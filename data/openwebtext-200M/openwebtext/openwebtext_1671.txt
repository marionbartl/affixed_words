With the Obama Administration pushing for additional UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea , to punish them for their defiance , officials are expressing concern that the government is actually “ too defiant ” for the sanctions to even work .
“ As long as the regime does n’t care about what the outside world thinks of it , as long as it does n’t care about the well - being of its people , there is not a lot you can do about it , ” warned Gates , “ unless you are willing at some point to use military force . ”
This is actually a long - standing knock on the concept of sanctions in general , as the US has been quick to sanction nations in the past but rarely have they accepted any reconciliation with such nations .
In Iraq , for instance , over a decade of harsh sanctions killed a large portion of the Iraqi population , culminating in the 2003 US invasion of the nation .
Even now , over seven years into the US occupation , many of the anti-Iraq sanctions are still in place , ostensibly to pressure them into abandoning a nuclear program that they do n’t have .
According to Gates the sanctions are important primarily because “ to do nothing would set the wrong precedent . ”
Yet having acknowledged that the sanctions will harm North Korea ’s civilians while doing nothing to change its government ’s policy , can it really be justified purely as a face - saving measure for the Obama Administration ?
In a system , gone completely loony , pension plans in seven state will be busted by 2020 yet the states keep hiring public workers .
Please consider Pension Plans Go Broke as Public Payrolls Expand .
Seven states will run out of money to pay public pensions by 2020 .
That has n’t stopped them from hiring new employees .
The seven are Illinois , Connecticut , Indiana , New Jersey , Hawaii , Louisiana and Oklahoma , according to Joshua D. Rauh of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University .
Combined , they added 9,700 workers to both state and local government payrolls between December 2007 and April of this year , says the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Generous and bloated are the terms that have been used to describe them ; critics have set up websites to pillory those government retirees who enjoy $ 100,000 - plus annual pensions and other goodies , such as health - care benefits for themselves and their families for life .
“ Are State Public Pensions Sustainable ?
Why the Federal Government Should Worry About State Pension Liabilities ” is the title of Rauh ’s recent study .
It ’s a provocative piece of work , especially for one of its tables , titled , “ When Might State Pension Funds Run Dry ? ”
Pension Security Bonds : A New Plan to Address the Pension Crisis
As I have blogged previously , states are making financial promises that they cannot possibly keep , and the bills are coming due much sooner than you think .
Unless action is taken soon , the federal government will face intense pressure to bail out the affected states , at a price tag of $ 1 trillion or more .
The outline of the plan is that the federal government should cut a deal with states .
They should allow a state to issue tax - subsidized bonds for the purpose of pension funding for the next 15 years — if and only if the state government agrees to take three specific measures to stop the growth of unfunded liabilities :
1 . The state must close its defined benefit plans to new employees under a “ soft freeze ” and agree not to start any new defined benefit plans for at least 30 years .
2 . The state must annually make exactly its actuarially required contribution ( ARC ) left over from the existing underfunded plans ; only the amount of that ARC will be subsidized .
3 . The state must include its new workers Social Security , and provide them with an adequate defined contribution plan , again for at least 30 years .
To this end , the federal government should start a Thrift Savings Program for state workers and operate it alongside the existing Thrift Savings Program for federal workers .
The tax subsidies for these new Pension Security Bonds would work like Build America Bonds , with the federal government paying 35 % of all coupon payments directly to the state .
The cost of this subsidy will be in large part offset by the gains to the Social Security system of bringing in new state workers .
Pension Security Bonds
Mish ,
The employer / employee contributions for the defined contribution plan must be in line with private sector compensation practices .
On the bonds ... if we do nothing , we 'll be in a situation 8 years from now where states are begging the federal government for a multi-trillion dollar bailout .
I 'd like a clear " just say no " message , but I fear that message is n't credible .
When it comes to down to it , politicians will inevitably cave in and waste loads of money on the bailout ... they do it every time .
My plan gives states the incentives to clean up their act now .
Pensions are THE thing that is bankrupting states .
The choice is a $ 75 billion federal incentive today ( unfortunate ) or a multi-trillion dollar federal bailout 8 years from now ( catastrophic ) .
I 'm going with the incentive .

Fifty years ago one of the most extraordinary libel trials of all time took place in Britain .
The flamboyant American entertainer Liberace had sued the Daily Mirror columnist William Connor ( who wrote under the byline Cassandra ) for implying that he was homosexual .
Connor wrote that Liberace was " ... the summit of sex - the pinnacle of masculine , feminine , and neuter .
Everything that he , she , and it can ever want ... a deadly , winking , sniggering , snuggling , chromium - plated , scent - impregnated , luminous , quivering , giggling , fruit - flavoured , mincing , ice - covered heap of mother love . "
( Two important contextual facts : male homosexuality was then illegal ; the word " gay " had not become an antonym for homosexual ) .
After a six - day hearing , during which Liberace denied being homosexual or ever having taken part in homosexual acts , the jury found for him .
He was awarded a then - record £ 8,000 in damages ( about £ 500,000 in today 's money ) .
As Liz Hodgkinson pointed out in yesterday 's Media Guardian , the decision centred largely on whether Connor knowingly used the term " fruit " , which was American slang for a " homosexualist " ( to use the description favoured throughout the case ) .
The whole trial has been resurrected by the former Daily Mirror journalist , Revel Barker , who now runs the gentlemenranters.com website , in a new book , Crying all the way to the bank ( to be published 8 June , by Revel Barker Publishing ) .
He and Vera Baird QC have done a fine job in selecting key passages of evidence , and it is eye - opening stuff in many respects .
The most obvious factor is the Mirror 's arrogance , as shown during the cross-examinations of Connor and the Mirror 's editorial chief , Hugh Cudlipp .
Baird observes that the Mirror " did n't seem to have a plan for the trial . "
Cudlipp and Connor were going up against a man who was phenomenally popular with the public at the time .
Their chances of victory were slim to start with and grew thinner with each passing day .
The case should have been settled , in Liberace 's favour , well before it ever reached court .
But Cudlipp was convinced , not least by the Mirror 's rising popularity , that he could win a case largely based on hypocrisy ( that Connor did not mean what it is obvious he did mean ) .
Liberace was also hypocritical because he was gay , though he always denied it .
He died , aged 67 in 1987 , of an Aids - related illness .
Barker 's book has fascinating moments for journalists , not least the lengthy questioning of Cudlipp by Liberace 's counsel , Gilbert Beyfus QC , in which he attempts to trap the Mirror supremo into admitting that his sensational , risk - taking paper was reckless .
The questions , including those from the judge , Mr Justice Salmon , reek with middle class distaste for popular journalism .
There is more than an echo of the attitude displayed in a previous libel case involving the Daily Mirror , in 1947 .
This action was foolishly brought by a Mirror photographer ( at the suggestion of his employers ) against an obscure legal magazine .
It rebounded badly on the paper , which lost the action .
The details can be found in Privacy and the press by H. Montgomery Hyde .
What both cases illustrate is that as long ago as the 1940s and 50s , newspapers were losing out in libel actions , partly due to prejudice from the judiciary and definitely due to hostility from the public .

America Detached from War
Bush ’s Pilotless Dream , Smoking Drones , and Other Strange Tales from the Crypt
By Tom Engelhardt
Admittedly , before George W. Bush had his fever dream , the U.S. had already put its first unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) or drone surveillance planes in the skies over Kosovo in the late 1990s .
By November 2001 , it had armed them with missiles and was flying them over Afghanistan .
In November 2002 , a Predator drone would loose a Hellfire missile on a car in Yemen , a country with which we were n’t at war .
Six suspected al - Qaeda members , including a suspect in the bombing of the destroyer the USS Cole would be turned into twisted metal and ash -- the first “ targeted killings ” of the American robotic era .
Just two months earlier , in September 2002 , as the Bush administration was “ introducing ” its campaign to sell an invasion of Iraq to Congress and the American people , CIA Director George Tenet and Vice President Dick Cheney “ trooped up to Capitol Hill ” to brief four top Senate and House leaders on a hair - raising threat to the country .
A “ smoking gun ” had been uncovered .
According to “ new intelligence , ” Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had in his possession unmanned aerial vehicles advanced enough to be armed with biological and chemical weaponry .
Worse yet , these were capable -- so the CIA director and vice president claimed -- of spraying those weapons of mass destruction over cities on the east coast of the United States .
It was just the sort of evil plan you might have expected from a man regularly compared to Adolf Hitler in our media , and the news evidently made an impression in Congress .
Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida , for example , said that he voted for the administration 's resolution authorizing force in Iraq because " I was told not only that [ Saddam had weapons of mass destruction ] and that he had the means to deliver them through unmanned aerial vehicles , but that he had the capability of transporting those UAVs outside of Iraq and threatening the homeland here in America , specifically by putting them on ships off the eastern seaboard . "
In a speech in October 2002 , President Bush then offered a version of this apocalyptic nightmare to the American public .
Of course , like Saddam ’s supposed ability to produce “ mushroom clouds ” over American cities , the Iraqi autocrat ’s advanced UAVs ( along with the ships needed to position them off the U.S. coast ) were a feverish fantasy of the Bush era and would soon enough be forgotten .
Instead , in the years to come , it would be American pilotless drones that would repeatedly attack Iraqi urban areas with Hellfire missiles and bombs .
In those years , our drones would also strike repeatedly in Afghanistan , and especially in the tribal borderlands of Pakistan , where in an escalating “ secret ” or “ covert ” war , which has been no secret to anyone , multiple drone attacks often occur weekly .
They are now considered so much the norm that , with humdrum headlines slapped on ( “ U.S. missile strike kills 12 in NW Pakistan ” ) , they barely make it out of summary articles about war developments in the American press .
And yet those robotic planes , with their young “ pilots ” ( as well as the camera operators and intelligence analysts who make up a drone “ crew ” ) sitting in front of consoles 7,000 miles away from where their missiles and bombs are landing , have become another kind of American fever dream .
The drone is our latest wonder weapon and a bragging point in a set of wars where there has been little enough to brag about .
CIA director Leon Panetta has , for instance , called the Agency ’s drones flying over Pakistan “ the only game in town ” when it comes to destroying al - Qaeda ; a typically anonymous U.S. official in a Washington Post report claims of drone missile attacks , “ We ’re talking about precision unsurpassed in the history of warfare ” ; or as Gordon Johnson of the Pentagon 's Joint Forces Command told author Peter Singer , speaking of the glories of drones : “ They do n't get hungry .
They are not afraid .
They do n't forget their orders .
They do n't care if the guy next to them has been shot .
Will they do a better job than humans ?
Yes . ”
Seven thousand of them , the vast majority surveillance varieties , are reportedly already being operated by the military , and that ’s before swarms of “ mini - drones ” come on line .
Our American world is being redefined accordingly .
In February , Greg Jaffe of the Washington Post caught something of this process when he spent time with Colonel Eric Mathewson , perhaps the most experienced Air Force officer in drone operations and on the verge of retirement .
Mathewson , reported Jaffe , was trying to come up with an appropriately new definition of battlefield “ valor ” -- a necessity for most combat award citations -- to fit our latest corps of pilots at their video consoles .
“ Valor to me is not risking your life , " the colonel told the reporter .
" Valor is doing what is right .
Valor is about your motivations and the ends that you seek .
It is doing what is right for the right reasons .
That to me is valor . "
Smoking Drones
These days , CIA and administration officials troop up to Capitol Hill to offer briefings to Congress on the miraculous value of pilotless drones : in disrupting al - Qaeda , destroying its leadership or driving it “ deeper into hiding , ” and taking out key figures in the Taliban .
Indeed , what started as a 24/7 assassination campaign against al - Qaeda ’s top leadership has already widened considerably .
The “ target set ” has by now reportedly expanded to take in ever lower - level militants in the tribal borderlands .
In other words , a drone assassination campaign is morphing into the first full - scale drone war ( and , as in all wars from the air , civilians are dying in unknown numbers ) .
If the temperature is again rising in Washington when it comes to these weapons , this time it ’s a fever of enthusiasm for the spectacular future of drones ( which the Air Force has plotted out to the year 2047 ) , of a time when single pilots should be able to handle multiple drones in operations in the skies over some embattled land , and of a far more distant moment when those drones should be able to handle themselves , flying , fighting , and making key decisions about just who to take out without a human being having to intervene .
When we possess such weaponry , it turns out , there ’s nothing unnerving or disturbing , apocalyptic or dystopian about it .
Today , in the American homeland , not a single smoking drone is in sight .
Now it 's the United States whose UAVs are ever more powerfully weaponized .
It 's the U.S. which is developing a 22 - ton tail - less drone 20 times larger than a Predator that can fly at Mach 7 and ( theoretically ) land on the pitching deck of an aircraft carrier .
It 's the Pentagon which is planning to increase the funding of drone development by 700 % over the next decade .
Admittedly , there is a modest counter - narrative to all this enthusiasm for our robotic prowess , “ precision , ” and “ valor . ”
It involves legal types like Philip Alston , the United Nations special representative on extrajudicial executions .
He recently issued a 29 - page report criticizing Washington ’s “ ever - expanding entitlement for itself to target individuals across the globe . ”
Unless limits are put on such claims , and especially on the CIA ’s drone war over Pakistan , he suggests , soon enough a plethora of states will follow in America ’s footprints , attacking people in other lands “ labeled as terrorists by one group or another . ”
Such mechanized , long - distance warfare , he also suggests , will breach what respect remains for the laws of war .
“ Because operators are based thousands of miles away from the battlefield , ” he wrote , “ and undertake operations entirely through computer screens and remote audio - feed , there is a risk of developing a ' PlayStation ' mentality to killing . ”
Similarly , the ACLU has filed a freedom of information lawsuit against the U.S. government , demanding that it “ disclose the legal basis for its use of unmanned drones to conduct targeted killings overseas , as well as the ground rules regarding when , where , and against whom drone strikes can be authorized , and the number of civilian casualties they have caused . ”
But pay no mind to all this .
The arguments may be legally compelling , but not in Washington , which has mounted a half - hearted claim of legitimate “ self - defense , ” but senses that it ’s already well past the point where legalities matter .
The die is cast , the money committed .
The momentum for drone war and yet more drone war is overwhelming .
It ’s a done deal .
Drone war is , and will be , us .
A Pilotless Military
If there are zeitgeist moments for products , movie stars , and even politicians , then such moments can exist for weaponry as well .
The robotic drone is the Lady Gaga of this Pentagon moment .
It ’s a moment that could , of course , be presented as an apocalyptic nightmare in the style of the Terminator movies ( with the U.S. as the soul - crushing Skynet ) , or as a remarkable tale of how “ networking technology is expanding a homefront that is increasingly relevant to day - to - day warfare ” ( as Christopher Drew recently put it in the New York Times ) .
It could be described as the arrival of a dystopian fantasy world of one - way slaughter verging on entertainment , or as the coming of a generation of homegrown video warriors who work “ in camouflage uniforms , complete with combat boots , on open floors , with four computer monitors on each desk ... and coffee and Red Bull help[ ing ] them get through the 12 - hour shifts . ”
It could be presented as the ultimate in cowardice -- the killing of people in a world you know nothing about from thousands of miles away -- or ( as Col .
Mathewson would prefer ) a new form of valor .
The drones -- their use expanding exponentially , with ever newer generations on the drawing boards , and the planes even heading for “ the homeland ” -- could certainly be considered a demon spawn of modern warfare , or ( as is generally the case in the U.S. ) a remarkable example of American technological ingenuity , a problem - solver of the first order at a time when few American problems seem capable of solution .
Thanks to our technological prowess , it ’s claimed that we can now kill them , wherever they may be lurking , at absolutely no cost to ourselves , other than the odd malfunctioning drone .
Not that even all CIA operatives involved in the drone wars agree with that one .
Some of them understand perfectly well that there ’s a price to be paid .
As it happens , the enthusiasm for drones is as much a fever dream as the one President Bush and his associates offered back in 2002 , but it ’s also distinctly us .
In fact , drone warfare fits the America of 2010 tighter than a glove .
With its consoles , chat rooms , and “ single shooter ” death machines , it certainly fits the skills of a generation raised on the computer , Facebook , and video games .
That our valorous warriors , their day of battle done , can increasingly leave war behind and head home to the barbecue ( or , given American life , the foreclosure ) also fits an American mood of the moment .
The Air Force “ detachments ” that “ manage ” the drone war from places like Creech Air Force Base in Nevada are “ detached ” from war in a way that even an artillery unit significantly behind the battle lines or an American pilot in an F - 16 over Afghanistan ( who could , at least , experience engine failure ) is n’t .
If the drone presents the most extreme version thus far of the detachment of human beings from the battlefield ( on only one side , of course ) and so launches a basic redefinition of what war is all about , it also catches something important about the American way of war .
After all , while this country garrisons the world , invests its wealth in its military , and fights unending , unwinnable frontier wars and skirmishes , most Americans are remarkably detached from all this .
If anything , since Vietnam when an increasingly rebellious citizens ’ army proved disastrous for Washington ’s global aims , such detachment has been the goal of American war - making .
As a start , with no draft and so no citizen ’s army , war and the toll it takes is now the professional business of a tiny percentage of Americans ( and their families ) .
It occurs thousands of miles away and , in the Bush years , also became a heavily privatized , for - profit activity .
As Pratap Chatterjee reported recently , “ [ E ] very US soldier deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq is matched by at least one civilian working for a private company .
All told , about 239,451 contractors work for the Pentagon in battle zones around the world . ”
And a majority of those contractors are n’t even U.S. citizens .
If drones have entered our world as media celebrities , they have done so largely without debate among that detached populace .
In a sense , our wars abroad could be thought of as the equivalent of so many drones .
We send our troops off and then go home for dinner and put them out of mind .
The question is :
Have we redefined our detachment as a new version of citizenly valor ( and covered it over by a constant drumbeat of “ support for our troops ” ) ?
Under these circumstances , it ’s hardly surprising that a “ pilotless ” force should , in turn , develop the sort of contempt for civilians that can be seen in the recent flap over the derogatory comments of Afghan war commander General Stanley McChrystal and his aides about Obama administration officials .
The Globalization of Death
Maybe what we need is the return of George W. Bush ’s fever dream from the American oblivion in which it ’s now interred .
He was beyond wrong , of course , when it came to Saddam Hussein and Iraqi drones , but he was n’t completely wrong about the dystopian Drone World to come .
There are now reportedly more than 40 countries developing versions of those pilot - less planes .
Earlier this year , the Iranians announced that they were starting up production lines for both armed and unarmed drones .
Hezbollah used them against Israel in the 2006 summer war , years after Israel began pioneering their use in targeted killings of Palestinians .
Right now , in what still remains largely a post - Cold War arms race of one , the U.S. is racing to produce ever more advanced drones to fight our wars , with few competitors in sight .
In the process , we ’re also obliterating classic ideas of national sovereignty , and of who can be killed by whom under what circumstances .
In the process , we may not just be obliterating enemies , but creating them wherever our drones buzz overhead and our missiles strike .
We are also creating the ( il ) legal framework for future war on a frontier where we wo n’t long be flying solo .
And when the first Iranian , or Russian , or Chinese missile - armed drones start knocking off their chosen sets of " terrorists , " we wo n’t like it one bit .
When the first “ suicide drones ” appear , we ’ll like it even less .
And if drones with the ability to spray chemical or biological weapons finally do make the scene , we ’ll be truly unnerved .
In the 1990s , we were said to be in an era of “ globalization ” which was widely hailed as good news .
Now , the U.S. and its detached populace are pioneering a new era of killing that respects no boundaries , relies on the self - definitions of whoever owns the nearest drone , and establishes planetary free - fire zones .
It ’s a nasty combination , this globalization of death .

Say hello to Professor Araragi , the authority on Pokémon in the Isshu region .
Translated to English , we believe her name could / should be “ Yew . ”
Quite the change from Oak , Elm , and all the rest , is n’t she ?
According to another round of info from CoroCoro magazine , Pokémon Black & White allow you to upload your save file to the Internet .
Mysterious .
Could it be to prevent using hacked monsters in online ranked battles ?
After all , this piece of information is mentioned in the same section as a new wireless feature called “ Random Match , ” which is exactly what it sounds like .
CoroCoro also mentions an ingame device named the “ C Gear , ” which comes with various “ connection abilities , ” but just what these are is n’t detailed .
We knew it had to happen eventually -- iPhone OS has been renamed to iOS with the bump to version 4 .
Some 1500 new features are coming along with the name change , including biggies like multitasking , a unified inbox , app folders , and data detectors .
Although Apple is encouraging devs to tweak their apps for the iPhone 4's new Retina Display , iOS4 will also automatically redraw text and controls for existing apps to make them play nice with the new higher pixel density .
Bing search integration has also been added to iOS 4 in addition to Google and Yahoo -- Google is still the default , though .
The golden master is available to devs today , and Steve says the 100 millionth iOS device -- that 's iPhone , iPod touch , and iPad -- will be sold sometime this month .
That 's a lot of devices !
We found out about most of the features of iOS 4 at the SDK event , so check here for the full rundown .
Apple says iOS 4 will arrive for the iPhone 3G , 3GS , and the iPod touch on June 21 -- and it'll be free to iPod touch owners for the first time , which is nice .
Not all features will be supported across all devices : the first - gen touch is left out entirely , and the 3G wo n't do multitasking , as we heard at the SDK event .
We 'll see if there are any other limitations and let you know .
Amusingly , an iOS trademark is currently owned by Cisco -- just like the original iPhone trademark -- so we 'll see if Apple 's lawyers actually called ahead this time around or if they 'll have to fake - tussle and make nice again

A little over a month ago the photography blogosphere was a buzz with the news that the final episode of the TV medical drama House was being shot completely on a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera in its movie mode .
The episode has now aired in the US ( trailer below ) and the director of the episode Greg Yaitanes has answered a lot of questions about it via Twitter .
I also stumbled across a great audio interview with Greg today on Philip Bloom ’s site .
It ’s an hour long ( so grab a cup of your favorite beverage before hitting play ) but it ’s an interesting listen .
The reason for using the 5D Mk II ?
The amazing Depth of Field available with the lenses as well as the ability to shoot in very small spaces .
You can hear the full interview here .
The shooting was done with the 5D Mk II and a combination of lenses ( shot largely wide open ) including :
Here ’s the trailer to the episode :
It may be a festival of film , but it was two former television stars who grabbed the limelight at Cannes yesterday .
Twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff , the popular hosts of ' 80s French sci- fi series Temps X , were barely recognisable on the Chopard red carpet , thanks to the incredible amount of cosmetic surgery both appear to have undergone .
Now aged in their 60s , the shock appearance has prompted the British press to liken the pair to cosmetic surgery devotee Jocelyn Wildenstein .
It has been a star - studded 24 hours on the French Riviera , with the arrival of Hollywood A - listers Johnny Depp , Michelle Williams and Juliette Binoche at the glamorous world film festival .

The Prime Minister 's Office announced on Thursday that the security cabinet had agreed to relax Israel 's blockade on the Gaza Strip , but as it turns out , no binding decision was ever made during the cabinet meeting .

The Prime Minister 's Office issued a press release in English following the meeting , which was also sent to foreign diplomats , was substantially different than the Hebrew announcement – according to the English text , a decision was made to ease the blockade , but in the Hebrew text there was no mention of any such decision .
It is not clear whether this discrepancy was a deliberate attempt to buy time in the face of international pressure , or a clerical omission on behalf of the Prime Minister 's Office .
The cabinet ministers held a long discussion on Wednesday and another one Thursday morning on the topic of altering Israel 's policy following the three - year siege on the Hamas ruled territory .
The siege was imposed after Hamas violently seized control over the Gaza Strip in 2007 .
The aim of the discussions was to approve a plan drafted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the envoy of the Quartet of Middle East peace negotiators Tony Blair .
The discussions spanned a total of six hours , but no decision was ever made .
During both meetings , many ministers voiced their opinions regarding the blockade , and the defense establishment presented the plans for the " liberalization " of the blockade .
However , upon concluding the discussions , the ministers did not vote on any binding practical draft of the decision .
In fact , the policy by which the government is currently bound is the one decided by the security cabinet during the previous term of former prime minister Ehud Olmert , by which the blockade remains as it was .
Two official statements came out of the Prime Minister 's Office in regard to the security cabinet meeting – one in Hebrew for the Israeli media and another in English for the foreign media and foreign diplomats .
The English version said that " It was agreed to liberalize the system by which civilian goods enter Gaza [ and ] expand the inflow of materials for civilian projects that are under international supervision . "
The Hebrew version addressed mainly remarks made by Netanyahu , but failed to mention any decision or agreement .
The Hebrew version also failed to mention whether the prime minister 's position was formally approved .
" Israel will alter the system in order to allow more civilian goods into Gaza , " the Hebrew statement read .
In addition to the English statement , word was sent to foreign consulates and embassies indicating that the decision made by the security cabinet will be implemented immediately .
However , according to the officials charged with the actual monitoring of the transfer of goods into Gaza , they have not been notified of any change in policy as a result of the cabinet meeting .
A senior defense official said Thursday that " there was every intention to increase the transfer of goods into Gaza even before the cabinet meeting .
We have notified the Palestinians , regardless of the cabinet meeting , that we will allow the entry of food items , house wares , writing implements , mattresses and toys .
Beyond that , we have not said a thing . "
Sources at the Prime Minister 's Office admitted that there was no decision , and no vote , during the security cabinet meeting .
One of the sources said that " it was a briefing by the prime minister , " and another source said it was a " declaration of intent . "
" A meeting will be held soon , and we hope that a binding decision will be taken then , " the prime minister 's office said , explaining that the reason for the delay is " the need for continued contact with allies within the international community in order to gain support for the liberalization plan . "
This despite the fact that most of the international community has already voiced support for the plan , following a campaign launched by Blair , who drafted the plan with Netanyahu .
Michael Robertson's Crowdsourced List Of 1,400 Examples Of EMI Giving Away Free Music ; EMI Denies All But 3
from the um ... dept
This list is just a fraction of the songs EMI makes available , but it 's irrefutable that EMI uses free song files as promotion .
Astonishingly they are still telling the court that they do n't authorize song files to be distributed for free .
They are denying these songs are legitimate in spite of overwhelming evidence of MP3 files from retailers , blogs , artist sites , label sites , and marketing sites .
Even when you point to one of their own corporate blogs which offers downloads they remain steadfast in their claim that they do n't distribute MP3s online for free .
Thanks to the MP3tunes user community , we have powerful evidence to refute EMI 's claims that they do n't distribute promotional songs .
I think it 's one of the first examples of crowdsourcing evidence .
The evidence was assembled not by parties to the litigation or their legal teams but citizens with a computer and motivation to help out .
We 'll learn later this year whether it will help MP3tunes prevail .

Want some free music from EMI ?
You may remember that EMI is in a legal battle with Michael Robertson and his current company MP3 Tunes ( well , one of his current companies ) .
MP3 Tunes is a music locker .
It only lets you upload your own songs , but also does have a search engine , Sideload.com , that will search for freely available music online .
As part of the lawsuit , EMI insisted that EMI has never authorized music to be posted for free online , so any and all music from EMI that is found by Sideload must be unauthorized .
Except ... of course .
that 's not true .
EMI hands out free mp3s to journalists all the time to post , and often has them on their own website .
When asked about it , EMI finally admitted to allowing a grand total ofsongs to be distributed freely online .
To prove that EMI was lying , last fall , Michael Robertson offered up a bookmarklet that people could use to let him know whenever they found free MP3s of EMI music on legitimate sites ( mainstream media , artist 's own websites , label marketing sites , etc. ) .
That " You Lie , EMI " bookmarklet seems to have worked wonders .
Robertson has now collected over 1,400 examples of EMI giving away free MP3s .
He 's even put the whole list in a nice Google spreadsheet , so you can check it out yourself ( and even see where EMI has put up free music ) .
I 'm not surprised to see our friend Lily Allen on the list .
As you may recall , last fall , right after Lily went on a bit of a rant about the evils of file sharing and distributing unauthorized music , we pointed out that on her official LilyAllenMusic website , she and EMI ( who runs the website ) were distributing mixtapes full of songs from EMI artists ... and artists from other record labels as well ( though , we doubt EMI got the rights to do that ) .
Either way , nice job crowdsourcing the proof that EMI does , in fact , lie : But were n't we just told by the head of PPL in the UK ( home of EMI ) that " there is no such thing " as " promotion " when it comes to music , and " for free " should be erased from our vocabulary .
Perhaps that explains EMI 's actions .
They no longer recognize the concept of free promotion as existing after listening to Fran Nevrkla 's speech .

Happy Saint - Jean - Baptiste Day !
I was drawing Papineaus earlier .
In celebration ?
Maybe that is why there is a comic about the other related rebellion here .
By : Ira Chernus , t r u t h o u t | Op - Ed
“ We stand by Israel , ” State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley declared , as he voiced the State Department ’s support for Israel ’s internal investigation of the attack on the flotilla bound for Gaza .
Israel “ has the institutions and certainly the capability to conduct a credible , impartial and transparent investigation , ” Crowley said .
Over at the White House they stand by Israel , too .
Though the White House press release forgot to use that exact phrase , the rest of the words of praise from the highest level of the US government were much the same as the State Department ’s : Israel “ is capable of conducting a serious and credible investigation and the structure and terms of reference of Israel ’s proposed independent public commission can meet the standard of a prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation . ”
At the highest level of Israel ’s government , though , things look a bit different .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to persuade his cabinet to approve the commission he appointed to investigate the killings at sea .
On the Israeli right , any kind of investigation looks like capitulation to hostile world opinion .
To blunt charges of weakness , Netanyahu started off the cabinet meeting insisting that the whole purpose of the investigation is to prove that the Israel Navy operation and the ensuing investigations were appropriate and met international standards :
“ The government decision will make it clear to the world that Israel is acting legally , responsibly and with complete transparency . ”
“ Two principles guided us , ” Netanyahu said .
His first principle was “ maintaining the freedom of IDF [ Israel Defense Forces ] soldiers to act and the credibility of the IDF investigation . ”
To that end , Netanyahu told the cabinetthat the committee he is appointing will not be able to talk with IDF soldiers , as any international investigating body no doubt would .
The Israeli panel will have to rely on summaries of the IDF ’s own investigations and an interview with IDF Chief of Staff ( and one of Israel ’s most powerful political figures ) Lt. Gen. Gaby Ashkenazi .
Israel ’s civilian politicians are typically afraid of the political power of the military .
So , their first rule is never to limit or impinge on the freedom of the IDF .
That means letting the IDF investigate itself and then rubber - stamping the results .
The second principle , Netanyahu told his cabinet , is “ giving a credible and convincing response to the responsible states in the international community . ”
Before meeting with his cabinet , Netanyahu addressed a gathering of his Likud Party and decoded those words .
He assured his followers bluntly that he was appointing the committee only to appease the international community .
The editors of Israel ’s most respected newspaper , Ha’aretz , got it right :
The panel is “ aimed at appeasing the world , in particular the United States .
Its authority is too limited to conduct a real investigation and its makeup raises the suspicion that it is designed more as a public - relations tool than to properly examine the events and reveal the responsible parties . ”
It offers only “ the deceptive appearance of a real investigation . ”
Another Ha’aretz editorial , denouncing the charade as “ a farce ” and “ a whitewash , ” pointed outthat the panel will have no real powers , not even those of a government probe , and that the head of the panel , retired Israeli Supreme Court Justice Yaakov Tirkel , “ does not believe in such a panel . ”
In an interview , he “ made clear that he is not a devotee of drawing conclusions about individuals and dismissing those responsible for failures . ”
Tirkel also opposed having foreigners on the panel .
But to give the appearance of transparency , there will be two .
One of them , David Trimble , a Northern Irish Nobel Peace Prize laureate , is a co-founder of a new initiativecalled “ Friends of Israel ” – along with neocon John Bolton and an eminent Likudnik , Dore Gold .
For all these reasons , as Ha’aretz concluded , the panel is bound to fail both at finding the truth and at appeasing the international community .
It will be obvious to anyone watching closely that the investigation is intended to substitute appearance for truth , that the results of the investigation have already been determined in advance .
When truth disappears , all that ’s left is lies .
So , if the US stands with Israel on this matter , as the State Department says , it stands with an Israeli government that seems ready to lie .
There ’s a similar move brewing in Congress , this one aimed at discrediting the flotilla movement by keeping all its participants out of the US because they are “ terrorists . ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are circulating a bipartisan letter calling on Obama to put the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief ( IHH ) on the US “ terrorist ” list .
At a press conference pushing this effort , Rep. Eliot Engel justified Israel ’s blockade of Gaza and its attacks on ships trying to break the blockade , using the familiar mantra : “ The United States must stand with Israel as it seeks to carry out legitimate acts of self - defense . ”
“ Legitimate acts of self - defense ” will surely be the conclusion of the Israeli probe , too .
But defense against what ?
What is it , exactly , that the US is standing with ?
Netanyahu has an answer , one that wraps all the particular distortions of truth inside one big overarching lie .
To his cabinet , he saidthat the flotilla “ was not a one - time thing .
We find ourselves in the midst of a difficult and continuous battle against the State of Israel .
The flood of hate is being led by Israel ’s enemies all over the world .
They are trying to pinch us with the metal pinchers of missiles and terror and revoke Israel ’s right to defend itself . ”
In his talk to Likud , Netanyahu put it in a broader and more dramatic historical frame .
“ There is a difficult and continuing struggle against Israel being led by the country ’s enemies … .
Dark forces from the Middle Ages are raging against us , ” he warned ominously .
Netanyahu is usually content to equate all critics of Israel with Nazis and charge that another Holocaust is in the making .
Now , though , he conjures up a much larger history of oppression going back to the Middle Ages , identifying Israel ’s critics not merely with Hitler , but with ten centuries or more of anti-Semitic persecution , violence and rage .
It might be tempting to dismiss such florid rhetoric as mere window dressing .
But it would be a mistake .
Because when a lie is repeated often enough , it becomes the big lie .
And when so many people believe the big lie , it takes on a life of its own .
Ignoring it means letting it go on doing its destructive work .
The popular picture of Israel as a defenseless ghetto , packed with innocent , vulnerable Jews surrounding by raging anti-Semites , is the big lie that lets all the little falsehoods about Israeli policy flourish .
Apparently , it ’s increasingly popular in Israel .
Reporting on a poll that shows Netanyahu ’s popularity growing ( though still at only 52 percent approval ) , Ha’aretz commented : “ The [ Israeli ] public apparently buys Netanyahu ’s narrative , which seems to suggest that the world is hypocritical , that we are the only just people and that whoever is not with him – with Netanyahu – is against Israel . ”
Israeli columnist Doron Rosenblum agrees that Netanyahu gets political mileage out of this narrative of victimization : “ The National PR man has once again succeeded in explaining to the domestic consumer , who is wallowing in his fears and hatreds , that there really is a reason for the sense of siege , isolation and persecution :
The world is hypocritical , the wave is getting stronger , the vise is closing in . ”
And Rosenblum points out the tragic irony : the more Israelis base their policies on their fear of being ostracized by the world , the more they take actions that insure they ’ll be ostracized .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have polls that ask the public here in the US about that narrative .
If we did , I ’d bet the farm that it would be accepted by a sizable majority , in one form or another .
There are many versions , some more subtle than others .
But they all reflect the basic image of the Jews as victims of an unbroken chain of oppression and victimization , leading right up to the present - day woes of “ poor little Israel . ”
There would be many Americans who would know the facts that disprove this narrative : Israel ’s immense military power , which it does not hesitate to use , and Israel ’s obvious position as dominator , not dominated .
Some would know that the history of the Jews is hardly one of unrelieved persecution .
Jews have often lived amicably with Christians and Muslims in many places around the world .
Certainly , today , most Jews in the US and many other lands live freely , with virtually full acceptance and no discrimination .
Yet , even those who consciously know these facts are unconsciously affected by the story of endless suffering , which Netanyahu and so many other Israeli leaders have relied on to justify Israel ’s violence .
That ’s how the big lie works , spreading its tentacles beneath the surface of consciousness as well as above it .
And I suspect that it reaches up to the highest levels of power , in Washington as well as Jerusalem .
There ’s no hard proof ; the evidence is anecdotal .
But when you grow up in a culture suffused with the big lie , it is very difficult to escape .
With a public so primed to see Jews as defenseless victims , policymakers who are on the fence find it politically safer to “ stand with Israel . ”
And if they still are n’t sure which way to go , the emotional tug of the Israeli narrative , no matter how slight , can be enough to tilt them to the Israelis ’ side .
That ’s not to say Washington always takes the Israelis ’ side .
In the wake of international outrage over the flotilla attack , President Obama called on the Israelis to ease the Gaza blockade .
Though they ’d previously refused , the Israelis are now taking steps , albeit slowly and ambiguously , to comply .
As one Israeli analystput it : “ The right flank of Netanyahu ’s cabinet is far from thrilled with these steps , and the same goes for senior defense establishment officials , But when the Obama administration insists , the Netanyahu government gives in .
This was the price Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak paid for Obama ’s stamp of approval on an internal investigation that would save those leaders ’ political skin , according to Israeli journalist Amos Harel : “ Netanyahu and Barak fought like lions over the status and powers of the committee that has been appointed to examine the naval raid .
The narrow mandate accorded the committee , with U.S. agreement , ensures that no harm will befall the two leaders . ”
It also insures that little or no harm will befall the big lie with which all Israeli governments have justified their violence against Palestinians and the ensuing cover-ups .
And it encourages the Israelis to count on the big lie to justify future violence against the many flotillas yet to come .
The same big lie is part of the reason the U.S. government so often stands , and lies , with Israel – even when that policy obviously runs counter to U.S. interests and alienates the U.S. from the international community , as in the current case of the flotilla investigation .
How big a part the lie plays is anyone ’s guess .
There ’s no way to prove it .
But it would be dangerous to underestimate it .

Quote of the Week
Vuvuzela : play like a pro guardian.co.uk
The BBC was investigating the possibility of transmitting an alternative " vuvuzela free " version of its World Cup coverage tonight , as the fierce debate over the buzz of the horn looked set to be heading for football grounds all over Britain .
As players , fans and coaches weighed in on whether the loud drone of the plastic horns was an annoying irritant or joyful expression of African culture , South African organisers hit back and encouraged visiting fans to export them back to their own countries .
At the same time , fans in Britain have been snapping up the horns at the rate of one every two seconds and suppliers claimed the UK had been gripped by " vuvuzela fever " .
" Vuvuzelas are here to stay and will never be banned , " said Rich Mkhondo , a spokesman for the local World Cup organising committee .
" People love the vuvuzelas around the world .
Only a minority are against vuvuzelas . "
The Premier League and the Football League said there was nothing in their rules to stop supporters bringing them to English grounds but the decision would rest with individual clubs .
" There is a good chance they will end up in our grounds because people will bring them back from the World Cup , " said a Football League spokesman .
" It is a matter for individual clubs , as is the case with drums and other musical instruments . "
The drone of the vuvuzela has sparked an international debate since the tournament 's launch on Friday , with broadcasters inundated with complaints and arguments raging on radio phone-ins .
The BBC has received 220 complaints and , while it is committed to reflecting the atmosphere in the stadiums on its main coverage , it is believed to be looking into providing a so - called " clean " feed that would strip out the majority of crowd noise , via the red button .
South African organisers insisted today they were an important part of the atmosphere and would not be banned , despite the World Cup organising committee chief executive , Danny Jordaan , saying at the weekend that he personally preferred the sound of singing .
Critics have argued that the constant drone masks the ebb and flow of the game and drowns out the noise of the crowd .
The Danish goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen said after today 's match with Holland that the constant noise meant he had to be no more than 10 yards away from his teammates and have eye contact to pass any messages .
Following his opening game , Argentina 's Lionel Messi said : " It is impossible to communicate , it 's like being deaf . "
But the South African goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune , mindful of the value of home advantage , said after his team 's opening match that there were n't enough vuvuzelas in the stadium and called on supporters to make more noise .
Even in South Africa , opinion is divided .
Some put the wave of international criticism down to the effect of vuvuzelas being blown by enthusiastic visitors rather than the more expert exponents at South African Premier League matches .
But the organising committee called on overseas fans , who have been snapping up the horns , to export them .
" The vuvuzela is now an international instrument , " said a spokesman .
" People will buy them and stuff them in their suitcases and take them home . "
England fans in the UK appear to be heeding his call ; Sainsbury 's sold 22,000 red vuvuzelas – or " Vu Vu horns " as it brands them – in 12 hours before England 's game – one every two seconds .
The supermarket chain has ordered 25,000 extra horns but thinks it may run out before Friday 's game against Algeria .
There were none left at Sainsbury 's in Emmersons Green , near Bristol .
A few miles away in Chippenham , Wiltshire , half a dozen remained on the shelves .
Mike Brown was buying two for his children .
" I could be making a terrible mistake but I think I 'm going to have to make a rule that they can only blow them during the actual games .
But the kids wanted them and I can't resist it when they get excited about something like the World Cup . "
Amazon said sales had increased by 1,000 % .
David Broughton , from Northamptonshire - based company thevuvuzelaman.co.uk , said the country was gripped with " vuvuzela fever " .
" We sold 1,000 online over the weekend .
Someone in Dubai has asked for 10,000 .
If anyone knows of half a million vuvuzelas lying around , they could get very rich , " he said .
World Cup organisers tried to draw a line under the issue of whether the instruments were good for the tournament .
" This is a world event hosted by South Africa .
As our guests , please embrace our culture and the way we celebrate , " said the spokesman .
" You either love them or you hate them .
We in South Africa love them . "

( CNN ) -- Microsoft and Cirque du Soleil jumped the gun on Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) events with a special pre-show gala Sunday night celebrating motion - control system Project Natal 's official renaming as " Kinect . "
The lavish soiree was designed to showcase Microsoft 's new hardware , a 3 - D , movement - tracking interface that eliminates gamepads entirely by substituting physical gestures for joystick presses .
But it was hard to tell just what was being demonstrated at the bash , apart from the Redmond giant 's fierce determination to push this hardware to the forefront of successful gaming technology .
The smoke , mirrors and half - naked people slathered in face paint did n't quite mask what seemed to be a limited , and undercooked , selection of initial supporting titles and concepts .
Video gaming ' history ' to be made this week at E3
Attendees were invited to don colored , light - changing ponchos which gave the proceedings an almost cult - like feel .
After stepping through a TV - shaped cutout , guests were treated to a performance complete with dancing aboriginals , little boys dismounting massive plastic elephants to ascend elevating , Xbox - logo - shaped platforms and female performers walking on ceilings .
The spectacle , which employed multiple oversized projection screens , rotating stages built to resemble modern living rooms and a Cheshire - grinning family of four to demonstrate various interactive challenges from river rafting to running hurdles , was one of the most surreal I 've ever seen at E3 .
But apart from the brief cheers which greeted a " Star Wars " game 's demonstration of how players could swing their arms to wield a lightsaber , it was n't particularly convincing from a serious gamer 's perspective .
The demo featured a variety of gaming activities , from hurling javelins to soccer , bowling and volleyball , plus simple dance tutorials and yoga challenges .
Also showcased was a racing simulation wherein players could drive a car by turning an imaginary steering wheel .
But none of these applications , from sports - themed mini -games to high - speed arcade outings , seem to promise much more than what you 'd find on your Wii console today .
Ironically , it was Kinetic 's non-gaming applications -- the ability to browse menus with the flick of a wrist , video chat with friends worldwide using a dedicated camera or play with virtual pets -- that served to best illustrate the hardware 's capabilities .
From playing jump rope with cartoon tigers to instantly calling up movies and television shows with a swipe of your hand , Kinetic clearly illustrates that there 's room for growth in casual applications .
But Microsoft has yet to show us a signature blockbuster title that speaks to the same audience as traditional , or so - called " hardcore " games -- let alone can compete with the likes of " Call of Duty : Black Ops " or " Rage . "
Nor do we have convincing proof that flailing around in front of their TVs will do anything but leave fans exhausted after the first 15 minutes .
Still , it 's too early to render a formal verdict on Kinect , as precise hardware details and its launch software lineup remain a mystery .
Check back later today , following Microsoft's 1 p.m. ET press conference , for a deeper look at whether or not Kinect has what it takes to move to the top of the pack .

In a second draft legal argument , he said : “ The language of resolution 1441 is not clear … In these circumstances , I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further Council decision … which would authorise the use of force . ”
Derek Zona over at The Copper & Blue ( SB Nation 's Oilers blog ) wrote a nice run-down of the Oiler 's recent draft success .
I highly recommend you read his post before continuing with this one , as I 'm going to use his methodology to pull up some numbers for the Thrashers .
It all started with an About.com post by Jamie Fitzpatrick looking at draft success rates for NHL players in the 90s .
Well , you might remember a certain somebody did his own analysis of the 90s recently , so I thought it'd be fun to jump on this bandwagon as well .
The question ?
" How many career NHL players did the Thrashers get in the drafts from 1999 - 2005 ? "
Remember , this is the period that is widely considered " dark times " for the Thrashers .
Our drafting has ( according to common wisdom and many stats posts by The Falconer ) gotten much , much better since then .
Still , how'd we do ?
And how did we stack up to the Oilers ?
The cut - off that Derek used for " career player " is 200 NHL games ( but just 100 games for goalies . )
The expected success rate of 1st round selections is in the low 60s , but since the Thrashers drafted in the top 5 for many years , we expect them to be much higher .
Year Round Num .
Player GP 1999 1 1 Patrik Stefan 455 2000 1 2 Dany Heatley 589 2001 1 1 Ilya Kovalchuk 621 2002 1 2 Kari Lehtonen 216 2002 1 30 Jim Slater 335 2003 1 8 Braydon Coburm 297 2004 1 10 Boris Valabik 80 2005 1 16 Alex Bourret 0
As expected , the Thrashers had a bit more success than the Oilers .
Of our 8 picks , 6 are " career NHLers " based on Derek 's standards , though I expect Boris Valabik to hit that mark eventually .
( If he can stay healthy , it 'll only take two more seasons . "
Alex Bourret , on the other hand , was a total bust .
Now , keep in mind this says nothing about the quality of the player : we all consider Patrik Stefan to have been a terrible pick , but he meets the criteria we 're looking for .
6 - for - 8 ( 75 % ) means the Thrashers beat the average , in a couple years , that should be 7 - for - 8 , or 87.5 % .
The second round is where it starts to get a little rough .
You 'll notice that the Thrashers traded away a large number of their second round picks in certain years , going three consecutive years without a 2nd - round selection .
Year Round Num .
Player GP 1999 2 30 Luke Sellars 1 2000 2 31 Ilya Nikulin 0 2000 2 42 Libor Ustrnul 0 2004 2 40 Grant Lewis 1 2005 2 41 Ondrej Pavelec 61 2005 2 49 Chad Denny 0 2005 2 53 Andrew Kozek 0
This is where it starts to look ugly .
Not a single 2nd - round pick has panned out ?
0 - for - 7 ? 0 % ? Ouch .
Now , we obviously expect Ondrej Pavelec to hit 100 NHL games sometime soon , probably this next season , but it 's still pretty shocking .
Even 1 - for - 7 ( 14.3 % ) is under the NHL average for 2nd- rounders ( about 25 % ) .
We 'd actually need two of these guys to work out .
Oh wait .
There 's a name up there I recognize .
Ilya Nikulin ?
I know him from somewhere ... is n't he an All - Star in the KHL ?
Yes , sadly , we got burned by the Russian Factor with our pick of Nikulin .
And , if you count him and Pavelec , we 're looking more like 2 - for - 7 ( 28.6 % ) , just a tad above the NHL average .
So while our 2nd - round drafting certainly was n't great , it 's not quite as terrible as it looks at first glance .
Of course , after the 2nd round , things get a little ugly .
The NHL average is roughly 12 % ( if you look at the 90s ) and 8.7 % over the period we 're looking at ( purely stats - based , not counting guys who " might make it . " )
The Thrashers had 54 picks in the later rounds , conveniently the same number as the Oilers , so if you 'd like a comparison , you 've got it .
Of course , 16 of the 54 ( 30 % ) were in the 8th or 9th round , so we can't expect too much .
Here are guys who made it along with guys who might someday make it ...
Year Round Num .
Player GP 1999 5 128 Derek MacKenzie 64 1999 8 217 Garnet Exelby 408 2000 6 180 Darcy Hordichuk 431 2001 5 135 Colin Stuart 51 2001 6 189 Pasi Nurminen 125 2002 7 198 Nathan Oystrick 56 2003 8 239 Tobias Enstrom 246 2005 6 187 Andrei Zubarev 0
I do n't have to tell you this , but it 's pretty ugly .
Our current success rate is 4 - for - 54 , or 7.4 % , short of the current 8.7 % average .
There 's a few guys who might help that out , but it 's not really in our hands .
Derek MacKenzie is picking up about 20 games / season as a call - up for the Columbus Blue Jackets .
A long - term injury might see him hit 200 games .
Colin Stuart would have , in all likelihood , hit 200 games with us , but due to some trades , he 's currently not getting any NHL games with the Calgary Flames .
Nathan Oystrick might still have a chance as a call - up for the Anaheim Ducks , but it 's a long - shot at best .
Andrei Zubarev would very likely make our squad , but he 's currently playing in the KHL .
The good news is that our drafting has picked up measurably .
Three of our first round picks since 2006 are already in the NHL ( Bryan Little , Zach Bogosian , Evander Kane ) and the only other selection still has a shot ( Daultan Leveille ) .
Two of our three 2nd rounders look to be solid ( Carl Klingberg , Jeremy Morin , not so much Riley Holzapfel ) .
Of our 20 later - round picks , two will almost certainly be career NHLers ( Arturs Kulda , Paul Postma ) and several others , especially goalies , hold high places in our soon - to - be - released prospect rankings .
ATHENS ( Reuters ) -
Tens of thousands screamed “ Thieves , Thieves ! ” outside Greece ’s parliament in violent protests this week that killed three people -- and for the first time , the prime minister was listening .
After seven months in office , George Papandreou finally appears to be heeding calls for retribution as he tries to push through his pain - for - aid measures on a society enraged over chronic corruption .
“ My rage is huge when I see the tragedy of the looting of Greek people ’s wealth , ” he told a parliament debate on his austerity bill on Thursday , accusing the previous government of waste and corruption .
“ One minister paid 28,000 euros ( 24,103 pounds ) for office curtains ... They will be prosecuted . ”
Opinion polls show Greeks are more willing to suffer belt - tightening measures to exit a debt crisis shaking the euro zone if those they hold responsible for their woes -- corrupt politicians and businessmen -- pay .
Analysts say tackling high level corruption means changing a legal system set up to protect parliamentarians and confronting resistance from within his own party , also spoiled from years in power in the 1980s and 1990s .
“ Will he do it ?
He has no other option , ” said Costas Panagopoulos , head of ALCO pollsters .
“ Society wants blood and if you do n’t give them some , they will drink yours . ”
Papandreou came to power promising to tax the rich and help the poor , and the re-birth of the state after a series of scandals helped bring his conservative opponents down .
But he quickly found himself dealing with Greece ’s biggest economic crisis in decades .
His plans for “ green growth ” were set aside and the first wave of tax hikes and wage cuts prompted public demands that those responsible go to jail .
SLOW TO REACT
His government repeatedly said it was not the time for punishment but for change , a position analysts said helped create an impression that all Greek politicians conspire to cover up for each other .
They say he has been slow on the social justice front , but after this week ’s protests he can no longer underestimate the force of people ’s anger .
“ He appeared reluctant but he is now being forced by social unrest , ” said Costas Vergos , head analyst at Cyclos Securities .
“ I believe he can make it if he tackles corruption and tax evasion . ”
Papandreou must push through 30 billion euros worth of austerity measures in exchange for a 110 billion euros EU / IMF bailout , taking on angry unions protesting wage and pension cuts with strikes and rallies .
“ We understand the rage and we feel it as well , ” said Papandreou , son of the socialist maverick Andreas .
“ We are all to blame for not daring to make the necessary changes sooner . ”
But sympathy will not be enough .
Papandreou must effect a reform in norms as vast as his father ’s policy of socialist “ Change ” in the 1980s , when he modernised society and generous EU subsidies helped create a large , affluent middle class .
Analysts say his task is to limit a gargantuan public sector bloated through decades of political influence and introduce meritocracy .
The private sector must be freed from both state constraints and money .
If such problems , which seriously erode competitiveness , are not addressed Greece will continue to be the trigger for a wider euro zone crisis , and face more painful measures down the line .
NEED TO REFORM
A main hurdle to fighting corruption is a constitutional law protecting politicians suspected of wrongdoing from prosecution unless parliament lifts their immunity .
Several parliamentary committees have been investigating scandals but no politician has ever been brought to justice .
The ruling party itself has shown some desire to reform .
In a letter to parliament , 48 of its younger members petitioned to investigate all those who have held public office in the last 20 years and confiscate whatever cannot be justified .
“ We must have catharsis in our political system to rescue our political ethos and restore our role as parliamentarians , ” they said .
Papandreou himself , widely seen as untouched by scandals , is for the first time showing he is determined to pay the price for change .
Analysts said he could ask his deputies to abandon their parliamentary immunity , pressuring opposition parties to do the same , and allow the necessary sacrifices .
In a show of political muscle flexing , on Thursday he expelled from the party three deputies who voted against his austerity bill , cutting his parliamentary majority to 157 in the 300 - seat house .
“ I have known George Papandreou for years and I see he is now more determined than ever , ” said a government official close to the premier .
“ He is willing to pay the political cost to turn the page for Greece . ”

Team Sky has announced its squad for the Tour de France , naming a roster capable of being competitive on a number of fronts .
While the team ’s primary emphasis will no doubt be on supporting Bradley Wiggins ’ attempt to better last year ’s fourth - place finish , there is enough talent in the selection for Team Sky ’s black jerseys to feature prominently throughout the three weeks of the race .
Wiggins will be accompanied by fellow Britons Steve Cummings and Geraint Thomas .
Thomas Löfkvist should be able to provide support in the high mountains as well as ride to a high finish of his own , while the hugely experienced Michael Barry makes a delayed Tour de France debut in Wiggins ’ service .
Another eagerly - awaited debutant will be Edvald Boasson Hagen , and the exciting Norwegian talent will be expected to make a serious impact on the race .
Juan Antonio Flecha will join him in the hunt for stage victories .
The full line - up is : Michael Barry , Steve Cummings , Juan Antonio Flecha , Simon Gerrans , Edvald Boasson Hagen , Thomas Löfkvist , Serge Pauwels , Geraint Thomas and Bradley Wiggins .
Team principal Dave Brailsford is pleased with the balance achieved by his line - up .
“ We have a blend of Tour experience and young talent that will help us to perform this year and continue to develop .
The aim is to perform well , make a positive contribution to the Tour and help to get more people enjoying the sport .
We want to inspire .
And these nine riders will help us to do that . ”
Councillor Paula Fletcher is blaming fatigue and city hall technology for her University Ave. mis-vote that has cycling advocates mourning the loss of the ultimate in bike lanes .
It was late Wednesday — almost 10 p.m. — and councillors had been at it for more than 12 hours when voting began on Councillor Suzan Hall ’s motion to strip the controversial University Ave. pilot project from a package of new bike lanes .
Deputy speaker Gloria Lindsay - Luby told the 28 councillors in the chamber : “ It ’s Councillor Hall ’s motion deleting the bike lanes on the pilot project on University .
Please press your buttons .
This is for deletion . ”
In a momentous twitch of the finger , Fletcher , a fierce advocate of bike lanes and this proposal to bring median - hugging , protected lanes to busy University for the summer , pressed the green “ Yes ” button — tilting the balance 15 - 13 in favour of killing it .
“ It had been a very long day . . . and I thought I was voting on the whole enchilada ” of more than 30 kilometres of bike paths and lanes , including University , Fletcher ( Ward 30 , Toronto - Danforth ) told the Star on Thursday .
“ I realized what I had done and I pushed the red button ” to vote “ no . ”
But , when the results were put up on a screen , she was a “ yes . ”
A councillor howled “ Paula ! ” and she admitted her initial mistake but added : “ I pushed the red button ! ” and asked for a re-vote .
Lindsay - Luby ruled that was n’t allowed if it would change the outcome — the amendment would have failed on a 14 - 14 tie .
Fletcher said that when she pressed the red button she was still seeing a flashing message indicating voting was open , and wants the technology investigated .
John Elvidge of the city clerk ’s office says councillors can change their votes until all have voted .
Results are then locked in , he said , with maybe a “ millisecond ” lag before the computer system indicates voting is closed .
“ We do n’t think there is a problem with the system , ” he said .
Toronto Cyclists Union executive director Yvonne Bambrick watched from the gallery as the project , putting lanes behind solid posts from Richmond St. W. to Wellesley St. W./ Hoskin Ave. for three months , suffered its strange death .
“ It ’s a pretty significant let - down that the most innovative and forward - looking project , when we would finally have physically separated bike lanes in Toronto — the ultimate in protected space for cyclists — should fail in this way , ” she said Thursday .
Still , Bambrick does n’t blame Fletcher .
“ There ’s disappointment , not anger , ” she said .
“ People make mistakes .
It ’s a distracted , busy environment ( at city council ) and the meeting had gone long . ”
Bambrick noted that , had Fletcher voted as she had intended it ’s possible the subsequent vote on the whole package could have been defeated , meaning no new lanes .
“ It would have been all or nothing , ” she said , adding she ’s hopeful the University Ave. project will be proposed next year .
The # bikeTO Twitter feed was buzzing Thursday about what one user dubbed “ buttongate . ”
Some ridiculed Fletcher but others were angrier that 16 councillors and Mayor David Miller — a proponent of the project — were n’t there to vote .
Miller spokesman Stuart Green said : “ After hosting the mayor of Torino and then attending the Thousandth Tower ( film ) event in the rotunda , ( Miller ) had a personal commitment scheduled for after council was supposed to have ended , ” at 8 p.m .

Mayoral candidate Rocco Rossi , who had said it was “ sheer madness ” to put the lanes on University and remove two car lanes , was crowing .
“ I ’m delighted that sanity has prevailed and I have won my first council vote , ” joked Rossi , who wants bike lanes put only on secondary roads .
Faye Lyons of the Canadian Automobile Association said her organization is “ pleased ” the project was killed because the city had n’t adequately studied its potential impact on vehicle flow .
Jason Leopold has the story over at Truthout .
Another day , another story of a huge corporate behemoth running amok and roughshod over the most basic safety regulations and protocols .
In 2008 , an employee of BP hired to oversee and maintain required document databases relating to regulatory safety requirements raised concerns about a related BP Gulf project , Atlantis .
The whistleblower , whose name has been withheld at the person 's request because the whistleblower still works in the oil industry and fears retaliation , first raised concerns about safety issues related to BP Atlantis , the world 's largest and deepest semi-submersible oil and natural gas platform , located about 200 miles south of New Orleans , in November 2008 .
Atlantis , which began production in October 2007 , has the capacity to produce about 8.4 million gallons of oil and 180 million cubic feet of natural gas per day .
It was then that the whistleblower , who was hired to oversee the company 's databases housing documents related to its Atlantis project , discovered that the drilling platform had been operating without a majority of the engineer - approved documents it needed to run safely , leaving the platform vulnerable to a catastrophic disaster that would far surpass the massive oil spill that began last week following a deadly explosion on a BP - operated drilling rig .
The specifics are pretty chilling .
Regulations require extensive preparation and analysis of potential hazards with signoffs by qualified engineers at each step .
Part of the analysis is a detailed drawing of the project 's piping and process flows .
BP's were incomplete , which prompted a member of the BP team to alert BP officials to the risk that they could be assumed to be complete , leading to a complete failure of the system .
According to the Truthout article , 85 percent of the drawings did not receive engineer approval .
Eighty - five percent .
Stunning .
And there 's more .
Even worse , 95 percent of Atlantis ' subsea welding records did not receive final approval , calling into question the integrity of thousands of crucial welds on subsea components that , if they were to rupture , could result in an oil spill 30 times worse than the one that occurred after the explosion on Deepwater Horizon last week .
The rest of the story is at Truthout .
Go read it .
It 's chilling all on its own , but when read in the larger context of the Massey Energy Upper Big Branch disaster , Goldman Sachs revelations , Wall Street meltdowns and SEC shenanigans , the abject failure of conservative " small government , no regulation " philosophy is truly on parade for everyone to see .
Late - night editorial comment :
The Masseys , Halliburtons , BPs , and Wall Streeters do it because they expect to do it and get away with it .
They do it because for 30 years we 've listened to the drumbeat of a cadence : Profits over all .
As the cadence quickened , the media joined the parade , morphing from objective observer to drum major .
The beat grew louder .
With each decibel increase , their arrogance and power grew stronger .
In 30 years , the John Birch society has transformed from pariah to mainstream .
How far will we let them go before we get out in the streets and " take our country back " ?
We 're not going to undo all of this in a year , two years or four years .
It took them thirty years of sustained , over - the - top underhanded rhetoric and behavior to get to this point .
I believe the 2010 elections are as much about whether we 're willing to arm - wrestle corporate interests for control of this country as they are about any specific candidate or issue .
They are about where our hearts are , and we can't afford to turn away or disengage .
Not now .
Some contend Democrats are n't any better than Republicans , or liberals than conservatives .
Whatever fits .
Either way , I disagree .
Under a Bush administration , this whistleblower 's story would not have seen the light of day or Truthout 's site .
He went through standard channels first .
Under Bush , he'd have been crushed in those channels before he ever had the chance to reach out to Jason .
Democrats are n't perfect and neither is Obama .
But on their very worst day , they 're still better by far than what we can expect with conservatives in control .
Change is n't overnight .
They spent 30 years bringing down everything progressives built in the 20th century .
We 're seeing the fruits of their labor on land , sea , and in the air .
Conservatives have brought this country to the brink of ruin .
When they can't win by the rules , they write their own .
It 's time for that to change .
This is where I live .
If you were to look at the full - size image , you 'd see two offshore oil derricks on the horizon .
I do n't know who runs them or manages them , but I know I 've kicked and screamed for 2 years since Bush lifted the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California ( yes , it was Bush , not Obama ) about the danger to our coastline .
This is what 's at risk here , along with newly revived groups of brown pelicans , migrating whales , and endangered plovers .
It could just as easily happen here , and it is n't worth the risk .
I believe this so strongly that I gave away my car and decided to walk or ride a bike everywhere I could over a year ago .
I do n't regret it , and I will fight back as long as I 'm breathing for the right to see this coastline this way , to see pelicans dive into clear water and most of all , oil companies ' power to diminish .
The Portuguese novelist José Saramago , who explored Portugal 's troubled political identity in a series of novels published over the last four decades and won the Nobel prize for literature in 1998 , died today at the age of 87 .
An outspoken atheist and communist , he challenged the orthodoxies of post - dictatorship Portuguese life with novels such as Baltasar and Blimunda , The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis and All the Names , but reached his widest audience with the 2008 film of his 1995 novel , Blindness , directed by Fernando Meirelles .
He spent the last years of his life in Lanzarote after the Portuguese government had vetoed the nomination of his novel The Gospel According to Jesus Christ for an EU literary prize in 1992 .
His translator Margaret Jull Costa hailed his " wonderful imagination " and his focus on the " dignity of the ordinary man " .
" He was the greatest contemporary Portuguese writer , " she said , " a complete original .
It 's been an enormous privilege to have translated his work . "
Born in 1922 , he worked as a car mechanic and a journalist before devoting himself to fiction in his 50s .
His breakthrough came in 1982 with his fourth novel , Baltasar and Blimunda , a story of the love of a maimed soldier for a young clairvoyant in 18th - century Lisbon .
Giovanni Pontiero's 1988 English translation brought his work to a international prominence .
His reputation grew through the 1980s and 90s as he published a series of important and fantastical novels , written in a flowing mellifluous prose which follows the rhythm of speech .
The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis , first published in 1984 , is widely acknowledged to be his masterpiece – an account of the return to Lisbon of an imaginary character invented by the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa after the death of his creator .
The Stone Raft , first published in 1986 , imagines the Iberian peninsula cut off from Europe and adrift on the Atlantic , while All the Names ( 1997 ) turns a registry office clerk into a hero as he sets off in pursuit of an unknown woman .
Praised by the Swedish Academy for his " parables sustained by imagination , compassion and irony " , the award of the Nobel prize in 1998 took his fame to a new level .
Saramago 's editor at Harvill Secker , Rebecca Carter , found it " hard to take in the fact that someone as vibrant should have left us " , and saluted his body of work as " one of the most important of the last century – radical , witty , humane , endlessly challenging and questioning " .
He continued to write until his death , and experimented with a daily blog , Outros Cadernos de Saramago , in 2008 , which was published between hard covers as The Notebook in English earlier this year .
A bout of pneumonia left him seriously ill last year , but he had made a full recovery and was expected to appear at the Edinburgh festival in August to promote his latest book in English , The Elephant 's Journey .
His last book , Cain , in which Abel 's brother serves as a kind of alter - ego as he travels through the Old Testament , was published in 2009 with an English translation expected next year .

One of the exciting new NASA programs supported by the President ’s budget is the Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research ( CRuSR ) program .
CRuSR will help foster the development of commercial reusable transportation to “ near space , ” a step along the path to providing the Nation with much lower - cost and more reliable access to orbital space .
The overall goal of CRuSR is regular , frequent , and predictable access to the edge of space at a reasonable cost with easy recovery of intact payloads .
Thanks in large part to the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize , a new generation of commercial suborbital spacecraft has been under development by entrepreneurs like Richard Branson , Jeff Bezos , John Carmack , David Masten , and Jeff Greason .
CRuSR — one of several innovative priorities for NASA ’s new Chief Technology Officer , Bobby Braun — is building on that momentum .
Starting next year , NASA will invest $ 15 million per year to support a wide range of technology demonstrations , educational experiments , and science payloads on these new vehicles .
This program will leverage significant investment by the private sector to provide quick , routine access to the edge of space .
NASA will work with this new industry to develop flight data standards and payload procedures that maximize the amount of data retrieved from each flight .
It will also give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity of a lifetime .
They ’ll help design and build new hardware , work side - by - side with rocket scientists to integrate the experiments into the vehicles , and analyze the data once each experiment has been completed .
There may even be opportunities for middle and high school students , who could travel to the nearest spaceport to see their science experiment blast off into space .
With its mix of technology development , public - private investment , and educational potential the program a tribute to CTO Braun ’s creativity and a perfect example of President Obama ’s charge to NASA — to “ inspire wonder in a new generation , sparking passions and launching careers . ”

Dissenting from yesterday 's Supreme Court ruling that said the Second Amendment applies to the states via the 14th Amendment , Justice Stephen Breyer complained that judges will now have to make assessments about gun control for which they lack the necessary expertise .
To illustrate that point , he posed a series of rhetorical questions ( emphasis added ) :
Does the right to possess weapons for self - defense extend outside the home ?
To the car ?
To work ?
What sort of guns are necessary for self - defense ?
Handguns ?
Rifles ?
Semiautomatic weapons ?
When is a gun semi-automatic ?
Where are different kinds of weapons likely needed ?
Does time - of - day matter ?
Does the presence of a child in the house matter ?
Does the presence of a convicted felon in the house matter ?
Do police need special rules permitting pat - downs designed to find guns ?
When do registration requirements become severe to the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban ?
Who can possess guns and of what kind ?
Aliens ?
Prior drug offenders ?
Prior alcohol abusers ?
How would the right interact with a state or local government 's ability to take special measures during , say , national security emergencies ?
Most of these are questions that courts may actually have to address .
But I doubt they will be called upon to settle the issue of what constitutes a semiautomatic weapon ( a gun that fires one round , ejects the empty casing , and automatically loads a new cartridge when the trigger is pulled ) or decide whether people have a right to possess them ( a question the Court already answered in District of Columbia v. Heller , where it overturned a law that banned semiautomatic handguns ) .
I suspect Breyer is using semiautomatic weapon as a synonym for assault weapon , an arbitrary category that is based mainly on the proscribed guns ' military - style appearance rather than their capabilities .
While this conflation demonstrates Breyer 's point that judges do not necessarily have the knowledge to assess the wisdom or propriety of gun control laws , the same is true of legislators .
Judges , like legislators , can and should strive to intelligently assess the evidence and arguments submitted by both sides .
Sometimes judges and legislators both fail at this task .

Celebrated science fiction author Philip K. Dick published Project Plowshare as a serial between November 1965 and January 1966 .
The story , later expanded into the novel Zap Gun , is set in a world where seemingly deadly new weapons are “ plowshared ” into consumer products .
It is ironic that just a few years after that novel was set , a defense giant is quite literally turning a new weapon system into an agricultural tool .
Defense giant Raytheon is well known for putting the “ ray ” into raygun .
They developed the infamous Active Denial System that is designed to zap rioters with a non-lethal millimeter “ pain ray ” .
Active Denial System at Moody Air Force Base , Ga .
Raytheon realized that technology which can heat human skin at a distance can also be used to heat crops that are vulnerable to frost .
One crop that is very sensitive to frost is grapes .
In 2005 Ontario ’s overall yield of processed grapes fell by 54 % due to injuries sustained by the grapes during winter .
In 2007 California experienced $ 800 million in crop losses due to freezing temperatures with navel oranges being the hardest hit .
Existing methods of frost prevention include heaters , wind machines , sprinklers and helicopters in emergencies .
These methods all have significant downsides .
They are either noisy , costly , inefficient or are only effective under certain environmental conditions .
Two moths ago Raytheon deployed a prototype of their newly developed Tempwave system to an Ontario vineyard .
Tempwave sits atop a 25 feet pole and is powered by the grid .
When its sensors detect weather conditions that may result in frost , its low - level microwave delivers energy directly to the crop without wasting energy on heating the intervening air .
As long as the Tempwave system has enough power delivered to it , frost protection is guaranteed .

Tempwave proof of concept in Californian orchard
From the Raytheon press release ( 19 April 2010 ) …
Canadian horticulture research center has contracted with Raytheon Company ( NYSE : RTN ) to install a prototype microwave frost protection system at its Ontario vineyard .
Tempwave ( TM ) is a Raytheon - developed system that uses low - level microwave radiant heat to prevent frost damage to crops .
Microwave energy is transmitted from towers located in an orchard or vineyard changing the energy balance that slows cooling to prevent freeze damage .
“ The agreement leverages Raytheon ’s expertise in radio frequency applications with the Canadian research center ’s mandate to introduce innovative horticulture technologies , ” said Lee Silvestre , vice president for Mission Innovation at Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems .
Mission Innovation is charged with exploring and applying Raytheon technical expertise to address global challenges outside Raytheon ’s traditional core business interests in defense , homeland security and other government markets .
The Vineland Research and Innovation Centre in Ontario , Canada , is a center for horticultural research and innovation whose charter includes commercializing and delivering new technologies to market .
“ This new prototype technology will help ensure Ontario vineyards and orchards are protected when temperatures fall below freezing and jeopardize tender fruit and grape production , ” said Dr. Jim Brandle , the center ’s chief executive .
“ Our partnership with Raytheon is a new chapter in Vineland ’s on - going research to protect Canada ’s food supply . ”
The contract calls for Raytheon to install a prototype system in the center ’s vineyard , prepare it for operation , and support initial testing during a four - month period .
It is part of a working agreement for each party to contribute its expertise to test and market the system worldwide .

Some 12 or 13 years ago , when I was reporting from Israel for the New York weekly , the Forward , I wrote a piece on Kemal Ataturk , the founder of modern secular Turkey , that I submitted to the newspaper with some trepidation .
In it , I presented evidence for the likelihood of Ataturk 's having had a Jewish  or more precisely , a Doenmeh  father .
The Doenmeh were a heretical Jewish sect formed , after the conversion to Islam in the 17th century of the Turkish - Jewish messianic pretender Sabbetai Zevi , by those of his followers who continued to believe in him .
Conducting themselves outwardly as Muslims in imitation of him , they lived secretly as Jews and continued to exist as a distinct , if shadowy , group well into the 20th century .
In the many biographies of Ataturk there were three or four different versions of his father 's background , and although none identified him as a Jew , their very multiplicity suggested that he had been covering up his family origins .
This evidence , though limited , was intriguing .
Its strongest item was a chapter in a long - forgotten autobiography of the Hebrew journalist , Itamar Ben-Avi , who described in his book a chance meeting on a rainy night in the late winter of 1911 in the bar of a Jerusalem hotel with a young Turkish captain .
Tipsy from too much arak , the captain confided to Ben - Avi that he was Jewish and recited the opening Hebrew words of the Shema Yisra'el or " Hear O Israel " prayer , which almost any Jew or Doenmeh  but no Turkish Muslim  would have known .
Ten years later , Ben-Avi wrote , he opened a newspaper , saw a headline about a military coup in Turkey , and in a photograph recognized the leader that the young officer he had met the other night .
At the time , Islamic political opposition to Ataturk - style secularism was gaining strength in Turkey .
What would happen , I wondered , when a Jewish newspaper in New York broke the news that the revered founder of modern Turkey was half - Jewish ?
I pictured riots , statues of Ataturk toppling to the ground , the secular state he had created tottering with them .
I could have spared myself the anxiety .
The piece was run in the Forward , there was hardly any reaction to it anywhere , and life in Turkey went on as before .
As far as I knew , not a single Turk even read what I wrote .
And then , a few months ago , I received an e-mail from someone who had .
I wo n't mention his name .
He lives in a European country , is well - educated , works in the financial industry , is a staunchly secular Kemalist , and was writing to tell me that he had come across my article in the Forward and had decided to do some historical research in regard to it .
One thing he discovered , he wrote , was that Ataturk indeed traveled in the late winter of 1911 to Egypt from Damascus on his way to join the Turkish forces fighting an Italian army in Libya , a route that would have taken him through Jerusalem just when Ben - Avi claimed to have met him there .
Moreover , in 1911 he was indeed a captain , and his fondness of alcohol , which Ben - Avi could not have known about when he wrote his autobiography , is well - documented .
And here 's something else that was turned up by my Turkish e-mail correspondent : Ataturk , who was born and raised in Thessaloniki , a heavily Jewish city in his day that had a large Doenmeh population , attended a grade school , known as the " Semsi Effendi School , " that was run by a religious leader of the Doenmeh community named Simon Zvi .
The email concluded with the sentence : " I now know  know ( and I have n't a shred of doubt )  that Ataturk 's father 's family was indeed of Jewish stock . "
I have n't a shred of doubt either .
I just have , this time , less trepidation , not only because I no longer suffer from delusions of grandeur regarding the possible effects of my columns , but because there 's no need to fear toppling the secular establishment of Kemalist Turkey .
It toppled for good in the Turkish elections two days ago when the Islamic Justice and Development Party was returned to power with so overwhelming a victory over its rivals that it seems safe to say that secular Turkey , at least as Ataturk envisioned it , is a thing of the past .
Actually , Ataturk 's Jewishness , which he systematically sought to conceal , explains a great deal about him , above all , his fierce hostility toward Islam , the religion in which nearly every
Turk of his day had been raised , and his iron - willed determination to create a strictly secular Turkish nationalism from which the Islamic component would be banished .
Who but a member of a religious minority would want so badly to eliminate religion from the identity of a Muslim majority that , after the genocide of Turkey 's Christian Armenians in World War I and the expulsion of nearly all of its Christian Greeks in the early 1920s , was 99 % of Turkey 's population ?
The same motivation caused the banner of secular Arab nationalism to be first raised in the Arab world by Christian intellectuals .
Ataturk seems never to have been ashamed of his Jewish background .
He hid it because it would have been political suicide not to , and the secular Turkish state that was his legacy hid it too , and with it , his personal diary , which was never published and has for all intents and purposes been kept a state secret all these years .
There 's no need to hide it any longer .
The Islamic counterrevolution has won the day in Turkey even without its exposure .
As a freelance web designer , I make use of a lot of web - based tools and applications to help manage all aspects of my business .
Using these tools has increased my organization , professionalism and timeliness , which in turn has increased profits .
The best part ?
Most offer free plans for single users ( aka freelancers ) .
Project Management
You may think that the plethora of project management apps are made for teams of developers , and while they certainly do help when working in teams , they can be a valuable asset to the freelancer as well .
Most offer great organizational tools , including calendars , task lists and time - tracking .
The most well - established of project management apps , Basecamp is a solid piece of software that allows you to manage contacts , projects and milestones .
Their free plan is quite limited but if you can afford their premium plans , it is well worth the money ( and is brandable to boot ! ) .
Presents a unique way of managing your projects by reducing them to their basic elements :
Action Steps - Tasks
References - Notes , files , sketches , links
Backburners - Ideas ( not yet tasks )
Discussions - Messaging
Events - Milestones and due dates
This is probably my favorite of the bunch , as they provide project management , bug tracking and SVN / Git repository hosting in an all - in - one package .
They have a stellar free plan too , with 200 MB of storage space and nearly all premium features .
Billing and Invoicing
While it 's fine to send clients a PayPal payment request for your work , a professional looking invoice adds a bit of credibility to your business .
Smart accounting can also make life much easier during tax season .
The following web apps allow you to send digital invoices ( or snail mail ) , collect payments and manage your finances :
This Toronto - based service lets you easily track time and send invoices to clients , then collect payments using a number of payment gateways .
They can also send snail mail invoices if you prefer for $ 1 - 2 , depending on volume sent ( return envelopes included ) .
Made by the popular design studio MetaLab , Ballpark allows you to send gorgeous estimates and invoices .
Your clients can comment on estimates or accept them , with the ability to make the initial payment using PayPal .
Blinksale allows you to send custom designed invoices and even supports recurring payment templates , which is great for charging clients for hosting or domain fees .
Unfortunately , Blinksale does n't have a free plan , only a 30 - day trial .
Packed with a ton of features , Free Agent is the big - daddy of invoicing and accounting web apps .
You can send estimates , track time , invoice clients , manage your business financials ( by uploading bank statements ) and create country - specific tax reports .
They do n't have a free plan but do have a 30 - day free trial ( no credit - card required ) .
This app is n't for invoicing or billing clients , but rather to help manage and organize your business financial data , primarily your cash flow .
It is a powerful tool with a lot of great features that lets you get an overview of exactly how your business is doing financially over time .
Mockups and Creative Process
If you 're a freelance web designer you know all about the significance of mockups .
While you 're almost certainly going to have to make several high - quality , full mockups in Photoshop ( or the like ) , it can help to make a quick wireframe mockup to find the perfect content layout your client wants .
The following tools can help with that :
This free ( while in beta ) tool lets you create mockups directly in your browser and share them with others .
It loads quickly and has a wide range of objects you can import into the main view , including working links and support for multiple hierarchal pages .
Balsamiq is a highly extensible mockup builder with a web client , desktop client and plugins for several other enterprise collaboration applications .
Both their product and support are stellar , however they do n't offer a free version ( only a limited demo ) .
Mockflow is similar to the others but allows real - time collaboration between users and online - offline syncing , so you can work from the desktop app or the web client .
They also have a MockStore , where users can share their custom elements .
Hosted Content Management Systems
Clients absolutely love to be able to manage their content without external help , and installing a CMS will make life easier for them and for you .
Sometimes , you might not want to use WordPress or write your own custom backend , in which case you can consider using one of these hosted solutions :
LightCMS is a really a lot more than just a content management system , with support for client management , e-commerce and billing , packaged with the default CMS features like blogging , calendars and basic SEO .
Their plans can get slightly expensive but the convenience of having everything handled by one source makes up for it .
Similar to LightCMS , Traffik allows you to manage all aspects of your site ( or your clients ) , giving you the ability to create blogs , forums or restricted members sections .
Traffik also provides a basic e-commerce solution so your clients can manage and sell their products .
This free app lets you manage any website by entering the FTP information for your server and adding snippets of Cushy code to the HTML of the site .
Clients can then login to the CushyCMS site and manage the content you 've marked as editable .
This is probably the simplest and easiest solution out of the three , though it lacks in features .
Browser Compatability
Any good web designer knows the importance of browser compatability but frankly , it can be a pain to deal with .
The process involves testing designs on numerous browsers to make sure they look the same .
To help with this process , several sites now offer screen shots in various browsers so you do n't have to install a gazillion browsers on your local machine .
Certainly the best looking site of the three , Litmus is the Basecamp of the browser compatability world .
They offer a free plan that allows you to conduct 50 tests a month , however it 's limited to only 2 browsers ( IE7 and FF2 ) .
Their premium plans are pretty stellar - if you can afford them .
BrowserShots is a free , open - source service that takes screenshots on more than 75 different browsers .
The only catch is that you have to wait in a queue for your results , or you can pay to get priority processing .
BrowserCam does what the other services do but adds one killer additional feature : support for mobile browsers and desktop / web - based e-mail clients .
They only have paid plans but there is a 24 hour free trial that supports 200 screen captures .
Support Systems
While most freelancers can get away with providing client support through e-mail , people with a large number of clients may opt to use a dedicated support system .
The following tools can help you manage support requests easily and professionally :
This is probably one of my favorite ' new ' web app .
Zendesk is a complete support system that can be fully integrated with your site .
It includes a customer forum , support tickets and documentation .
They have a 30 - day free trial , with their cheapest plan costing $ 9 per month ( and well worth it ! ) .
Made by the creative minds at entp , Tender is another complete support system , providing support forums , ticketing and knowledge base .
They have a 30 - day free trial and are a little more expensive than Zendesk .
What better way to provide professional support to your clients than a toll - free 1-800 number ?
Grasshopper allows you to get a custom toll - free number for a flat monthly rate , with unlimited extensions that can be routed to any land or cell line .
Conclusion
Organization can make freelancing a lot easier and more profitable , and using the above web apps can help with that goal .
The more professional you are ( or appear ) , the more you are able to charge for your services , granted you maintain a high level of quality as well .
Do you use any of the tools listed ?

The private sector continued to reduce its debt in the first quarter , while the government picked up the slack , and then some .
Overall , debt rose at a 3.5 % annualized rate , according to the Federal Reserve 's Flow of Funds report .
But all of that growth was thanks to the government .
The following chart tells the story :
As you can see , households ( purple line ) continued to reduce their debt last quarter by 2.4 % .
This marked their seventh straight quarter of shrinking debt .
Businesses ( gold line ) , however , are beginning to reverse their debt reduction trend .
After a four - quarter slide , debt was virtually unchanged in the first quarter .
This appears to indicate that businesses are having more luck rolling over their debt this year .
And then , there 's the government .
State and local governments ( green line ) increased their debt burden by 4.3 % .
This was their fifth - straight quarterly increase , which has been pretty stable in the 4 % to 5 % growth range over that period .
The federal government ( red line ) remains the biggest borrower .
Although its debt growth at 18.5 % is n't as much as what we saw in late 2008 , it 's still pretty huge .
It 's more than last month 's 12.6 % rise .
And remember , this is debt growth , so each quarter total debt has grown to add to the huge late - 2008 deficits .
Slouching towards Utopia
Hitch - 22 : A Memoir .
By Christopher Hitchens .

DOUBLE book - keeping is the theme of this memoir by Christopher Hitchens , which is at once sinuously written , evocative and frustrating .
With a mixture of genuine charm and phoney self - deprecation , he plays both sides : sexually , socially and politically .
The result is a racy and Falstaffian read .
It tells the reader a lot about Oxford in the days of the student revolts , about raffish London in the 1970s , about the most horrid bits of the late cold - war era and about America 's inexorable pull .
In the midst is Hitch : beloved friend of Martin Amis , James Fenton and Ian McEwan , formidable wordsmith , womaniser , drinker and smoker , a man to whom rules do not apply .
He wriggles past constraints , starting with his family background , steeped in the austere rigour of the Royal Navy .
At Oxford he mixes robust revolutionary socialism with an upmarket social life ; his legendary fondness for female companionship ( almost always requited ) has a homosexual counterpoint .
He is on the left , but not of it : too witty , too iconoclastic and too sceptical to fall for the dreary dogmas of mainstream Marxism .
Hitch was a Trotskyite , the lushest and most exotic growth in the botanical gardens of British communism — and thus detested by more orthodox comrades .
His disillusionment with that self - indulgent creed is the book 's central thread .
Among the sharp vignettes is his first eye - opening trip across the Atlantic .
Despite his loathing of President Nixon , he finds he cannot demonise America .
In Cuba he spots the verbose and oppressive side of the Castro revolution .
In Argentina , he dissects and skewers clerical fascism .
For the sharp - penned and quick - witted in those days the globe was there for trotting .
Mr Hitchens may be criticised for lack of depth ; but nobody can fault him for not covering the distance .
The nostalgia is sometimes fetid .
On his favourite high horse , Mr Hitchens might dismiss another writer 's coy tales of long - ago gay flings at Oxford with future Conservative cabinet ministers as “ kiss and hint ” writing .
The boozy Friday lunches in London with his clever friends , and their shared fondness for puerile , obscene word games , will leave most readers bored and mystified .
Mr Hitchens admits that it was funnier at the time ( and probably funnier still for those robbed of their critical faculties by copious amounts of alcohol ) .
But amid the dregs are shards of brilliant , piercing writing .
The account of his uncovered Jewish ancestry ( concealed by his lively , miserable mother , who killed herself in a hotel room in Athens , with her lover ) is more than poignant .
His willingness to go to the barricades to defend his friend Salman Rushdie after the fatwa in 1989 , and his beloved America after September 11th 2001 , is unaffected and appealing .
Having lambasted bourgeois values such as freedom and tolerance , Hitch now ( a bit late in the day , some might think ) understands why they matter .
The ardour is not always matched by insight .
In particular , the smoke of incinerated straw men obscures any serious discussion of religion ( superstition practised by hypocrites , in his view ) .
And for what is meant to be a no-holds - barred memoir , the author goes lightly on some of his failings .
Broken ideals get plenty of self - satisfied scrutiny ; broken hearts and marriages rate barely a mention .
The impression left is of a writer frozen in a precocious teenagery , whose ability to tease and provoke the grown - ups is entertaining but ultimately tiresome .
If Mr Hitchens can stay off the booze and do some serious thinking , his real autobiography , in 20 years ' time or so , should be a corker .
WILSON : I never met anyone who did n’t .
That ’s not something you say lightly — you ’d have to be crazy to joke about that at this time in history , as a Westerner .
IDEAS : You told Omar you were in love with him when you had only known each other for a matter of weeks .
At the same time , you revealed that you were a Muslim .
Do you think he believed you when you said that ?
WILSON : I knew I was a monotheist - monotheist .
Islam had a lot of the things I liked about Judaism , in terms of the indivisible God who is one and whole , and “ does not beget and is not begotten ” ... but it was an evangelical religion .... [ W ] hat also appealed to me is that to become a Muslim is sort of a deal between you and God .
You do n’t need to be witnessed [ by ] any particular priest ; there ’s no ceremony you have to go through ; there is no test .
IDEAS : Like a lot of people , you underwent almost a period of religion shopping in college .
What drew you to Islam ?
Ideas spoke with Wilson from her home in Seattle , where she now lives with her husband , Omar , who works for a nongovernmental organization that helps refugees .
The book vividly recounts her struggle with the sexual harassment she experienced on the street , the suspicion of some of her neighbors , and the deep frustration many Egyptians feel toward the United States .
But she also discovered generosity and warmth in unexpected places , and a new identity as a person bridging two worlds .
The transition was n’t easy .
When she first arrived in Cairo , already privately committed to Islam , but isolated in one of the world ’s most crowded cities , she and her American roommate were subsisting on cheese and olives , baffled as to how to buy food without American - style supermarkets .
She got to know her future husband , Omar , a Cairo native and fellow teacher , when he offered to show them around .
He soon became their cultural translator and close friend .
She documents her unusual experience in all its complexity and joy in a new memoir , “ The Butterfly Mosque : A Young American Woman ’s Journey to Love and Islam . ”
What took Wilson from a Comm .
Ave. dorm to a flat in a working - class neighborhood in Cairo ?
And what was it like , as an American raised in a liberal secular family , to start seeing the world from within traditional Islam ’s rules and norms ?
A year after graduation , she was living in Cairo , a convert to Islam , preparing to marry an Egyptian man and adapting to a culture with drastically different values from the one she was raised in .
In 2001 , G. Willow Wilson was a sophomore at Boston University , a budding history major , and a comic book fan who wrote music reviews for the Weekly Dig .
IDEAS : You lived in Tura , a working - class district of Cairo .
What did you discover about the so - called Arab street that you would n’t have known from books ?
WILSON : One thing I learned [ is ] that there is no such thing as the “ Arab street ” — things are so different depending on class , location ....
There are extremists , religious extremists , who have very specific religious issues with us , and they try to prey upon the insecurities and fears of ordinary people and say , “ You should be looking at this through a religious lens , in terms of Muslims vs. non-Muslims . ”
But the original frustration has nothing to do with religion , it ’s a cultural and economic and political frustration that ’s being exploited by religious extremists .
IDEAS : You came to appreciate the fundamentalist idea that beautiful things — women ’s bodies , Mecca — ought to be hidden from view .
But you were relentlessly harassed by men on the street .
How do those attitudes square ?
WILSON : There ’s a misunderstanding in the West — people think that because harassment is bad and fundamentalism is bad , that fundamentalism and harassment must be somehow connected ... but in fact they ’re not .
One of the big draws of the fundamentalists to me is they ’re so polite , especially to women ....
In Cairo there is so much political oppression , and there are huge economic disparities between rich and poor , there ’s so much social injustice .
This creates a huge amount of frustration , and people act out — I think the harassment of women is an outgrowth of that .
But it ’s absolutely anti-Islamic to treat women that way .
IDEAS : Shortly after your engagement to Omar , you decided to begin wearing a head scarf .
What did that mean to you ?
WILSON : I wanted to do something to honor my marriage and make that relationship ... different from all my other relationships .
That ’s something the head scarf , in a symbolic way , is meant to do in Arabic culture , it defines your relationship to your husband and the men of your family differently than your relationship to the average guy on the street you ’ve never met .
IDEAS : What was his reaction ?
WILSON : He was surprised .
He never pressured me ... it had never come up between us .
But he was very happy and touched that this was something I would bring up on my own .
IDEAS : One of the first head scarves you bought was red .
WILSON : I wanted to be able to express myself within the parameters of this symbol I ’d chosen .... I did n’t limit myself to what we think of here as this stereotypical black , drab [ color ] .
The great thing about Cairo is the vast majority of women wear some kind of head scarf , but they are also very fashion - conscious .
They love bright colors .
IDEAS : You wrote an essay for The New York Times that drew some criticism for seeming to glorify the “ women ’s car ” in the Cairo subway , where men are not allowed .
What were you trying to say ?
WILSON : These spaces that we do n’t understand in the West , that we explicitly condemn , that we do n’t want to have anything to do with , that we feel superior to , are not empty spaces ... people have experiences there [ and ] ... build relationships there .
They laugh , they cry , they go about their daily lives .
There is not nothing going on in these women - only spaces in the Middle East .
There are conversations and personalities .
IDEAS : When you and Omar started living together , you were freelancing and spent a lot of time keeping house .
Was there a tension there because it was a choice for you , and for a lot of women those menial jobs are not a choice ?
WILSON : For most women these jobs are not a choice .
I do n’t know anybody who does n’t at the end of the day , even if they are a high - powered CEO , come home and pick clothes off the floor and put them in the washing machine .
I think we [ in the West ] like to pretend that these jobs are less vital than they are ....
In Egypt , they ’re appreciated .
IDEAS : Did you ever argue about chores ?
WILSON : Yeah , we did what every couple does —
“ I ’m not going to take out the trash , I refuse !
It ’s your job . ” ... Relationships between married people have a lot more similarities across the world than they do differences .
IDEAS : You are also a comic book writer — are you possibly the only white American Muslim woman in comics ?
WILSON : For sure .

The Hussites were a religious and military faction which many historians have labeled " radical Catholics " or " Proto - Protestants " .
Joan of Arc denounces the Hussites ' theology as a " false and vile superstition " , condemns them for destroying churches and statues of the saints , and threatens to add her own presence to the ongoing crusading efforts against them unless they " return to the Catholic faith and the original light " .
Pope Martin V had encouraged another crusade against the Hussites not long before the letter was dictated .
Some modern readers and authors have commented negatively on the violent threats against the Hussites contained in this letter .
Perhaps they expected Joan of Arc to be a pacifist .
In any event , the context should be obvious : as with her ultimatums to the English - which take a similar form - she was responding to an existing state of war .
She specifically refers to the Hussites ' attacks on churches and monasteries , and it may not be coincidence that the letter was sent not long after campaigns by the Hussites which had devastated a significant number of villages in Silesia , Hungary , Lusatia , Meissen , and Saxony - actions against civilians which particularly angered her , judging from the accounts of eyewitnesses who knew her .
This is the setting for the threats of military action to stop the Hussites from further campaigns of this type .
The violent tone of her ultimatums differs sharply from her other letters and the descriptions by eyewitnesses who said she was normally " sweet - natured " in other circumstances .
The Text
The original version of the letter was translated into Latin by Joan 's scribe and confessor , Friar Jean Pasquerel .
Unlike her letters to the English commanders - a bilingual group who spoke fluent French - in this case Latin was the most convenient means of communicating with the intended recipients .
Pasquerel 's name appears at the bottom of the letter , as was common practice in the 15th century when a scribe recorded a letter dictated by someone else , as can be seen from Royal and seigneurial correspondence of that era .
Below is an English translation of the letter , with notes and commentary on the right .
Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) --
An Iranian ship carrying aid supplies has set sail for Gaza and two others are expected to leave next week , two of Iran 's semi-official news agencies reported on Monday .
Iran 's
Mehr news agency said that an Iranian ship carrying humanitarian aid left the port of Khorramshahr on Saturday , heading towards Gaza .
" This ship will pass through territorial waters of Oman , Yemen and Egypt before it reaches Gaza .
It is said that the ship contains only humanitarian aid and there are no peace activists on board , " the agency stated .
Iran 's
Fars news agency also reported that top Iranian officials will allow two other ships to leave , but its navy will not escort them .
" Maj. Gen. Salami , deputy commander IRGC ( Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ) , discussing the humanitarian aid ships to Gaza , said that protecting these ships is not on the agenda of the IRGC , " Fars said .
The name of one of the ships is " Toward Gaza , " Mohammad Ali Noorani , the deputy head of Iran 's Society for the Defense of Palestine said at a news conference .
He said that vessel will leave from the port city of Bandar Abbas .
A Turkish flotilla of ships trying to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza was stopped by Israeli naval vessels on May 31 and nine people on one of the ships were killed when the Israeli military boarded it and gunfire broke out .
Israel says its troops were attacked with knives , metal poles and other objects .
Vic Rawl says inexplicable Democratic primary contest casts ' cloud ' over state election ; Notes ' irregularities ' , problem reports from voters , poll workers , vows ' electoral reform ' , calls for ' full and unblinking investigation of overall integrity ' of state 's ES&S voting system ...
UPDATE : ' Burden of proof ' on Rawls .
Good luck with that .
Brad Friedman Byon 6/14/2010 , 12:32 pm PT
[ UPDATED at end of article . ]
A formal challenge to the announced results of South Carolina 's Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate has now been filed by Judge Vic Rawl , the candidate who was n't announced the winner by the state 's oft - failed , easily - manipulated , 100 % unverifiable ES&S e-voting system .
Rawl released an official statement on his website today , in conjunction with the filing and a press conference he held in Charleston this afternoon .
The statement points generally to a number of findings being made by the campaign as independent experts have analyzed the results , voting patterns and problems being reported by poll workers and voters on Election Day where the unknown , unemployed candidate Alvin Greene defeated Rawl on the unverifiable ES&S iVotronic touch - screen voting systems , performing 11 points better on those machines than he did in the paper - based absentee results .
The oft - failed , easily - manipulated ES&S election results reporting system gave Greene a 59 % to 41 % " victory " over Rawl .
Greene did no campaigning , had no name recognition , had no campaign website , faces felony obscenity charges and managed , somehow , according to the electronic results , to best Rawl , a four - term state legislator to win the nomination to face incumbent Republican U.S. Sen .
Jim DeMint in this November 's general election .
We 've covered details and analysis of this bizarre matter in two previous articles since last Tuesday 's election :
As you 'll see below , Rawl 's official statement today reads as an indictment of the state 's electronic voting system and , frankly , as a summary of years of The BRAD BLOG 's oft - ignored reporting ( and warnings ) about the ES&S e-voting system 's disastrously failed record ...
From Rawl 's statement [ emphasis added ] :
We have filed this protest not for my personal or political gain , but on behalf of the people of South Carolina .
There is a cloud over Tuesday ’s election .
There is a cloud over South Carolina , that affects all of our people , Democrats and Republicans , white and African - American alike .
At this point , the people of our state do not have the basic confidence that their vote will be counted .
The strange circumstances surrounding Tuesday ’s vote require a thorough investigation .
For better or worse , this protest process is the only platform currently available for that investigation .
And let me be clear : regardless of the outcome of this protest , a full and unblinking investigation of this election and the overall integrity of South Carolina ’s election system must go forward .
Whether our protest is upheld or not , I intend to bring my full energies to electoral reform well into the future .
I want to speak briefly about the bases for our protest .
First is ongoing analysis of the election returns themselves , which indicate irregularities .
Second are the many voters and poll workers who continue to contact us with their stories of extremely unusual incidents while trying to vote and administer this election .
These range from voters who repeatedly pressed the screen for me only to have the other candidate ’s name appear , to poll workers who had to change program cards multiple times , to at least one voter in the Republican primary who had the Democratic U.S. Senate race appear on her ballot .
For those who experienced problems voting , I urge you to go to our website , www.vicrawl.com and use the form there to report them .
You can also call our Election Integrity Hotline at 843-278-0510 .
Third is the well - documented unreliability and unverifiability of the voting machines used in South Carolina .
It is worth noting that these machines were purchased surplus from Louisiana after that state outlawed them .
The full details of our protest will be presented on Thursday .
For the people of South Carolina , getting to the bottom of Tuesday ’s results will build confidence , either way .
I also hope that a full and frank discussion of our voting system will result in substantial reform .
At the risk of repetition , this protest is not about me , or my personal political fortunes .
Indeed , if the protest is upheld and a new election ordered , I have not decided whether to run in it .
But , either way , I am not done with the issue of fixing our elections .
We 'll briefly hit several of those points one at a time :
" At this point , the people of our state do not have the basic confidence that their vote will be counted . "
Rawl is correct .
There is no basis for confidence in the results of the election , or any held on 100 % unverifiable Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting machines .
There exists no proof that Greene won this election .
Period .
We have asked readers --- and , more importantly , election officials , elected officials , and voting machine vendors --- for years to offer any evidence that any vote ever cast on an DRE during any election has ever been recorded as per any voter 's intent .
No such evidence has been profferred , because no such evidence exists .
These are 100 % faith - based voting systems , and we persist in using them in dozens of states across the country for reasons we are still unable to fathom .
Whether the results are actually accurate or not is beside the point .
It is strictly impossible for any citizen to know if they are or are n't .
Period .
" [ O ] ngoing analysis of the election returns themselves , which indicate irregularities . "
In each of our previous posts on this election ( here and here ) , we detailed findings from independent academic experts examining the results .
Among those findings , the brightest red-flag would be the 11 - point disparity between paper - based absentee results and Election Day touch - screen results .
According to a statement released by Rawl 's campaign last last week , " This difference is a clear contrast to the other races . "
Politico reported , for example , " In Lancaster County , Rawl won absentee ballots over Greene by a staggering 84 percent to 16 percent margin ; but Greene easily led among Election Day voters by 17 percentage points . "
Two articles from the political statistics website FiveThirtyEight.com ( first here , the here ) examined a number of independent statistical analyses of results , finding that neither mischievous Republican crossover voters , nor racial preferences ( Rawl is white and Greene is African - American , though most voters did n't know that about either candidate ) are able to fully explain the results .
Writing at FiveThirtyEight , Tom Schaller ultimately narrowed the existing possibilities for explaining the explaining the results to just two .
Scenario A : A combination of African - American voters possibly recognizing the name " Greene " , spelled with an " e " at the end , as an African - American surname and his ballot position as the first candidate in the race , combined with a low number of voters who knew of , but disapproved of Rawl .
Or Scenario B : " Somebody with access to software and machines engineered a very devious manipulation of the vote returns . "
We added " Scenario B.1 " to Schaller 's possibilities :
Out - and - out machine failure , given the documented history of such failures on these precise voting machines .
Rawl 's second listed reason for his challenge underscore that point ...
" [ V] oters and poll workers [ report ] extremely unusual incidents while trying to vote ... "
Rawl 's statement notes " voters who repeatedly pressed the screen for me only to have the other candidate ’s name appear " and ( extremely disturbing ) " poll workers who had to change program cards multiple times " , as well as " at least one voter in the Republican primary who had the Democratic U.S. Senate race appear on her ballot . "
Every single one of the incidents mentioned above has occurred time and again across the United States over the last several election cycles and has generally been ignored by both election officials and candidates .
The most well - known example is the 2006 U.S.
House special election in Florida 's 13th Congressional district , where some 18,000 votes disappeared entirely on ES&S iVotronic touch - screen machines in Democratic candidate Christine Jennings stronghold county of Sarasota .
Despite the extraordinary and still - unexplained undervote rate , Republican Vern Buchanan was announced the winner by just 369 votes .
In that race , scores of voters and poll workers had come forward , on Election Day , to report votes flipping from one candidate to another , as well as the inability to select Jennings at all .
Even the wife of Buchanan had reported difficulties in selecting her husband on the touch - screen " ballot " .
Though neither a state - sponsored investigation nor an investigation by the U.S. GAO was able to find a certain explanation for what happened , Democrats in the U.S. House ultimately dismissed Jennings challenge to the race under the Federal Contested Elections Act .
Nonetheless , FL's then incoming Republican Gov. Charlie Crist and FL's Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler worked together after the incident to pass a bill in the state legislature which largely outlawed the use of touch - screen voting systems entirely in the Sunshine State .
That , and other states , such as Ohio and Colorado , who also commissioned reports which found the ES&S systems to be highly error - prone and easily manipulated , did not dissuade their use in South Carolina .
Nor did a county - wide failure of the machines in SC's 2008 Republican primary .
Nor even the federal conviction of 6 high - ranking election officials --- including the County Clerk , an Circuit Court Judge and the County Superintendent --- earlier this year , in March , after it had been found that they had actually changed the votes of voters on the ES&S touch - screen systems themselves after voters left the booth in 2006 .
As to Rawl 's statement concerning " poll workers who had to change program cards multiple times , " The BRAD BLOG has reported time and again over the years about this insane and disturbing practice .
We even contributed a full chapter to Sonoma State University 's book Censored 2010 : The Top 25 Censored Stories of 2008 - 09 detailing the instances in which votes were reported as flipping on ES&S voting systems in 2008 and election officials who accessed the sensitive memory cards during the election in order to attempt to " recalibrate " them .
That problem has occurred now , year after year --- even as recently as Arkansas ' May 18th Arkansas general primary , as we reported at the time , as testified to in affidavit by a Circuit Court Judge and one of his clerks .
When these systems are in " election mode " , they are extremely vulnerable to tampering and there is no reason that any official , or voting machine company employee should ever be able to access those cards at that time .
The proper solution would be to pull such problem machines from use , so they can be examined later .
That very rarely happens , however , since the precincts which rely on these machines rarely have enough paper ballots available to make up for the difference , or proper procedures in place to assure the secure chain - of - custody of such ballots .
" At least one voter in the Republican primary who had the Democratic U.S. Senate race appear on her ballot . "
Electronic voting systems are notorious for presenting the wrong ballots to voters .
Often , the voter has no idea .
This has now happened twice , even to us , on ES&S electronic voting systems .
In 2008 's statewide primary in CA , the system in use in Los Angeles County --- which , unlike the one used in SC , actually prints out an inked - in paper ballot representing voter preferences --- mis-printed 4 out of 12 of our own votes .
Happily , we noticed the failure before officially casting the ballot .
Last week , in the CA 's primary , the same system again failed , as two different machines were unable to offer us the correct ballot to vote on .
The system repeated offered a ballot for a precinct , and then a party , that we should n't have been voting in .
Once again , following the ES&S voting machine failure , we were allowed to vote on a paper ballot , which is a right for California voters .
" [ W ] ell - documented unreliability and unverifiability of the voting machines used in South Carolina . "
The points detailed above underscore Rawl 's point here , but his quote is worth noting again --- particularly the part about the machines " unverifiability " .
We have opined , year after year after year , that , in the end , it does n't actually matter whether these systems report accurate results or not .
The bottom line is that there is no way for voters to know that they did .
That alone is a grave threat to democracy , and one of the reasons why we continue to hear of more and more such questions about results , in each and every election .
At this hour , we do not know whether the SC Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate was gamed or whether machine malfunction might explain the results .
We also do not know that it was legitimately counted as per the voters ' intent .
We are seeking proof , not speculation , to support either possibility .
As Rawl correctly notes , " There is a cloud over South Carolina , that affects all of our people , Democrats and Republicans , white and African - American alike . "
That applies to the cloud over virtually every election held in the United States on machines made by private companies , which use concealed voting counting to report the results of elections .
The same applies even to paper - based elections when the same easily - manipulated , oft - failed electronic tabulators are used to tally them .
We applaud Rawl for his courageous --- and patriotic --- position , vowing " a full and unblinking investigation " and his stated intent to bring his " full energies to electoral reform well into the future . "
To that end , VelvetRevolution.us ( an organization co-founded by The BRAD BLOG , in part , to demand electoral reform following years of our reportage on these matters ) has hosted a StandingForVoters.org campaign , in support of candidates of any party who vow not to concede their election until all votes are counted , and counted both accurately and transparently .
More recently , VR has launched a ProtectOurElections.org campaign , seeking to urge Congress to pass substantive election reform .
Unfortunately , there are currently no bills pending in Congress that would outlaw concealed voting counting , or even the use of proprietary " trade secret " software made by private companies in our public elections , which have now been completely outsourced to such un-overseeable private vendors .
Over the weekend we attempted to contact the Rawl campaign with a number of questions about their current investigation , and to offer whatever advice and consultation we could .
They have yet to return our calls or email .
In his statement today , Rawl promised that " the full details of our protest will be presented on Thursday . "

UPDATE 4:13 pm PT : Garance Franke - Ruta's Washington
Post blog coverage today explains the next steps in the process for the formal complaint , as filed today by Rawl , and highlights one absolute absurdity in this entire fine mess ...
Primary elections in South Carolina are administered by the political parties , not the state .
The complaint now goes to the 92 - member South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee , which will consider the protest at a public hearing Thursday in Columbia at which Rawl 's attorney , F. Truett Nettles II of Charleston , will present the campaign 's case .
Greene or a representative for him may also attend and present evidence , though he is under no obligation to do so .
It is unclear how many members of the executive body will attend and vote on whether to dismiss Rawl 's case , overturn the election or call for a new one , and there is no quorum number the body must reach before proceeding .
The burden of proof at the hearing will be on Rawl .
That last point , of course , underscores the absurdity of the bulk of U.S. elections .
The proof will be on Rawl to show that the election , held on unverifiable voting machines ( unverifiable either way ! ) , was inaccurate .
In the meantime , as we 've said previously , we are open to anybody 's PROOF that the election results , as reported , actually are accurate --- any hard evidence that Greene actually won and Rawl lost .
Yet , as election officials and supporters of electronic voting certainly know , there is no such proof .
Why the burden should be on Rawl to prove a negative , rather than for election officials to prove that their system reported voter 's intentions accurately , is just one of the continuing absurdities in the woeful , off - the - rails electoral systems we now use in this country .

Vernon , Connecticut ( CNN ) --
A prominent member of the Pakistani - American community in Connecticut said Thursday that a suspect in last week 's Times Square bombing kept a low profile but appeared to have become more religious over the past year .
" [ Faisal Shahzad ] was somebody who was under the radar ; he was never a part of our community , never a part of our events or meetings , " said Dr. Saud Anwar , founder and past president of the Pakistani American Association of Connecticut .
After news broke about suspect Shahzad , the pulmonologist sent e-mails to others in the community to dredge up what he could about him
" As a physician , I look at it as a disease , " Anwar said of Shahzad 's apparent radical turn .
" I try to understand what led to the disease ... how we can prevent a disease like this . "
Anwar said his e-mails turned up a man who studied with Shahzad at the University of Bridgeport and had stayed in touch with him since then .
That man does not want to be identified publicly .
" He recalled him as a regular individual , outgoing , interacting with people , interested to learn , not isolated , " Anwar said .
But , in the past year or so , " he felt there was a change in his personality , " Anwar said , explaining that Shahzad appeared to become introverted , asocial and " a little bit more religious . "
Anwar added , " There was a little anger in there .
[ The friend ] felt [ Shahzad ] was looking at things as true black and white . "
Returning to his disease analogy , the physician said that after Shahzad returned from Pakistan early this year , " the disease became a little bit more progressive , much stronger . "
Shahzad told his friend that he was looking for work in the Middle East " because he was having challenges with his job over here , " Anwar said .
" He just mentioned that he was seeking something .
I do n't know if he found anything or not , " Anwar said .
This week , Sholom Rubashkin , who was the vice - president of what was once the largest kosher meat processing supplier in the world , was sentenced to 27 years federal prison for “ financial fraud . ”
Prosecutors had asked for 25 years , and this is essentially a life sentence for Rubashkin , who is 51 .
However , a lot of other people , including a number of former U.S. attorneys general , called for leniency and are outraged by this sentence that was motivated more by politics and not by the law .
I will go against all of them .
Sholom Rubashkin , in my view , does not need " leniency . "
He needs to be freed , period , for the man is not a criminal , which is more than I can say for the people who hounded and prosecuted him and destroyed his business , Glatt kosher Agriprocessors of Postville , Iowa .
Let me begin .
Rubashkin is a Hasidic Jew , his family having fled the U.S.S.R. after the Nazi invasion .
They came to the United States and set up a butcher shop in New York City .
After marriage in 1989 , he and his new bride moved to Atlanta on shlihut to do kiruv ( Jewish outreach ) .
That same year , Rubashkin ’s father started a kosher meat processing business in Postville to better enable Jews living outside of main Jewish centers to be able to obtain kosher meat .
Before Glatt kosher Agriprocessors began to expand its business , Jewish families could only purchase kosher meat from small butchers and specialty stores that catered to Jews .
This made things more difficult for Jewish families who did not leave near these kinds of stores , but by expanding the amount of kosher meat for sale , the firm was able to bring kosher meat to regular grocery stores , which was not a small development for Jewish families .
Soon , Rubashkin joined his father ’s company and the family moved to Postville .
As the Jewish Daily Forward declared ( more about the Forward later ) , the Rubashkins literally changed how Jewish people in the United States eat .
Like many others who practice Hasidism , the Rubashkins were generous to people in the community , both Jews and non-Jews , and generated a lot of good will as a major employer in that area .
Unfortunately , being successful in the United States these days does not garner praise ; it makes one a target of people who specialize in promoting strife and envy .
In this Age of Envy and dominance by the state , it seems that the only entrepreneurship that is acceptable is political entrepreneurship , and the Rubashkins did not fall into that category .
( Public Choice economists call such political entrepreneurship " rent seeking . " )
The Rubashkins made their living from processing meat , and that meant slaughtering animals according to Jewish dietary laws that are thousands of years old , and that attracted the attention of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
First , PETA charged in magazine articles that the Rubashkin plant was a veritable house of horrors , something out of an Upton Sinclair novel .
( Notice , I say that The Jungle is a novel , since it was written as socialist propaganda and had as much veracity as did PETA ’s charges . )
The organization charged that the place was a filthy hellhole with unsanitary ( at best ) facilities where animals were tortured and worse , and filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Second , while it was clear that PETA ’s charges were false , nonetheless the organization managed to put the kosher meat facility in the public eye , thus making it a bigger target for federal authorities .
The next organization to go after Glatt kosher Agriprocessors was the United Food and Commercial Workers Union , which had been unsuccessful in organizing the plant .
Part of the problem was its workforce , and anyone who has been near a meat or chicken processing plant will know that a lot of immigrants from Mexico and Central America work there , as well as Asian immigrants .
Work in these plants is hard and low - paying , but low - skilled workers nonetheless are able to band together and make enough money to live in the United States and send money back home to relatives .
However , they clearly were not candidates for union membership , which not only enraged the union leadership , but also caught the attention of liberal Jewish groups that do n’t much care for the ultra- orthodox Hasidim , including the publishers of the Jewish Daily Forward .
The Forward ran a number of articles ( sourced by the UFCW , of course ) that claimed Rubashkin was hiring not only illegal immigrants , but also was exploiting child labor .
At the same time , political conservatives such as Wesley Pruden of the Washington Times , were mounting a huge campaign against illegal immigration , and the Bush administration decided to make an example out of Agriprocessors and staged an extremely public raid on the facilities in 2008 .
Keep in mind that the government went full - scale paramilitary on its raid , complete with a Blackhawk helicopter , and heavily - armed police carrying submachine guns and other weapons .
The raid was no surprise ; in fact , days earlier , Rubashkin knew the raid was coming and personally contacted the federal authorities and promised to cooperate with them .
Not surprisingly , the Bush administration did things its way , and its way was to be as brutal as possible .
More than 300 workers were rounded up , denied legal representation , and forced to plead guilty to a number of charges .
They were imprisoned for up to five months , and then deported .
The feds then seized all of the company ’s records and went on a fishing expedition .
Ultimately , the government charged Rubashkin with financial fraud , claiming that the company had faked invoices and other financial documents in order to inflate its financial assets in order to qualify for larger loan amounts from First Bank of St. Louis .
In fact , Rubashkin ’s firm had overstated its revenues , but that is much more common than one might think and generally does not land one in a criminal trial .
I will give an example that most readers can understand , a personal example .
Last year , we refinanced our mortgage , and an appraiser came to our house to see if we would qualify for the best deals .
There was a " magic " number for our house ’s value , and he asked me at least twice if I believed that our place qualified .
My answer always was the same : " I have no idea .
That is up to you . "
Now , I was hoping that he would see to it that our house met the so - called value threshold , although I had serious doubts that we actually could sell our house on the open market at that price , and I was not going to say anything that legally could get me into trouble later on .
In fact , during the refinancing boom of the last decade , appraisers generally overstated the market value of houses so that the owners or perspective buyers could qualify for certain loans .
Was this fraud ?
Legally , it was .
How far did the fraud go , and who perpetrated it ?
It would determine who the feds wished to target before that decision could be made .
For example , if the feds wished to crucify the homeowner , they can get the appraiser to testify and the homeowner lied to them , and , no doubt , the bankers would testify that they never would have approved the jumbo - sized loan had not the homeowner or perspective buyer defrauded them .
That would be a lie , but federal prosecutors regularly suborn perjury , something I have documented in dozens of articles over the years .
For that matter , if the feds wished to nail the bankers or the appraisers , they would " convince " the others in that chain to testify to whatever would be the most damning testimony .
It would not matter as to what really happened , as federal prosecutors famously create their own reality , or at least a reality that the courts , the political classes , and the media will swallow .
In the case of Agriprocessors , the loan was a revolving $ 35 million payout that enabled the company to keep a steady cash flow , meet payroll , and pay its bills .
The firm was not arrears in payment , and all indications were that the company would be able to meet its obligations to the bank .
Because the federal courts have eviscerated the ancient doctrine of mens rea , which means that prosecutors needed to prove that a person charged intended to commit a crime , intent to defraud no longer matters .
In fact , one can argue that Agriprocessors did not " defraud " First Bank at all , and there are indications that the bank knew that Agriprocessors was overstating its revenues and underestimating its costs ( something the federal government does every year , but never results in anyone ’s arrest ) , but did not care because its good customer paid its bills on time .
The company was profitable , and so was the bank .
That was not all , according to the feds .
Apparently , certain suppliers of cattle and other things are required by a little - known ( and almost never enforced ) law from the 1920s to be paid within 24 hours .
No one had complained about the late payments , to my knowledge ; instead , it was yet another of those " legal technicalities " that federal prosecutors use when they want to convict someone on something .
I wo n’t dwell on Sholom Rubashkin ’s trial , except to say that there were some highly - prejudicial aspects that should be mentioned .
Certainly , Hasidim are to people in Iowa what Old Order Amish might be to people from New York City : alien creatures from outer space .
Hasidic
Jews live a separate life , although it is clear to many people in Postville , Rubashkin , his family , and his company were heroes and important to the community and its well - being .
None of that mattered to the jury located in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , where the trial was held , and federal jurors quickly returned guilty verdicts .
According to the New York Times , the damning testimony came when …
Former Agriprocessors employees testified that Mr. Rubashkin had personally directed them to create false invoices to show First Bank , which is based in St. Louis , that the plant had more money flowing in than it really did .
Knowing how federal prosecutors operate , I have no idea if any of those witnesses told the truth .
Federal prosecutors are well - known for suborning perjury and are especially known to do it in high - profile cases , such as this one .
One can be sure that the people who testified were told that if they did not testify according to a certain script , then the feds would levy fraud charges against them , too .
( If the readers wishes to gain some insight into how federal prosecutors lie in order to gain testimony they want , read this link to what the feds did in the trial of Jeffrey Skilling of Enron .
Because no federal prosecutor ever has to worry about being charged with suborning perjury , one can bet that this kind of behavior is the norm , not the exception , among U.S. attorneys . )
On another front , the State of Iowa originally charged Rubashkin with more than 9,000 counts of child labor law violations and he recently stood trial .
Even after prosecutors amended the charges to just 83 , they could not win a single conviction .
( While state courts are known to be corrupt , unlike the federal courts , evidence generally matters in state trials . )
Unfortunately , there is more .
After the feds originally charged Rubashkin with fraud charges , the prosecutors argued that he was a " flight risk " and should be imprisoned .
Their reasoning ?
Rubashkin is a Jew and the nation of Israel grants expedited citizenship to Jews around the world .
They further stretched the story by pointing out that Rubashkin kept about $ 20,000 in cash , as well as his passports and other documents in a lockbox in his home .
( There are two aspects to that story .
First , most of us keep some cash and papers in lockboxes , and we are among that " criminal " crowd that likes to keep these things in a single place just in case we need them .
Second , one of the Rubashkin children is autistic , and the family knew they needed to keep certain papers secure in a place where that child would not be able to find and disturb or scatter them , not realizing what they were . )
Obviously , this is something that would affect literally every Jew charged with a crime , given that the vast majority of them are considered to be " citizens " of Israel , even if very , very few of them actually would do such a thing .
( For that matter , anyone with a passport and cash would be considered a “ flight risk ” to somewhere , given those standards . )
There is another , more troubling , aspect of this case to me , and it goes to the heart of federal criminal law and how it is enforced .
Bernie Madoff was guilty of fraud ; he ran a Ponzi scheme , and no Ponzi scheme — including those run by the government — can survive over time .
Madoff knew that sooner or later , his investors would lose their money , and that is exactly what happened .
Fraud goes to intent .
One defrauds someone else if one purposely charts a course of action that will negatively affect the other party , while promising to give that party positive results .
For example , if I borrow money in order to start a business , but then use those funds instead for a Caribbean cruise , that is fraud .
However , Sholom Rubashkin intended to pay back his loans , as he always had done , and he intended his business to continue to provide kosher meat to people who wanted to buy it .
He had no plans to abscond with the money he borrowed , with people showing up to work one day and finding the place padlocked and Rubashkin and his family on a secret cruise to Israel .
There was no fraud in the historic sense of the word .
If there was misrepresentation of his funds , that was a civil and contractual matter between Agriprocessors and First Bank , and , let ’s face it , had the feds not invaded his plant and shut down the operation , Agriprocessors still would be in operation today and most of us never would have heard of Sholom Rubashkin .
To understand federal criminal law today , one must remember that it is something far removed from the roots of what criminal law used to be in the United States .
In the past , a crime designated real harm done by one party to another , whether it was robbery , murder , assault , rape or something in which it was obvious that one party clearly injured another .
Today , however , most federal criminal law falls into the " public welfare " category , in which a person charged has failed to perform a certain so - called public duty , or has failed to follow a set of rules which often are arbitrarily set up and even more arbitrarily administered .
Not surprisingly , we have seen federal criminal law put to an increasing number of political applications .
The legal language might be similar to what it was in the past , but now it is describing certain things that might have political meaning , but describe simple disobedience from the federally - prescribed way of doing things .
The irony is that the feds are calling this a huge " fraud , " but the only people really being defrauded are the victims of this federal assault .
Let us look at the real damage that the feds have inflicted upon people :
A thriving business has been shut down , and hundreds of people now are out of work , and a town is reeling economically and financially ;
A woman will be deprived of her husband for many years , and a number of children will not have a father ;
First Bank was heavily damaged by this action in a way that never would have been the case had the feds not decided to " rescue " the bank from its " fraudulent client " ;
Kosher meat is more expensive and much less available than it was before the government destroyed Agriprocessors .
No doubt , federal authorities consider this whole affair to be a great victory , and they are telling the rest of us how they are protecting us from fraudsters and exploiters .
In truth , the real fraudsters and exploiters here are the federal agencies that took part in this action , and the various groups that were cheerleaders for it .
Literally , thousands of people were harmed by what the government did .
However , no one from the federal government lost a dime .

The construction of the Sofia Metro has revealed more of the archaeological heritage of the Bulgarian capital .

A large ancient building located under the St. Nedelya Cathedral in downtown Sofia might turn out to be a palace of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great , according to Bulgarian archaeologists .
The building might also turn out to be the ancient thermae , or public baths of the ancient Roman city of Serdica , today ’s Sofia , according to architect Konstantin Peev , head of the EKSA company , which is helping the Sofia Municipality with the excavation and restoration of the archaeological heritage of the Bulgarian capital .
The excavations at the Sofia Largo and the so called Metro Station 2 - 8 next to the Tzum retail store were made necessary by the construction of the second line of the Sofia Metro .
According to Peev , the bouleuterion of the city of Serdica was located under the northwestern corner of today ’s building of the Sheraton Sofia Hotel Balkan .
The bouleuterion was a small amphitheater - like building which housed the council of the citizens in the Antiquity period .
The Serdica bouleuterion had a diameter of about 20 meters .
Peev also said that the archeaological excavations in the spring of 2010 have so far revealed a number of Roman insula , i.e. homes closed off among four streets .
He pointed out that the archaeologists have revealed the main streets of the Roman city of Serdica – the main street , decumanus maximus , connecting the Eastern and Western Gates , was wide about 7 - 8 meters and paved with huge pave stones .
The cardo , the secondary street , went in the north - south direction .
Architect Peev stated that the municipality and the Culture Ministry were currently considering various options for conserving and displaying the archeaological heritage of Sofia .
OTTAWA — A central piece of the tough - on - crime agenda championed by the Conservative government is going to cost taxpayers more than a billion dollars a year to roll out , says a report from the parliamentary budget watchdog .
Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin
Page released a scathing report Tuesday morning that examined the economic impact of implementing the Truth in Sentencing Act , which limits the amount of time inmates can get for time served while in custody awaiting a trial and verdict .
The report found the increased number of inmates the new legislation will deliver to federal correctional institutions — and the need to build new and bigger prisons to house them all — will cost an additional $ 618 million annually in operational and maintenance costs , and another $ 1.8 billion over five years in construction costs .
The report says changing the law will lengthen the average prison stay for an inmate by about 159 days , which would bring the total amount of time in physical custody from 563 days to just under two years .
Longer stays mean there will be an average of 17,058 inmates at any given time compared to an average head count of 13,304 inmates in fiscal 2007 / 2008 , which is the year Page used as a baseline for his study .
The report estimates that would require an additional 4,189 cells , which means an average of $ 363 million annually over the next five years to expand existing facilities and build new ones .
Public Safety Minister Vic
Toews disputed the figures , standing by his earlier claim that officials at Correctional Services Canada told him the initiative would cost $ 2 billion over five years — which is nonetheless higher than the $ 90 million price tag he originally disclosed .
Toews also said the federal government had no plans to build new facilities but would construct new cells inside existing buildings .
Page said he received no significant co-operation from Correctional Services Canada since he began looking into the impact of a suite of Conservative law - and - order bills at the request of Liberal MP Mark Holland ( Ajax - Pickering ) last October .
“ There was just no disclosure and I think as a legislative budget officer we want to make sure that we do n’t let these things slip by that can generate significant cost pressures going forward , ” said Page , who used a probabilistic study and numbers from 2007 / 08 because the government did not share its methodology .
Page also noted that provinces and territories are expected to have to shell out another $ 5 billion to $ 8 billion over the next half decade to handle the increased inflow .
“ If we ’re changing the Criminal Code , it ’s not just for the federal government , ” Page said .
“ It actually has a huge operational and cost impact on the provinces and territories . ”
Laura Blondeau , a spokeswoman for Ontario Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services Rick Bartolucci , said he looks forward to reviewing the report but does not want his province to pick up the tab for a federally led initiative .
Holland called on the government to come forward with the numbers for the rest of its crime and punishment bills for Page to examine and feared the final result would be astronomical .

“ If all of them are implemented , this will bankrupt Canada , ” Holland said .
“ We ’re talking about tens of billions of dollars at a time when we ’re already running a $ 50 billion deficit .
“ We ’d have to cannibalize the health , education , military departments just to pay for all these new prisons and what is so offensive about it is that it was tried in the United States , it was tried in the United Kingdom and these policies were a complete failure . ”

There ’s so much stupid in this ad I can’t even know where to begin criticizing it , so first let me link some responsible rat breeders ( yes , they exist ) who would never , ever , ever dream of finding adopters through Craigslist .
Responsible Rat Breeder 1
Responsible Rat Breeder 2
Notice something those sites have in common ?
It ’s called a “ waiting list , ” and it ’s what responsible breeders keep so that they do n’t have to look for homes for babies on the most notoriously awful pet sales / adoption website in the country .
But then again , this guy is n’t responsible .
Now , none of these errors would be anything to hoot and holler about if they came from a pet owner seeking a good home for rats he or she could no longer keep .
But this Bill character is setting himself up as a breeder who is a source for premium , fantastical , highly in demand ( but not enough so for a BLOODY GOLDARN WAITING LIST ) rats .
So , let ’s pick apart his ad for reasons this dumbass should n’t be breeding at all , shall we ?
1 . “ We have the most incredible Black Rat called the Black Phantom . ”
There is no such thing as a Black Phantom Rat .
These are the known and repeatable rat colors that exist .
“ New ” colors must go through an approval process with a show organization .
See , the phenotype of a rat ( what you see when you look at it ) results from its genotype ( the genes creating that appearance ) , and new color genes just do n’t spring up all over the place .
This here is the supposed black phantom , which in reality is just a solid black rat .
Nothing special about it whatsoever :
( this is a long one , so you ’re going to have to click through to read the whole thing ! )

AKA , stupidest rat breeder ever . ’
​ It ’s something most seasoned pot smokers already know , but still it ’s nice to get more scientific confirmation : Marijuana does n’t make you wreck your car .
Journal of Psychoactive Drugs .
Subjects show almost identical driving skills just before and just after smoking marijuana , according to a study published in the March issue of the
​ Investigators from Hartford Hospital in Connecticut and the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine measured the simulated driving performance of 85 people in a double - blind , placebo controlled trial .
Volunteers responded to various simulated events associated with auto crash risk , such as avoiding a driver who was entering an intersection illegally , deciding to stop or go through a changing traffic light , responding to the presence of emergency vehicles , avoiding colliding with a dog who entered into traffic , and maintaining safe driving during a secondary ( in - the - car ) sound distraction .
Test subjects performed the tests sober , and then again 30 minutes after smoking a joint containing either 2.9 percent THC or a placebo joint with no THC .
The volunteers performed virtually the same after smoking marijuana as they did sober and / or after smoking bunk pot .
“ No differences were found during the baseline driving segment ( and the ) collision avoidance scenarios , ” the scientists reported .
One reason no increase in accidents is associated with marijuana may be the well known “ little old lady ” syndrome , in which pot -smoking drivers slow down and drive more cautiously to compensate for any slight impairment that may occur .
“ Participants receiving active marijuana decreased their speed more so than those receiving placebo cigarette during ( the ) distracted section of the drive , ” the study reported .
Authors suggested that test subjects ’ reduction in speed on this task could mean that they were compensating for perceived impairment .
“ No other changes in driving performance were found , ” researchers concluded .
A 2008 driving simulator study published in the scientific journal Accident , Analysis and Prevention also found that drivers who smoked marijuana were more likely to decrease their driving speed .
“ Average speed was the most sensitive driving performance variable affected by both THC and alcohol but with an opposite effect , ” investigators reported .
“ Smoking THC cigarettes caused drivers to drive slower in a dose - dependent manner , while alcohol caused driers to drive significantly faster than in ‘ control ’ conditions . ”
The Way We Live Now : totally misunderstanding the situation .
It says here that some of you youngsters remain optimistic about your chances out there ?
Allow us to correct your mistaken idealistic perceptions .
So , according to these here figures , " Of all age groups , Americans 18 to 29 were most likely to say they believed their financial circumstances would improve over the next year . "
That 's funny , because it's my understanding that the young people are the ones who have n't earned any money yet .
A full half of the nation 's workforce has had their employment directly negatively affected by this financial collapse .
The young half , for the most part !
And it 's not like they 're going to get rich next year — this recovery is going to be slowwwwwwwww .
With poor economic comprehension like that , our young folks will never get decent jobs .
I mean , if they were German , sure ; Germans can't help but to get jobs .
But Americans ?
I just can't see why anyone would take a chance on them .
Growing up to be a drunk oil trader like the Brits would actually be aspirational , because it would mean that they 'd somehow been hired as an oil trader in the first place .
More likely , American kids will just remain huddled around the mailbox , praying their voodoo prayers for the dwindling government stimulus money , growing ever more fearful .
Oh you know what they might could do though ?
Line sitter .
Sit in line for tickets and things like that .
Try it , kids .
It 's your only hope .

They are left with whale poo .
From news24.com
Pretoria – Nearly 500 African penguins died in 24 - hours because of cold and wet weather at Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape , SA National Parks ( SanParks ) said on Tuesday .
SanParks spokesperson Megan Taplin said : “ The chicks , aged between a few weeks and two months , are covered only with down feathers .
They succumbed to the cold and wet weather that has hit Bird Island . ”
It was common for a third of a penguin population ’s chicks to die in such weather conditions , she said .
However , with only 700 breeding pairs of African penguins on Bird Island , the death of over half the populations ’ chicks presents an “ added threat ” to the dwindling numbers of penguins .
The African penguin was recently reclassified as an endangered species because of its declining population across South Africa .

RECIPES Flour Tortillas
The following is my favorite recipe , with some variations , for flour tortillas .
If you wish to learn more about the art of preparing flour tortillas , perhaps with an eye to creating your own Best Flour Tortilla recipe , please go to my blog on the subject .
Introduction
The following recipe is meant to serve as a standard from which readers are encouraged to experiment based on their own taste and dietary requirements , particularly in terms of the type and amount of fat .
Some recommended adaptaions follow the recipe .
Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup cake flour
½ teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons good quality lard or other fat ( see above )
2/3 cup water
Directions
1 . Make the dough .
Mix the flours and salt , either in a bowl or in a food processor fitted with the steel blade .
Heat the water and lard or other fat over low heat or in a microwave until it has melted .
Gradually stir the liquid into the flour and form into a dough by hand , or pour into the processor with the motor running .
The result should be a dough that is neither wet nor dry and crumbly , but if you must err do so on the side of leaving the dough a little too damp .
If it seems much too wet add a little more flour ; if it is too dry add a little more water .
Knead the dough very briefly , then allow it to rest for 1 hour .
Divide it into 14 pieces .
Roll the pieces of dough into little balls between the palms of your hands , then cover them with a slightly damp towel , and allow them to rest for at least 15 minutes , and up to an hour and a half .
This will allow the gluten to relax and make them easier to shape .
2 . Form the tortillas .
With a rolling pin , roll the dough into rounds 6 ½ to 7 ½ inches in diameter .
3 . Cook the tortillas .
Heat a large , heavy skillet or griddle over medium heat .
Since stove settings vary you will have to experiment to find the best heat for your particular situation .
( If you have a laser thermometer , I have found the ideal temperature to be 425 - 475 degrees ) .
When the skillet or griddle has preheated , place one of the rolled dough pieces on it .
Within about 20 - 30 seconds it should start to bubble and some little brown spots begin to form on the bottom .
Flip the tortilla over and cook another 20 - 30 seconds .
By this time it should start to puff a little more , and the other side will develop light brown spots .
Flip the tortilla again at which time it should immediately begin to puff , sometimes into a large , nearly round ball .
You can encourage the tortilla to puff by lightly passing a spatula over the top surface of the tortilla , called " tickling " it , while it is cooking
When the tortilla has fully expanded , remove it from the heat and place it in a tortilla warmer or wrap it in a thick towel .
As you proceed , adjust the heat based on the above description .
For example , reduce the heat if after about 20 - 30 seconds the bottom of the tortilla is beginning to char , or raise it if nothing much has happened .
Repeat the process for the remaining tortillas .
Makes 14 tortillas
Adaptations
Northern Mexican - style flour tortillas
To make authentic , northern Mexican flour tortillas , use 4 tablespoons lard or rendered beef fat instead of three .
Tex - Mex tortillas
To make thicker , Tex - Mex style tortillas , add ½ teaspoon baking powder with the flour and salt , divide the dough into 10 pieces , and roll them to a diameter of 6 ½ to 7 ½ inches .
Very thin flour tortillas
Divide the dough into 16 pieces and roll to 7 ½ inches .
Tortillas for burritos or chimichangas
To make tortillas for burritos or chimichangas , divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll them to a diameter of about 9 inches .
This makes a fairly small burrito , but this is about the maximum size of home griddles and skillets .
If your equipment permits larger sizes , divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll out to about 12 inches .
Extra fatty , silky - smooth tortillas
For this adaption , simply add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the Northern Mexican alternative above .
Flour tortillas with extra rich flavor
Substitute butter for ½ or all the lard in the recipe .
Low fat flour tortillas
For those interested in making decent flour tortillas with a minimum of fat , prepare the basic recipe with 1 tablespoon of canola or olive oil .
Mix the oil with very warm tap water before adding it to the flour .
The result is a very soft tortilla with a nice , light texture , and low fat content .
The Fans May Be Paid Chinese Actors
British announcers during yesterday 's match speculate on the rumor that the North Koreans were n't " fans " in the sense that that word is normally used .
The LA Times has done some reporting that indicates the situation may be slightly more complex than that , but something is obviously not quite right here :
" Shortly before Tuesday 's game started , a five - row block of seats on the second level at Ellis Park Stadium filled up with more than 40 men and a woman , all dressed in identical red shirts , jackets and scarves , wearing identical red caps and waving small North Korean flags .
...
Kim Yong Chon , 43 , one of the North Korean fans , said the group , which numbered 300 , was not Chinese , but he admitted they had been carefully recruited by the North Korean government to make the trip ...
They sang the North Korean national anthem loudly but sat passively , almost expressionless , through most of the game , with one man sucking on a beer ... "
The only light that the understandably media - shy North Korean coach has been able to shed on the broader situation here is that North Korea 's performance " will bring great happiness to our Dear Leader . "
Which is all that really matters in the end .
A new beta build of VirtualBox , Sun ’s Oracle ’s free x86 virtualization software , makes it possible to run Mac OS X as a guest operating system … no shenanigans or flaming hoops to jump through , just pop in the $ 30 retail Snow Leopard upgrade disc and go .
This had previously only been possible with some awkward Hackintosh - style maneuvering , or using recent editions of commercial virtualization products .
At this early stage , performance is fairly sluggish , the screen size is fixed and there ’s no sound support , but the OS otherwise appears to run feature - complete ( including networking and USB ) .
Hopefully future builds will ramp up to the level of functionality and performance that VirtualBox provides for other guest operating systems .
Installation tip : when you come to the step prompting for a target disk for installation ( which will likely show no available volumes ) , run Disk Utility from the “ Utilities ” menu , format the virtual disk image you created when setting up the VM ( Mac OS Extended , Journaled ) , then exit Disk Utility to return to the OS X installer .
You can then select the newly - formatted virtual disk and proceed with installation .
COLUMBIA , Mo. 
When Allison Frisch goes shopping this summer for furnishings to decorate her freshman dorm room at Stephens College , she will be looking for a comforter for herself  and a matching doggie bed for her roommate .
That is because Ms. Frisch will be sharing her room with Taffy , her 10 - year - old Shetland sheepdog .
And Stephens , a women ’s college founded here in 1833 , says it is glad to have them both .
Ms. Frisch is one of 30 incoming freshmen at Stephens who have asked to bring a family pet to campus when they arrive this fall .
That represents an increase of 20 over last year ’s freshman class  so many that the college is renovating a dormitory for the students and their companions , most of them dogs and cats .
The dorm , dubbed Pet Central , will have a makeshift kennel on the first floor , staffed by work - study students who will offer temporary boarding and perhaps a bath .
With these efforts , Stephens is hoping to smooth the transition of some students who may be so anxious about leaving home or adjusting to college life that a stuffed animal will not be of sufficient comfort .
They want the real thing .
Years ago , Floridian inventor Michael Powell pitched Home Depot a device that would keep its employees ' fingers safe when cutting wood for customers .
It worked so well that they stole his idea .
Now Powell 's getting sweet , $ 25 million justice .

Before Michael Powell came along , Home Depot employees were slicing off fingers left and right , resulting in nearly $ 1 million a year in worker 's compensation claims .
But Powell devised a simple guard for protecting workers ' digits and let the company test it out in eight stores in the area .
The trial was a huge success — and cut worker 's compensation claims down to $ 7000 the following year — but instead of ponying up Powell 's proposed $ 2000 per device , Home Depot just went ahead and fabricated copies of the saw guards without Powell 's consent .
According to court documents , when Powell 's claim to the invention was brought up in a meeting , one Home Depot executive responded , " Fuck Michael Powell .
Let him sue us . "
Well , hey , Powell did just that , and after a series of courtroom victories , he 's now looking to collect some $ 25 million from the company .

Handing down the latest ruling , a district judge said :
Home Depot knew exactly what it was doing .
They simply pushed Mr. Powell away and they did it totally and completely for their own economic benefit .

A small California biotech company , Epicyte , in 2001 announced the development of genetically engineered corn which contained a spermicide which made the semen of men who ate it sterile .
and other news
A small California biotech company , Epicyte , in 2001 announced the development of genetically engineered corn which contained a spermicide which made the semen of men who ate it sterile .
At the time Epicyte had a joint venture agreement to spread its technology with DuPont and Syngenta , two of the sponsors of the Svalbard Doomsday Seed Vault .
Epicyte was since acquired by a North Carolina biotech company .
Astonishing to learn was that Epicyte had developed its spermicidal GMO corn with research funds from the US Department of Agriculture , the same USDA which , despite worldwide opposition , continued to finance the development of Terminator technology , now held by Monsanto .
In the 1990 ’s the UN ’s World Health Organization launched a campaign to vaccinate millions of women in Nicaragua , Mexico and the Philippines between the ages of 15 and 45 , allegedly against Tentanus , a sickness arising from such things as stepping on a rusty nail .
The vaccine was not given to men or boys , despite the fact they are presumably equally liable to step on rusty nails as women .
Because of that curious anomaly , Comite Pro Vida de Mexico , a Roman Catholic lay organization became suspicious and had vaccine samples tested .
The tests revealed that the Tetanus vaccine being spread by the WHO only to women of child - bearing age contained human Chorionic Gonadotrophin or hCG , a natural hormone which when combined with a tetanus toxoid carrier stimulated antibodies rendering a woman incapable of maintaining a pregnancy .
None of the women vaccinated were told .
It later came out that the Rockefeller Foundation along with the Rockefeller ’s Population Council , the World Bank ( home to CGIAR ) , and the United States ’ National Institutes of Health had been involved in a 20 - year - long project begun in 1972 to develop the concealed abortion vaccine with a tetanus carrier for WHO .
In addition , the Government of Norway , the host to the Svalbard Doomsday Seed Vault , donated $ 41 million to develop the special abortive Tetanus vaccine .
12 GM Foods : The U.S. Fights Mandatory Labeling in An Untested Human ExperimentMonday , June 30 , 2008 by : Dr. Gregory Damato , Ph.D. The U.S. and several other nations recently attended a Codex meeting this month in Calgary , Canada to discuss food labeling .
The Codex Alimentarius Commission implements the Joint FAO / WHO Food Standards Program , the purpose of which is to bullcrap protect bullcrap the health of consumers and to ensure bullcrap fair bullcrap practices in the food trade .
The Codex Alimentarius ( Latin , meaning Food Law or Code ) is a collection of internationally adopted food standards presented in a uniform manner .
One of the principle reasons for this forum was to discuss the necessity , or lack of necessity as the U.S. sees it , to set up mandatory labeling of GM ( genetically modified ) and GE ( genetically engineered ) foods for consumers .
( MONSANTO ) South Africa ( SA ) and many African countries are strong dissenting voices of the U.S. policy that all GM / GE foods are considered equal to non-GM / GE foods and are in fact deemed safe under a 1992 George H. W. Bush Executive Order .
( Can you say New World Order and Global Depopulation Program ? )
Under this official policy , all GM / GE foods are not required to undergo any kind of safety testing before entering the market .
Below you will find the exact policy of the FDA concerning GM food : Nearly every modified food in the U.S. is completely untested for safety .
This is very noteworthy for two reasons : ( a ) the U.S. leads the world in GM / GE foods ( with up to 80 % of its prepared and prepackaged foods being modified ) ; and ( b ) every other nation besides the U.S. tests all GM / GE food before they are put into the food chain .
Several African nations have dubbed GM / GE foods as " lethal " and believes the United Nations WHO is fulfilling a population GENOCIDE strategy in Africa .

In 2005 and 2006 , researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that female rats who were fed glyphosate - tolerant GM soya produced an excessive number of stunted pups with over 50 % of them dying within three weeks .
The other half were all sterile .
This experiment was repeated several times with the same result [ 3 ] .*
Between 2005 and 2006 in the Warangal district of Andhra Pradech in India , thousands of sheep died while grazing on residues from Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis , which is a type of bacteria which is toxic to some types of insects ) cotton crops [ 4 ] .*
In 2003 , villagers in the Philippines ' south suffered mysterious illnesses when a Monsanto Bt maize hybrid came into flower .
At least five have died and many villagers tested positive for antibodies to the Bt protein while others still remain chronically ill [ 5 ] .*
Between 2001 and 2002 , 12 cows died in Hesse , Germany after consuming Syngenta GM maize ( Bt176 ) , while many others had to be slaughtered due to mysterious illnesses [ 6 ] .*
From 2002 to 2005 , researchers from four Italian universities published articles indicating that GM soya adversely affected pancreatic , hepatic ( liver ) and testicular cells in young mice [ 5 ] .*
In 2005 , Australian researchers at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra reported that a harmless protein in beans ( alpha - amylase inhibitor - 1 ) caused inflammation in the lungs of mice and elicited increased dietary sensitivities to other proteins when transferred to peas [ 7 ] .*
In 1998 , researchers reported damage to every organ system of young rats who were fed GM potatoes containing snowdrop lectin [ 8 ] .
In the same year , researchers in Egypt found analogous effects on the guts of mice fed Bt potato [ 9 ] .*
In 2002 , Aventis , later named Cropscience , submitted research to regulators in the U.K. reporting that chicken fed glufosinate - tolerant GM maize Chardon LL were twice as likely to die prematurely than chickens in the control group [ 10 ]

Rome attacked Carthage in full force , beginning in 264BC and completed their task after killing or enslaving every Carthaginian , by sowing the land to salt so that nothing could ever grow there again .
The Edomites descended from Esau later intermarried with the Turks to produce a Turco - Edomite mixture which later became known as Chazars - who are the present occupants of Israel .
These Canaanites eventually adopted the name " Sepharvaim " for deceptive purposes .
They later became known as Venetians , and by marrying into European royalty and arsitocracy , the " black nobility . "
The Venetians today control the Federal Reserve system in the US .
Around AD1400 , European power centers coalesced into two camps : the Ghibellines , who supported the Emporors Hohenstaufen family , and the Guelphs , from Welf , the German prince who competed with Frederick for control of the Holy Roman Empire .
The Pope allied himself with the Guelphs .
All modern history stems directly from the struggle between these two powers .
The Guelphs are also called the Neri , Black Guelphs , or Black Nobility , and supported William of Orange in his seizure of the throne of England , which eventually resulted in the formation of the Bank of England and the East India Company , which would rule the world from the 17th century .
All coup d'etats , revolutions and wars in the 19th and 20th centuries are centered in the battle of the Guelphs to hold and enhance their power , which is now the New World Order .
The power of the Guelphs would extend through the Italian financial centers to the north of France in Lombardy ( all Italian bankers were referred to as " Lombards " ) .
Lombard in German means " deposit bank " , and the Lombards were bankers to the entire Medieval world .
They would later transfer operations north to Hamburg , then to Amsterdam and finally to London .
The Guelphs would start the slave trade to the colonies .
The Guelphs , in order to aid their control of finance and politics , would perpetuate gnostic cults which eventually developed into the Rosicrucians , Unitarians , Fabian Society and the World Council of Churches .
The East India company , together with John Stuart Mill , would finance the University of London .
A friend of Mill , historian George Grote , a founder of London University donated £ 6000 for the study of " mental health " , which began the worldwide " mental health " movement .
Banks large and small in the thousands are in the Committee of 300 network , including Banca Commerciale d'Italia , Banca Privata , Banco Ambrosiano , the Netherlands Bank , Barclays Bank , Banco del Colombia , Banco de Ibero - America .
Of special interest is Banca del la Svizzeria Italiana ( BSI ) - since it handles flight capital investments to and from the United States - primarily in dollars and US bonds - located and isolated in " neutral " Lugano , the flight capital center for the Venetian Black Nobility .
Lugano is not in Italy or in Switzerland , and is a kind of twilight zone for shady flight capital operations .
George Ball , who owns a large block of stock in BSI , is a prominent " insider " and the bank 's US representative .
In the secret 1822 Treaty of Verona ( between Austria , France , Prussia and Russia ) the Jesuits agreed to smash the US Constitution and suppress the freedom of the US .
Their methods included destroying free speech , destroying and suppressing the press , universal censorship , sustaining the cooperation of the Pope and clergy to use religion to help keep nations in passive obedience and financing wars against countries with representative governments .
The monarchs who signed this treaty were ultimately deposed .
Most of these families are very wealthy and may be more powerful today than when they sat upon thrones .
They are known collectively as the Black Nobility .
Privately these families refuse to recognize any right to rule except their own .
The fact that this treaty was made long ago does not mean it is void .
The treaty was placed in the Congressional Record on April 25 , 1916 by Senator Owen .
In 1948 George H.W. Bush graduated from Yale University and the Skull and Bones .
He is a distant cousin of the Queen of England , part of the Black Nobility which traces its power back 5,000 years .
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands created a group that became known as the Bilderbergers .
Many " conservative " researchers have come to recognize the Bilderbergers as an important force for the " New World Order . "
( Note : Since the Bildebergers , according to former British Intelligence agent John Coleman , serve as a BINDING force between the three major ' one world government ' forces - the Wicca - Masons ( i.e. Communism ) ; the Black Nobility descendants of the early Roman emperors ; and the Maltese Jesuits .
. . each of which have 13 respective representatives on the 39 - member Bildeberger board - and since a Nazi SS stormtrooper was responsible for developing this " New World Order " coordination council , and since Adolph Hitler 's second book was titled [ believe it or not ]
" The New World Order . "
No wonder Adolph Hitler 's dream - and that of his predecessors the " Kaisers " , a German translation of " Caesars " - was the revival of the Roman empire ) .
According to former British Intelligence agent Dr. John Coleman , the three world power groups : the Wicca - Masons ( i.e. Communism ) , the Maltese - Jesuits and the Black - Nobility ( ' Black ' in this context refers to their character , not their skin color ) all work for and under the central Command of the Bavarian Illuminati which binds them together .
The Bavarians created the Bilderberg society for this purpose , the core of which is a council of 13 members from each of the three ' groups ' or 39 in all .
The old - line ruling families who believe that they have the right to rule the world because they are descended from the emperors of the ancient Roman and so - called ' holy ' Roman Empires consist of 13 - 15 ' blue blood ' families .
Which include : Rothschild ; Kuhn ; Loeb ; Lehman ; Rockefeller ; Sach ; Warburg ; Lazard ; Seaf ; Goldman ; Schiff ; Morgan ; Schroeder ; Bush and Harriman . . .
Others that have not been mentioned are more ' powerful ' than others .
But these names will get you started if you wish to track down the present - day inner core of the conspiracy .
The history of the Bilderberg group itself , a cover for the Bavarian Illuminati , and its Nazi conections , would probably be the best place to start .
Prominent on the board of two insurance giants are Committee of 300 members : the Giustiniani family , Black Nobility of Rome and Venice who trace their lineage to the Emperor Justianian ; Sir Jocelyn Hambro of Hambros ( Merchant ) Bank ; Pierpaolo Luzzatti Fequiz , whose lineage dates back six centuries to the most ancient Luzzatos , the Black Nobility of Venice , and Umberto Ortolani of the ancient Black Nobility family of the same name .
Other old Venetian Black Nobility Committee of 300 members and board members of ASG and RAS are the Doria family , the financiers of the Spanish Hapsburgs , Elie de Rothschild of the French Rothschild family , Baron August von Finck ( Finck , the second richest man in Germany now deceased ) , Franco Orsini Bonacassi of the ancient Orsini Black Nobility that traces its lineage to an ancient Roman senator of the same name , the Alba family whose lineage dates back to the great Duke of Alba , and Baron Pierre Lambert , a cousin of the Belgian Rothschild family .
Italy was chosen as a test - target by the Committee of 300 .
Italy is important to the conspirators ' plans because it is the closest European country to the Middle East , and linked to Middle East economics and politics .
It is also the home of the Catholic Church , which Weishaupt ordered destroyed , and home for some of Europe 's most powerful oligarchical families of the ancient Black Nobility .
Should Italy have been weakened by Aldo Moro 's death , it would have had repercussions in the Middle East which would have weakened US influence in the region .
Italy is important for another reason ; it is a gateway for drugs entering Europe from Iran and Lebanon .
Various groups combined under the name of socialism to bring about the downfall of several Italian governments since the Club of Rome was established in 1968 .
Among these are the Black Nobility of Venice and Genoa , P2 Masonry and the Red Brigades , all working for the same goals .
Police investigators in Rome working on the Red Brigades - Aldo Moro case came across the names of several very prominent Italian families working closely with this terrorist group .
The police also discovered evidence that in at least a dozen cases , these powerful and prominent families had allowed their homes and / or property to be used as safe houses for Red Brigades cells .
Peccei headed the Atlantic Institute 's Economic Council for three decades while he was the Chief Executive Officer for Giovanni Agnellis ' Fiat Motor Company .
Agnelli , a member of an ancient Italian Black Nobility family of the same name , was one of the most important members of the Committee of 300 .
He played a leading role in development projects in the Soviet Union .
The Club of Rome is a conspiratorial umbrella organization , a marriage between Anglo - American financiers and the old Black Nobility families of Europe , particularly the so - called " nobility " of London , Venice and Genoa .
The key to the successful control of the world is their ability to create and manage savage economic recessions and eventual depressions .
The Committee of 300 looks to social convulsions on a global scale , followed by depressions , as a softening - up technique for bigger things to come , as its principal method of creating masses of people all over the world who will become its " welfare " recipients of the future .
To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning which includes rock " music " gangsters such as the filthy , degenerate Mick Jagger 's " Rolling Stones " ( a gangster group much favored by European Black Nobility ) and all of the Tavistock - created " rock " groups which began with " The Beatles . "
To continue to build up the cult of Christian fundamentalism begun by the British East India Company 's servant , Darby , which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist state of Israel through identifying with the Jews through the myth of " God 's Chosen People " and by donating very substantial amounts of money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the furtherance of Christianity .
Brzezinski was not writing as a private citizen but as Carter 's National Security Advisor and a leading member of the Club of Rome and a member of the Committee of 300 , a member of the CFR and as a member of the old Polish Black Nobility .
His book explains how America must leave its industrial base behind and enter into what he called " a distinct new historical era .
"
In this regard a French Black Nobility member , Etienne D'Avignon , as a member of the Committee of 300 , was assigned the task of collapsing the steel industry in the US
It is doubtful that any of the hundreds of thousands of steel workers and shipyard workers who have been without jobs for the past decade have ever heard of D'Avignon .
A second assassination bureau is located in Switzerland and was until recently run by a shadowy figure of whom no photographs existed after 1941 .
The operations were and probably still are financed by the Oltramaire family - Swiss Black Nobility , owners of the Lombard Odier Bank of Geneva , a Committee of 300 operation .
The primary contact man was Jacques Soustelle - this according to US Army - G2 intelligence files .
This group was also closely allied with Allen Dulles and Jean de Menil , an important member of the Committee of 300 and a very prominent name in the oil industry in Texas .
Army - G2 records show that the group was heavily involved in the arms trade in the Middle East , but more than that , the assassination bureau made no less than 30 attempts to kill General de Gaulle , in which Jacques Soustelle was directly involved .
The same Soustelle was the contact man for the Sendero Luminosa - Shining Pathway guerilla group protecting the Committee 's Peruvian cocaine producers .
Richard Gardner was sent to Rome on a special assignment .
Gardner married into one of the oldest Black Nobility families of Venice , thus providing the Venetian aristocracy a direct line to the White House .
The late Averill Harriman was another of the committee 's direct links with the Kremlin and the White House , a position inherited by Kissinger after Harriman 's death .
In 1986 in " The Order of St. John of Jerusalem " Dr. Coleman wrote : " ( I ) t is therefore not a secret society , except where its purposes have been perverted in the inner councils like the Order of the Garter , which is a prostituted oligarchical creation of the British royal family , which makes a mockery of what the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem stands for .
As an example , we find the atheist Lord Peter Carrington , who pretends to be an Anglican Christian but who is a member of the Order of Osiris and other demonic sects , including Freemasonry , installed as a Knight of the Garter at St. George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , by Her Majesty , Queen Elizabeth II of England , of the Black Nobility Guelphs , also head of the Anglican Church , which she thoroughly despises .

“ Ratings firms fear litigation more than they fear regulation because past regulation efforts have n’t “ been that draconian . ”
- Scott McCleskey , a former Moody ’s compliance officer who has testified before Congress about the industry .
>
Of all the various contributors to the financial crisis and economic collapse , none loom larger than the Ratings Agencies .
They were the prime enablers of the entire crisis , allowing global asset managers to purchase all manner of junk paper due to their triple AAA rating .
Had these various securitized RMBS been rated properly , i.e. , reflecting their true value and risk factors , most of the crisis would have been avoided .
The big 3 ratings agencies have escaped much blame , liability and scrutiny for most of the post - crisis period .
As Columbia Law School professor John Coffee noted , the credit rating agencies have been “ essentially liability proof and it ’s not because they ’re infallible . ”
Until now .
There is a new move afoot to slap ordinary liability on rating agencies for the results of their ratings :
“ Credit - rating firms are a big step closer to facing a harsher liability standard on their work .
But it could take years for courts to decide what the planned rules mean .
A panel of Senate and House lawmakers negotiating final details of a financial - overhaul bill agreed this week to allow investors to bring legal action against credit - rating firms that “ knowingly or recklessly ” fail to “ conduct a reasonable investigation of the rated security . ”
The new standard , if passed into law , likely would make it easier for investors to sue the ratings companies , such as McGraw - Hill Cos . ’
Standard & Poor ’s and Moody Corp. ’s Moody ’s Investors Service , which for long have enjoyed near immunity from liability for ratings gone awry . ”
Some of the problems of this legislation are obvious :
Defining what is a “ reasonable investigation ” is far too ambiguous , and should be more clearly defined by Congress .
More importantly , the proposed rule changes do not impact the past actions crimes of the ratings agencies — namely , the charge of selling their ratings to the highest bidder .
But for this legal Payola , most of the crisis would have been avoided .

Legal Fights Loom Over Ratings - Firm Liability Rule

YOU are not going to want to read this : chocolate cannot be relied upon as a source of antioxidants to boost cardiovascular health .
But it gets worse : drinking coffee and red wine in the hope it will prevent heart disease does n't work either .
Fans of Turkish or Greek coffee have now been warned that their boiled coffee contains more bad cholesterol - bearing oil than filtered Italian coffee varieties .
Dark day ...
Experts say health claims about chocolate are baseless .
The brutal news was delivered yesterday by the Heart Foundation following a review of more than 100 international studies on antioxidants from the past decade .
The Heart Foundation 's national director of healthy weight , Susan Anderson , said the benefits of dark chocolate , coffee and red wine had been overstated , and the review was conducted following concern that these popular beliefs were misleading the community .
As fears grow about the dangers posed by clinics offering unproven stem - cell treatments , the main professional body for the field is getting tough .
The International Society for Stem Cell Research ( ISSCR ) is writing to members who are listed as advisers to clinics offering speculative therapies , demanding they explain themselves .
Any who continue to associate themselves with these clinics risk expulsion , the society ’s leaders have warned .
Opening the ISSCR ’s annual meeting in San Francisco on 16 June , society president Irving Weissman of Stanford University in California vowed to “ smoke out the charlatans ” .
While the ISSCR has previously attacked clinics offering unproven therapies , Weissman also turned his ire on a minority of the society ’s own members who have been named as advisers to clinics operating outside the medical mainstream .
At a press briefing on 17 June , he revealed that these members are being told to explain their connections with such clinics .
Expulsion from the society was a possibility for members who continue to associate themselves with unproven “ therapies ” , added Sean Morrison of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , a member of the ISSCR board of directors .

Quizzed by New Scientist after the briefing , Weissman declined to reveal the names or locations of those being targeted .
He said that “ a handful ” of letters were being sent to the society members in question , who would have about a month to respond .
Quackbusters
The ISSCR ’s move against rogue members follows its launch of a website to help prospective patients spot bogus clinics .
Members of the public can submit clinics for review via the website ; the ISSCR will follow up to determine whether each clinic has a bona - fide medical ethics committee , and whether it is supervised by an official regulatory body such as the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency .
Clinics that fail these tests will be named on the website .
Concern about clinics offering unproven treatments reached a crescendo this week with the news that a woman who had been treated for a kidney condition at a clinic in Thailand had died , apparently as a result of the stem - cell injections she received .
At least 26 people have been killed in a twin suicide car bombing close to a state - owned bank in the Iraqi capital , Baghdad , officials have said .
More than 50 others were also hurt when the vehicles exploded simultaneously outside the Trade Bank of Iraq 's headquarters in the Yarmouk district .
The blasts severely damaged the building and the nearby offices of an interior ministry identity - card centre .
There has been increased unrest in Iraq since March 's parliamentary election .
The poll produced no outright winner , and a deal between the various parties to form a coalition government has not yet been reached .
Co-ordinated attacks
Baghdad security spokesman Maj - General Qassim al - Moussawi told the Reuters news agency that the two cars were packed with around 80kg ( 176lb ) of explosives each , and were driven directly at the main gates of the Trade Bank .
I feel so sorry for what is happening to my country Mahmoud Asi , Local resident
The bombs were detonated simultaneously by the drivers shortly after 1100 ( 0800 GMT ) when their vehicles struck the blast - walls protecting the building , he added .
Several security guards stationed outside the building were killed by the explosions .
A bank employee said the death toll would have been worse had it not been for the blastwalls and the building 's shatterproof glass .
At least two of the dead were police officers guarding the nearby interior ministry building , outside which a number of people were queuing to apply for identity cards at the start of the working week .
" I feel so sorry for what is happening to my country , " Mahmoud Asi , a local resident who was wounded along with his wife in the attack , told Reuters .
" All the bank 's guards were killed . "
The Trade Bank of Iraq is one of the public sector 's most active financial institutions and at the forefront of efforts to encourage foreign investment .
The attack came just a week after gunmen wearing explosive belts attacked the Iraqi Central Bank , engaging security forces in a lengthy gun battle before blowing themselves up .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says it is not clear whether banks have now become the latest category of target for insurgents , though officials have speculated that they may be turning in that direction because their funds are running out .
However , the attack on the central bank was highly unusual and has left many question marks , our correspondent says .
Responsibility for it has apparently been taken by al - Qaeda 's umbrella group in Iraq , but the main objective seems to have been to destroy records inside the bank , and there has been speculation that it may have been an attempt to cover up a huge money - laundering operation , he adds .
Overnight on Saturday , three roadside bombs exploded in the predominantly Shia district of Hurriya , killing at least two people and wounding 14 .
Officials told Iraqi media that the first bomb went off on a main street .
When locals gathered , the second bomb exploded , and when police came to the site , the third bomb was detonated .
Despite the recent attacks , correspondents say the general level of violence in the country remains far lower than it was at the height of the insurgency and sectarian conflict in 2006 and 2007 .
Last Monday , the 325 members of the Council of Representatives were sworn in , but the session was immediately suspended until further notice to allow consultations on the election of a new speaker .
Our correspondent says the job is part of the mix in a wider division of powers that cannot be done until there is agreement on the other major components , most importantly who will be the next prime minister .
A lot of manoeuvring and wrangling will be needed to hammer out a power - sharing deal and the prediction is that it will take weeks , possibly months , he adds .
The political uncertainty threatens the planned end of US combat operations in August , ahead of a full withdrawal by the end of 2011 .
LONDON  Alcohol - induced behavior has produced many unintended consequences , but pushing up the global price of oil and losing $ 10 million must rank among the most novel .
Britain ’s financial regulator disclosed on Tuesday that Steven Noel Perkins , a former oil futures broker , single - handedly engineered a jump in the price of oil a year ago and cost his firm millions of dollars with a string of unauthorized trades after a weekend of heavy drinking .
Mr. Perkins had just returned from a liquor - soaked golf weekend with colleagues in June of last year when he sat down in front of his laptop at his home east of London and started to place bets on Brent crude futures , according to a report by the Financial Services Authority .
He continued to drink and place bets through the night , and by the morning of June 30 , Mr. Perkins had placed more than $ 520 million worth of trades , at one point pushing the price of oil to $ 73.05 , an eight - month high .
The trades by Mr. Perkins were the main reason the price gained about $ 1.65 a barrel in just over two hours in the middle of the night , according to the report .
“ Mr. Perkins ’s explanation for his trading on 29 and 30 June is that he was drunk , ” the F.S.A. said .
“ He claims to have limited recollection of events on Monday and claims to have been in an alcohol - induced blackout at the time he traded . ”

Star Trails and Tajinastes
Image Credit & Copyright : Daniel López
Explanation :
What bizarre planet do these alien creatures inhabit ?
It 's only planet Earth , of course .
In this well - composed scene , the sky is filled with star trails around the north celestial pole .
A reflection of the Earth 's daily rotation on its axis , star trails are familiar to photographers who fix their camera to a tripod and make long exposures of the night sky .
But the imposing forms gazing skyward probably look strange to many denizens of Earth .
Found on the Canary Island of Tenerife , they are red tajinastes , rare flowering plants that grow to a height of up to 3 meters .
Hidden among the rocks of the volcanic terrain , tajinastes bloom in spring and early summer and then die after their seeds mature .
On the distant horizon , below and left of the celestial pole , lies the Teide volcano .

Those who perpetrate violence against women suffer severe consequences .
Well , hey , that ’s a message I can get behind .
So why am I not pumping my fist in praise of Larsson ’s pro-woman opus ?
Because I have a hard time reconciling his ostensibly feminist agenda with all the male fantasy coursing through the books .
Take Mikael Blomkvist , the series ’ hard - charging journalist ( and apparent stand - in for the author ) .
He ’s a walking aphrodisiac — a Swedish James Bond , only without the dashing hotness .
Powerful women , rich women , married women , and even the fierce cyberpunk hacker genius Lisbeth Salander — they all want to bed him .
Lisbeth ( played by Noomi Rapace in the Swedish film adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo , pictured here with her guardian played by Peter Andersson ) even falls in love with him .
This macho make - believe does n’t negate Larsson ’s professed feminism .
But it does cast a shadow over how I read the many , many scenes of horrific violence inflicted upon female characters .
One victim is choked to death with a sanitary napkin down her throat .
Another is tortured , then decapitated with a saw .
Lisbeth is raped .
The crimes are unspeakable — which you could argue is the point for an activist like Larsson : Bring it into the open , try to prevent it from happening again .
Still , Larsson seems to want it both ways : to condemn such savagery while simultaneously exploiting it in graphic detail for titillating storytelling purposes .
And that makes me uncomfortable .
But what about Lisbeth ? , Larsson fans might ask .
She can knock out murderous thugs with a flick of her Taser ; is n’t she ample proof of Larsson ’s feminist intent ?
Yes …until you get to the part in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo when she decides to seduce Mikael ( of course ! ) and we learn that she finds her “ skinny body ” “ repulsive , ” her small breasts “ pathetic , ” and that , overall , she does “ not have much to offer . ”
Okay , so Lisbeth has body issues .
We all do .
Yet instead of allowing her to accept her imperfections , Larsson betrays her by having her succumb to an arbitrary standard of female beauty :
She gets a boob job .
And going up a few bra sizes , we ’re told , “ improved her quality of life . ”
Really ?
This superhero in steel - toe boots sees progress in two lumps of silicone ?
Sorry , I just do n’t buy it .
Sadly , Larsson is n’t around to discuss these potholes in his politics .
By all accounts , he was passionate about his beliefs .
I think he would have relished debating whether a heroine needs Lara Croft ’s measurements to kick some ass .

Soy Lecithin has been lingering around our food supply for over a century .
It is an ingredient in literally hundreds of proceesed foods , and also sold as an over the counter health food supplement .
Scientists claim it benefits our cardiovascular health , metabolism , memory , cognitive function , liver function , and even physical and athletic perfomance .
However , most people do n't realize what soy lecithin actually is , and why the dangers of ingesting this additive far exceed its benefits .
Lecithin is an emulsifying substance that is found in the cells of all living organisms .
The French scientist Maurice Gobley discovered lecithin in 1805 and named it " lekithos " after the Greek word for " egg yolk . "
Until it was recovered from the waste products of soybean processing in the 1930s , eggs were the primary source of commercial lecithin .
Today lecithin is the generic name given to a whole class of fat - and - water soluble compounds called phospholipids .
Levels of phospholipids in soybean oils range from 1.48 to 3.08 percent , which is considerably higher than the 0.5 percent typically found in vegetable oils , but far less than the 30 percent found in egg yolks .
Out of the Dumps
Soybean lecithin comes from sludge left after crude soy oil goes through a " degumming " process .
It is a waste product containing solvents and pesticides and has a consistency ranging from a gummy fluid to a plastic solid .
Before being bleached to a more appealing light yellow , the color of lecithin ranges from a dirty tan to reddish brown .
The hexane extraction process commonly used in soybean oil manufacture today yields less lecithin than the older ethanol - benzol process , but produces a more marketable lecithin with better color , reduced odor and less bitter flavor .
Historian William Shurtleff reports that the expansion of the soybean crushing and soy oil refining industries in Europe after 1908 led to a problem disposing the increasing amounts of fermenting , foul - smelling sludge .
German companies then decided to vacuum dry the sludge , patent the process and sell it as " soybean lecithin . "
Scientists hired to find some use for the substance cooked up more than a thousand new uses by 1939 .
Today lecithin is ubiquitous in the processed food supply .
It is most commonly used as an emulsifier to keep water and fats from separating in foods such as margarine , peanut butter , chocolate candies , ice cream , coffee creamers and infant formulas .
Lecithin also helps prevent product spoilage , extending shelf life in the marketplace .
In industry kitchens , it is used to improve mixing , speed crystallization , prevent " weeping , " and stop spattering , lumping and sticking .
Used in cosmetics , lecithin softens the skin and helps other ingredients penetrate the skin barrier .
A more water - loving version known as " deoiled lecithin " reduces the time required to shut down and clean the extruders used in the manufacture of textured vegetable protein and other soy products .
In theory , lecithin manufacture eliminates all soy proteins , making it hypoallergenic .
In reality , minute amounts of soy protein always remain in lecithin as well as in soy oil .
Three components of soy protein have been identified in soy lecithin , including the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor , which has a track record of triggering severe allergic reactions even in the most minuscule quantities .
The presence of lecithin in so many food and cosmetic products poses a special danger for people with soy allergies .
The Making of a Wonder Food
Lecithin has been touted for years as a wonder food capable of combating atherosclerosis , multiple sclerosis , liver cirrhosis , gall stones , psoriasis , eczema , scleroderma , anxiety , tremors and brain aging .
Because it is well known that the human body uses phospholipids to build strong , flexible cell membranes and to facilitate nerve transmission , health claims have been made for soy lecithin since the 1920s .
Dr. A. A. Horvath , a leading purveyor of soybean health claims at the time , thought it could be used in " nerve tonics " or to help alcoholics reduce the effects of intoxication and withdrawal .
In 1934 , an article entitled " A Comfortable and Spontaneous Cure for the Opium Habit by Means of Lecithin " was written by Chinese researchers and published in an English language medical journal .
Lecithin , though , did not capture the popular imagination until the 1960s and 1970s when the bestselling health authors Adelle Davis , Linda Clark and Mary Ann Crenshaw hyped lecithin in their many books , including Lets Get Well , Secrets of Health and Beauty and The Natural Way to Super Beauty : Featuring the Amazing Lecithin , Apple Cider Vinegar , B - 6 and Kelp Diet .
Lecithin did not become a star of the health food circuit by accident .
Research took off during the early 1930s , right when lecithin production became commercially viable .
In 1939 , the American Lecithin Company began sponsoring research studies , and published the most promising in a 23 - page booklet entitled Soybean Lecithin in 1944 .
The company , not coincidentally introduced a health food cookie with a lecithin filling known as the " Lexo Wafer " and a lecithin / wheat germ supplement called Granulestin .
In the mid 1970s , Natterman , a lecithin marketing company based in Germany , hired scientists at various health clinics to experiment with lecithin and to write scientific articles about it .
These " check book " scientists coined the term " essential phospholipids " an inaccurate term since a healthy body can produce its own phospholipids from phosphorous and lipids .
In September 2001 , lecithin got a boost when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) authorized products containing enough of it to bear labels such as " A good source of choline . "
Producers of soy lecithin hope to find ways to help the new health claim lift demand for lecithin and increase prices in what has been a soft market .
Eggs , milk and soy products are the leading dietary sources of choline , according to recent research conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at Duke University .
Genetically Modified
One of the biggest problems associated with soy lecithin comes from the origin of the soy itself .
The majority of soy sources in the world are now genetically modified ( GM ) .
Researchers have clearly identified GM foods as a threat to the environment , pollution of soils and a long - term threat to human health with links to of the world with unnatural genetic material that may have unknown long - term consequences with links to decreased fertility , immunological alterations in the gut and the exacerbation and creation of allergies .
Genetically engineered soy contains high concentrations of plant toxicants .
The presence of high levels of toxicants in the GM soy
represent thousands of plant biochemicals many of which have been shown to have toxic effects on animals .
Unfermented Soy Sources
The manufacture of soy lecithin is also typically confined to unfermented sources because it is quicker and cheaper to make .
Unfermented soy products are rich in enzyme inhibitors .
Enzymes such as amylase lipase and protease are secreted into the digestive tract to help break down food and free nutrients for assimilation into the body .
The high content of enzyme inhibitors in unfermented soybeans interferes with this process and makes carbohydrates and proteins from soybeans impossible to completely digest .
Unfermented soy has been linked to digestive distress , immune system breakdown , PMS , endometriosis , reproductive problems for men and women , allergies , ADD and ADHD , higher risk of heart disease and cancer , malnutrition , and loss of libido .
It is now widely recognized that the only soy fit for human consumption is fermented soy .
Phosphatidyl Choline ( PC )
Because many lecithin products sold in health food stores contain less than 30 percent choline , many clinicians prefer to use the more potent Phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) or its even more powerful derivative drug Glyceryl - phosphorylcholine ( GPC ) .
Both are being used to prevent and reverse dementia , improve cognitive function , increase human growth hormone ( hGH ) release , and to treat brain disorders such as damage from stroke .
PC and GPC may help build nerve cell membranes , facilitate electrical transmission in the brain , hold membrane proteins in place , and produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine .
However , studies on soy lecithin , PC , and brain aging have been inconsistent and contradictory ever since the 1920s .
Generally , lecithin is regarded as safe except for people who are highly allergic to soy .
However , the late Robert Atkins , MD , advised patients not to take large doses of supplemental lecithin without extra vitamin C to protect them from the nitrosamines formed from choline metabolism .
Trimethylamine and dimethylamine , which are metabolized by bacteria in the intestines from choline , are important precurors to N - nitrosodimethylamine , a potent carcinogen in a wide variety of animal species .
Phosphatidyl Serine ( PS )
Phosphatidyl serine ( PS ) -- another popular phospholipid that improves brain function and mental acuity  nearly always comes from soy oil .
Most of the scientific studies proving its efficacy , however , come from bovine sources , which also contain DHA as part of the structure .
Plant oils never contain readymade DHA .
Indeed , the entire fatty acid structure is different ; bovine derived PS is rich in stearic and oleic acids , while soy PS is rich in linoleic and palmitic acids .
Complicating matters further , the PS naturally formed in the human body consists of 37.5 percent stearic acid and 24.2 percent arachidonic acid .
Yet soy - derived PS seems to help many people .
Russell Blaylock , MD , author of Excitotoxins , the Taste that Kills , explains that the probable reason PS works is because its chemical structure is similar to that of L - glutamate , the trouble - making neurotransmitter , amino acid and excitotoxin that exists in high concentration in MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) , HVP ( hydrolyzed vegetable protein ) and " natural flavorings " and foods containing these soy derivatives .
( See Chapter 11 . )
Because PS competes with glutamate , it may protect us from glutamate toxicity .
Ironically , the expensive soy - derived supplement PS is being used to undo damage that may be caused in part by the cheap soy in processed foods
Lysophosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( LPE )
The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has approved lysophosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( LPE ) , another phosphatidyl substance commercially extracted from soybeans , for use as a fruit ripener and shelf - life extender .
LPE  once called cephalin -- is now being used to treat grapes , cranberries , strawberries , blueberries , apples , tomatoes , and cut flowers .
When applied to fruits that are nearly ripe  going into puberty , so to speak -- LPE promotes ripening .
When applied to picked fruit or cut flowers that are already ripe or blooming , however , it will " reduce senescence by inhibiting some of the enzymes involved in membrane breakdown . "
This can dramatically extend shelf life .
Whether the substance could also keep human bodies fresh for funeral home viewings has not yet been investigated .
At this point , no company wants to be caught with a BPA - filled product .
The chemical , which is found in food and drink can linings , water bottles , computers , and other products containing plastic , can cause numerous health problems–it mimics estrogen , for example , and that can lead to infertility and even cancer .
Now the National Workgroup for Safe Markets has come out with a report ( PDF ) claiming that canned foods , many of which are labeled as “ healthy ” or organic , contain an average of 77 parts per billion ( ppb ) of BPA .
When the FDA last tested canned food in 1996 , it found
found an average of 16 ppb , or almost five times less than the average level of BPA found in the NWSM report .
The NWSM conducted its research on 50 donated food and beverage containers from 20 people located in 19 U.S. states and Ontario , Canada .
Cans containing fish , fruits , vegetables , beans , soups , tomato products , sodas , and milk were submitted from kitchen cupboards , pantries , and straight from local chain grocery stores .
An FDA - certified lab in San Francisco evaluated the concentrations of BPA in the food within the cans , with some upsetting results : BPA was found in 92 % of the canned food samples .
NSWM found no correlation between the age of the product and the amount of BPA in the food , and BPA levels could n’t be predicted by price , quality , or nutrition value of the product .
NWSM reports :
The highest level of BPA — 1,140 part per billion
( ppb ) , to our knowledge the highest level ever found in the U.S. — was detected in DelMonte French Style Green Beans from a participant ’s pantry in Wisconsin .
Other high scorers included Walmart ’s Great Value Green Peas from a store in Kentucky , and Healthy Choice Old Fashioned Chicken Noodle Soup from a pantry in Montana .
On average , the products contained 77.36 ppb of bisphenol A .
This does n’t mean that we should shun cans altogether .
Instead , manufacturers could implement alternatives like metal can linings , polyester coatings , and even simple glass jars .
They might have to , anyway , if legislation is passed to limit the amount of BPA in cans–not an unlikely event considering that the EPA recently added BPA to its chemical concern list .
Check out the full NSWM report below for more detailed information on the findings as well as a list of companies that are phasing out BPA .
An jury in Oregon has ordered the Boy Scouts of America to pay $ 18.5 million US in punitive damages in a sex abuse lawsuit .
It is believed to be the largest award ever granted by a jury in a sex - abuse lawsuit against the organization .
The amount is in addition to $ 1.4 million US awarded to Kerry Lewis in compensatory damages last week , after the jury found the Scouts were negligent for failing to prevent abuse by an assistant Scoutmaster in the early 1980s .
The punitive damages award on Friday came in the second phase of a month - long trial that centred on files the Scouts have kept on suspected child molesters since the 1920s .
Lawyers for Lewis , 38 , argued the organization was reckless for allowing former assistant scoutmaster Timur Dykes to continue to associate with the victim 's Scout troop after Dykes acknowledged to a Mormon bishop early in 1983 that he had molested 17 scouts .
The Mormon church was the local affiliate , or " charter " organization , for an estimated one - third to one - half of the Boy Scout troops in the United States in the 1980s .
It had already been ordered to pay compensatory damages but was not subject to punitive damages .
The Boy Scouts denied the allegations of negligence and said their files actually helped them keep child molesters out of their ranks .
WWE ’s Fatal 4
Way is in the books , and we have new champions .
Who are they ?
Well , you should read on and find out :
Intercontinental Title Match
Kofi Kingston ( Champion ) vs. Drew McIntyre
WINNER : Kingston via pin fall after hitting Trouble in Paradise
McIntyre brought out Teddy Long to sit ringside so that he could award him the belt after the match , and it turned out to be his down fall .
Ref got knocked out , and McIntyre grabbed Teddy to count the pin .
Teddy refused , and then Matt Hardy jumped in the ring and hit Drew with Twist of Fate .
Kofi followed up for the win .
Diva ’s Title Match – Fatal 4 Way
Eve Torres ( Champion ) vs. Gail Kim vs. Maryse vs. Alicia Fox
WINNER : Alicia via pin fall on Maryse after stealing the match from Eve who hit a moonsault
Shockingly , the diva ’s match was n’t half bad .
I thought it would totally be a cluster f**k , but it flowed pretty well .
It had an almost identical ending to the US Title Fatal 4 Way match from Monday Night RAW , but not going to knock it because a lot of 3 & 4 - way matches end that way .
Chris Jericho vs. Evan Bourne ( Added day of show )
WINNER : Bourne via pin fall after hitting Air Bourne
Good match .
This a great thing that Jericho is doing giving Bourne a rub like this .
I guess WWE management is going to push Bourne .
He is an exciting wrestler , but I still ca n’t help but think that eventually because of his size he ’s going to fall out of favor with WWE .
Kudos to those guys for putting on a show though .
World Heavyweight Title Match – Fatal 4 Way
Jack Swagger ( Champion ) vs. Rey Mysterio vs. CM
Punk vs. Big Show
WINNER : Mysterio via pin fall after hitting Swagger with the 619
I knew this would happen .
Mysterio was n’t originally supposed to be in the match , and it winds up being he who wins the World Title .
Kane made his way down to the ring with a casket and singled out CM Punk , trying to put him in it .
Luke Gallows came down to save Punk , and they ran .
Kane follows them to the back .
US Title Match
The Miz ( Champion ) vs. R - Truth
WINNER : Miz via pin fall counter to a wheel barrow
Miz handled this match from beginning to end .
Truth had a few moments where he battled back , but Miz just showed some great aggression .
Glad that he retains the title .
Mixed Tag Team Match ( Added day of show )
The Hart Dynasty vs. The Usos & Tamina
WINNERS : Harts via pin fall after Natalya hit Tamina with a Discus Lariat
I ’m glad they added this match to the card .
It was n’t the greatest of showings in the world , but it speaks volumes as to what the WWE thinks of the Usos considering they ’ve only been on the big show for just a month .
Kudos to them for making a splash so soon .
WWE Title Match – Fatal 4 Way
John Cena ( Champion ) vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge vs. Sheamus
WINNER : Sheamus via pin fall after the NXT grads came out and destroyed Cena
I ’m not shocked that the NXT grads came out , and I ’m really happy that someone other than Cena walked away from the match as the WWE Champion .
Bret Hart was n’t at the PPV because of the attack by the NXT grads , so they did n’t get their answer as to whether or not they will be getting contracts .
QUICK THOUGHTS :
All in all , I do n’t say this very often , but I actually enjoyed this PPV from beginning to end .
Every match had me glued to the TV .
I do n’t understand why they ca n’t do this for every PPV !
Oh well , I ’m going to count my blessings and walk away from this one with a smile .
Man , the comedy keeps writing itself :
Breaking news on Twitter from Politico 's Mike Allen -- the 2012 Republican National Convention will be held in Tampa .
Florida has been a fiercely contested " swing state " in recent presidential campaigns , and Barack Obama 's victory there in 20 [ 08 ] was the Democratic Party 's first since 1996 .
The Politico is right -- Florida is a critical " swing " state .
There are some high visibility and politically strained battles going on there ( I 'm looking at you two , Crist and Rubio ) .
But somehow I suspect that there was another element factored in to the choice of Tampa :
A reputation can sometimes be hard to shake and the city of Tampa has a reputation it would probably like to eliminate .
For the past decade some have called Tampa the lap dance capital of the world .
Paul Allen , the founder and publisher of NightMoves magazine , says he hears about the city 's reputation all the time .
He believes the shear number of strip clubs in the Bay area has undoubtedly contributed to the city 's rep .
" In greater Tampa Bay , I think the last count is around 56 different clubs that are adult - oriented , " he said .
Another reason for the reputation is the city 's role in the adult industry .
" If you own a club in Oshkosh , Wisconsin and you want to book a feature ( dancer ) to come to your club , there 's basically four people you can call .
Three of those four companies are based right here in Tampa , " Allen said .
You can't write comedy as gold as what the RNC does all on its own .
In the future , long after Hollywood has broken free of its ouroboros - like cycle of pointless and needless remakes , I feel certain that director Louis Letterier ‘s 2010 remake of Clash Of The Titans will be held as the epitome of everything wrong with the trend .
Loud , abrasive and charmless , this new iteration of some classic Greek myths misses everything that made the original film , which featured the last work of visual effects maestro Ray Harryhausen , a minor classic .
In the 1981 original , we had Perseus , son of the Greek god Zeus and a mortal woman , questing and slaying monsters in order to save his beloved Andromeda from being sacrificed to the terrifying Kraken .
Thirty years later , we have a hero ( Sam Worthington ) seemingly motivated by daddy issues who apparently thinks that running hither and yon killing things is a good substitute for an anger management course .
After his adoptive parents and younger sister are killed in the crossfire between the gods and mortals in the opening salvos of what could be all out war , Perseus vows to defend the city of Argos from its appointed meeting with the monstrous Kraken .
Although his half - divine parentage grants him special powers , Perseus refuses to use them .
In a gross miscalculation of our attention spans on the part of the filmmakers , Perseus repeatedly tells everyone within earshot that he will meet these challenges “ as a man . ”
Although raised as a fisherman and allegedly not drawing on his divine advantages , Perseus manages to battle his way through a host of giant scorpions , the Medusa and a host of other perils with a band of soldiers many of whom , despite having far more experience at this sort of thing , do n’t make it to the final reel .
Surprisingly , what should be a story about gods and men is surprisingly short on the gods side of things .
The jealousy that lord of the underworld Hades feels towards Zeus and the other gods who get to reside on the far snazzier Mount Olympus and the rivalry between them would have made a great storyline for the movie , if it had been developed more .
Instead it is more plot device than plot .
And outside of Zeus and Hades , the remaining pantheon is woefully underused .
Apollo and Hermes get about a line each while the rest stand around like nicely - dressed props .
Sam Worthington has certainly been making a name for himself recently headlining high profile genre films like Avatar and Terminator : Salvation .
Unfortunately , this is the least of these films .
The part of Perseus is barely written and what is on the page leaves Worthington no option but to growl and snarl all his lines .
But the film ’s main problem is that it takes itself as seriously as a film like 300 or Gladiator when there is no call for it in the material .
This affects the action to the point where it becomes more of an exercise in executing something visually challenging to create rather sequences that are fun or thrilling to watch .
Clash Of The Titans also becomes yet another film to make the mistake in thinking that fast , frantic editing is more exciting , when it is usually dreadfully confusing and dull .
This is a pity as I greatly enjoyed Leterrier ’s work on The Incredible Hulk just two summers ago .
Letterier does manage to squeeze in a nod to the original film , but not is it only cringe - inducing , it comes off as snide and condescending .
Perhaps someone should have reminded them that if it were n’t for the original , no one involved would have been collecting a paycheck for this cinematic catastrophe .
President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE plans to ask Congress for a tool similar to a line - item veto that would let him single out new spending for cuts .
The president will send to the Hill before the Memorial Day recess a proposal for " enhanced rescission authority , " under which he could propose cuts to a spending measure within 45 days after signing it into law , an administration official said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Congress would then have to vote on the president 's cuts as a package that could n't be amended , the official said .
The line - item veto sought by past presidents , notably President Ronald Reagan , would have let them strip specific items from spending bills before signing them into law .
But after Congress passed and Presidentsigned such legislation , the Supreme Court in 1998 struck it down .
The Court ruled that the president can't veto portions of a spending bill and must instead " approve all the parts of a bill , or reject it in toto .
" The White House is proposing the new power to cut spending as Democrats try to grapple with large deficits , which the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) expects will average nearly $ 1 trillion for the next decade .
Wary of subjecting Democratic lawmakers to a tough vote on the debt in an election year , congressional leaders have yet to decide whether to push for the annual budget resolution .
The administration official noted that rescission power is part of a " bigger picture " in the administration 's efforts to deal with the deficits .
The president has established a bipartisan fiscal commission of lawmakers and economic experts to produce a plan to reduce red ink .
He has also called for a three - year freeze on discretionary spending unrelated to national security .
Lawmakers from both parties who back a presidential line - item veto praised Obama 's latest proposal but said he needs to do more to tackle spending .
" While an important tool , a line - item veto cannot stop Washington ’s unchecked spending spree and the glaring lack of a budget for the upcoming fiscal year , " said Rep . ( R- Wis. ) , who has proposed a line - item veto bill with Sens . ( R- Ariz . ) and Russ Feingold ( D - Wis . ) .
Ryan said he 's " eager " to work with the president and lawmakers to pass a line - item veto that 's constitutional .
Feingold said he was " very pleased " by news that Obama will push for the rescission power .
" With soaring deficits , we need more tools to stop unnecessary and wasteful spending that Congress has so far been unwilling to give up , " Feingold said in a statement .
Any measure that looks like line - item veto would likely run into opposition by Congressional leaders and members of the House and Senate Appropriations committees , the lawmakers in charge of the spending bills that would be affected by new presidential rescission powers .
Four years ago , then - Senate Minority Leader ( D - Nev. ) said he likes " the line - item veto about like I like a bad sore throat .
" Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) also opposed a line - item veto when President George W. Bush backed it .
Joe Minarik , a senior official in Clinton 's White House Office of Management and Budget , said that Republicans , hoping for congressional majorities in coming years , will be reluctant to give Obama more power while Democrats may be divided over the proposal .
"
On the one hand , they 'll want to support the president and show party unity , " Minarik said .
" On the other hand , you 'll have members who support the prerogatives of the Congress [ on spending bills ] . "

Somehow dotcom mania never ended in California .
After California granted disastrous 20 - 50 % benefit increases to unions in 1999 , the state 's pension plans justified the huge future cost by forecasting bubble - style stock market returns for the next hundred years .
This was most likely done in order to project inflated future asset values which matched the future liabilities .
The Economist :
In 1999 the dotcom bubble was still inflating , and the plans ’ actuaries predicted that their retirement funds would gain enough value to pay the increased pensions .
By implication , they assumed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach 25,000 in 2009 and 28 m in 2099 .
It is currently at around 10,300 .
Thing is , they held to these ridiculous forecasts even well after it was obvious to everyone that the dotcom era 's returns were over .
The Dow 's pre-crisis peak in 2007 was n't anywhere near 25,000 .
It was just above 14,000 .
Moreover , the Dow is clearly not going to reach 28 million by the end of the century .
Thus everyone related to California 's pensions must have known for quite some time that the underlying assumptions were way too high .
Yet , absurdly , when someone tried to correct these obviously broken assumptions , he was kicked out :
A few years ago Mr Crane [ Mr. Schwarzenegger 's economic advisor ] tried , as a board member of the teachers ’ pension plan ( CalSTERS ) , to make the assumptions more sane .
His fellow Democrats voted him off the board .
But since then the stock market has fallen sharply and California has tipped into budget crisis , exacerbated by the additional contributions that taxpayers are obliged to make to top up the public - sector pension funds .
On the same day that Mr Schwarzenegger struck his deal with the unions , for instance , CalPERS ordered the state to increase its annual pension payment to almost $ 4 billion .
Two studies estimate California ’s unfunded pension liability at about half a trillion dollars , almost seven times its official debt .
So we 're stuck with half a trillion dollars of unfunded promises to California 's public sector workers , thanks to forecast assumptions so bogus that , rather than merely ' bad ' forecasts , they border on being plain lies .
By the end of 2011 , two thirds of U.S. airline passengers will be asked to step through one of 1,000 new Rapiscan X - ray machines .
But some scientists are concerned about the unprecedented radiation exposure coming along with them .

Specifically , they 're worried about the half of the machines that are classified as back - scatter scanners , which use low - energy X - rays to peek underneath passengers ' clothes .
Such machines are already in place at 23 American airports , but by the end of next year they 'll be a security standard .

That has many scientists very concerned .
A group headed by a biochemist from the University of California , San Francisco , says that any ionizing radiation can potentially lead to chromosome damage and , eventually , cancer .
He and his colleagues have written a letter to the President 's science advisor urging for further studies on the effects of radiation from the new scanners .
David Brenner , who heads Columbia University 's Center for Radiological Research , does n't think that the small dose of radiation from the scanners poses much of a risk to most individuals , but the scale of the operation — and the fact it will include a small percentage of the population who may be unwittingly sensitive to radiation — is problematic .
NPR explains :
" There really is no other technology around where we 're planning to X - ray such an enormous number of individuals , " Brenner told the caucus and congressional staffers .
" It 's really unprecedented in the radiation world ... "
Recent research , Brenner says , indicates that about 5 percent of the population - one person in 20 - is especially sensitive to radiation .
These people have gene mutations that make them less able to repair X - ray damage to their DNA .
Two examples are the BRCA - 1 and BRCA - 2 mutations associated with breast and ovarian cancer , but scientists believe many more such defects are unknown .
" I do n't know if I 'm one of those 5 percent .
I do n't know if you 're one of those 5 percent , " Brenner says , " And we do n't really have a quick and easy test to find those individuals . "

TSA and FDA officials say that the radiation from the new Rapiscan machines is negligible , and point out that scanning is technically optional , but it 's hard to take their word — which can't totally be divorced from the multi-million dollar government investment the machines entail — over that of the leading researchers in the field .
Just file it in the back of your mind as one more thing to worry about when you 're flying next year .

PAY SCALE PAY SCALE Paychecks from private business shrank to their smallest share of personal income in U.S. history during the first quarter of this year , a USA TODAY analysis of government data finds .
At the same time , government - provided benefits — from Social Security , unemployment insurance , food stamps and other programs — rose to a record high during the first three months of 2010 .
Those records reflect a long - term trend accelerated by the recession and the federal stimulus program to counteract the downturn .
The result is a major shift in the source of personal income from private wages to government programs .
The trend is not sustainable , says University of Michigan economist Donald Grimes .
Reason :
The federal government depends on private wages to generate income taxes to pay for its ever - more - expensive programs .
Government - generated income is taxed at lower rates or not at all , he says .
" This is really important , " Grimes says .

The recession has erased 8 million private jobs .
Even before the downturn , private wages were eroding because of the substitution of health and pension benefits for taxable salaries .
The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that individuals received income from all sources — wages , investments , food stamps , etc. — at a $ 12.2 trillion annual rate in the first quarter .
Key shifts in income this year : • Private wages .
A record - low 41.9 % of the nation 's personal income came from private wages and salaries in the first quarter , down from 44.6 % when the recession began in December 2007 .
• Government benefits .
Individuals got 17.9 % of their income from government programs in the first quarter , up from 14.2 % when the recession started .
Programs for the elderly , the poor and the unemployed all grew in cost and importance .
An additional 9.8 % of personal income was paid as wages to government employees .
The shift in income shows that the federal government 's stimulus efforts have been effective , says Paul Van de Water , an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
" It 's the system working as it should , " Van de Water says .
Government is stimulating growth and helping people in need , he says .
As the economy recovers , private wages will rebound , he says .
Economist Veronique de Rugy of the free - market Mercatus Center at George Mason University says the riots in Greece over cutting benefits to close a huge budget deficit are a warning about unsustainable income programs .
Economist David Henderson of the conservative Hoover Institution says a shift from private wages to government benefits saps the economy of dynamism .
" People are paid for being rather than for producing , " he says .

A board member with the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) — the organization that approves open source licenses — has warned that there are " some serious questions " surrounding Google 's swashbuckling efforts to create an open and royalty - free codec for web video .
Hoping to defend the VP8 codec against patent attack , Google has open sourced the technology under a new license that includes some patent - centric language , but it has yet to submit the license for OSI approval .
With a Monday blog post , OSI director Simon Phipps questioned whether there 's a hole in the license that could expose users to third - party patent holders , and he urged Google to join hands with the OSI on the project , saying that before it does so , the codec can not be considered open source .
But he also urged Google to release more information about the patents backing the technology so that software makers can adopt it with added confidence .
And he called on the company to work with an open standards organization with a strong patent disclosure policy .
At the same time , Phipps — the former head of open source at Sun Microsystems — took a jab or two at Google for building a new license after criticizing others for " license proliferation . "
But he tells
The Reg that the primary aim is to bring Google to the table , and Google open source guru Chris DiBona has told us that the company intends to approach the OSI " in the coming weeks . "
Last week , at its annual Google I/O developer conference , Mountain View announced that VP8 had been open sourced under a royalty - free license , hoping to challenge the patent - backed H.264 codec favored by Apple and Microsoft .
Acquired last year when Google purchased video compression outfit On2 Technologies in a deal worth $ 124.6 million , VP8 has been rolled into a larger media format known as WebM , and it has already been included in developer - build browsers from Mozilla and Opera .
With his blog post , the OSI 's Simon Phipps called Google 's move " a positive and welcome development , " praising the company for offering an alternative to H.264 and the existing open source codec Ogg Theora .
And he pointed out that Google had " done their homework " in securing the backing of Mozilla , Opera , and even Flash - maker Adobe .
But his post was meant to show that more homework lies ahead .
" Once all the hoopla had died down , it became clear there are some serious questions that need considering , " he said .
For starters , there 's the license issue .
Google has used a new license to open source VP8 , and at Google I / O last week , the company told us the license had not been submitted to the Open Source Initiative .
Product manager Mike Jazayeri said that Google will " certainly follow the best practices " where the license is concerned , but it still has n't submitted it to the OSI , and Phipps questions whether the license can be approved without changes .
Google 's license is essentially a BSD that has been modified to include language that provides the licensee with patent rights to the technology and at the same time prevents them from using other patents to file an infringement suit against the technology .
" The main difference between the standard BSD license and the VP8 license is that this license grants patent rights , and terminates if patent litigation is filed alleging infringement of the code , " Google says in a WebM FAQ .
The addition is a bastardized version of language that appears in the Apache 2 license .
Like Apache 2 , Google rescinds patent rights if you file suit , but it also rescinds your right to use the technology .
" The main reason it was not used is that filing patent litigation against someone using the Apache 2 license only terminates patent rights granted under the license .
Whoever filed the litigation would still be able to use the software they are suing over and still be in compliance with the license , " Google 's FAQ says .
" This license , however , terminates all rights when patent litigation is filed .
Rather than modify the Apache license to meet our needs , which would probably lead to significant confusion , we went with the simpler approach of a BSD style license + patent provision . "
Simon Phipps questions whether the added language is a stumbling block .
" As it stands it possibly can't be approved due to Google 's ironic inclusion of a ' field of use ' restriction in the patent grant ( which is restricted to ' this implementation of VP8 ' rather than the more general grant in the Apache license from which the text started ) , " he wrote .
Whereas Google specifically refers to " this implementation of VP8 , " the Apache license simply refers to " the work . "
Phipps wonders whether Google 's license still grants patent rights if someone uses only a portion of the VP8 code and not the whole thing .
" One of the questions I would ask is : ' Does this narrowing of the language cause any problems ? ' " he told The Reg .
" And that 's the sort of question that gets answered during an OSI license review . "

Four - legged creatures may have gained a foothold by ditching genes guiding fin development .
Actinodin genes code for rigid fibres in zebrafish embryo fin buds .
Neither genes nor fibres are found in mouse embryo limb buds .
Jing Zhang
The loss of genes that guide the development of fins may help to explain how fish evolved into four - limbed vertebrates , according to a study .
In the late Devonian period , around 365 million years ago , fish - like creatures started venturing from shallow waters onto land with the help of eight - fingered limbs .
The limbs had evolved from fins ; during the transition , our back - boned ancestors lost rows of rigid fibres , called actinotrichia , that provide structural support and guide fin development .
The number of digits was also later winnowed to a maximum of five on each limb .
Marie - Andrée Akimenko of the University of Ottawa in Canada and her colleagues may now be able to explain how our ancestors lost their fins : they have discovered a family of genes that code for the proteins that make up fins ' rigid fibres .
The actinodin ( and ) genes are present in the laboratory model zebrafish and in ancient fish , but not in four - legged vertebrates ( tetrapods ) , the team report today in the journal Nature1 .
What 's more , the researchers found that dampening the expression of and genes in zebrafish also disrupts the expression of genes that regulate the growth of limbs and the number of digits in other animals .
“ The real question is : did we lose these genes because we lost the use of fins , or did we lose fins because we lost the genes ? ”
Denis Duboule
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Lausanne
These results hint that the loss of and genes is linked to the change from fins to limbs .
" It 's a very nice example of how changes in one or two genes can be responsible for a huge evolutionary transition , " says Axel Meyer , a biologist at the University of Konstanz in Germany who studies gene evolution in fish .
But a causal connection is not certain .
" The real question is : did we lose these genes because we lost the use of fins , or did we lose fins because we lost the genes ? " says Denis Duboule , an evolutionary developmental biologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne ( EPFL ) .
" The problem is that when it 's an evolutionary question , you can't do the experiment . "
and action
The researchers looked for genes that were most actively expressed in zebrafish fins that were regrowing after amputation , and pinpointed two with previously unknown functions .
Both genes code for proteins that make up a complex collagen - like structure called elastoidin , which is found in actinotrichia .
Akimenko's team also searched the zebrafish genome database and found two additional genes that they predict produce similar proteins .
The expression of all four and genes tracked the appearance of actinotrichia in the zebrafish embryo and in the regenerating fins of adults .
Databases for other bony fish also contain the genes , but they are not found in tetrapods .
The gene family may have very ancient roots , as a partial and - like sequence appears in the genome of the elephant shark , which evolved 450 million years ago and is part of the oldest living family of jawed vertebrates .
The team went on to use morpholinos ( small molecules that bind to RNA and prevent the manufacture of proteins ) to dampen the expression of two and genes in zebrafish embryos .
They found no actinotrichia in the embryonic folds that would normally give rise to fins , and the folds were underdeveloped and curled over .
When they disrupted the two genes in the regenerating fins of adults in the same way , they found that the distribution of actinotrichia was affected .
Furthermore , zebrafish with reduced and expression showed abnormal expression of genes that regulate the growth of limbs and digits .
When similarly abnormal in other animals , these genes can cause the growth of extra digits , like those seen in the early eight - fingered land vertebrates .
You lose some , you win some
" We tend to think that new genes bring new functions , but this study shows that the presence of genes constrains or directs development in certain directions , " says Meyer .
" Gene loss is actually a creative force in evolution . "
The study was limited to only a few days by the short lifespan of the RNA - blocking morpholinos , so it was not possible for Akimenko to determine whether disrupting the and genes also prevents the formation of other parts of the fin skeleton that disappeared during the fin - to - limb transition .

In the future , she plans to introduce and genes into mice and observe the effects on limb development .
She would also like to examine the role of the other two and genes and determine how they are regulated .
The genes were not the only factor in the evolution of fins into limbs , however : " this is only one little piece of the puzzle that may help us to understand this transition , " Akimenko says .

C is the classic go - to tool for small programs that need to be really fast .
When scripts .
mit.edu needed a small program to be a glorified cat that also added useful HTTP headers to the beginning of its output , there was no question about it : it would be written in C , and it would be fast ; the speed of our static content serving depended on it !
( The grotty technical details : our webserver is based off of a networked filesystem , and we wanted to avoid giving Apache too many credentials in case it got compromised .
Thus , we patched our kernel to enforce an extra stipulation that you must be running as some user id in order to read those files off the filesystem .
Apache runs as it's own user , so we need another small program to act as the go - between . )
It 's also a frankenscript , a program that grew out of the very specific needs of our project that you will not find anywhere else in the world .
As such , it 's critically important that the program is concise and well - defined ; both properties that are quite hard to get in C code .
And it only gets worse when you want to add features .
There were a number of small features ( last modified by headers , byte ranges ) as well as a number of large features ( FastCGI support ) .
None of the development team was relishing the thought of doubling the size of the C file to add all of these enhancements , and rewriting the program in a scripting language would cause a performance hit .
Benchmarks of replacing the script with a Perl CGI made the script ten times slower ( this translates into four times slower when doing an end - to - end Apache test ) .
But there is another way !
Anders writes :
So I had this realization : replacing it with a compiled Haskell CGI script would probably let us keep the same performance .
Plus it would be easy to port to FastCGI since Haskell ’s FastCGI library has the same interface .
And a few weeks later , voila : static - cat in Haskell .
We then saw the following benchmarks :
$ ab -n 100 http://andersk.scripts.mit.edu/static-cat.cgi/hello/hello.html
Requests per second : 15.68 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) $ ab -n 100 http://andersk.scripts.mit.edu/static-cat.perl.cgi/hello/hello.html
Requests per second : 7.50 [ #/sec ] ( mean ) $ ab -n 100 http://andersk.scripts.mit.edu/static-cat.c.cgi/hello/hello.html
Requests per second : 16.59 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Microbenchmarking reveals a 4 ms difference without Apache , which Anders suspects is due to the size of the Haskell executable .
There is certainly some performance snooping to be done , but the Haskell version is more than twice as fast as the Perl version on the end - to - end test .
More generally , the class of languages ( Haskell is just one of a few ) that compile into native code seem to be becoming more and more attractive replacements for tight C programs with high performance requirements .
This is quite exciting , although it hinges on whether or not you can convince your development team that introducing Haskell to the mix of languages you use is a good idea .
More on this in another blog post .
Rebels manufacturing massive quantities of drugs to sell for missiles and guns as they plan fight against junta
Elections promised for Burma this year have sparked an explosion in drug trafficking into Thailand , as rebel armies , fearful of a final , pre-poll crackdown by the ruling junta , trade heroin and amphetamines for guns .
For decades rebel armies , most notably the Wa State Army , have financed their fight against the oppressive Burma junta by running drugs over the border , from where they are trafficked all over the world .
A decade ago the Golden Triangle between Thailand , Burma and Laos supplied half the world 's heroin .
Afghanistan now produces more , but drug barons in Burma have turned to manufacturing massive quantities of amphetamines and methamphetamines – which can be produced cheaply in small , hidden laboratories , without the need for acres of exposed land .
Now Burma 's illicit drug trade and the country 's flawed electoral process appear set to collide .
The Burmese junta has promised elections sometime this year , probably in October , though few in the international community expect them to be free or fair .
The ruling generals have vowed to bring the rebel armies under their command , and turn them into border guard forces , before the polls are held .
With the deadline for the Wa to come under central government control gone , its leaders have become increasingly worried about being attacked by government troops .
Colonel Peeranate Gatetem , head of the Thai army 's anti-drug Pha Muang task force , said the number of drug runs had increased exponentially in recent months , as a desperate Wa – outnumbered and outgunned by the junta 's troops – prepares to fight .
" This year will be the biggest for amphetamines , " Peeranate said .
" In all of last year we intercepted 1.2 m pills .
This year , in just six months , already we have seized 5 m . "
He added that they were uncovering what they believe to be only a tiny fraction of what is being brought across the border , by most estimates between 1 % and 2 % .
" The amphetamine trade is huge now , we think it will be around 300 m to 400 m pills this year .
But it is hard to know . "
Sources from within Burma say the drug laboratories are working around the clock , with more under construction .
In February , 15 smugglers were intercepted carrying 1.2 m pills between them , and there have been reports of up to 30 Wa soldiers , in full uniform , marching through the forests fully laden .
The UN's Office on Drugs and Crime has also registered a rise in drug trafficking .
" Minority groups that feel under threat from the central government are using drug trafficking to sustain themselves and keep control of their territories , " Gary Lewis , a UN representative , said .
With the money it is making , Peeranate added , the Wa was arming with surface - to - air missiles bought from China , and AK - 47 assault rifles .
" They are preparing for war .
" The Burmese government wants the Wa to disarm , come under government control and become a border guard force .
But the Wa will not ever agree to do that , so they are preparing for the government troops to move in on them .
" They are getting ready to fight .
They are selling more and more drugs so they can buy weapons to fight the government . "
The Guardian spoke to Wa soldiers just over the border , in Burma , about halfway between the Thai army border camp and Wa camp .
" Burmese Army bad .
They come shoot , shoot , " one soldier said through an interpreter , mimicking machine gun fire .
The Wa will not participate in the election , he added , because it refuses to co-operate with the junta it says is illegitimate and brutal .
" We protect our territory .
We fight for [ our ] people . "
The Wa refuse to discuss drugs , but he added : " Our life here is hard … we always need to make money some way , any way to feed our people .
We need to survive . "
In Thailand a former Wa drug runner , who now works undercover for the Thai army gathering intelligence on shipments , said : " The Wa are very worried , they think junta 's soldiers are coming soon … the soldiers are afraid .
They sell the drugs to buy many , many guns , so they can fight .
" The Wa fighters will be ready , and they will fight . "
Last week , the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus held a press conference with RIAA CEO Mitch Bainwol .
They rolled out a new list of six horrific websites that make copyright infringement simple — and that just might destroy your job and family .
" An Internet of chaos may meet a utopian vision but surely undermines the societal values of safe and secure families and job and revenue - creating commerce , " said Bainwol .
" Shining the spotlight on these websites sends a vital message to users , advertisers , payment processors and governments around the world . "
Canadian - based isoHunt found itself on the list and it was n't pleased about the inclusion .
" One person 's ' worst search engine ' is another person 's ' robust search engine ' , " said is oHunt 's attorney , Ira Rothken , when I spoke with him this week .
" If the RIAA has a problem with the manifestation of torrent files throughout the world on the Internet , " he added , the group should take it out on those who host the torrent files .
isoHunt is just a search engine , he argues , citing a 90 percent overlap between the torrent files indexed by isoHunt and torrent files available through a Google search .
This " mere search engine " argument did n't save The Pirate Bay under Swedish law ( though an appeal is pending ) , and it did n't save is oHunt under American law .
is
oHunt has been targeted in a long - running copyright infringement lawsuit in a California federal court , and a judge issued a summary judgment against the site last year .
isoHunt was liable for " inducing infringement . "
Ira Rothken
Last week , another blow fell as the judge issued a tough permanent injunction against isoHunt , demanding that it implement tough keyword - filtering rules based on movie titles submitted by rightsholders .
It also must block such piratical search terms as " warez , " telecine , " and " jaybob . "
Still , Rothken remains adamant that the site " does n't do anything more than what a good , automated search engine ought to do . "
In our conversation , he made the case that search was simply too important to suffer these sorts of blanket injunctions .
" Should we as a society not allow torrent search engines because some groups like the major studios do n't like the state of the Internet as it relates to .torrent files ? " he asks .
The answer to that question will soon provide another piece of key judicial precedent for these types of cases .
Just another search engine ?
Rothken 's basic contention remains that is oHunt is a search engine , nothing more .
Even if the site ran a tracker ( its US - facing tracker was turned off in 2007 ) , he says , it adds nothing to the basic argument about infringing behavior .
" Trackers do not have any content going through them , " says Rothken , comparing them favorably to sites like YouTube , which actually host infringing content themselves .
And other search engines link to loads of infringing content , even beyond . torrent files .
Do a simple image search for any celebrity on Google , for instance , and many of the responses and thumbnails ( which Google even caches on its own servers ) are unauthorized and copyrighted .
" We all recognize that the greater good is to allow for robust search , " says Rothken .
But is
oHunt is n't like mainstream search engines in one key respect : it indexes only torrent files , a format used largely to distribute copyrighted material without authorization .
Instead of scooping up torrents as part of its quest to index everything , isoHunt makes torrents its business .
Rothken concedes that the distinction " may have a bearing on the optics of the case , " but argues that it " should n't have a bearing on the substance of the case . "
I press on this point : how can the quantity of infringement not matter at all ?
If some new technology was used to break the law 999,999 times , but the millionth use was a legal one , would n't the sheer scale matter to a court ?
" It may matter to a court right now , " Rothken allows , but he says that it should n't .
Search is just too important to society .
" Regardless of the percentage of files , even if it's a large percentage of those files that ultimately will lead to downstream content that 's unauthorized , search of that content should still be allowed ...
When you look at the total picture ... do we believe that search engines for . torrent files should be banned altogether ?
Most people would say no . "
Rightsholders are n't left without remedy here , it 's just that they do n't like the remedy : sending tens of thousands of DMCA takedown notices .
Unlike sites such as The Pirate Bay , which routinely mock takedown requests , isoHunt responds " every single time " to takedown requests , and those files are blocked by logging their hash values — identical copies will be kept out of the indexing system in future .
The federal trial court did recognize this , but it found that is oHunt 's " inducement " of copyright infringement to be the overriding factor .
Something similar happened to the Dutch P2P search engine Mininova last year ; despite taking down links after a complaint , a Dutch judge said the site needed to exert some level of preemptive filtering due to the massive infringement it was facilitating .
" So vague and so ambiguous and so overbroad "
IsoHunt now faces the same restrictions in the US .
It must filter its index using lists of titles supplied by US movie studios , but Rothken objects to the expansiveness of the order .
It 's not " narrow , " he says , but " so vague and so ambiguous and so overbroad . "
In his view , the injunction will essentially force isoHunt to filter individual English words and numbers ... like " Firefox , " " Avatar , " " 10 " and " 24 . "
This is something of a blunt instrument — a German court recently recognized how that such filtering would lead to numerous false positives on a site like RapidShare .
Filename filters alone , especially when they filter single words , could catch all sorts of things : parodies , a short clip compilation of The Godfather with voiceover criticism , the Firefox browser .
None of this made much headway with the trial judge , who did not even let the case proceed to trial ( it was decided on summary judgment ) .
But Rothken says the case is important to isoHunt , to founder Gary Fung , and to society , so he will pursue the case in " every court that will hear us . "
isoHunt is currently asking for a stay of the injunction and plans to appeal the case .

Multiclavula vernalis hits Hampshire
A rare fungus has been sighted in England for the first time .
The fungus Multiclavula vernalis , which forms a tiny , orange fruiting body , was found in Hampshire on land used for training by the British Army .
Experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew confirmed the fungus 's identity .
The fungus usually prefers much colder climates and has only previously been recorded in the British Isles in the Outer Hebrides and on the Shetland Isles .
Moving south Keith Blackmore , assistant reserves and grazing project officer for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust , found the small patch of tiny , orange , club - shaped fungi on a site owned and used by the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) for army training .
" I knew it was a very unusual discovery when I saw it but I did n't know exactly what it was , " said Blackmore .
MORE ABOUT FUNGI
Find out more about fungi diversity " Having sought expert advice , I 'm really thrilled to find out it 's an exciting first for England .
It 's a great addition to the flora and fauna that already exists on these wonderful wildlife reserves . "
Samples were sent to the head of mycology at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , who confirmed their identity as Multiclavula vernalis , a fungus rare in the British Isles and never recorded in England before .
It is usually found in colder climes , either nearer the Arctic Circle or in mountainous regions .

They have worked four years , often longer , juggling jobs and classes , cramming for finals , studying abroad working internships — all with the hope of finding a career foothold despite the worst job market since the Great Depression .
More than 11,000 members of the Class of 2010 from Oregon ’s seven public universities capped their hard work with commencement ceremonies this week and last .
Now , they move on either to graduate school or to join more than 212,000 other Oregonians looking for work , including untold thousands of last year ’s graduates still searching for jobs .
Many from the Class of 2009 are living with their parents and working part - time retail jobs they could have landed without a degree .
Others are taking more college classes to put off paying back student loans , which average more than $ 20,000 .
Many say they ’ve lost self - confidence .
Still , none of the 18 students from the Classes of 2009 and 2010 interviewed by The Oregonian expressed regret about going to college .
Job prospects for the Class of 2010 , which number about 18,000 students in Oregon when you include those who graduated last fall and winter , are slightly brighter because of a recent increase in employers hiring college graduates , said Edwin W. Koc , research director for the
What ’s more , recruiters will focus on the Class of 2010 , he said .
“ If you come out of the Class of 2009 , you are going to be treated as someone who has been in the job market for a year , ” he said .
Employers want to see some experience , he said .
After a yearlong search , Jackie Mroz , 22 , of Oregon City , is about to get some experience , but at a cost .
She put everything she had into her studies at the
, graduating in 2009 with degrees in international studies and sociology and a double minor in nonprofit administration and African studies .
She studied abroad in Senegal , took challenging courses , earned a 3.8 grade point average and raced through college in three years .
“ It has gotten me pretty much nowhere , ” she said .
When she graduated , Mroz figured she would quickly land a job with an international nonprofit .
After two months , she took on a catering job as she broadened her search .
Still living with her parents in Oregon City , she sent out more than 70 carefully prepared job applications and resumes .
“ I never got a single interview , except for the catering company , ” she said .
By March , she had added three more catering jobs .
“ I have gone through weeks when I completely doubted myself , ” she said .
“ What am I doing wrong ?
It is a question I ask everyday .
.... After a year of getting basically no response , you start giving up . ”
Mroz recently drove cross-country for a 3 - month unpaid internship that she started last week with a nonprofit agency in Baltimore .
The agency helps refugee immigrants settle in the United States .
After that internship ends , she will pay her way to Kenya for a community development internship through the San Francisco - based Foundation for Sustainable Development .
If those experiences do n’t lead to jobs , Mroz said , she ’ll consider graduate school .
Of course some graduates are landing jobs , particularly those with specific technical skills such as John Yeier , 24 , who graduated from the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls on Saturday .
He ’s the sole member of his class with a degree in embedded engineering , which integrates computer software and hardware in cell phones , cars and other machines .
He will work on small plane navigation system software for Garmin AT in Salem .
OIT Class of 2009 graduates also have been unusually successful because they study for technical jobs such as nursing , medical imaging , mechanical engineering and dental hygiene .
A survey of the class , with 58 percent responding , found that 71 percent have found jobs related to their degrees and another 21 percent are working .
A recent national survey of more than 13,000 graduates in the Class of 2010 shows that about one in four who applied for jobs will have one waiting for them after they graduate .
That ’s up from one in five students who landed jobs last year , but far below the one in two graduates who found work in 2007 .
The
job bank lists 14,373 job openings , but they are most prevalent in low - paying occupations that do n’t require college degrees such as retail sales , trucking and housekeeping .
Audra Armen - Van Horn , 23 , Portland , worked for Victoria ’s Secret while earning her psychology degree from the University of Oregon .
Now , a year after graduating in 2009 and applying for more than 100 jobs , she ’s still working part time for the store while hoping to get a job with the American Cancer Society .
“ I have a bachelor ’s degree , and I ’m making $ 8.50 an hour , ” she said .
“ It is pretty depressing .
.¤.¤.
But it is a job .
I ’m happy I have a job . ”
Malcolm Staudinger , 22 , a 2009 graduate in environmental science from
lives at home with his parents in Vancouver , Wash . , and is now looking to Montana and Alaska for a job related to geographic information systems .
“ I apply probably for half a dozen jobs a week and have gotten maybe three or four interviews in the past year , ” he said .
“ It is tough because it makes you doubt yourself .
You feel like you have these great skills and worked hard and you are constantly getting passed over again and again and again . ”
This year the college majors delivering the best job prospects are accounting , business administration , computer science , engineering and mathematics , said Koc of the Association of Colleges and Employers .
The major with the dimmest prospects - teaching .
“ This is the worst I ’ve seen for education majors , ” he said .
Mindy Lary , 27 , Beaverton , can testify to that .
She graduated in 2009 with a Master of Art in elementary school teaching from the
and has been substitute teaching since .
“ I applied for 75 teaching jobs , anything within an hour ’s drive of the Portland area , and I did n’t even get an interview , ” she said .
Some recent graduates are trying to create their own jobs .
Lisa Anderson , 23 , a 2009 journalism graduate from the University of Oregon and receptionist for a Portland law firm , has joined five other journalism graduates in starting a men ’s clothing magazine and website .
“ We printed our first issue in March , ” she said .
“ It is definitely a labor of love . ”
Linda Williams Favero , assistant director of the
in Portland , said the job market for college graduates is improving .
She helps students and recent graduates polish their job hunting in a 6 - session , 3 - week seminar .
By the time participants finish her class , half have a job or prospects for one , she said .
One day last month , Favero advised nine recent graduates taking her seminar to treat their job search as though it were a full - time job .
Tap social networks for job contacts , she advised , and organize information interviews with potential employers , prepare a 30 - second elevator job pitch , polish your resume and keep positive .
Matt Petryni , 24 , a 2009 UO graduate , said the seminar has helped him regain hope after a discouraging year of rejections from the world of urban planning where he hopes to work .
He ’s heartened by seeing other graduates land jobs , he said .
“ So it is not impossible , ” he said .
“ That is good to hear right now . ”

I know it ’s too early to speak about WordPress 3.0 , but I ’ve been playing around with some of it ’s enhancements the other week , and ..
Well , this is a miracle , really .
Remember all those plugins promising custom post types in versions prior to 3.0 .
Those that never get updated and show themselves glitchy sometimes , especially during upgrades ?
Well the time has come .
In version 3.0 the developers of WordPress introduce the custom post types .
I ’m not sure whether it ’ll be solely built into the API or also displayed as a GUI somewhere in the settings , but it does n’t require too much coding skills to add a couple via your functions .
php or a perhaps a plugin .
Well , first I ’d like to share a few thoughts of what could be accomplished using these custom post types , and I think that some of the first ones to appear would be
Photo Posts
Quotes
Chats
Audio / Podcasts
and of course Video
These are basically the things that you ’re allowed to post at Tumblr , but hey ?
We could already post these at the standard Posts type .
Exactly , we could !
But the custom types perhaps is a step to more organization , rather than functionality .
Why would we want to play around with custom fields , or add stupid meta boxes in the Edit Posts page and then teach our clients and / or content managers to use them ?
Why not just get rid of all those stuff and have them seperately in your main menu , and the meta boxes are customized to match the exact needs of certain post types .
For instance , why should the Edit Post page contain the ability to attach an audio file if it wo n’t be used 50 % of the time ?
Or why would Quotes contain post revisions ?
Chats and Video posts would n’t require image posting , right ?
This way you can talk to your client or content manager in a certain way :
John , could you please add a new Podcast ?
Here ’s the MP3 file .
Instead of
John , I need you to add this MP3 file as a Podcast – please add a new post , then in the box on the right you should pick that your post type is a Podcast , then a little bit lower in the next box you should upload this audio file , and also please make sure that you check the Podcasts category before you publish .
No , John , do n’t touch the Video box , we use that for video posts .
No , leave the custom fields as they are , you should never touch that area
See what I mean ?
Manipulating also comes in clean and handy .
You do n’t have to sort different post types into different categories , then use the Edit Posts screen and set filters to a certain category to get a list of Podcasts .
Wow ..
Also , once your post is a Podcast , it does n’t hurt your eyes in the Edit Posts section , it ’s not visible there at all .
Once a Podcast – always a Podcast ;)
Awesome is n’t it ?
More awesome is the way you can customize the columns in the Edit screen to fit your needs , for each and every post type !
Take a look at this Podcasts Edit screen example :
Now is n’t that awesome ?
I bet it is !
So what else could be done with WordPress ’ Custom Post Types ?
Well , basically anything .
Say you run an online store which of course has some static Pages ( such as Contact , About , etc ) , some blog Posts , cause we ’re so 2.0 , remember ?
And Products , which would be a custom post type that contains the product name , description , product price , stock availability , and could even contain inquiries in forms of user comments !
One more example – a Real Estate Agency , same story – Pages , Blog Posts , News stories , property For Sale , property For Rent , Land for sale .
The last three would contain extra taxonomy in forms of Country , Region .
Custom fields such as price , total area , etc .
The Edit Property page could even contain a Google Map where you could point out its location !
Here ’s a screenshot :
Amazing !
Using Custom Post Types
Yeah , all this is good , but it gets even better as soon as you find out how easy it is to define ( register ) Custom Post Types in WordPress 3.0 !
Err..
This means that you have to actually switch to 3.0 before any of this works .
Read the article on Nightly Builds , switch to a 3.0 - dev branch and launch an upgrade .
You should be able to get 3.0 - alpha by now .
So let ’s try to add a Podcasts type and let ’s go straight to the code :
// Fire this during init register_post_type (' podcast ' , array ( ' label ' => __(' Podcasts ' ) , ' singular_label ' => __( ' Podcast ' ) , ' public ' => true , ' show_ui ' => true , ' capability_type ' => ' post ' , ' hierarchical ' => false , ' rewrite ' => false , ' query_var ' => false , ' supports ' => array ( ' title ' , ' editor ' , ' author ' ) ) ) ;
Oh my god !
Is that it ?
Yes !
I would n’t like to go through the parameters but you could read about them in the WordPress Codex – Function Reference : register_post_type .
Perhaps the tricky part would be with the custom columns ?
Nah :
add_action ( " manage_posts_custom_column " , " my_custom_columns " ) ; add_filter ( " manage_edit-podcast_columns " , " my_podcast_columns " ) ; function my_podcast_columns ( $ columns ) { $ columns = array ( " cb " => " < input type= " " checkbox " " /> " , " title " => " Podcast Title " , " description " => " Description " , " length " => " Length " , " speakers " => " Speakers " , " comments " => ' Comments ' ) ; return $ columns ; } function my_custom_columns ( $ column ) { global $ post ; if ( " ID " == $ column ) echo $ post -> ID ; elseif ( " description " == $ column ) echo $ post -> post_content ; elseif ( " length " == $ column ) echo " 63:50 " ; elseif ( " speakers " == $ column ) echo " Joel Spolsky " ; }
Whoot !
All done .
As seen in the code above , there ’s an action and a filter involved .
The action outputs custom columns depending on the type , while the filter simply defines the columns for the Podcasts post type .
It ’s as simple as that .
Note that I trimmed the code a little bit to fit on screen , so you should n’t be simply outputing 63:50 , but actually count the podcast length ;)
That ’s about it , folks !
Cheers , and say , What custom post types are you thinking of implementing in the first place ?
Please share via the comments .
Thanks !

Enlarge By Jeff Chiu , AP The new Apple iPhone 4 . Verizon Wireless will start selling Apple 's iPhone next year , ending AT&T's U.S. exclusive on the phone , say two people familiar with the plans .
The device will be available to customers in January , according to the people , who declined to be named because the information is n't public .
Natalie Kerris , an Apple spokeswoman , and Jeffrey Nelson , a Verizon Wireless spokesman , declined to comment .
AT&T also declined to comment .
USA TODAY was unable to independently verify the reports .
Speculation on a Verizon iPhone has been rampant in the tech blogosphere .
If the reports are true , the iPhone , which has been the sole domain of rival AT&T in the U.S. since June 2007 , will give Verizon a boost in its smartphone competition , UBS analyst John Hodulik says .
Verizon customers , who numbered 92.8 million at the end of the first quarter , may buy 3 million iPhones a quarter , he says .
iPHONE 4 SALES : Consumers buy 1.7 million in 3 days " Apple is going to dramatically increase the number of devices it sells in the U.S. when exclusivity at AT&T ends , " Hodulik says .
" It 's hard to ignore the quality issues that AT&T has faced . "
Verizon Wireless , which is building a high - speed fourth - generation network , plans to unveil several devices that will run on the new technology in January at the Consumer Electronics Show , CEO Lowell McAdam has said .
Verizon 's CDMA - based wireless network differs from the GSM technology AT&T 's network is based on .
The iPhone has helped AT&T add subscribers even as the U.S. mobile - phone market nears saturation .
In the first three months of this year , about a third of AT&T's iPhone activations came from customers new to the carrier .
Without those 900,000 new subscribers , AT&T might have posted a loss in contract customers that quarter , analysts say .
AT&T has battled customer complaints about its network and dedicated an extra $ 2 billion to upgrade it this year .
A Verizon partnership is a victory for Apple over rivals such as Research In Motion and Motorola , whose phones are promoted by the carrier .
Motorola makes Droid phones that use Google 's Android operating system .
RIM makes BlackBerrys .
" For Apple , it means a larger addressable market , " says Andy Hargreaves , an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities .
" It 's also good news for Apple in that it will spread the load on the wireless data networks . "
Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones since their introduction .
The latest version , iPhone 4 , sold more than 1.7 million units in the first three days after its June 24 debut .
A release at Verizon in the first quarter would help Apple 's sales in the U.S. grow to at least 15 million units next year from 11 million in 2010 , Barclays Capital analysts said in a note Tuesday .
Apple 's suppliers have been ramping up production of components for a phone on Verizon 's CDMA network , according to the research report .

Chief constables must get more officers on the beat despite tough spending cuts to come , the home secretary has said .
Theresa May told the Association of Chief Police Officers they must use budgets in the most useful way .
" Front - line availability should increase even as budgets contract , " she said , pledging to be " ruthless " on waste .
The association 's president Sir Hugh Orde had said it would be " misleading in the extreme " to claim police numbers were sustainable in the face of cuts .
Both addressed senior officers from England , Wales and Northern Ireland at Acpo's annual conference in Manchester on Tuesday .
ANALYSIS
There could be no clearer sign of budget - tightening at the Home Office than the sight of its most senior civil servant , Permanent Secretary Sir David Normington , travelling standard class to the Acpo conference with Policing Minister Nick Herbert .
But cheaper train fares wo n't come near to achieving the savings required .
Staffing cuts , as forces leave vacancies unfilled , and a two - year pay freeze starting from 2011 are beginning to look inevitable .
Compelling constabularies to reduce costs through merger is politically undeliverable , but a few forces - Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire possibly the first - may volunteer .
Ministers insist savings can be found from national procurement of equipment , kit and vehicles , by reducing bureaucracy through fewer targets and simpler processes , and by trimming central agencies .
A pay , conditions and pensions review is also under way , signalling huge upheaval for the police service in the years ahead .

Mrs May also announced she was scrapping immediately the performance targets and minimum standards introduced by Labour and would press on with her plan for locally - elected police commissioners .
Sir Hugh had earlier told the BBC that with 83 % of the policing budget being spent on staffing , it was likely that numbers would be reduced in the coming years .
He told the conference : " The harsh reality is that depending on the severity of cuts , it would be misleading in the extreme to suggest the size of this service is sustainable .
" Salami slicing which we 've done before will not deliver the level of cuts we anticipate .
" We have to strike a difficult balance between the understandable demand for more and more officers on the streets ... and the less visible but equally critical duties every chief constable undertakes on behalf of the citizens . "
Sir Hugh urged ministers to save cash through structural reforms , suggesting forces might merge units and back - office functions , or share expensive equipment , but warned that force mergers were unpopular with voters .
He has asked the government for more detail on how plans to introduce locally elected police commissioners will work but said operational independence remained key .
Mrs May said independence would not be compromised .
But she said accepting a new type of accountability was the price of scrapping targets and Labour 's 10 - point policing pledge , which included commitments to respond quickly to calls and keep victims informed about their case .
" Targets do n't fight crime , " she said .
" I could n't be any clearer about your mission ... it is to cut crime .
No more , and no less . "
On budget cuts , Mrs May added : " We 're not talking about a spending a freeze or a reduction of 1 % or 2 % .
The cuts will be big : they will be tough to achieve .
" I will be ruthless in cutting out waste , streamlining structures and improving efficiency . "
However , she said this could only go so far and that chief constables would have to increase the visibility and productivity of officers and community support officers .
Delegates were told that police officers and staff must also be ready to " make sacrifices " and " accept pay restraint " .
Meanwhile , Mrs May said the government was considering co-ordinating the procurement of items such as vehicles , uniforms and IT nationally , while Acpo is examining how forces buy and organise resources .
Ministers have mooted mergers between collaboration between forces to use civilian staff for paperwork duties .
Dale Bassett , of think tank Reform , agreed civilians might be " better suited " and " cheaper " for some roles .
" It 's really important that chief constables start to get out of this mindset that uniformed officers are the only way to go , " he told BBC Radio Five Live .
Responding to Mrs May 's speech , Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon said removing the policing pledge was " bold , brave and necessary " .
But his Lancashire counterpart Steve Finnigan said that " quite a few chief constables ... would say targets can be very helpful " in fighting crime .
Last week , Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said his force would " shrink " as a result of budget cuts .
The one - note drone of massed plastic horns is the soundtrack to the 2010 World Cup , and although they are upsetting lots of players and commentators , FIFA today seemed to rule out banning them .
But in the right hands - like those of musician Byron Wallen - it is another story .

The bill proposing a ban on the niqab or the kind of Muslim veil that covers the entire face , passed by the lower house of the Belgian parliament , is not really about religion , crime or even immigration .
It is about the primacy of state interests over individual preference .
James Scott in his Seeing like a State argues that modern governments need their populations to be “ legible ” or transparent .
In the UK , it has gotten so you cannot go so much as 50 miles without being photographed on closed circuit television .
The state interest is often asserted in niqab debates by arguing that the police have to know who it is they have pulled over for a moving vehicle violation .
Of course that the anonymous citizen is an “ other ” and coded as dangerous , makes state knowledge of the individual all the more imperative .
That it is not a purely east - west issue or Christian - Muslim one is easy to show .
First of all , I would estimate the majority of Muslim women in the world does not veil at all in the sense of consistently covering the hair or face , and there is dispute among historians as to whether it is even required in Qur’anic law .
In Pakistan until the last couple of decades , most women contented themselves with wearing a neck scarf that fell on their chest , called a dupatta , but wore no head covering .
But certainly virtually no mainstream Sunni or Shiite clerical authority requires the niqab or the full - face covering , which is a sign either of Salafi or Wahhabi extreme puritanism or of Gulf origins and culture .
I should n’t think more than .02 % of Muslim women in the world wears the niqab , and the biggest absolute number would be in Saudi Arabia alone .
Muslim states also have intervened in women ’s dress , for various purposes , from security to the promotion of ‘ state feminism ’ as a project of governmental shaping of citizens .
Turkey bans not only the full face veil but even just headscarves on public property , e.g. schools .
Likewise , in 2007 , Tajikistan forbade any veiling in public places
Of course , in the Soviet period the Muslim - heritage Central Asian Soviet Socialist Republics insisted that women give up the veil .
( See the footnotes for works of Northrop and Kamp on this issue , regarding the Hujum or public state - sponsored renunciation of the veil in Stalinist Uzbekistan ) .
Again , this move was a way of asserting the primacy of the state in a region where kinship and traditional elites such as the clergy presented strong rivals to government authority .
And the Soviet state was a jealous state .
In Egypt in the past few years , the rector of al - Azhar Seminary ( among the foremost such centers of Muslim religious study ) has forbidden the full - face veil ..
Al - Azhar takes this step because its faculty are mainstream Sunnis , and they fear more radical forms of Islam , such as the Salafi refomists or puritanical Wahhabis , many of whom insist that women wear the full face veil .
There is something of a rivalry between Gulf lifeways and those of the Levant , as well ( many Gulf women and / or their families prefer the niqab , while it is rare in the Mediterranean ) .
So in the Muslim world a ban on veiling has lots of potential meanings , from sectarian competition to a state preference for secularism .
Amnesty International and some Muslim organizations protested the ban as an infringement against individual liberty .
In a way , they are right .
This struggle is a way for the state and major social institutions to inscribe themselves on the bodies of women , the very citizens who produce other citizens .
Domenech ( right ) chose Anelka to start France 's first two games
France striker Nicolas Anelka has been sent home from the World Cup after verbally insulting coach Raymond Domenech during the Mexico game .
The Chelsea star missed training on Saturday after reports of a row with the France coach during their 2 - 0 loss .
And he later refused to apologise when asked to by French Football Federation president Jean - Pierre Escalettes .
An FFF statement said the 31 - year - old 's half - time comments to Domenech were " totally unacceptable " .
The statement continued : " Faced by the refusal of the player to publicly apologise , he ( Escalettes ) took the decision in total agreement with the coach and the official members of the delegation present to exclude Nicolas Anelka from the squad . "
606 : DEBATE France captain Patrice Evra also attended the meeting with Anelka at the French training camp in Knysa .
And Evra accused a " traitor " within the French camp of leaking the story to the media .
" The problem of France is not Anelka , but the traitor among us .
" We must eliminate the traitor from the group because he wants to hurt the team , " the Manchester United full - back said .
Anelka , a League and FA Cup double winner with Chelsea this season , has won 71 international caps .
He scored twice on his debut against England in 1999 but later spent three years in the international wilderness after refusing to play for Les Bleus under coach Jacques Santini .
France captain Evra was grim - faced as he gave his reaction to the story Domenech brought Anelka back into the fold in 2005 but left him out of France 's squad for the World Cup in Germany the following year .
It was only a temporary omission and Anelka scored in the first leg ofthe qualifying play - off against the Republic of Ireland last November when France secured their place in South Africa .
He was also in the starting line - up for both of France 's first group games but failed to hit the net in the 0 - 0 draw with Uruguay and the loss to Mexico .
France 's poor start to the competition has left their hopes of qualification from Group A out of their hands .
There were reports earlier in the week that Domenech had also had a training ground bust - up with midfielder Florent Malouda .
And the team has been urged to show greater dignity for the remainder of the tournament .
French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot said in a statement : " The very high pressure weighing on Les Bleus does not authorise any form of slip - up .
" The players must keep in mind that they 're wearing France 's colours and are considered as role models by many youngsters .
" This obliges them to show restraint and dignity . "
If Mexico and Uruguay draw in their final match , France will be eliminated .

( CNN ) --
At least 115 people have died after a tropical storm battered Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador over the weekend , officials in those countries reported .
Guatemala was hit hardest , with at least 92 deaths , 54 people missing and 59 injured , emergency officials said .
Nearly 112,000 people have been evacuated and more than 29,000 are living in temporary shelters , Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said in an address to the nation late Sunday .
The devastation has been widespread throughout Guatemala with mudslides destroying homes and buildings and burying some victims .
At least nine rivers have dramatically higher levels and 13 bridges have collapsed , the nation 's emergency services said .
In the northern part of Guatemala City , the downpour created a giant sinkhole that swallowed up a space larger than the area of a street intersection .
Residents told CNN that a three - story building and a house fell into the hole .
A local newspaper reported that a private security guard was killed when the sinkhole opened up , but authorities had not confirmed the fatality .
Residents said that a poor sewage drainage system underground was to blame for the sinkhole .
A similar hole opened up nearby last year , they said .
Classes have been canceled this week throughout the nation .
In Honduras , where 14 people have died , President Porfirio Lobo declared a state of emergency Sunday .
Nearly 3,500 people have been evacuated from their homes and nearly 3,300 are living in shelters , the Honduran emergency agency said Monday .
More than 140 homes have been destroyed and another 700 have been damaged , the Permanent Commission for Emergencies reported .
The situation in El Salvador , where nine people died , was improving Monday , officials said .
The rain stopped Sunday afternoon and river levels were beginning to diminish , officials said .
Classes nationwide remained canceled , however , until further notice .
More rain was possibly forecast for Monday , though , and Salvadoran officials said they were closely monitoring the situation .
Agatha was demoted from a tropical storm to a tropical depression Saturday night and lost its status as a depression Sunday evening .
It was the first named storm for the Pacific hurricane season .
The Atlantic hurricane season starts Tuesday .

In a controversial change to a longstanding policy concerning the practice of female circumcision in some African and Asian cultures , the American Academy of Pediatrics is suggesting that American doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial pinprick or “ nick ” on girls from these cultures if it would keep their families from sending them overseas for the full circumcision .
The academy ’s committee on bioethics , in a policy statement last week , said some pediatricians had suggested that current federal law , which “ makes criminal any nonmedical procedure performed on the genitals ” of a girl in the United States , has had the unintended consequence of driving some families to take their daughters to other countries to undergo mutilation .
“ It might be more effective if federal and state laws enabled pediatricians to reach out to families by offering a ritual nick as a possible compromise to avoid greater harm , ” the group said .
But some opponents of female genital mutilation , or F.G.M. , denounced the statement .
“ I am sure the academy had only good intentions , but what their recommendation has done is only create confusion about whether F.G.M. is acceptable in any form , and it is the wrong step forward on how best to protect young women and girls , ” said Representative Joseph Crowley , Democrat of New York , who recently introduced a bill to toughen federal law by making it a crime to take a girl overseas to be circumcised .
“ F.G.M. serves no medical purpose , and it is rightfully banned in the U.S. ”
About 100 taxi drivers gathered outside Parliament this morning to protest changes to taxi stands at Wellington Airport .
Cabs involved in the protest include drivers from the ACE Taxis , Kiwi Cabs , Wellington Taxis 2005 , Amalgamated Taxis , Harbour City Taxis , Choice Taxis , Supreme Taxis and Dial - a - Cab .
The drivers are protesting a deal done by the airport and Wellington Combined Taxis to give that company a preferential pick - up zone at the airport from July 1 .
A spokesman for about 300 cab drivers owned and operated by the smaller companies , Logan Pithyou , said drivers would be protesting each morning this week between 7 am and midday .
" They 'll be driving between the airport and Parliament .
We just want to highlight the fact there are a lot of people who will be locked out .
" Many of them are already looking at signing up for the dole .
Their livelihoods depend on them being able to pick people up from the airport .
It 's not good for these people . "
No one from Wellington Airport was available for comment .
Divend Prasad , a Wellington taxi driver , said he was beeping his horn as part of the protest and was given a $ 150 ticket by police .
He said he was told he would end up in jail if he did it again .
Mr Prasad was a registered high school maths and science teacher in his native Fiji .
Unable to get work as a teacher in New Zealand , he resorted to driving a taxi , he said .
Fellow taxi driver Vonrick Kerr said the changes at the airport were the " straw that broke the camel 's back " .
The prime taxi rank spots were going to those with deep pockets , he said .
" The shallow pocket area is the back where we 're not going to get any work at all and we feel that 's an injustice . "
The airport was partly council - owned so taxi drivers , as ratepayers , should be able to earn a living there , Mr Kerr said .

I do n’t want to make the mistake of over - interpreting fairly balanced remarks by Michael Kelly of Cambridge , nor of taking quotes out of context as daggers to throw at climatologists .
But I did find his reactions interesting as he read through some Briffa and Jones papers — they seem to match the reactions of many non-climate scientists who tend to have the same type reactions if they really read through some of the work , rather than just issuing statements of moral support without much investigations .
All that being said , here are some of his admittedly offhand reactions after reading through some of the papers .
The entire document is worthy of reading through , as linked by Bishop Hill .
There are however some more detailed qualifications : ( i ) I take real exception to having simulation runs described as experiments ( without at least the qualification of ‘ computer ’ experiments ) .
It does a disservice to centuries of real experimentation and allows simulations output to be considered as real data .
This last is a very serious matter , as it can lead to the idea that real ‘ real data ’ might be wrong simply because it disagrees with the models !
That is turning centuries of science on its head .
( ii )
The reading of the papers was made rather harder by the quality of the diagrams , and the description of the vertical axes on a number of graphs .
When numbers on the vertical axis go from - 2 to +2 without being explicitly labelled as percentage deviations , temperature excursions , or scaled correlation coefficients , there is potential for confusion .
( iii ) I think it is easy to see how peer review within tight networks can allow new orthodoxies to appear and get established that would not happen if papers were written for and peer reviewed by a wider audience .
I have seen it happen elsewhere .
This finding may indeed be an important outcome of the present review … .
( 2 ) On a personal note , I chose to study the theory of condensed matter physics , as opposed to cosmology , precisely on the grounds that I could systematically control and vary the boundary conditions of my ob - ject of study as an integral part of making advances .
An elegant theory which does not fit good experimental data is a bad theory .
Here the starting data is patchy and noisy , and the choices made are in part aesthetic , or designed to help a conclusion .
rather than neutral .
This all colours my attitude to the limited value of complex simulations that cannot by exhaustively tested against ‘ real ’ data from independent experiments that control all but one of the variables .
(3) Up to and throughout this exercise , I have remained puzzled how the real humility of the scientists in this area , as evident in their papers , including all these here , and the talks I have heard them give , is morphed into statements of confidence at the 95 % level for public consumption through the IPCC process .
This does not happen in other subjects of equal importance to humanity , e.g. energy futures or environmental degradation or resource depletion .
I can only think it is the ‘ authority ’ appropriated by the IPCC itself that is the root cause .
These questions to Briffa could have come from McIntyre :
This year was no exception .
Senate Bill 1381 , which would establish a medical marijuana system in Illinois and passed the Senate a year ago , languished in the House , where it remains in the Rules Committee .
Its sponsors feared it might not pass if called for a vote , in no small part because some members were reluctant to endorse a potentially controversial bill in an election year .
We agree with Lang .
It ’s time for Illinois to acknowledge what some other states and many sufferers of chronic diseases already have recognized .
First , that marijuana — for reasons science has not yet been able to pinpoint — often is effective in easing symptoms where established pharmaceuticals are not .
And second , that a carefully designed and closely monitored system for prescribing and dispensing marijuana will prevent the program from becoming a virtual legalizing of recreational marijuana .
That , of course , is what has happened in California .
The state legalized medical marijuana in 1996 , but the lax system to administer it left it open for easy abuse .
The California example has hindered advocates ’ efforts to enact worthy programs in other states , which is unfortunate .
SB 1381 has specific rules for diseases and conditions that would merit marijuana use and would require a physician ’s statement for patients who want to receive medical marijuana .
The state would issue cards to qualified patients .
The bill calls for a three - year pilot program , thus ensuring a review after a reasonable trial period .
There 's another , broader reason we believe lawmakers should pass this bill .
Despite overwhelming anecdotal evidence from chronic disease sufferers of its effectiveness in easing nausea and pain , marijuana still suffers from its classification as an illegal drug by the federal government .
That classification has thwarted research that might help scientists better understand why marijuana works for some symptoms .
As more states recognize the medicinal value of marijuana , we would hope the federal government would alter its designation and encourage more research .
Opponents of medical marijuana are correct on two points : smoking is an unhealthy means of delivering any medicine , and the questions of dosage and potency in smoking marijuana run counter to the most basic pharmaceutical rules .
Step up research and maybe more precise and acceptable methods will be found .
For now , though , we believe the humane approach is to provide access to relief to those who may benefit from it .
Many chronic sufferers already are obtaining marijuana on the black market .
Lang says he may try to get his bill through the House after the November election and before a new General Assembly is seated in January .
That would remove the election fear factor and give lawmakers a chance to vote sensibly on a sensible bill that could bring relief to many Illinoisans .

The false narrative initially put out by the Israeli government of hapless IDF commandos severely threatened by hardened “ terrorists ” on the Mavi Marmara has fallen apart , amid revelations of doctored photos , dubbed voices and other deceptions and the patent absurdity of the claim that the commandos had boarded the ship armed only with “ paint guns ” and low - caliber pistols .
Now the Big Lie stands further exposed , thanks to a smuggled - out video showing IDF commandos kicking a prone , helpless victim and then apparently executing him with semi-automatic rifle fire at almost point - blank range .
This smuggled video , showing IDF commandos brutally kicking their captive , who is clearly posing no threat to them , and then firing four shots downward , shows these commandos were on the ship with intent to kill and injure , and that is what they did .
They were certainly not kicking and shooting here to protect their lives .
This looks more like a Rodney King moment than self - defense .
Update : My colleage Linn Washington , who is knowledgeable about firearms , says that the gun in the video appears to be a pump- action Remington 870 shotgun–a potent and lethal firearm used widely by police for “ riot control , ” that could cause the types of wounds found in the Turkish autopsies of victims if fired at close range , and one that is in the Israeli arsenal .
There are claims from Turkish sources that this clip depicts the 19 - year - old American - born Furkan Dogan being executed .
Dogan ’s autopsy showed he was shot four times in the face , and at least once in the back .
IDF defenders are claiming that the video does n’t actually show the victim , but unless you think the first commando is kicking soccer goals on the deck , and the shooter is firing at the deck for sport , there can be no doubt that the target of both acts of violence is being first pummeled with kicks , and then peppered with bullets .
So far , the President Obama and the White House and State Department have made no condemnation of Israel ’s illegal and murderous attack in international waters on a civilian ship flying the flag of a NATO ally .
This video is , for me , reminiscent of the video from the Tet Offensive in the 1968 in the Vietnam War , which showed a South Vietnamese officer executing a captured Viet Cong fighter with a pistol shot to the head , and also of the 1979 video of a soldier in the army of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza executing the ABC newsman Bill Stewart ( which came across a monitor in a local ABC newsroom I happened to be visiting in rural North Carolina , causing absolute pandemonium and outrage ) .
Both those earlier videos of military atrocities by soldiers for regimes backed by the US significantly turned American public opinion against the US puppet regimes and the wars they were fighting .
Hopefully this latest video of another atrocity by a client regime ’s stormtroopers will have the same effect .
To help make sure that happens , send this page link to your local newspaper editor and to your local TV news stations , and demand that they air this video .
No more censorship of this story !
And by the way , kudos to Counterpunch , to Rense.com , to Smirking Chimp and to Public Record for having the guts to run this story and the link when most other alternative and progressive sites have been afraid to , or have pulled it when attacked .
In the history of modern rational thought , there ’s hardly a creed more definitive than Objectivism , the philosophy movement created by Russian - American novelist and thinker Ayn Rand .
Among the central tenets of Objectivism is the idea that we can gain objective knowledge through the processes of logic and that the pursuit of our own happiness , framed as rational self - interest , is the sole purpose of existence .
While such moral code may seem overly cynical , especially in the age of the Charter for Compassion , it seems to be the silent underwriting of much of today ’s modus operandi .
Today , we look at a three–part interview Rand gave in 1959 , as part of Mike Wallace ’s Gallery of Colorful People series on CBS .
More than half a century later , Rand ’s code of morality and her bold challenge to altruism theory is equally controversial and no less fascinating to study .
Judgement of its moral righteousness aside , Objectivism is still one of the most important cultural conversations to engage , if only for the passionate consideration of all sides of the argument that it ignites .
What makes this particular interview noteworthy is that Wallace plays , with complete composure , the perfect devil ’s advocate , eliciting a series of almost emotional retorts from the living epitome of emotionless rationalism .
Watch , waver , and draw your own conclusions .
When you are asked to love everybody indiscriminately , that is to love people without any standard , to love them regardless of whether they have any value or virtue , you are asked to love nobody . ” ~ Ayn Rand
Love should be treated like a business deal , but every business deal has its own terms and its own currency .
And in love , the currency is virtue .
You love people not for what you do for them or what they do for you .
You love them for the values , the virtues , which they have achieved in their own character . ” ~ Ayn Rand
For a deeper look at Rand ’s philosophy and moral code , we highly recommend her iconic Atlas Shrugged , one of the most important written works of the 20th century .
And we should also point out that you certainly do n’t have to agree with Rand ’s views in order to appreciate their cultural significance .
Ray Noland
We did n’t actually go into our third annual Best of Chicago issue with a theme in mind , but as themes are wont to do , one emerged : street smarts .
Our cover artist , Ray Noland , is perhaps best known for his “ independent political propaganda campaign ” for Obama , GoTellMama ! , and his instantly recognizable depictions of former governor Rod Blagojevich , which have become a street - art phenomenon .
And the “ bests ” our staff and contributors came up with — from the best neighborhood garage sale to the best use of a pernicious weed as food to the best place to corner an alderman who ’s been ducking your calls — exhibit an unsurpassed street - level savvy about how to live well ( often for less ) in Chicago .
As for your smarts , dear readers : we decided this year to publish not just the winners of our readers ’ poll but the top three vote getters in most categories .
We especially enjoyed your responses to the sole question on our Civics poll — best person to run against Mayor Daley in 2011 — so much so that we ’ve published almost all of them .

In this interview on This Week with Jake Tapper , it 's hard to know how much of this is true , since Bobby Jindal has never met a situation he 's not willing to exploit for political purposes .
But it does sound like a logistical mess out there , what with BP asserting control of the complete operation :
When asked whether he agreed with Obama ’s claim that the government was doing everything it could , Jindal said , “ I think there could have been a greater sense of urgency . ”
Jindal recounted to ' This Week ' host Jake Tapper one instance where BP and federal government bureaucracy got in the way of the cleanup .
" Terrebonne Parish … submitted a plan for 180,000 feet of hard boom .
The Coast Guard approved them for 90,000 feet .
A week ago Friday , they did n't even have 90,000 feet .
They did n't have that much boom , hard boom , in the parish … ”
Tapper asked the governor what happened next .
“ Well , in that case , they literally had hard boom sitting on the dock and they did n't deploy it , ” Jindal said .
“ There was no excuse .
The BP contractor said BP told them not to do it until the oil was coming .
NOAA projections showed for days , and we saw the oil ourselves . ”
“ We finally brought the Coast Guard captain that was in charge of Louisiana 's response with us on a National Guard Black Hawk helicopter , showed him the oil on the island , showed him the sheen in the bay , showed him the oil coming into that area , and said this needs to be boomed .
He agreed it needed to be boomed , ” Jindal said .
The boom was finally deployed .
Tapper also pushed Jindal , an avowed conservative , to reconcile his belief in small government with his demands for more federal assistance .
“ When government grows too big , it does n't do its core functions properly , ” he said .
“ Absolutely , I believe in a limited government that is effective and competent in what it does .
We need federal government exactly -- we need our federal government exactly for this kind of crisis . ”
And in related news , you probably already guessed Jindal is n't exactly nature 's steward with the control he does have .
Louisiana is a state firmly in the pocket of Big Oil , after all :

Donna Kaye is used to listening when God calls her – even in traffic .
When she felt called to make a quick right down Ellwood Avenue as she exited the Downtown Expressway two years ago , she did n’t hesitate to turn the steering wheel .
What caught her attention – what had spoken to her so strongly – was an unobtrusive , whitewashed sign set cattycorner on a lawn at the corner of Ellwood and Cameron Street .
“ I see ‘ Independent Catholic ’ and ‘ 11 a.m. service ’ and I think ‘ Oh , I can sleep in , and it ’s independent ! ’ ” says Kaye , a divorced former Catholic schoolteacher , who ’d spent the past decade or more living in a church - imposed spiritual purgatory .
Donna Kaye is used to listening when God calls her – even in traffic .
When she felt called to make a quick right down Ellwood Avenue as she exited the Downtown Expressway two years ago , she did n’t hesitate to turn the steering wheel .
What caught her attention – what had spoken to her so strongly – was an unobtrusive , whitewashed sign set cattycorner on a lawn at the corner of Ellwood and Cameron Street .
“ I see ‘ Independent Catholic ’ and ‘ 11 a.m. service ’ and I think ‘ Oh , I can sleep in , and it ’s independent ! ’ ” says Kaye , a divorced former Catholic schoolteacher , who ’d spent the past decade or more living in a church - imposed spiritual purgatory .
Because of Kaye ’s divorce , even though it was annulled by the Catholic Church – annulment is Catholicism ’s only avenue to spiritually redeem divorcees – she ’d found herself an outcast at the Catholic school where she taught .
Even her attempts to publish an otherwise well - received , religious - themed children ’s book series , focused on the sacraments and holy days of the Catholic calendar , had been rejected by “ every Catholic children ’s literature publisher in North America ” .
It had seemed at every turn , her attempts at spiritual development were stymied by the church she loved .
That fateful January day as she left the highway , Kaye says , her spiritual wandering ended – at the front door of Gentle Shepherd Church of Antioch .
“ I walked in and I immediately felt accepted , embraced by everyone there , ” she says .
“ I found a church where I could freely worship , be loved and love back .
I ’m all about accepting everyone as they are . ”
It ’s a common story at Gentle Shepherd : A devout follower , cast at odds with their church ’s teachings , falls away from the church they love and is left seeking an alternative where they are accepted .
And the church ’s answer is always the same : Come on in .
The church ’ pastor , Monsignor Thomas David Siebert , got here just the same way , finding the church “ quite incidentally ” after leaving his post as a priest with the Byzantine Catholic Church , where he ’ served as a priest since 1981 .
In fact , he even helped establish a monastery in Washington , D.C. in 1991 .
To those who knew him , his faith seemed unquestionably strong , but with time , his commitment to the church ’s rigid requirements of clergy began to weaken as he began to question the very advice he found himself dispensing to young seminarians .
“ It was n’t something I sought out at the time , ” he says , referring not only to discovering Gentle Shepherd , but to the personal and spiritual crisis that led him here .
“ I had essentially taken time off from active ministry to give myself time to work out what I was going to do about living out my sexuality in the open .
“ Being gay and out and clergy all in the same sentence can pose serious difficulty in the Roman [ Catholic ] church , ” he says .
Even among the world ’s 1.1 billion Catholics , the existence of independent Catholic churches – those that do n’t necessarily reject Rome , but do n’t concede many of its less inclusive edicts – is something of a mystery .
The term “ catholic ” simply means universal , but it ’s a big universe out there that goes largely unexplored by the faithful .
Even the simple fact of such an ancient alternate Catholic rite as the Copts of Egypt , who date to the very founding of Christianity during the century after Jesus ’ death , is unknown to many Roman Catholics .
But the Coptic Church not only dates to the same time as the origin of the Roman Catholic Church , it represents one of the first great schisms in Christianity .
In this early case , the schism was fundamental , but has in common with so many other resolved conflicts of Christianity the undeniable fact that the argument was over a question that nobody can answer short of literal divine intervention :
What was the nature of Jesus ?
Was he a man who was inhabited by God and who was dis-inhabited at the moment of crucifixion ?
Or was he born a God who literally died and rose again after being crucified ?
Since that first schism – the dueling sides frequently killed one another ’s clergy in the frenzy to resolve the question – there have been plenty more .
The Lutheran church of the once - Roman Catholic Martin Luther questioned Rome ’s unique authority over all things holy , asserting common men ’s equal right to a personal relationship with their God .
The Anglican and Episcopal churches similarly have Catholic roots – and can even trace their bishops back to Rome .
Gentle Shepherd belongs to just one of the thousands of alternate Catholic jurisdictions that exist , in its case the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch .
The Church of Antioch also traces a direct line of succession for its bishops back to the early church and to Jesus ’ twelve Apostles .
Within the Church of Antioch , it ’s not only Rome ’s final authority that is questioned , but again – as with the Copts – some of the fundamental concepts of Roman Catholicism .
The church believes in “ creation - based spirituality ” where man is assumed to be good and to be already saved from damnation , explains Siebert , which stands if not in conflict then at least to question the Roman Catholic belief in original sin , man ’s fall , and his ultimate redemption through Jesus ’ crucifixion .
“ Our inclination is to look at the Christian dispensation in a way that is other than one beginning in a fall … and thereby requiring a violent , blood - soaked sacrifice in order to satisfy a divine injustice that ’s been done , ” Siebert says , offering the Church of Antioch ’s alternative that favors “ looking at the full theological spectrum in Christian history , that has been proscribed by those churches that claim themselves to be the orthodox . ”
In other words , he says , “ those things that have been declared heretical , our church makes room for people to say ‘ But why ? ’ ”
That “ why ” is all - encompassing , he says .
The nature of God is not defined .
“ Theism just does n’t cut it anymore , ” Siebert says , referring to the theism that pictures God as human , with a long , white beard , and at least in some basic context , a person or persona that can be related to by those who worship him .
“ I ’ve reached the point in my life where I can open myself to a far larger God . ”
Siebert acknowledges that it may seem a subtle distinction between this brand of religion and Unitarianism , which rejects answers and structure in seeking God .
“ That ’s a good question , actually , ” he says , of where the distinction lies .
“ And I think one that bears some thought . ”
If anything , the distinction is found in the practice , says Father Thomas Michael Gallub , the church ’s associate pastor , a swarthy , stocky man with twinkling eyes that leap at the chance to talk about God .
“ We take great pains to express the fact that we ’re Catholic , ” he says , noting first his taking of “ Christ as my personal savior , just as any Roman Catholic would . ”
And then there ’s that more rigid definition of what is Catholic .
And what truly define the church , Gallub says , are its traditions , ceremonies and sacraments .
Sunday services at Gentle Shepherd look nearly identical to any Catholic rite church , with the liturgy proceeding along the same set script .
Sacraments like confession , marriage , anointment of the sick and communion are celebrated in the same ways .
“ We love the idea of the symbol and the sacrament , ” Gallub says , speaking of all Catholics .
Gentle Shepherd ’s low - slung , unassuming building barely stands out as anything but just another tiny bungalow snuggled among the other post - World War II track housing along this stretch of Ellwood .
Burgundy shutters add no flash to the drab , white - brick exterior and only a porch extension with a hubcap - sized faded gold cross set above it indicates this house belongs to God and not Smith or Jones .
Founded in Richmond in 1999 , the church ’s own story of acceptance helps explain its open - arm approach to new congregants .
The building once housed St. Alban ’s Anglican Catholic Church , which worships as an ultra-conservative breakaway from the Episcopal church .
When St. Alban ’s looked to move to its current location on Hermitage Road , they put the tiny Ellwood Avenue church on the market – and Gentle Shepherd came calling .
“ They would n’t sell to us , ” says Gallub , “ because we had homosexuals in our congregation . ”
Enter notorious Richmond developer , architect , and sometimes political activist Louis Salomonsky .
When he first bought the property , Fr. Gallub says , Salomonsky had intended condos , but then found out about the church ’s plight .
“ He turned around and sold it to us – and gave us a substantial donation .
Well , it started out as a donation , but it turned into a big price reduction . ”
Since then , Gentle Shepherd has maintained a steady membership consisting of just the sorts of people Fr. Gallub says St. Alban ’s was worried about .
People like Monsignor Siebert and Fr. Gallub .
Both priests have long - term committed partners .
Gallub sees Gentle Shepherd as less a refuge than a proof point in the ongoing debate over gay clergy , and whether the celibacy vows of the Roman Catholic church that have served as a vow of devout piety for some may have , in our modern times , provided a cloaked place for the sort of evils currently confronting that church .
That conflict – once masked behind shame and confidential legal settlements – has been on full display in recent weeks even in the run up to Easter , the holiest date in the Christian calendar , being marked as the day Jesus was crucified and brought salvation to the faithful .
While Rome , and Pope Benedict , have faced that scandal by alternating between defiance and denial , the Church of Antioch faces no such crisis .
That the chastity vows of Roman Catholic clergy have been both blessing and curse seems plain , says Gallub .
The vow is supposed to serve to place those men and women who take it outside of the carnal , material things that distract from man ’s relationship with God .
But because the faithful have long seen these clergy as asexual , some sexual predators have used this trust as a weakness to take advantage of vulnerable men , women and children .
Slow reaction by Rome – and outright protection from prosecution or other consequences provided to some offending priests over the years – has led to a mass questioning of faith for some Catholics , as evidenced by reports in recent weeks from Ireland and Germany .
“ The nature of this issue is bound to attract media attention and the way the Church responds is crucial for its moral credibility , ” the Vatican ’s chief spokesman , Father Federico Lombardi , said on Vatican Radio the same week Christians celebrated Palm Sunday .
The Church of Antioch certainly claims no immunity to those who would take advantage of vulnerable faithful by exploiting their positions of trust , but Gallub says , such predators where they may exist do n’t have the additional advantage of seeming even more harmless by holy vows of chastity .
The Church of Antioch , of which Siebert will become Southeastern Diocese bishop on May 2 , maintains a very public policy of zero tolerance for priests and other clergy who commit sexual crimes against their congregation or others .
Such concerns seemed far away during Palm Sunday service .
The congregation seems largely split between men with exceedingly good hair and occasional earrings , and heterosexual couples .
All gather in the handful of pews together , sharing friendly hugs and smiles before the processional song begins .
“ Gentle Shepherd come lead us , ” sings a cantor , joined by the two - dozen other mostly well - honed male tenor voices , droning in a slow hymn that begins to take on a proud , joyous stride .
“ Today our church becomes the very streets of the city of Jerusalem , ” says Siebert as the song ends , calling the assembled toward the back of the church , where they gather to take palm fronds that will serve to commemorate Jesus ’ triumphant entry into the holy city of King David .
“ As we enter into these mysteries … we ponder upon them for the meaning they hold for our own lives . ”
That mystery has been at least partly revealed for Siebert , and for many of his congregants who have flocked to Gentle Shepherd for its acceptance of anyone who arrives .
It was deciding to express openly his love – and the Roman Catholic Church ’s unsatisfactory answers to his questions about his feelings — that led Siebert to his split with Roman Catholicism .
It ’s immaterial whether those feelings were for a man or a woman
“ I had met someone , ” he says , “ I wanted to avoid living a subterfuge , and that ’s not to pass judgment on any clergy that do otherwise . ”
Siebert says he “ tried to stay within the structures of Roman Catholicism … [ but ] I came up against a brick wall . ”
He still viewed his priestly vows as a commitment stronger than marriage , but says those vows were taken long before he ’d come to know himself .
“ I did n’t become a priest to avoid my homosexuality , ” he says , calling his decision to take those vows one made with full knowledge of his orientation .
In fact , orientation should n’t matter afterwards .
When his feelings for another became stronger , he tried religious counseling and even took the step that led him to become a monk .
Eventually , he took a leave of absence from the church to sort out his feelings .
And it was during this period that he took a phone call that was the first big step eventually leading him to Gentle Shepherd .
“ I remember standing there in my kitchen thinking ‘ holy shit , ’ ” he says of the call , which came from one of his former seminarians .
The young , former priest candidate was asking Siebert to officiate his wedding to another man .
At first Siebert reacted to the obvious conflict that this would put him in , but then “ about twenty seconds later I was like , ‘ Of course I will do this .
You are truth .
Declare it good and holy and be there with your friends and family and do this openly instead of doing it like others behind rectory doors . ”
Within a year , Siebert had been officially excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church .
It ’s a church to which he still professes his love , and one for which he has a compassionate understanding , as it confronts what may well prove one of its biggest challenges and greatest tests of its faithful .
“ I love it to this very moment , ” Siebert says .
“ They gave me life .
I ’m bound with that church and I ’m not in rebellion with the idea of the bishop in Rome as the heart of Christianity . ”

William R. Fitzsimmons , the dean of admissions at Harvard , said he had heard of schools with more than 100 valedictorians , and had seen home - schooled students praised as No. 1  out of one  all of which has helped render the distinction meaningless .
“ I think , honestly , it ’s a bit of an anachronism , ” he said .
“ This has been a long tradition , but in the world of college admissions , it makes no real difference . ”
Even some principals who have named multiple valedictorians acknowledge that the honor no longer carries the same weight .
“ If you ’ve got one in a population of 500 , it has special significance , ” said John O’Breza , the principal of Cherry Hill East .
“ When you have 9 , 10 or 30 in a population of 500 , the numbers speak for themselves .
The more rare it is , the more distinguished . ”
Still , being tapped as valedictorian resonates deeply .
“ I feel like as long as you reach that point , it does n’t matter how many you have , ” said Yvette Leung , one of the Jericho seven , who is bound for Harvard .
“ To be named valedictorian is an honor and a testament to how hard we ’ve tried . ”
The word valedictorian  Latin for “ farewell sayer ”  appears as early as 1759 in the diary of the Rev. Edward Holyoke , then president of Harvard College .
The Merriam - Webster dictionary defines it as “ the student usually having the highest rank in a graduating class who delivers the valedictory address at the commencement exercises . ”

The top seniors at Jericho High School will perform a 10 - minute skit instead of giving speeches .
School officials contend that there are more valedictorians than ever before because the frenzy over college admissions has made students more serious about grades and has spurred them to load up on advanced courses beginning in freshman year .
In addition , some schools have adjusted their formulas to give more students a shot at the top spot by counting more courses toward the grade - point average , or limiting the weight given to any one particular subject .
I have no idea what 's going on in this interview , but neither does the girl who is apparently part of it .
Funny that the elbow to the head did n't perk her up .

After hours of emotional public comment , a New York City community board voted overwhelmingly to support a plan to build a mosque and cultural center near Ground Zero .
" It 's a seed of peace , " board member Rob Townley said .
" We believe that this is significant step in the Muslim community to counteract the hate and fanaticism in the minority of the community . "
The vote late Tuesday by the Manhattan Community Board was 29 - 1 in favor of the plan , with 10 abstentions , the Associated Press reports .
Some in the crowd held pictures of victims of the attack , others carried signs reading , " Show respect for 9/11 .
No mosque ! "
The board did not have the power to block the project , but its actions are an important barometer of community sentiment , The New York Times says .
Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf , director of one sponsor of the project , said he understood the anguish but noted that his group condemned the 9/11 attacks , which killed members of his community and congregation as well .
" We have worked to ensure that our mosques are not recruiting grounds for terrorists , " he said .
C. Lee Hanson , whose son , Peter , died in the Trade Center , said he opposed the project , not because he was intolerant but because it would be insensitive to build a tribute to Islam so close to Ground Zero .
" When I look over there and I see a mosque , it 's going to hurt , " Hanson said , according to The Times .
" Build it someplace else . "

Evidence for a recoiling black hole has been found using data from the Chandra X - ray Observatory , XMM - Newton , the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) , and several ground - based telescopes .
A new paper reports that this black hole kickback was caused either by a slingshot effect produced in a triple black hole system , or from the effects of gravitational waves produced after two supermassive black holes merged a few million years earlier .
The discovery of this object , located in this composite image , comes from a large , multi- wavelength survey , known as the Cosmic Evolution Survey ( COSMOS ) .
This survey includes data from Chandra , HST , XMM - Newton , as well as ground - based observatories .
Of the 2,600 X - ray sources found in COSMOS , only one -- named CID - 42 and located in a galaxy about 3.9 billion light years away -- coincides with two very close , compact optical sources .
In this image , the X - ray source detected by Chandra is colored blue , while the Hubble data are seen in gold .
The two white sources near the center of the image are seen in the optical HST data , but they are too close for Chandra to resolve them separately .
The galaxy 's long tail suggests that a merger between galaxies has occurred relatively recently , only a few million years earlier .
Data from the Very Large Telescope and the Magellan telescope give evidence that there is a large difference in speed between the two optical sources of at least about three million miles an hour .
The X - ray spectra from Chandra and XMM - Newton provide extra information about CID - 42 .
Absorption from iron - rich gas shows that gas is moving rapidly away from us in the rest frame of the galaxy .
This could be gas in the galaxy between us and one of the black holes that is falling into the black hole , or it could be gas on the far side of the black hole that is blowing away .
Taken together , these pieces of information allow for two different scenarios for what is happening in this system and the nature of the two optical sources in the center of the image .
In the first scenario , the researchers surmise that a triple black hole encounter was produced by a two - step process .
First , a collision between two galaxies created a galaxy with a pair of black holes in a close orbit .
Before these black holes could merge , another galaxy collision occurred , and another supermassive black hole spiraled toward the existing black hole pair .
The interaction among the three black holes resulted in the lightest one being ejected .
In this case , the source in the lower left of the central pair of optical sources is an active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) powered by material being pulled along by , and falling onto , the escaping supermassive black hole .
The source in the upper right of the central pair is an AGN containing the black hole that resulted from a merger between the two remaining black holes .
In this slingshot scenario , the high - speed X - ray absorption can be explained as a high - speed wind blowing away from the AGN in the upper right that absorbs light from the AGN in the lower left .
Based on its optical spectrum , the AGN in the upper right is thought to be obscured by a torus of dust and gas .
In nearly all cases a wind from such an AGN would be undetectable , but here it is illuminated by the other AGN , giving the first evidence that fast winds exist in obscured AGN .
An alternative explanation posits a merger between two supermassive black holes in the center of the galaxy .
The asymmetry of the gravitational waves emitted in this process caused the merged black hole to be kicked away from the center of the galaxy .
In this scenario , the ejected black hole is the point source in the lower left of the central pair and a cluster of stars left behind in the center of the galaxy is in the upper right .
The observed X - ray absorption would be caused by gas falling onto the recoiling black hole .
Future observations may help eliminate or further support one of these scenarios .
A team of researchers led by Francesca Civano and Martin Elvis of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) will publish their work on CID - 42 in the July 1st edition of The Astrophysical Journal .
The second scenario , concerning the recoil of a supermassive black hole caused by a gravitational wave kick , has recently been proposed by Peter Jonker from the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht as a possible explanation for a source in a different galaxy .
In this study , led by Peter Jonker from the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht , a Chandra X - ray source was discovered about ten thousand light years , in projection , away from the center of a galaxy .
Three possible explanations for this object are that it is an unusual type of supernova , or an ultraluminous X - ray source with a very bright optical counterpart or a recoiling supermassive black hole resulting from a gravitational wave kick .
The notion that international sporting competitions inevitably inspire warm fraternity – an idea advanced by Baron de Coubertin , the founder of the modern Olympic games – is a romantic fiction .
With the World Cup upon us , we should recall Arthur Koestler 's maxim that there is nationalism , and there is football nationalism – and that the latter is the more deeply felt .
“ He ’s a treasure , ” said Sean Sardi Ricketts , 37 , a co-owner of the restaurant , the great - grandson of Vincent Sardi Sr. and the grandson of Vincent Sardi Jr. , who took over the restaurant when his father retired and helped make it a Broadway institution .
“ He ’s not even a customer on Tuesdays .
He ’s like part of the family . ”
Image William Herz , left , at Sardi ’s last Tuesday for lunch with members of the Dutch Treat Club , a 105 - year - old organization of writers , artists and performers that he once belonged to .
Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Sardi’s has long been at the center of Broadway life — the idea for the Tony Awards was born there over lunch , according to Vincent Sr. ’s 1953 book — and Mr. Herz said it was only natural for it to become the center of his life as well .
And there is another reason he has been returning to Sardi ’s for roughly 77 years .
Shortly before a play he had produced closed after just a week at the Lyceum Theater in 1940 , Mr. Herz was eating at Sardi ’s when Vincent Sr. asked him to join him for dessert and coffee .
“ And he said to me , ‘ I know your show is closing , ’ ” Mr. Herz recalled .
“ He said , ‘ I just want you to keep coming to Sardi’s , and do n’t worry about the bill . ’
So I burst into tears , and that ’s why I ’ve been a customer of Sardi ’s for so long .
I was touched and moved by it , and I thought it was damn nice of him . ”
These days , Mr. Herz picks up his own bill .
Hundreds of theater , film and television personalities have had their caricatures up on the walls of Sardi’s , but Mr. Herz is not one of them .
Like most New Yorkers who regularly dine in what is perhaps the restaurant capital of the world , he is not as famous as the place where he eats lunch .
He was an extra , occasional actor , stage manager , casting director and producer on Broadway through the 1930s and 1940s , and then worked for years at a ticket agency next door , naturally , to Sardi’s .
He is an unpretentious sort who takes the bus to and from Sardi’s and who eats only half of his roasted chicken , because he likes to take the rest home to feed to his dog , Diego .
As he sits with his friends at table No. 4 , the tourists sitting nearby admiring the caricatures have no idea that the old , frail man in the corner could tell them a story or two about some of the stars on the walls .
He does not boast about his career and the theatrical history he took part in — he is the last living cast member of Mr. Welles ’s “ War of the Worlds ” adaptation — but , if asked , he will dish .
There was the time when Mr. Herz was serving in the military during World War II and helped organize a show in Miami for thousands of servicemen featuring Rita Hayworth .
“ She arrived at Servicemen ’s Pier and took off her mink coat — it was a chilly night — and she had a gingham dress on , ” he said .
“ I looked at her and I said : ‘ You ’re a pinup .
Why are you in a gingham dress ? ’
A housewife would wear a gingham dress in the kitchen .
I took her back to the Roney Plaza .
She got into an evening gown .
She did n’t speak to me the rest of the evening . ”
Throughout his unusual career , Bam Margera has taken all sorts of abuse to his head , arms , legs and testicles .
But up until early Saturday morning ( June 12 ) , he had never been beaten with a bat wielded by a 59 - year - old woman .
Margera , the skateboarder and breakout star of " Jackass " and " Viva La Bam " on MTV , was assaulted early Saturday morning following a noise complaint at The Note , the bar that Margera owns in his hometown of West Chester , Pennsylvania .
Elizabeth Ray , who lives on the same block as the bar , attacked Margera with a bat at around 2 a.m. on Saturday .
She was arrested and charged with one count of aggravated assault , two counts of simple assault and two counts of reckless endangerment .
She posted $ 10,000 bail shortly after her arrest .
Ray professed her innocence to the Philadelphia Daily News , claiming that Margera used racial slurs during their initial argument about the noise .
" He called me the n-word , " she said .
" I 'm innocent , and he 's a jackass , just like his movies . "
Margera 's mother April ( who audiences got to know well on " Viva La Bam " ) suggested that this was n't the first time her son had an altercation with Ray .
" She hit him over the head with a baseball bat , and she hit him while he was walking to his car , " she said , though she was not actually a witness to the incident .
" There was no fight .
She 's just crazy and gives him a hard time all the time . "
Margera was taken via ambulance to Chester County Hospital and treated for his target = " _blank " > injuries .
" Jackass " co-star Steve - O told TMZ that Margera had been brought into the intensive care unit of the hospital and was released a few hours later .
" I think he 's gonna be OK , " Steve - O told TMZ .
Upon exiting the hospital , Margera hopped on a plane to meet with the rest of the cast of " Jackass 3 - D , " which is scheduled to hit theaters this October .
JOHANNESBURG  North Korea ’s soccer team arrived Tuesday at the World Cup , where it will be supported by cheerleaders recruited from China , led by a forward born in Japan and prohibited at home from receiving free television coverage provided by fellow competitor and political rival South Korea .
There is much intrigue surrounding the mostly unknown team from North Korea .
One of the world ’s most closed nations will open slightly to participate in the world ’s biggest sporting event , even as it is being accused by South Korea of sinking one of its warships in March and killing 46 sailors .
As the lowest - ranked of the 32 nations in the field , North Korea faces an imposing challenge to become one of two teams advancing from the so - called Group of Death , which also includes Brazil , a five - time champion ; Portugal , a 2006 semifinalist ; and the Ivory Coast , an African power led by one of the world ’s best forwards , Didier Drogba .
Yet no country enters the tournament , which runs from June 11 to July 11 , with a bigger reputation for doing the unexpected .
North Korea ’s last appearance in the World Cup  in 1966  resulted in one of soccer ’s greatest feats , a shocking 1 - 0 victory over Italy , whose humbled players were reportedly pelted with rotten fruit upon returning home in disgrace .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
" This game 's in the refrigerator !
The door 's closed , the lights are out , the eggs are cooling , the butter 's getting hard and the Jell - O is jiggling ... "
That was legendary Lakers ' radio announcer Chick Hearn 's signature way of calling a game early , telling fans the home team won ... you can head for the exits before the final buzzer .
Chick wrote the book with popular sports phrases like " slam dunk , " " air ball , " " charity stripe , " and a " bunny hop in the pea patch " for a traveling violation .
Chick 's our inspiration today : Last March
I wrote " 6 reasons I 'm calling a bottom and a new bull . "
Today it 's time for a new call .
We 've had a good year .
Net gains over 50 % in 2009 .
But now : " Game over , head for the exits . "
Bears beating bulls .
No , no , " it 's a buying opportunity , " says another legend , hedge fund manager , Barton Biggs .
Buying opportunity ?
For who ?
Remember , Biggs is n't advising Joe Lunchbox about what to do with his little 401 ( k ) .
Biggs ' customers are mega-millionaires in his $ 1.5 billion Traxis Partners Fund .
Main Street investors like Joe are prey in his casino .
Read on , you decide :
As you stare from high up in the nose - bleed bleachers watching the game , staring at a Dow that not long ago was above 11,000 and heading for 12,000 .
Now the Dow 's sitting on the bench , ready for the showers , weak after a couple air balls around 10,000 .
No more timeouts .
" This game 's in the refrigerator . "
How bad is your bookie 's point spread in this game ?
A blowout ?
Will the Dow drop below 9,000 again ?
Now that it 's broken technical supports , will it drop below 6,470 , where the last bull rally started in early 2009 ?
Can you handle the nerve - racking volatility generated by Wall Street 's high - frequency traders playing the game at warp - speed with algorithms making thousands of micro-bets in milliseconds , betting billions daily ?
So who should you listen to ?
Barton and I arrived at Morgan Stanley about the same time .
He stayed decades longer , became one of the world 's leading strategists , advising the kind of high - rollers who also bet at private tables in a Vegas casino .
You remember Biggs :
In his book " Wealth , War & Wisdom " he advises his high rollers to prepare for a " breakdown of the civilized infrastructure . "
Buy a farm : " Your safe haven must be self - sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food ...
It should be well - stocked with seed , fertilizer , canned food , wine , medicine , clothes , etc. Think Swiss Family Robinson . "
Biggs is not advising small investors on what to do with their 401 ( k ) s .
If you 're gambling at Wall Street 's casino , folks , the odds - makers are betting against Biggs .
It 's " game over . "
Main Street lost 20 % last decade ... yet like sheep keep going back
Yes , if you 're channeling Chick , here 's your " mixed metaphor " cue card : " This game 's in the refrigerator ... Wall Street won ( proof , Goldman 's $ 100 - million - profit trading days and Blankfein's $ 68 million bonus ) ...
Main Street 's headed for another losing streak ... Congress ' lights are out ... the refrigerator door 's closing on financial reforms ... the lobbyists are laying some rotten eggs , poisoning capitalism ... the Tea Party - of - No - No ideologies are hardening ... the bull 's Jell - O is jiggling to a flat line ... and this market 's going into hibernation , with the bears ... run , do n't walk , to the exits , folks . "
But will Main Street exit ?
Will we ever learn ?
No .
The Wall Street casino makes mega-billions for insiders like Blankfein and the Goldman Conspiracy .
Yet " The Casino " is still below the 2000 record of 11,722 .
So after accounting for inflation , Wall Street lost over 20 % of Main Street 's 401 ( k ) retirement money between 2000 and 2010 .
Yes , Wall Street 's a big loser the past decade .
Their advice is self - serving .
Period .
Given their miserable track record , only a fool would bet with Wall Street .
Betting odds are Wall Street will lose another 20 % in the next decade from 2010 - 2020 .
Yes , today 's market is a " buying opportunity , " but only for Wall Street casino insiders like Biggs , Blankfein and even low - level staffers inside " The Casino . "
But not for our 95 million Main Street investors , there 's more pain ahead , this market 's dropping .
Correction ?
New crash imminent , worse than 2008
More proof : Earlier economist Gary Shilling said price - to - earnings ratios are at a " nosebleed 22.5 level . "
The Dow was around 11,000 .
Money manager Jeremy Grantham recently said the market 's overvalued 40 % .
That could mean a collapse to 6,600 .
Last week in Reuters ' " Markets Could Be Derailed Again , " George Soros echoed a " game over " warning with a " stark warning ... that the financial world is on the wrong track and that we may be hurtling towards an even bigger boom and bust than in the credit crisis . "
Now Dow Theory 's Richard Russell is warning the public of an imminent crash : " Sell ... get liquid ... by the end of this year they wo n't recognize the country . "
A bigger meltdown than the credit crisis ?
Yes , Bush 's team drove America into a ditch .
But now Obama and his money men , Summers , Geithner , Bernanke , are digging the hole deeper .
Soros says we have not learned " the lessons that markets are inherently unstable . "
As a result , " the success in bailing out the system on the previous occasion led to a super - bubble . "
Now " we are facing a yet larger bubble . "
Worse than 2008 ?
Yes , the game may be " in the refrigerator , " the lights will go out , but as Soros hints , the electricity may get turned off too .
Get it ?
This may not be a correction .
Not even a bear .
What 's coming could be worse than the 2000 dot - com crash and the 2008 meltdown combined , a " Super - Bubble " says Soros .
And the biggest reason , Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm tell Newsweek , is that " the president 's half - measures wo n't fix our failed financial system " because he refuses to " bust up the too - big - to - fail banks . "
Yes , Congress will pass something .
But unfortunately , as reported on MSNBC , Senator Dodd , the reform bill 's sponsor , is a turncoat , working overtime with Wall Street lobbyists " to weaken financial reform , " leave us vulnerable to a new , bigger crash in the near future .
And Wall Street lobbyists are spending hundreds of millions to kill reform .
' White Swans : ' 2000 and 2008 crashes were predictable , next one too
Recently Roubini was interviewed by Charlie Rose in BusinessWeek .
His message confirms the worst .
Roubini was questioned about his new book , " Crisis Economics . "
Rose began by asking , " what have we learned from these crises of capitalism ? "
Roubini could easily have said , " nothing , we learned nothing . "
His actual reply :
" The first lesson is that crises are not ' black swan ' events ... they 're not just random outcomes .
They are the result of a buildup of financial and policy vulnerability and mistakes -- excessive risk - taking , leverage , debt , and so on . "
They are ' White Swans ' " because these events are predictable .
But generation after generation , we seem to forget the past .
When there 's a bubble , there 's euphoria .
There 's irrational exuberance .
Consumers can use their homes like ATM machines .
Governments and policy makers are happy because they get reelected .
Wall Street makes billions of dollars of profits .
Everybody 's delusional . "
Sound familiar ?
Yes indeed , in " This Time Is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly , " economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff pinpoint the key signal that will blow the whistle and call the game :
The " 90 % ratio of government debt to GDP is a tipping point in economic growth . "
For 800 years " you increase it over and beyond a high threshold , and boom ! "
Warning , fans , the numbers on the game - clock are flashing wildly .
America 's ratio is now 92 % , thanks to Obama 's $ 1.7 trillion budget , future deficits , exploding debt .
Soon , Ka-Booom !
Another great nation bites the dust .
Depression follows .
Goodbye retirement .
Warning : 800 years of history are calling ' game over '
But ca n't we change destiny ?
Or are Dodd , Congress , Obama , Wall Street , the Party of No- No and 300 million Americans all just playing their parts in a historical script well - known to historians like Reinhart and Rogoff , Kevin Phillips , Niall Ferguson and others ?
The message of " This Time Is Different " is very simple :
" We have been here before .
No matter how different the latest financial frenzy or crisis always appears , there are usually remarkable similarities from past experience from other countries and from history .
... no country , irrespective of its global importance , appears to be immune to it .
The fading memories of borrowers and lenders , policy makers and academics , and the public at large do not seem to improve over time , so the policy lessons on how to ' avoid ' the next blow - up are at best limited . "
So please listen closely :
All the TARP bailouts , stimulus debt and Fed loans wo n't work .
Neither will a new conservative government .
This is not a basketball game .
We are not channeling Chick Hearn , calling this game before the final buzzer .
While we prefer the illusion that " this time really is different , " eight centuries of history suggest otherwise :
" The lesson of history , then , is that even as institutions and policy makers improve there will always be a temptation to stretch the limits .
...
If there is one common theme to the vast range of crises ... it is that excessive debt accumulation , whether it be by the government , banks , corporations , or consumers , often poses greater systemic risks than it seems during a boom .
...
Highly indebted governments , banks , or corporations can seem to be merrily rolling along for an extended period , when bang -- confidence collapses , lenders disappear and a crisis hits .
...
Highly leveraged economies ... seldom survive forever ... history does point to warnings signs that policy makers can look to access risk -- if only they do not become too drunk with their credit bubble - fueled success and say , as their predecessors have for centuries , ' This time is different ' . "
No , " this time " it 's never different .
Get it ?
In the end , it does n't matter what happens to the Dodd - Obama financial reforms .
The endgame 's never a Black Swan , it 's a very White Swan well known to historians -- guaranteed , inevitable and inescapable .
This time is never different .
The clock 's flashing .
Huge point spread .
Think bear , think crash , think end of capitalism , think Great Depression II ...
This is no buying opportunity , this game 's in the refrigerator , call it .
Folks in Brussels for Intel 's European research showcase got to get their hands on the company 's Light Peak this week , with the first demonstration of the optical cable technology running on a laptop .
Outfitted with a 12 mm square chip that converts the optical signal into data the machine can read , two separate HD video streams were piped to a nearby TV , which displayed them with the help of a converter box -- a necessary evil until the Light Peak chips are developed for the display side of things .
According to Justin Rattner , Intel 's CTO , the current 10 Gb / second speeds are just the beginning .
" We expect to increase that speed dramatically .
You 'll see multiple displays being served by a single Light Peak connection .
There 's almost no limit to the bandwidth -- fibers can carry trillions of bits per second . "
Among paleontologists , it 's sometimes called the " Great Dying . "
Roughly a quarter of a billion years ago , 90 - 95 percent of all life on Earth died out .
It took 30 million years for the planet to recover .
What happened ?

Most people are familiar with the extinction event 65 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs .
But the Great Dying was much more devastating .
It left almost nothing alive .
Welcome to the Permian
Let 's start with the lay of the land .
The era before the Great Dying - also known as the Permo - Triassic Extinction - is called the Permian , and it was a time of rapid animal evolution , including mammal - reptile hybrids called synapsids that looked sort of like giant lizards - some even had big sails on their backs .
These early mammals roamed a massive landmass called Pangaea , while the one , giant ocean called Panthalassa teemed with sea creatures , from tiny single - celled organisms to trilobytes and large fish .
On land , vast forests of giant ferns were giving way to trees similar to the ones we have on Earth today , dropping seeds in order to reproduce .

Basically there was an entire ecosystem of plants and animals on sea and land that you would hardly recognize as earthly - it was as if our planet was n't really our planet at all .
And then a series of catastrophic events managed to destroy most of the life that existed .

The extinction event
Looking at the fossil record , it 's clear that there was an abrupt , massive decline in animal diversity .
Advertisement
In this chart , you can see that there were actually three die - offs during the Permian , but the one at the end of the Permian and the beginning of the Triassic , 250 million years ago , was extreme .
Writing in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , Earth scientists Sarda Sahney and Michael J Benton call it " the most devastating ecological event of all time . "
They explain the chart above , which looks at die - offs of tetrapods ( four - legged creatures ) :
Global diversity ( dashed line ) and mean alpha diversity ( solid line ) of Permo - Triassic tetrapod families .
Extinctions are labelled as 1 , Olson 's extinction ; 2 , end -Guadalupian extinction ; and 3 , end -Permian extinction .

The seas were hit as hard as the land .
Sahney and Benton continue :
The impact of the end - Permian event was devastating .
In the sea , the level of species loss was 80 – 96 % , and blastoid echinoderms , tabulate and rugose corals , graptolites , trilobites , eurypterids , acanthodians and placoderms disappeared entirely .
On land , the dominant Glossopteris flora was replaced , eight orders of insects became extinct and two - thirds of tetrapod families were lost .
The only tetrapod lineages to survive were procolophonoids , dicynodonts , and presumably therocephalians , cynodonts , and archosauromorphs , and their Triassic recovery was slow .

Put another way :
It 's likely that 9 out of 10 marine species and 7 out of 10 land species went extinct .
Moreover , this was the only extinction event on Earth that destroyed many species of insects along with other animals .
When you look at the geologic record , there is simply nothing there at the hinge between Permian and Triassic :
Mega -volcanoes and a giant asteroid impact
So what happened ?
Nobody is completely sure , but there is evidence to support two major catastrophes , both of which would have led to devastating climate change .
At the end - Permian , giant mega-volcanoes began to erupt in the Siberian region .
Hillel Hoffman writes in National Geographic :
A deadly epoch of volcanic eruptions left a million - square - mile ( 2.6- million - square - kilometer ) fingerprint in Siberia .
Below the town of Norilsk lies a two - and - a - half - mile - thick ( four - kilometer - thick ) pile of lava , overgrown by conifers .
Geologists call this vast lava field the Siberian Traps .
It was n't produced by one volcano .
" Thick , pulsing flows of glowing magma gushed out from numerous broad , flat volcanoes , " said geologist Paul Renne of the Berkeley Geochronology Center .
" Hundreds of cubic miles spread across Siberia - enough to cover the Earth to a depth of about 20 feet ( 6 meters ) . "

At the same time , there is now ample evidence that an enormous , 9 kilometer asteroid hit the ocean .
According to NASA , geologists studying rocks from the Permian period have discovered a well - known fingerprint left by objects that originate from space : " soccer ball - shaped molecules called " fullerenes " ( or " buckyballs " ) with traces of helium and argon gas trapped inside . "
Deadly climate change
So you 've got massive volcanic eruptions , spewing tons of sulfur and greenhouse gas into the atmosphere .
Billowing clouds cut plants off from life - giving light , and acid rain pours from the skies .
The ozone layer is shredded .
Then you 've got this major asteroid impact , whose heat is so intense that it ignites forests .
The burning trees release carbon dioxide and other toxins .
The end result ?
A long - term transformation in the Earth 's climate , similar to what environmentalists predict in a worst - case scenario for our near future if we continue to burn fossil fuels and release other toxins .
Carbon dioxide levels rise , oxygen levels fall , and animals and plants die off by the millions .
Advertisement
Here is one interpretation of the sequence of events :
Not all scientists agree that the asteroid impact caused the volcanic eruptions .
Whether the volcanoes or the asteroid came first , it 's certain that the Great Dying was caused by the buildup of carbon dioxide both in the sea and on land .
The devastation was so complete that the period following the end of the Permian has a 10 - million - year " coal gap " when no coal was formed at all .
Scientists speculate that 's because there was simply not enough plant life to create the coal .

The survivors
So , who survived the Permian - Triassic Great Dying ?
The fossil record is full of fungi , which thrive on dead bodies .
And one group of those reptile - mammal tetrapods , called Lystrosaurus , began to thrive .
About the size of pigs , Lystrosaurs were burrowing animals who ate plants .
They had a lumbering , splayed gait and beaks that probably allowed them to chomp on rough vegetation .
And they sported short , wiggly tails .
Early in the Triassic , Lystrosaurs represented 90 percent of all animal life on land .
They were alone on a dead world .

Why did these guys - our distant ancestors - survive when so many of their fellow creatures did n't ?
No one is entirely sure .
It 's possible that their lungs , adapted for life in the tunnels they dug for shelter , were suited to an atmosphere with less oxygen .
And it 's also possible it was sheer luck .
Advertisement
Their progeny fanned out across the southern part of Pangaea , which gradually separated from the Northern half of the supercontinent and became its own continent , packed with dinosaurs and proto-mammals .
Though life never completely died out , it took 30 million years for the planet to have a complete ecosystem again , packed with predators and herbivores and a wide range of flora and fauna .
The Permian - never forget
What does the Great Dying tell us about our place in Earth 's current ecosystem ?
Most importantly it reminds us that our existence is short , contingent , and precarious .
Giant extinction events are the norm in geologic history .
Indeed , the Triassic period ended with another mega-extinction event , as did the Jurassic period .
The Earth has been many different planets through the eons , and the catastrophic changes it goes through on a regular basis mean we 'll be lucky to survive as a civilization .
Advertisement
More specifically , the Permo - Triassic extinction event proves that climate change caused by greenhouse gasses can kill nearly every creature on the planet .
Regardless of how that greenhouse scenario starts - whether it's a massive volcano or centuries of burning fossil fuels - climate change kills more effectively than a meteor impact .
Remember : the meteor and volcanoes only started the cycle of death - the Great Dying was probably as comprehensive as it was due to atmospheric changes .
Many people writing about the Great Dying claim that its most profound lesson is that life always finds a way to survive .
But looked at another way , this long - ago moment in geological time teaches us that we 're under constant threat of being wiped off the face of the planet with balls of fire and poison gas .

Survival is as mysterious as the Permo - Triassic Extinction itself .
Life always finds a way .
But it may not be our life , on this planet , in this tiny sliver of linear time .

An air stewardess fears she can't return to Dubai where she lives because she has had a baby out of wedlock .
Ex-pat Liz Curry , 30 , did n't even know she was pregnant when Alexandra was born during a 24 - hour stopover in South Africa .
Dubai 's strict Muslim laws mean
Liz could now be sent to prison if she goes back to the country where she has lived for eight years .
The penalty for having sex outside marriage is at least three months in prison followed by deportation .
Liz said : " I 'm on unpaid leave at the moment but I can't go back to work in Dubai - not just because I 'm a new mother but also because of the law .
" I 'm unmarried so if I 'd had the baby in Dubai I would have been arrested and I can't take that risk . "
Liz , from Ireland , said female cabin crew often have unusual menstrual cycles - she thought her stomach pains were ulcers so began taking tablets .
Doctors in Dubai ran urine and blood tests and told her to stay on the medication .
She only found out the truth in her Johannesburg hotel room in January .
Liz , who works for Emirates , said : " The cramps were horrendous and within a few minutes there was a baby .
I was in complete shock . "
Alexandra , who was just over 2lb , spent two months in an intensive care unit .
The pair are still in South Africa but the baby 's Australian dad , who lives in Dubai and who has been with Liz for two years , has not been able to see them .
Do 's and don'ts for all tourists
The Foreign Office has a code of conduct for anyone who visits Dubai or moves there .
Aside from the laws on sex outside marriage and kissing in public , there are other strict rules to be wary of in the popular tourist destination .
Possession of an illegal drug can lead to a minimum of four years in jail and some over - thecounter medications , such as codeine , are banned .
Alcohol is only served in licensed hotels and clubs and it is illegal to drink or to be drunk in public .
Criminal charges can also be brought for using bad language or making rude gestures .
Adoption and abortion are illegal and newborn babies are frequently abandoned - with three being dumped in February .

The Netherlands is one of the most popular countries in the west for highly - skilled migrants to move to , according to a survey of 11 industrialised countries by the SEO Economic Research bureau for the economic affairs ministry .
Only the US and Switzerland are more popular with so - called knowledge migrants , the research showed .
The Netherlands is popular for its labour market , salary levels , the reputation of its higher education and its knowledge infrastructure .
It scores less well in terms of the living environment , with only France , Belgium and Denmark performing worse .
According to the economic affairs ministry some 26,000 foreign nationals are working in the Netherlands under the highly - skilled migrants scheme .
Half come from Asia and 11 % from the US .
They are young and largely male .
Some 40 % of the migrants questioned for the survey want to stay in the Netherlands , 15 % for the long term .

Jamelle Bouie writes about a Philadelphia Inquirer report on the growth of cell phone ownership among the poor :
For people who are instinctively rankled by the sight of a poor person with a cell phone , I think simple ignorance is the culprit .
In this world of iPhones and pocket - sized computers , it 's easy to forget that with less than $ 100 , you can buy a fairly reliable phone and minutes for the month .
That said , if you fear " subsidizing texting and sexting among the poor , " your problem is n't ignorance — or at least not that kind of ignorance — your problem is that you hold a pretty ugly view of the poor and poverty .
For these conservatives , poverty is purely the result of individual behavior ; if you are poor , you have obviously done something to deserve it , " Of course poor people would use phone - handouts for texting and sexting , they would n't be poor if they did n't have degenerate habits like communication , or sexual expression . "
To repeat , cell phones are not a luxury .
But even if they were , there 's nothing about poverty that disentitles you to enjoying your life .
If you are one of the few people who do n't need a cell phone , but get one because it would improve your quality of life , that does n't make you any less " deserving " of help than someone who chooses to go without .
This idea that we should control the pleasure of those on the bottom is both baffling and pretty offensive .
If I have one quibble with Jamelle 's post , it 's the title .
Poor - bashing is n't a new pastime in the U.S .
To be honest , in my middle - class youth , I 'm sure I engaged in some poor - bashing .
It was n't until I was older and grew to understand that it 's more expensive to be poor that the prevalence of blaming the poor became clear to me .
I had to have it pointed out to me that a poor family with a large TV and cable was n't a sign of some moral failing — it was more likely a sign that there probably were n't many safe out - of - doors pastimes available in the neighborhood .
And the idea that poor people do n't deserve pleasure and little luxuries — and as Jamelle points out , cell phones are n't a luxury , they 're a necessity — is pretty sickening .
In October , 2002 , the lead lawyer for the CIA 's Counterterrorism Center told U.S. military personnel at Guantánamo that the laws banning torture are “ vaguely written ” and that torture is “ subject to perception . ”
Notes from that meeting quote Jonathan Fredman as saying , “ If the detainee dies , you 're doing it wrong . ”
More than 100 detainees have died in U.S. custody in Guantánamo , Afghanistan , and Iraq .
The U.S. military itself called 34 of these confirmed or suspected homicides .
This is one of them : a 47 year - old Iraqi man whose autopsy report concludes “ The severe blunt force injuries , the hanging position , the obstruction of the oral cavity with a gag contributed to this individual 's death .
The manner of death is homicide . ”
This image is in fact a painting by the artist Jenny Holzer — a remarkable example of the many ways in which American citizens are pressing for accountability for torture .
The actual , complete autopsy report is here .

At nearly 4 o’clock in the morning yesterday , Kieran Daly , who came out six months , ago was found by a police officer , motionless , in an intersection in Savannah .
His friends were administering first aid at the scene , and it would later be learned Daly suffered bruising to the brain and suffered two seizures immediately after he was allegedly attacked by two men , who would later tell police they did n’t like it that Daly was winking at them .
These two men are active duty Marines .
The police officer spotted Keil Joseph Cronauer , 22 , and Christopher Charles Stanzel , 23 ( pictured L - R ) , running away from what turned out to be a crime scene .
And you can be certain they ’re going to pull the “ gay panic ” defense .
Cronauer and Stanzel told police they were being harassed by a gay man and wanted to get away from him .
But witnesses painted a different picture , according to the report .
They told police one of the men grew angry because he thought Daly was winking at him and struck Daly in the back of the head with his fist , knocking him unconscious .
Saturday night , from his bed at Memorial University Medical Center , Daly insisted he tried to convince the Marines he was not winking at them .
“ The guy thought I was winking at him , ” Daly said .
“ I told him , ‘ I was squinting , man . … I ’m tired . ' ”
Daly said one of the men told him he demanded respect because he served in Iraq .
And at least one hurled slurs at him as he tried to walk away .
“ That ’s the last thing I remember is walking away , ” Daly said .
After being booked on misdemeanor battery charges at the Chatham County jail , Cronauer and Stanzel were released into the custody of military police .
Georgia does not have a hate crimes law — one of only five states in the U.S. lacking one .

When discussing financial matters , people often conflate money with wealth .
Although such loose language may be perfectly fine in everyday conversation , it 's important to occasionally go over the basics and make sure we are thinking about these issues in the proper way .
In this article , I use a recent National Public Radio interview in order to reiterate the basic distinction between money and wealth .
NPR's " Marketplace "
On the May 25 episode of NPR 's show " Marketplace , " host Kai Ryssdal wanted to get to the bottom of the incredible market volatility , so he called in a big gun :
KAI RYSSDAL : If ever there was a day not to peek at the Dow Industrials at the opening bell , why this was it .
Wall Street followed the global lead this morning .
Traders opened the day down 3 percent across the board and spent the next 7 ½ hours trying to get back to even .
They did get there , or close enough .
But in the past couple of weeks the three major indices have lost 10 percent or more .
More than 1,000 points on the Dow Industrials .
That is a lot of money not in stocks .
Chris Low is the chief economist at FTN Financial .
Chris , it 's good to talk to you again .
CHRIS LOW : Good to be here .
RYSSDAL : Where is all that money that 's going out of stocks going ?
It 's got to be going some place ?
LOW : You know , it is .
And one of the few places we 're seeing money flowing in is bank accounts .
RYSSDAL : So people are taking their money out of stocks and sticking it into a bank account that gets , I do n't know , like 1 or 2 percent interest ?
To be sure , there is a grain of truth in Ryssdal and Low 's analysis : many people presumably are alarmed at the prospect of holding so much of their wealth in the form of stock ownership , and so are selling shares in order to deposit more money into relatively safer assets — including very safe bank deposits .
However , the basic premise of the above interview — that a declining stock market means that money is coming out , and that therefore that money must be going somewhere else — is sloppy .
It implies that there is a fixed amount of financial asset wealth in the economy , and owners merely distribute this total among different classes .
To illustrate what 's wrong with this thinking , we can construct a simple example .
A Simple Economy
Suppose there is an economy consisting of three people : Alice , Bill , and Charlie .
Further suppose that there are only two forms of financial assets in this economy : keeping money in checking account balances at the bank , and holding shares of stock in the Acme Corporation .
Initially our three people hold the following assets :
Starting Financial Assets of Community Alice Bill Charlie $ 10,000 in checking $ 5,000 in checking 500 Acme shares @ $ 10 / share $ 5,000 in checking 500 Acme shares @ $ 10
Notice that in this initial configuration , everyone possesses $ 10,000 in financial wealth .
Alice has $ 10,000 in her checking account , whereas Bill and Charlie have their wealth evenly divided between checking and shares of Acme .
Further note that the total amount of financial wealth — at this moment — is $ 30,000 , while the total amount of money is $ 20,000 .
Now suppose that Bill realizes the current administration is staffed by Marxists and he thinks Acme 's profitability will soon take a nosedive .
Consequently he calls his broker and says , " I want to take my money out of stocks and put it into checking . "
The broker dutifully places an order to liquidate Bill 's entire portfolio at any price .
This huge sell order — which , after all , is dumping half of Acme 's outstanding shares — pushes down the price .
When it hits $ 3 per share , Alice tells her broker to jump on the opportunity .
After the trade is consummated , this is the configuration of the economy :
Ending Financial Assets of Community Alice Bill Charlie $ 8,500 in checking 500 Acme shares @ $ 3 / share $ 6,500 in checking $ 5,000 in checking 500 Acme shares @ $ 3
We can make several observations about the transformation of this hypothetical community .
First and most obvious , the total amount of money is the same : Although Bill increased his checking - account balance by $ 1,500 , Alice decreased her balance by the same amount .
Whenever someone sells stocks to raise cash , there must be someone on the other side of that transaction who is losing cash in order to acquire more stocks .
We can also note that while the total amount of money in the community stayed constant ( at $ 20,000 ) , the total amount of wealth decreased , from $ 30,000 down to $ 23,000 .
This loss of $ 7,000 can be decomposed into Bill 's loss of $ 3,500 and Charlie 's loss of $ 3,500 , each on his stock portfolio .
Specifically , when Acme shares were priced at $ 10 each , Bill and Charlie each held " $ 5,000 worth " of stock .
But when Bill dumped his entire holdings , this pushed the price down 70 percent , thereby pummeling the market value of Bill and Charlie 's portfolios .
The total " market cap " in this economy dropped from $ 10,000 down to $ 3,000 .
( Remember there are 1,000 shares of Acme Corporation in the economy . )
This $ 7,000 did n't " go " anywhere ; it certainly did n't go into checking accounts .
We can see this most clearly when considering Charlie 's position : Charlie did n't do anything at all with his assets , yet his personal wealth dropped from $ 10,000 to $ 6,500 .
It 's not that Alice or anybody else " took Charlie 's money , " it 's simply that the market price of Acme fell by $ 7 per share .
Conclusion
As our simple example showed , money and wealth are distinct .
In general , when investors reduce their demand for risky assets and flee to safe assets ( such as cash ) , this will depress the market value of the risky assets .
However , widespread selling of stocks by itself can't increase the total quantity of money .
In the real world , things are complicated by the fact that our banking system uses fractional reserves .
In this case , people really can influence the total quantity of money , based on their allocation of wealth .
Specifically , if people withdraw their funds from banks in order to hold physical currency , then the banks must contract their outstanding loans because of legal - reserve requirements .
If we are using a monetary aggregate such as M1 , which counts checking account balances as part of the money stock , then an increased demand to hold physical currency can shrink " the money supply . "
Similarly , there are also complications if we take " money " to be one of the broader aggregates , such as M2 or M3 , which include deposits in money - market accounts .
In this case , if people transfer their wealth from a money - market account into a straight checking account or physical currency , this too can affect " the money supply . "
Notwithstanding these complications , the simple economy in this article is a good starting point to clarify our thinking .
Money and wealth are distinct , and we should not assume that a fall in the stock indices necessarily means that " that money " has now been transferred someplace else .
NEGOTIATING WITH THOSE WHO OPPOSE THEIR OWN PRINCIPLES ….
This week , a couple of key Senate Republicans said they would never agree to any compromise on energy policy if it included a cap - and - trade provision .
If a proposal puts a cap on carbon emissions , and applies that cap to anyone or anything , anywhere , even a little , Republicans said they will kill the legislation and not allow the Senate to vote on it .
It led Mark Kleiman to raise a good point , and I hope he wo n’t mind if I quote it at length .
Why , I ’m so old that I remember when market - simulating pollution - control regulations — polluter charges or cap - and - trade — were the official conservative alternative to command - and - control regulation .
I was sympathetic to that critique , and frustrated about the environmental movement ’s unwillingness to see reason .
But now that the enviros have embraced a GHG tax or its cap - and - trade equivalent as the way to deal with global warming , conservative support is nowhere in sight .
They ’re all too afraid of Grover Norquist .
Remember this the next time a conservative explains how we ought to voucherize public education .
The minute that happens , the conservatives will come back and decide that we need to means - test the vouchers .
That done , they ’ll attack the remaining program as “ welfare . ”
This is not a group of people it ’s possible to do business with .
This is important .
Cap - and - trade — any version of it — has been deemed wholly unacceptable by Republicans this year .
But given the intense opposition to the idea , it ’s easy to forget that Republicans used to consider cap - and - trade a reasonable , market - based mechanism that was far preferable to command - and - control directives that the right found offensive .
And I ’m not talking about the distant past — the official position of the McCain / Palin Republican presidential ticket , not even two years ago , was to support cap - and - trade .
Not just in theory , either .
The official campaign website in 2008 told Americans that John McCain and Sarah Palin “ will establish … a cap - and - trade system that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions . ”
McCain / Palin ’s official position added , “ A cap - and - trade system harnesses human ingenuity in the pursuit of alternatives to carbon - based fuels . ”
Even George W. Bush awkwardly endorsed cap - and - trade before leaving office .
Democratic policymakers could , today , endorse the policy put forward by the Republican ticket from 2008 , and GOP senators would filibuster it .
Republicans said they wanted cap - and - trade , but now refuse to take “ yes ” for an answer .
The goal posts are always on the move , which in turn makes substantive policymaking with Republican lawmakers practically impossible .
Indeed , after Kleiman posted his piece this week , plenty of others noticed how common the phenomenon is .
Matt Yglesias noted :
Another major example I can think of is the Earned Income Tax Credit , once touted as the conservative alternative to welfare and / or restoring the real value of the minimum wage , but now supported almost exclusively by liberals while conservatives castigate the poor for not paying taxes .
Section 8 housing vouchers , put forward as an alternative to public housing and then repeatedly cut by GOP congresses is another one .
Of course this kind of consideration does n’t invalidate any given idea — I think auctioned , tradable emissions permits actually are the best way to regulate most sources of pollution and that housing vouchers are superior to old - school public housing .
But this kind of continual pulling away of the football by the conservative movement makes it quite difficult for us to reach stable consensus around decent policies .
Ezra Klein noted that Republicans used to support industry bailouts , but now consider them creeping socialism .
Jon Chait noted that the Republicans “ fervently embraced the logic of Keynesian stimulus in 2001 , ” but now fundamentally reject the same idea .
In perhaps my favorite example , the concept of an individual mandate as part of health care reform was , in fact , a Republican idea .
Now , the GOP considers it the single most offensive part of the Democratic policy .
The point is n’t to point out Republican inconsistencies ; that ’s fairly routine .
The point is to demonstrate that Republicans are so fundamentally unserious about solving public policy challenges , that they ’ll shamelessly move the goalposts at a moment ’s notice .
The party supports cap - and - trade , EITC , industry bailouts , housing vouchers , and mandatory health insurance — right up until there ’s a Democratic president .
Then , Republicans are no longer willing to even consider Republican ideas .
When the David Broders of the world lecture the dysfunctional Congress on the importance of policymakers working together in good faith , this dynamic tends to be overlooked entirely .
Credible people who are serious about solving problems can formulate consensus solutions .
But they ’ll invariably fail because Republicans have no qualms about fighting against their own proposals .

( CNN ) -- Swarms of bees hampered rescue efforts at the scene of a fatal wreck in Minnesota on Monday after they escaped from the damaged tractor - trailer that was hauling them , state highway patrol said .
One person was confirmed dead in the crash , which involved the bee truck , another tractor - trailer and two passenger vehicles , highway patrol spokesman Lt. Eric Roeske said .
Some first responders were stung as they reached the scene of the wreck on Interstate 35 in Lakeville , about 20 miles south of Minneapolis , Roeske said .
Firefighters were misting the air with fire hoses in an effort to keep the bees away more than three hours after the crash , he said .
Roeske said an investigation into the cause of the wreck was under way , but it appeared that the two passenger vehicles were crushed by the tractor - trailers .
" The damage is extreme , " he said , adding that one of the passenger vehicles was so mangled that police are unsure whether another victim is inside the car .
A person in the second passenger vehicle was airlifted to a hospital , Roeske said .
CNN 's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report .
We climbed two icebergs total ; first a " blocky " which is the shape of a cube and then a " dry dock , " which resembles a dry dock for boats .
" Dry dock " refers to the type of iceberg and not to whether it is grounded .
Our original intention was to climb only " tabular " iceberg , which is one who 's base is four times wider than it 's height .
But there was only one nearby and the swells were nearly 20 feet high .
" Pinnacle " icebergs are the classical shape that most people think about when they imagine icebergs .
Then there are " domes , " whose shape comes from the fact that they have rolled over , and " wedges , " which resemble a door wedge and are among the most unstable .
These shapes give us clues as to which ones we should consider and which ones we should approach with extreme caution .
These are only guidelines , however , because the most significant cause for an iceberg rolling is the ice under water .
Ninety percent of an icebergs mass is underwater .
Not only does this present a problem in evaluating the ice , this hidden mass could capsize a boat during the roll .
To demonstrate this point , look at how much of your ice cube is above the water in your next drink .
An iceberg rolls when its center of gravity changes .
This can occur from melting in warm saltwater or when the submerged iceberg strikes the ground , breaking off a large chunk .
Another factor is the changing of the low and high tides .
When tides go out the iceberg may hit the bottom of the bay .
The weight of the iceberg crushes the lower ice as it settles .
When high tide returns the iceberg begins to float again causing it to shift or roll to regain a new center of gravity .
Tides also affect the swells that one must navigate to approach and board an iceberg .
During our first climbing day we put the jet ski in the water to taxi out to our first iceberg .
However , rocks got into our propeller due to the deep sand and shells that made up the shoreline .
A crowd of curious fishermen began to gather around to watch us try to fix it and suggest ideas .
When it became apparent that we were not going to be able to fix our jet ski , they recommended that we talk with Shane , the village daredevil , who owned three of his own .
Fellow teammate Don Wargowsky talked with Shane about using one of his jet skis .
He was amenable to the idea but he wanted to take us out himself .
When Shane put his jet ski in the water and I boarded , it began to sink .
I thought that this must be some kind of a bad dream , but right then one of the fishermen , Godfrey , came around the corner in a small fishing boat .
This was the same fisherman who warned me minutes earlier that I would probably die .
After we had a talk about the chances we were taking , he finally said , " Everyone has a right to take their own risk . "
I got into Godfrey 's boat on shore and we headed toward the iceberg .
I could feel my heart pounding and my breathing was growing faster and faster .
As we approached the iceberg , ten - foot ocean swells were tossing the boat into and away from the iceberg with little effort .
The first obstacle became immediately apparent .
" How do I stick the iceberg with my ax while the boat is rising , falling and being pushed back and fourth sideways and colliding ? "
I fell several times trying to stand up in the small fishing boat while being tossed around .
The primary concern was falling between the iceberg and the boat .
The force of the collisions between the two could easily break my back or crush my skull .
Besides the incredible difficulty in standing during the swells , getting a solid stick with my ax into the iceberg required perfect timing .
If the stick was not solid enough for me to hold my body but enough to pull me in between the boat and the iceberg I had a problem .
I realized that what I had to do was to fully commit and quit worrying about how dangerous this all seemed .
Hesitation and fear was not what was needed to mount this iceberg .
As soon as the boat came into the iceberg once more I timed my swing and it caught solidly .
I then threw my left axe in and now had two solid axes in the iceberg .
I jumped out of the boat kicking my front points into the ice and climbed as fast as I could to clear the boat in case it came crashing back into the iceberg .
The ice was soft and somewhat sun-baked .
This refers to the way the sun softens the ice and produces more air bubbles in the ice , giving it a white color .
Typically an ice climber wants to aim for whiter ice because of the air bubbles .
This allows the ice to expand a little to absorb the force of the ax and not fragment off .
Clear ice lacks air bubbles and tends to fracture in a phenomenon called " dinner plating . "
Usually , sun -baked ice is not very solid , however on this iceberg our axes were very solid .
We had the benefit of only needing a single swing for a good stick but it was solid enough to take our body weight , which was necessary for us to throw our bodies onto the ice from the boat .
were also careful to swing for concave areas of the iceberg .
Our concern was that the ice was under so much pressure that the convex areas would explode .
Concave ice is seven times stronger than convex , an important fact for climbing ice under extreme conditions such as on an iceberg .
Our second iceberg had steep sides with an easy down climb .
We could n't trust just jumping off the berg because much of the mass was spread out far just below the surface .
We also did n't trust being connected to the berg by rope of any type .
Our concern was that we would be dragged underwater and drowned if we used ice screws .
We did n't even use leashes on the axes for the same reason .
The safest style was to solo leashless .
Leashless refers to climbing with out wrist leashes on the axes .
Climbers usually use leashes to take some of their body weight off of their hands to rest their grip .
On this day the wakes from the waves were not bad but still significant enough to make the initial stick into the berg difficult .
Again , the timing of the swing had to be precise .
The initial step onto the iceberg was steep and the ice was a bit harder than the day before .
I stuck my two axes in and jumped into the side of the berg .
My front points did n't get a perfect purchase into the ice , but they got enough to keep me from sliding between the boat and ' berg .
Although this ice was harder in texture I found it a bit more enjoyable to swing into .
It simply felt stronger and more secure .
Each swing still made that familiar high pitch crack from the 15,000 - year old high pressured air trapped in the ice .
I felt good and the climbing was very rhythmic .
Normally , waterfall ice has bulges or divots that a climber can use to place picks and kick their front points into .
Our icebergs were not like this whatsoever .
Iceberg ice is usually perfectly flat ; I have never seen ice so uniform and featureless in my life .
My line was steep and , without features to rest on , I would normally be a bit nervous .
But in order to climb an iceberg , you can not dwell on these things .
It is too late to worry about the steepness of the climb , or how difficult or tiring it may be .
Once you 're on the boat and then on the ' berg , it is time to perform , not to think about choices that you no longer have .
To be quick and confident we had to focus only on our climbing - stick one ax , " looks good , " stick the next , " looks good , " move feet up .
For me nothing else existed .
I got about halfway up when suddenly one of my axes caused a crack that I could feel through my crampons .
This was the only time I felt nervous .
I have no idea how deep the crack went or how it may have weakened the iceberg .
The villagers reported , however , that days later the entire iceberg that I was on would be nothing more than crumbled sea ice filling the bay .
Climbing the icebergs was the best and most exciting ice climbing I had ever done .
By normal climbing standards , the climbing itself was easy , but the thrill of getting off and on the boat and the uncertainty of what the iceberg would do added a danger that should make anyone consider , " Is this really worth it ? "
I am not in a position to say one way or another .
I can only say that every person is free to take their own risk .
The real question is , " If you died today are you ok with that ?
Are you willing to accept that this may be the last thing you are going to do , and do you still think it is a worthy enough goal to attempt with that in mind ? "
The answer to that can only be made by the person who is about to board the fishing boat and temp their own fate .

A new telescope in Hawaii being billed as the world ' slargest digital camera has begun searching the sky for potentially killerasteroids that could endanger our planet Earth .
With a main mirror about 60 inches ( 1.8 meters ) wide , thenew telescope on Maui's Haleakala volcano peak is somewhat small when comparedto the large 10 - meter Keck telescopes atop the Hawaiian peak of Mauna Kea .
But the telescope 's 1,400 - megapixel camera is a digitalgiant , with 1.4 billion pixels spread across 40 centimeters to snap photos ofthe night sky automatically , night after night , to find potentially dangerous asteroids .
A typical domestic digital camera may have 5 million pixels on a chip a few millimeters across , telescope officials said .
? Althoughmodest in size , this telescope is on the cutting edge of technology , ?
saidastronomer Nick Kaiser , who is leading the asteroid hunt , known as the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System ( Pan - STARRS ) .
?
It canimage a patch of sky about 40 times the area of the full moon , much larger thanany similar - sized telescope on Earth or in space .?
The asteroid hunt actually began on May 13 , when the newPan -STARRS telescope PS1 started its space rock survey .
That was when " theworld became a slightly safer place , " project officials said in astatement this week .
[ Moreasteroid photos . ]
Now , the new telescope has been turned over to the PS1Science Consortium , an international group of 10 institutions across the UnitedStates , Germany , Taiwan and the United Kingdom .
The consortium includes the University of Hawaii at Manoa , which built the Pan - STARRS telescope .
The telescope is prototype for the more ambitious P4observatory , a telescope that would be four times more powerful than P1 and sitatop Hawaii 's Mauna Kea .
As it is , P1 is expected to map about 75 percent ofthe night sky during its initial asteroidsearch .
Over the next three years , the new telescope is expectedto find 100,000 asteroids and determine which , if any , pose a collision threatto Earth , researchers said .
The observatory should also catalogue about fivebillion stars and 500 million galaxies , they added .
The new telescope is designed to take more than 500 photos of the sky every night and send 4 terabytes of data ( the equivalent of 1,000 DVDs ) to the Maui High Performance Computing Center for analysis .
Thecomputing center will compare the images with each other and older observationsto find any objects that have moved or changed in brightness , Pan-STARRSresearchers said .
Astronomers also hope to use the telescope to find browndwarfs , distant quasars and powerful supernova explosions in distant galaxies .
Of the many asteroids that fly in the region of spacearound Earth , only about 85 percent of the largest ones have been found , according to a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences .
About 15 percent of asteroids about 460 feet ( 140 meters ) wide ?
which could causewidespread local devastation if they hit Earth ?
have been tracked , the reportstated .
NASA routinely tracks asteroids and comets that fly nearEarth using a network of ground and space telescopes as part of its Near - EarthObject Observations program , though the National Academy of Sciences reportfound that more funding is needed for the space agency to meet its asteroidthreat census goals .
President Barack Obama has proposed a budget boostfor NASA 's asteroid - tracking program that would increase funding from $ 3.7 million in 2009 to $ 20.3 million in 2011 .
Obama has also proposed sendingastronauts to visit an asteroid by 2025 to gatherdata that could help astronomers find ways to deflect space rocks before theythreaten Earth and its inhabitants .
Lincoln 's portrait on the penny has always faced left , while Jefferson 's portrait on the nickel has faced left since 2003 .

If you take an assortment of United States coins and look at them face - up , you 'll notice that most of the portraits face left .
The penny and the nickel , however , are different .
Although there are several rather silly theories for why this is , the real explanations are pretty simple .
The Abraham Lincoln penny was minted in 1908 to commemorate the 100 - year anniversary of Lincoln 's birth .
In 1907 , President Theodore Roosevelt chose portraitist and sculptor Victor David Brenner to design the penny , probably because he admired Brenner 's previous works of art .
Those works included a bronze relief plaque bearing a portrait of Lincoln .
Brenner adapted this design for the " heads , " or obverse side of the penny .
He based the plaque on a photograph of Lincoln taken on Feb. 9 , 1864 by Anthony Berger .
Lincoln faced right in the photo , so he faces right on the plaque and faces right on the penny .

Thomas Jefferson , on the other hand , started out facing left on the nickel in 1938 .
In 2003 , the President enacted a law to revise the nickel in order to commemorate the bicentenary of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the Louisiana Purchase .
The U.S. Mint made this revision into a series .
On the 2004 nickel of the series , Jefferson still faces left and only the reverse side of the nickel changed to reflect its theme .
On the 2005 nickel , Jefferson faces right , with the word " Liberty , " based on his own handwriting , engraved next to him .
In 2006 , he faces forward , in an engraving based on a portrait done by Rembrandt Peale in 1800 , right before Jefferson became President .
The 2006 nickel is the first circulating U.S. coin that does not show a president in profile .

If this does n’t make you want to throw up in your mouth , I do n’t know what will :
“ How could we destroy our standards by hiring a guy stupid enough to write about people that way in a public forum ? ” one of my friends at the Post asked me when we spoke earlier today .
“ I ’m not suggesting that many people on the paper do n’t lean left , but there ’s leaning left , and then there ’s behaving like an idiot . ”
I gave my friend the answer he already knew :
The sad truth is that the Washington Post , in its general desperation for page views , now hires people who came up in journalism without much adult supervision , and without the proper amount of toilet - training .
This little episode today is proof of this .
But it is also proof that some people at the Post ( where I worked , briefly , 20 years ago ) still know the difference between acceptable behavior and unacceptable behavior , and that maybe this episode will lead to the reimposition of some level of standards .
That ’s the Atlantic ’s Jeffrey Goldberg , who single - handedly wrote the absolutely most factless pieces of propaganda in the run-up to the war in Iraq this side of Judy Miller , and to my knowledge has never corrected the record in detail and atoned for his sins .
That ’s the same Jeffrey Goldberg who is so incapable of forming constructive arguments that he basically spent the earlier part of the year sputtering that his co-worker Andrew Sullivan is an anti-Israeli propagandist .
That is , of course , until the adults at the Atlantic probably stepped in and told him to knock it off ( an assertion of mine that has at least as much evidence as Goldberg ’s assertions about WMD .
Although it is entirely possible he just stopped because he was losing the argument ) .
And we could go on and on , whether the topic is Chas Freeman , Iran , etc .
If that is the kind of bile and trash that Jeffrey Goldberg thinks makes him a refined and “ toilet - trained ” writer , then I can only assume that every one of the adults in his blackberry and in his rolodex still shits the bed .
The rules still hold true - all sorts of disgusting and bizarre worldviews are acceptable among the “ toilet - trained ” Beltway elites ( Krauthammer , Will , Thiessen , Kristol , and many others still write for the WaPo ) , but do n’t drink out of the finger bowl or use a four letter word or your ass is history .
*** Update ***
Goldberg is the gift that keeps on giving :
I ’ve been leaked postings from JournoList before — wonderfully charming things written about me , as you might have guessed — and I have n’t had the opportunity to use them , but would be happy to if the need arose .
Followed shortly by this :
.
On the other hand , I was repulsed — really repulsed — by his invitation to Matt Drudge to kill himself .
I despise violent keyboard - cowboyism …
Shorter Jeffrey Goldberg : “ I ’m not against using my perch at the Atlantic to publish someone ’s private emails to viciously destroy their character and career , but what really bothers me is if someone makes a joke privately ! ”
I think that pretty much sums up everything you need to know about Goldberg .
I ’m just done reading him .
Period .
Welcome to the Mortal Kombat Wiki , Kombatant !
The wiki about Mortal Kombat , a series of fighting games developed by NetherRealm Studios .
We are currently editing over 2,242 articles dating back to 2006 .
Mortal Kombat ( commonly abbreviated MK ) is a popular series of fighting games created by Midway , which in turn spawned a number of related media .
It is especially noted for its digitized sprites ( which differentiated it from its contemporaries ' hand - drawn sprites ) , and its mix of bloody and brutal action ; its graphic Fatality killing moves contributed to the founding of the ESRB .
The original Mortal Kombat was developed as a reaction to the popular Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II , with simpler controls and digitized graphics .
The original idea of Mortal Kombat was thought up in 1989 along with storyline and game content , but not put to arcades until 1991 ( and game systems ) .
Some say the game 's graphic violence was gratuitous , and was only included in order to generate a public outcry and controversy that would garner publicity for the game .
Although highly controversial , the mix of realism and violence propelled Mortal Kombat to widespread and historic renown .
anywhere at any time .
In the Obama era , just as in the Bush years , these beliefs remain unquestioned .
In this vivid analysis , Andrew J. Bacevich presents the origins of this consensus , forged at a moment when American power was at its height .
He exposes the preconceptions , biases , and habits that underlie our pervasive faith in military might , especially the notion that overwhelming superiority will oblige others to accommodate America 's needs and desires -- whether for cheap oil , cheap credit , or cheap consumer goods .
And he challenges the usefulness of our militarism as it has become both unaffordable and increasingly dangerous -- From publisher description .

For the last half century , as administrations have come and gone , the fundamental assumptions about America 's military policy have remained unchanged : American security requires the United States ( and us alone ) to maintain a permanent armed presence around the globe , and to be ready to intervene
With recent high - profile police brutality videos coming out of Seattle and Detroit , the NYPD may have feared it was falling behind .
Not to worry !
They 've just released a video of a cop viciously beating an Iraq War veteran in 2008 .
The New York Post reports that prosecutors in the police brutality trial of cop David London released these video snippets yesterday , which show London whupping the hell out of Army vet Walter Harvin in a project lobby , after the two argued .
( They do n't show the part where Harvin was still being beaten after being handcuffed ) .
The NYPD will never let you down .
Israel last night flouted pressure for an independent international inquiry into the lethal assault two weeks ago on a flotilla of ships attempting to break the blockade on Gaza , announcing an internal investigation with two foreign observers .
The White House gave its approval for the Israeli formula , which will be confirmed by the Israeli cabinet today .
The inquiry into the raid , in which nine Turkish activists aboard the Mavi Marmara were killed , will be headed by a former Israeli supreme court judge , Yaakov Tirkel .
The foreign observers are the former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble and a Canadian judge , Ken Watkin .
They will have no voting rights .
The inquiry falls short of a UN proposal for an international investigation , but was agreed after consultation with the US .
The White House said last night that the Israeli inquiry meets the standard of " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation " .
Since the flotilla assault , world attention has shifted to Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
Pressure to ease it will intensify today when EU foreign ministers are expected to adopt a robust position .
Spain , which currently holds the EU 's rotating presidency , will press for a vigorous approach , with support from France , Italy and the UK .
The Spanish prime minister , José Luis Zapatero , called at the weekend for a strong joint EU position on the siege .
Zapatero said his foreign minister , Miguel Ángel Moratinos , would argue at the meeting that the EU should stand up for the end of the blockade on Gaza and extend all its political and diplomatic capacity to reach that goal .
The Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , told his cabinet colleagues yesterday that discussions about Israel 's policy towards Gaza , which have included three meetings with the Middle East Quartet envoy Tony Blair in the past eight days , were continuing .
Blair , who will brief today 's EU meeting , is pressing for Israel to substitute the current allowed list of items permitted to enter Gaza – all items not on the list are forbidden – for a limited list of prohibited items , with everything else permitted .
The result would be greater transparency and accountability .
Netanyahu told the cabinet : " The principle guiding our policy is clear : to prevent war material from entering Gaza and to allow the entry of humanitarian aid and non-contraband goods . "
Despite the pressure to relax the siege , Israel is reluctant to make a dramatic move which would allow Hamas to claim a victory .
Aid agencies and the UN are also concerned that Israel will restrict any relaxation to essential humanitarian supplies which , although needed , will not help Gaza s legitimate economy to recover and regain its authority over the black market economy , which is based on goods smuggled in via tunnels from Egypt .
Phil Bloomer , Oxfam 's policy director , said : [ Gaza 's ] conventional economy is in tatters .
Without a full lifting of the blockade it will continue on a downward spiral . "
Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , yesterday called off a trip to a Paris arms show , amid reports that pro-Palestinian groups in France would seek his arrest over the flotilla deaths .
Amr Moussa , the secretary general of the Arab League , arrived in Gaza yesterday in the most high - profile visit by an Arab official since Hamas took control of the territory in June 2007 , after winning elections six months earlier .
He was expected to meet the Hamas prime minister , Ismail Haniyeh , to discuss the prospects of reconciliation between Fatah , which dominates the West Bank and is the party of the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , and Hamas .
Moussa told a press conference in Rafah : " The Palestinians deserve that the world , and not just the Arab world , stand by them in the face of the siege and in the face of what is happening in the occupied territories and Jerusalem . "
When Arizona introduced its new immigration law , aimed toward battling illegal immigration , its many critics –including President Obama–angrily protested , claiming it was racist ( or that it would encourage racism ) .
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vehemently denied it .
Today , Arizona has once again made the news–and once again , it ’s about racism .
A group of artists who painted a public mural in Prescott , Ariz .
has been asked to lighten the faces of the children depicted in the mural .
R.E. Wall , director of the Prescott Downtown Mural Project , told the Daily Courier he and the other artists “ heard regular racial slurs from the passengers of cars driving by ” while they were working on the mural .
The “ Go on Green ” mural covers two walls outside Miller Valley Elementary School , and it aims to advertise a campaign for environmentally friendly transportation .
It features portraits of four children , and a Hispanic boy as the predominant figure .
According to USA Today , Principal Jeff Lane said he asked Wall to make the children ’s faces appear lighter , but solely for artistic reasons :
“ We asked them to fix the shading on the children ’s faces , ” he said .
“ We were looking at it from an artistic view .
Nothing at all to do with race . ”
Furthermore , City Councilman Steve Blair reportedly led a campaign to have the mural removed entirely .
According to the Daily Courier , Blair made several controversial remarks on his KYCA radio talk show :
On his May 21 show , for instance , Blair said , “ I am not a racist individual , but I will tell you depicting a black guy in the middle of that mural , based upon who ’s president of the United States today and based upon the history of this community when I grew up , we had four black families – who I have been very good friends with for years – to depict the biggest picture on that building as a black person , I would have to ask the question , ‘ Why ? ' ”
Blair also said he is not a “ a racist by any stretch of the imagination , but whenever people start talking about diversity , it ’s a word I ca n’t stand . ”
Under pressure , Wall is altering the mural .
But the racial dispute in Arizona , no doubt , is in full swing .

BP : WikiLeaks ’ Finest Hour ?
As I wrote in my last column , the Internet and the digital revolution have enabled individuals with affordable desktop hardware to engage in forms of production , in a wide range of cultural and information industries , that previously required hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital outlays .
And the watchdog function , monitoring and exposing corporate malfeasance , is one of them .
WikiLeaks , a website that hosts leaked documents , is a case in point .
Time and again , WikiLeaks has attracted the ire of corporations and government agencies by serving as a venue in which the disgruntled employees of those corporations and agencies can expose the malfeasance of their employers .
As Reason ’s Jesse Walker put it , the government “ does n’t want to deal with a world where a disillusioned functionary can spill secrets so easily . ”
Most recently , Bradley Manning , a soldier who leaked the video of an airstrike that killed two Reuters reporters , suffered a penalty — arrest — that Obama considers too divisive for Bush administration torturers .
Not long before , a U.S. counterintelligence report recommended “ [t ] he identification , exposure , termination of employment , criminal prosecution , legal action against current or former insiders , leakers , or whistlblowers ” as a deterrent to other leakers .
This was only the most recent in a long series of government and corporate attempts to shut down WikiLeaks in the face of embarrassment .
Not to put too fine a point on it , the cockroaches do n’t like it when you turn on the kitchen light .
Unfortunately for would - be censors , they ’ve found that attempts to suppress online information results in the so - called Streisand Effect , named for an attempt by Barbra Streisand suppress photos of her house online — with the suppression itself generating so much publicity , and mirroring of the original content , that untold millions of people wound up seeing the photos .
It seems to me that BP could benefit from running up against the Streisand Effect — or rather , that we could all benefit from it doing so .
Surely there must be more than a few disgruntled employees at BP corporate headquarters with access to documents concerning the deferral of expenditures on safety equipment , orders to go ahead with risky operations in the face of warnings from engineers , orders to cut corners on normal safety measures in order to save time and reduce costs , and so forth .
Such workers likely also have access to all sorts of documents written after the disaster occurred , ordering those in charge of cleanup efforts to refuse respirators and other protective gear to cleanup workers and to fire those who brought their own .
Or memos ordering cleanup workers to stonewall the press .
Or documented evidence of collusion with local governments to bar access to the press .
Or documented refusals to share the formula for dispersant chemicals .
Come on .
There must be countless people out there who chafed at working under sorry specimens of humanity like Tony Hayward , suffering all the indignities those of us in Corporate America know all too wall , just itching for revenge against the human filth whose criminal negligence caused this disaster to happen .
We ’ve seen from this incident just how close to worthless the regulatory state really is .
In the future , the really effective sanction against corporate malfeasance is likely to be exposure by the “ small people ” working within the belly of the beast .
A thousand disgruntled workers who know how to anonymously upload a file attachment and click “ send ” are a lot harder to buy off than a government regulator .
So come on , BP workers , step up to the plate .
Help expose the scum of the earth to the public accountability they ’re begging for .
You ’ll be glad you did .
Last November a police officer shot and killed David Masters , an unarmed motorist , as he sat in the driver 's seat of his car on the side of Richmond Highway , a major thoroughfare in Fairfax County , Virginia .
Masters was wanted for allegedly stealing flowers from a planter .
He had been given a ticket the day before for running a red light and then evading the police , though in a slow and not particularly dangerous manner .
In January of this year , Fairfax County Commonwealth Attorney Raymond Morrogh announced through a press release that he would not be filing any charges against the officer who shot Masters .
The shooting , Morrogh found , was justified due to a " furtive gesture " that suggested Masters had a weapon .
The only eyewitness to this gesture was the police officer who pulled the trigger .
There exists dash - camera video of Masters ' shooting .
There are also police interviews of other witnesses , and there is the police report itself .
But the public and the press are unlikely to see those , or even to learn the officer 's name .
That 's because the Fairfax County Police Department — along with the neighboring municipal police departments of Arlington and Alexandria — is among the most secretive , least transparent law enforcement agencies in the country .
Michael Pope , a reporter who covers Northern Virginia for the Connection Newspapers chain and for WAMU - FM , filed a series of open records requests related to the Masters shooting with the Fairfax County Police Department .
All were denied .
In March , Pope asked Fairfax County Police Public Information Officer Mary Ann Jennings why her department wo n't at least release the incident report on Masters ' death , given the concerns that some have raised about the shooting .
" Let us hear that concern , " Jennings shot back .
" We are not hearing it from anybody except the media , except individual reporters . "
Except the media ?
That 's exactly who you would expect to file most open records requests .
Asked why her department wo n't even release the name of the officer who shot Masters , Jennings got more obtuse .
" What does the name of an officer give the public in terms of information and disclosure ? " Jennings asked .
" I 'd be curious to know why they want the name of an officer . "
Well , for starters , because he 's a government employee , paid by taxpayers and entrusted with the power to arrest , detain , coerce , and kill .
And he recently used the most serious of those powers on an unarmed man .
Releasing the name would allow reporters to see if the officer has been involved in other shootings or if there have been prior disciplinary measures or citizen complaints against him .
It would allow the media to assess whether the Fairfax County Police Department has done an adequate job of training him in the use of lethal force .
Then again , journalists can't get that other information either .
The default position of the Fairfax County Police Department , Pope says , is to decline all requests for information .
And not just from the media .
When a member of the county SWAT team shot and killed 38 - year - old optometrist Sal Culosi Jr. in 2006 , it took nearly a year , plus legal action , to get the department to release information about its investigation of the shooting to Culosi 's family .
Culosi , who had been suspected of wagering on football games with friends , was also unarmed when he was killed .
In a state that the professional journalism association Investigative Reporters and Editors ranks the fifth most transparent in the country , the police departments in Fairfax County , Arlington , and Alexandria have managed to interpret the open records law in a way that lets them be almost completely opaque .
" Part of my daily routine when I worked in Florida was to drive to the police station and get a copy of the previous day 's incident reports , " Pope says .
" I was just dumbfounded when I started working in Virginia . "
The police rejected all his requests for information — even for incident reports about arrests the same department had described in press releases .
Invoking a phrase that traditionally refers to censorship , Fairfax County 's Jennings told Pope that releasing police reports to the press would have a " chilling effect " on victims and witnesses , discouraging them from coming forward to report crimes .
As Pope notes , that does n't appear to be the case in cities that routinely release police reports , as nearly all do .
When Pope asked Jennings what evidence she has to support her theory , she replied , " I do n't know if there 's evidence or not .
All I have is what our investigators and what our commanders and the police administration believe . "
Do n't expect elected officials to correct any of this .
" I am in the corner of trusting our police department , " Arlington County Board Member Barbara Favola told Pope .
" If they push back I am not going to override them , and I do n't think I could get three votes on the board to override them either . "
Alexandria Commonwealth Attorney Randolph Sengel fired off an indignant letter to the editor after Pope wrote about the secrecy in the northern Virginia police departments .
Calling Pope 's well - reported piece a " rant " that was " thinly disguised as a news story , " Sengel declared , " Law enforcement investigations and prosecutions are not carried out for the primary purpose of providing fodder for his paper . "
Mocking the media 's role as a watchdog , Sengel added , " The sacred ' right of the public to know ' is still ( barely ) governed by standards of reasonableness and civility , " as if those two adjectives were incompatible with a journalist inquiring about the details of a fatal police shooting of an unarmed man .
" The most offensive theme of this article , " Sengel complained , " is the notion that law enforcement agencies decline to release these reports to protect their own , or to conceal corrupt behavior .
… Believe it or not , the reporter and his colleagues are not the last true guardians of truth and justice , the attainment of which does not hang on unfettered exercise of journalistic zeal .
Last time I checked there were multiple safeguards in place to assure the integrity of the criminal justice system . "
These are remarkably wrongheaded sentiments , especially coming from an elected prosecutor .
There have been several cases across the country where police reports have n't jibed with video evidence or have otherwise turned out to be inaccurate .
Journalists and advocacy groups have used public records to shed light on bogus arrests , police cover-ups , poor police training , and wrongful convictions .
Sengel seems indignant at the very idea that a lowly journalist might be looking over his shoulder , or over the shoulders of the cops who bring him the people he prosecutes .
Fairfax County has n't charged a police officer for an on - duty shooting in 70 years .
Perhaps that 's because no officer there has deserved to be charged .
But perhaps local police and prosecutors have too cozy a relationship .
The point is , we do n't know .
And northern Virginia 's cops have made it almost impossible to find out .

Labour ministers claimed that guidance would be amended so that “ completely untrue ” allegations are not included in a teacher ’s references , but an updated document published in March insisted : “ It is important that employers keep a clear and comprehensive summary of any allegations made , details of how the allegation was followed up and resolved , and details of any action taken and decisions reached , on a person ’s confidential personnel file and give a copy to the individual .

Last November , I proposed that for this Summer ’s world Cup Altitude will be key , the thinner air in Johannesburg will cause the ball to behave significantly differently than at sea level .
Less air resistance means faster shots and straighter trajectories .
As part of a feature for the New Scientist ( p35 - 37 , June 5th 2010 ) we created a shot simulator to show how the same shot behaves at different altitudes .
I also studied matches played by Mexico in the FIFA World Cup preliminary rounds leading to the current Finals , including home games at Mexico City at an altitude of 2,200 m .
Fig 1 . Maradona lifts the World Cup in Mexico ’s Azteca Stadium in 1986 .
The raw data , provided by Prozone , comes from the analysis of synchronised high definition video cameras at each game .
Eight World Cup Preliminary matches involving Mexico were analysed ( Table 1 ) and the venues categorized using FIFA ’s definitions as near sea-level ( 0 - 500 m ) , low altitude ( 500 - 2,000 m ) and moderate altitude ( 2,000 - 3,000 m ) .
Although the data set is quite small ( and one must always be careful about using small numbers to make big conclusions ) , there are some interesting trends .
Date Home team Score Away team Venue Altitude Definition 19-11-2008 Honduras 1 - 0 Mexico San Pedro Sula 80 m Near sea-level 28-3-2009 Mexico 2- 0 Costa Rica Mexico City 2,200 m Moderate 1-4-2009 Honduras 3 - 1 Mexico San Pedro Sula 80 m Near sea-level 6-6-2009 El
Salvador 2 - 1 Mexico San Salvador 660 m Low 10-6-2009 Mexico 2 - 1 Trinidad & Tobago Mexico City 2,200 m Moderate 12-8-2009 Mexico 2 - 1 United States Mexico City 2,200 m Moderate 9-9-2009 Mexico 1 - 0 Honduras Mexico City 2,200 m Moderate 25-9-2009 Costa Rica 0 - 3 Mexico San Jose 1,200 m Low
Table 1 . FIFA qualifying matches involving Mexico .
Figure 2 shows that shots from outside the box increase from just less than 5 per game at sea level to over 7 per game at moderate altitude .
Conversely , the number of shots from inside the box seems to decrease .
This is translated directly into the number of shots on target , with more from outside the box than inside the box .
The implication is , therefore , that players playing at altitude might be more inclined to take shots from longer distance to take advantage of the straighter , faster trajectories .
Whether this results in more goals is difficult to say as there is n’t really enough data in this data set , so I ’ve stopped here .
Figure 2 .

South Africa
The consequences for the World Cup Finals in South Africa will be interesting to see .
Will there be more shots from outside the area in Johannesburg ?
The ball bends less and flies faster at altitude for a given kick , so shots will tend to be straighter and faster .
Will players go for curling shots or straight shots ?
Will the goalies complain ?
One thing that seems quite certain , though , is that adidas has done its utmost to produce the most engineered ball for any World Cup so far ( see the video below to see how a ball is made ) .
The ball is constructed from eight 3D panels and thermally bonded together around an internal bladder .
Their tests show that the ball should fly relatively straight when it has little or no spin , a ‘ wobbly ’ ball is something that goalies in particular have complained of in the past .
Most importantly , the ball will be consistent so any odd occurrences should be due to the player or environmental factors .
So , after the pomp of the opening ceremony on June 11th has subsided , sit back to enjoy the first game between South Africa v Mexico , two teams who should have significant experience of the effects of altitude on play .
Let ’s see how the players react and if they really do go for shots from distance .

QUETTA : Acid attacks on two sisters in Dalbandin , Balochistan , on April 13 , followed by another attack on three sisters a couple of weeks later in Kalat on April 29 , have been effective in spreading fear among women in Balochistan .
One reason for the fear is that the culprits are still at large .
According to the residents of Dalbandin , the day after the attack on the two sisters , unidentified persons distributed pamphlets in which a group called Baloch Ghairatmand took responsibility for the attacks and threatened women unaccompanied by male family members of similar attacks .
These pamphlets were distributed in different places in the town , including the Dalbandin Press Club , shopping centres and some houses .
Thirteen - year - old Gul Begum and 11 - year - old Dur Jamal , belonging to a poor family which lives in a tent , were attacked by two masked men on a motorcycle .
According to Dur , “ some donkeys came close to our tent and when I went out to push them away two masked men on a motorcycle appeared and threw acid on me . ”
Hearing her cries , her sister Gul came out of the tent and she too was attacked with acid .
The sisters denied reports that they were returning from the market when the attacks were carried out .
DPO Chagai Pir Jan Mengal said the police are close to catching the criminals .
“ Security has been beefed up in the town so there is no fear among the women and others , ” he said , adding that the police had detained a lot of people who provided important information .
However , a local journalist Hyder Hajiz told The Express Tribune that women are avoiding leaving their homes without the company of male family members .
“ Threats are circulating through cell phone messages and pamphlets , ” he said .
“ I received a message in which the names of women who are on the target list were mentioned , ” he added , showing the message .
Hajiz also pointed out that given an acute shortage of drinking water in the area , people , including women , are forced to travel long distances to get water .
But after the attack on the sisters and in the absence of adequate measures by the police , women are too scared to get water .
The attack in Kalat targeted three sisters , aged 20 , 14 and eight , while they were walking on the road .
The three received severe burns on their faces .
This time too , the perpetrators wore masks and rode a motorbike .
There were other similarities too with the Dalbandin attack .
Residents said that a few days prior to the attacks , unidentified people threw pamphlets in houses , shopping centres and NGO offices , threatening women who stepped outside unaccompanied by male family members .
This time though , a group calling itself Rah-e - Raast claimed to be behind the message .
And a Kalat - based journalist , Shadi Khan , told The Express Tribune that a few days ago , two masked men stopped a Government Girls ’
College van and told the driver that girls walking to college would be attacked .
“ The commercial areas are now deserted as women avoid going shopping , ” he said , adding that girls or women on the road tend to get scared every time a motorcycle passes by .
Meanwhile , the Kalat police say that they are facing difficulties investigating the crime due to non-cooperation by the victims ’ family .
Threatening messages , mostly via pamphlets , were also distributed in Kharan , Nushkhi , Quetta , Mastung and other areas .
The result is that in Quetta too women are avoiding bazaars .
One resident , Nasurullah , said that his mother asks him to run all the errands now .
“ My mother used to go to buy vegetables every day but since the attacks she asks me to go instead . ”
Different political parties , including the Baloch National Front , Balochistan National Party , National Party , Jamiate - Ulema Islam , Jamaat -e- Islami and Baloch Republican Party have condemned the incidents , terming them against Baloch tradition .
Balochistan Assembly member from the Kalat district , Rubina Irfan , expressed her dissatisfaction with the government ’s efforts in dealing with the crimes , saying that not a single person was arrested in the past month and neither was a committee constituted to probe the matter .
“ I brought an adjournment motion regarding this crucial issue but instead of approving it for debate , the speaker disposed of the motion which shows the non-seriousness of the government in addressing women - related issues , ” she said .
Strongly criticising the law enforcement agencies , Irfan said it is astonishing that they have failed to trace culprits in towns so small that all the residents know each other .

Celebrate the delicious diversity of the great American hamburger .
Each week for 20 weeks the AP will feature a new burger created by the biggest names in the food world .
Rick Bayless ' goal was simple — the best of Mexico and the U.S. in one delicious burger .
To get from dream to dinner plate , the man famous for showing Americans just how good — and even upscale — Mexican food can be , drew inspiration from queso fundido , an appetizer of melted cheese , onions , chilies and sometimes meat .
So Bayless — whose restaurants include Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in Chicago — decided to deconstruct the queso fundido a bit , adding the chorizo to the burger itself and using the melted cheese , roasted peppers and caramelized onions as toppings .
QUESO FUNDIDO BURGER
2 fresh medium poblano chilies
2 teaspoons canola or vegetable oil
1 medium yellow onion , sliced into 1/4 - inch slices
2 cloves garlic , minced
Salt
1 1/2 pounds ground chuck
8 ounces chorizo , crumbled and cooked ( browned in a skillet )
1 to 2 canned chipotle chilies in adobo , finely minced ( seeded if desired )
8 thick slices Monterey Jack cheese
4 hamburger buns , lightly toasted
One at a time , use tongs to hold the chilies over a gas burner , turning until well charred , about 5 minutes .
You also can set the chilies under a broiler for about 10 minutes , turning regularly .
Place the chilies in a bowl , cover with a kitchen towel and let cool .
Rub off the blackened skin and pull out and discard the stems and seed pods .
Cut the chilies into 1/4 - inch strips .
In a medium skillet over medium , heat the oil .
Add the onion and saute until it begins to brown , 7 to 8 minutes .
Stir in the garlic and poblanos and cook for 2 minutes .
Season with salt , usually about 1/2 teaspoon .
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and cover to keep warm .
In a large bowl , combine the ground chuck , cooked chorizo , chipotles and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt .
Mix until well combined .
Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and form into patties .
Heat a gas grill to medium - high , or light a charcoal fire and let it burn until the charcoal is covered with white ash ( about medium hot ) ; bank the coals to one side .
Place the hamburger patties on the grill and cook for a total of 4 to 5 minutes for medium rare .
Lay one piece of cheese on top of each burger , top with the warm onions and chilies , then another piece of cheese .
Close the lid of the grill and continue cooking until the cheese has melted , about 1 minute .
Remove from the grill and slide onto a toasted bun .
He is accused of eating part of the lung raw and then frying the rest of it with some onions on a makeshift cooker in the cell in the Rouen prison .
There 's a story , apparently a true one , that after Jimi Hendrix came off stage at the legendary Woodstock festival , he was asked what it was like to be the greatest guitar player in the world .
" I do n't know , " he answered .
" Ask Rory Gallagher . "
This week , fans travelled from all corners of the globe to honour the rock icon at the unveiling of a new statue in the Donegal town of Ballyshannon , where he was born in 1948 , and to attend the annual Rory Gallagher International Tribute Festival .
Gallagher was the guitarist 's guitarist .
As a youngster , Brian May of Queen approached Rory and asked how he achieved his wonderfully dirty sound .
A gentle and gracious man , he shared his trade secrets with the novice and , as May revealed : " That 's how I got my sound . "
Others who have cited Gallagher as a big influence include The Edge , Slash from Guns N' Roses and Johnny Marr from The Smiths .
Next Thursday , RTE will air a new documentary about the guitarist with contributions from The Edge , Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman and other stars .
The programme marks the 15th anniversary of Gallagher 's death in 1995 at the wastefully early age of 47 .
It 's a little - known fact that Gallagher almost joined Wyman in the Rolling Stones after the band 's guitarist Mick Taylor walked out following a series of blow - ups with Keith Richards .
Rory 's brother Donal , who was also his manager , explains : " It was January 1975 .
We 'd just finished a tour and we got home to Cork .
We got a phone call late at night from a man with a funny accent .
He gave his name as Ian Stewart ( the Stones ' pianist and road manager ) and asked if Rory would like to join the band .
" Rory would n't take the call .
He thought it was a prank .
So Ian rang back a second time and asked if Rory would go to Rotterdam to record the album that became Black And Blue .
" So Rory went over and played some sessions , but he was scheduled to go on a Japanese tour and it was n't easy to pull out .
He stayed for a few days and he was asked to go to Keith 's hotel room for a chat about joining the band .
" Unfortunately Keith was comatose and Rory spent the night trying to revive him .
Morning came and there were none of the other Stones around , so Rory just went to the airport and flew out to Japan . "
Rory Gallagher sold millions of records but the real foundation for his strong international fanbase was his powerhouse live delivery .
He cut his teeth as a schoolboy playing pop covers with showbands but as his passion for the blues developed he struck out on his own .
He perfected a distorted , gritty sound , combining screeching slide guitar with a rich growl of a voice .
In an era when flamboyant hippy chic was all the rage , Gallagher remained resolutely anti-fashion .
He rarely took to the stage without his trademark check lumberjack shirt .
He formed his own band , Taste , in the mid-1960s .
They gave a storming performance at the legendary 1970 Isle of Wight festival where 600,000 fans overwhelmed the sleepy island for a stellar bill that Taste shared with Hendrix , Bob Dylan , The Who and The Doors .
With his reputation soaring , Rory revamped himself as the solo star of his band .
The 1970s were a prolific decade when he made the time to record 10 albums in between lengthy tours .
One exhausting trek took in 100 shows across 12 countries in just 16 weeks .
In 1971 , the readers of Melody Maker voted him Top International Musician Of The Year , ahead of Eric Clapton .
The tide turned against Gallagher towards the end of that decade when his marathon virtuoso jams were snubbed by a new generation of music fans devoted to rudimentary three - minute ditties .
Donal , who today runs his own music label in London , reflects : " In Ireland at that time he was taken for granted .
People thought Rory was like a number 11 bus -- there will be another one along in five minutes .
But there was n't another Rory .
He was unique .
But when that new wave of bands came along , like The Boomtown Rats and U2 , he was by - passed .
No one cited Rory .
It was a low point for him . "
Gallagher 's low points could plunge him into an abyss .
He once remarked : " I agonise too much . "
He nursed a sense of foreboding about his own mortality .
The death of Thin Lizzy 's Phil Lynott at the age of 35 in 1986 shocked and dismayed him .
Turning 40 , he reflected on the wear and tear he inflicted on himself over decades of living what he called his " gypsy " rock 'n ' roll lifestyle .
Forever a driven and restless perfectionist , he told one interviewer : " I 'd rather go crazy on the road than off it , because it 's one or the other .
" If I could only be the relaxed type of musician I would be much healthier because then I could switch off for a night or go off for a holiday .
I do n't take holidays in the sun because so many prospects get delayed .
I 'm still trying to get over the workaholic thing because it is bad for you .
I do n't take vitamin pills and all that stuff but I got through ( his relatively lean years ) . "
Rory Gallagher was n't taking vitamin pills , but towards the end he was taking a cocktail of more sinister pills and at the age of 40 he knew that he was burning the candle dangerously at both ends .
He reflected : " My dream would be to be fit and healthy at 65 and still playing , but that 's asking too much of the man upstairs , it really is . "
His brother Donal says : " Yeah , he knew he was never going to be John Lee Hooker ( the blues legend who was still gigging into his eighties ) .
" I think the medications various doctors gave him were psychotic .
His drinking did n't help .
He went into a spiral of depression .
A lot of his later tracks were doom - laden .
He had fallen into a state of mind where it was hard to get him out of it .
" On one of the later tours , I broke into his dressing room and took a plastic bag of pills .
I took them to a doctor who said you would n't be allowed to take all these medications even under supervision . "
Despite his deteriorating health , he continued to tour .
By the time of his final gig in early 1995 he was visibly unwell .
A liver transplant some months later failed to take , and he died in June 1995 .
The lyrics of Joni Mitchell 's ' Big Yellow Taxi ' could apply to Rory Gallagher : " Do n't it always seem to go / That you do n't know what you 've got till it 's gone . "
His stature has grown since his passing .
Today he is commemorated with statues in Temple Bar 's Rory Gallagher Corner and Cork 's Rory Gallagher Place .
Ballyshannon has its Rory Gallagher Exhibition and Festival .
Paris has its Rue Rory Gallagher , while the French town of Bedoin has a street named Impasse Rory Gallagher .
He has even featured on a postage stamp .
There wo n't be another one along in five minutes .
Featuring contributions from The Edge , Slash , Bob Geldof and Bill Wyman , the documentary Rory Gallagher -- Ghost Blues marks the 15th anniversary of the guitarist 's death .
The hour - long programme goes out next Thursday on RTE 1 at 10.15 .

Right after I finished my Q1 total Smartphone Market Analysis , Google ( Nasdaq : GOOG ) came out with the statement that they now sell 100,000 smartphones per day .
There are 61 models of Android handsets by 21 branded manufacturers ( including Google itself , with its Nexus One as one Android handset model ) .
Run rates
What does this tell us ?
Well , the quick math of course says Google is now ( in May 2010 ) selling smartphones at the rate of 36 million units per year .
Is that big ?
World No. 4 manufacturer of smartphones , HTC ( who makes mostly Android smartphones but also makes Windows Mobile smartphones ) sells currently at the rate of 18 million per year .
So where HTC once was manufacturing seven out of every 10 Android handsets in the world , today HTC 's share is at best half of all Android phones -- this bodes well for the other big Android manufacturers like Motorola ( NYSE : MOT ) , LG , SonyEricsson , Samsung , etc. HTC is no longer the only game in town .
But yes , what does 100,000 per day mean ?
How does that compare to Apple 's ( Nasdaq : AAPL ) iPhone ?
Yes , the world got quite a shock two weeks ago when NPD reported that Android devices were selling more than iPhones in the USA in Q1 .
So yes , how is Apple doing ?
Well , its latest sales numbers from Q1 had Apple selling iPhones at 8.75 million per quarter which means they sell at the rate of 35 million units per year .
Yes , assuming Apple 's current iPhone sales have not exploded in unit sales ( reasonable assumption as we await the new iPhone model due in June , and something Apple said in court documents about the Gizmodo ' stolen ' iPhone case , Apple actually testified that current iPhone model sales are struggling because customers now await the new model ) , the family of Google Android smartphones has definitely passed iPhone unit sales globally in Q2 .
So how near is Research In Motion ( Nasdaq : RIMM ) , the world 's second - largest smartphone maker ?
It 's getting interesting here -- RIM 's latest quarterly sales were measured at 10.6 million by the analysts ( we await newer numbers from RIM , which reports in a cycle one month off from the normal quarterly calendar cycle ) but yes , RIM 's current sales is at the level of 42 million per year .
Or the daily rate ?
RIM 's daily rate in Q1 was 116,000 smartphones per day .
How close is Android ?
Android reported in Q1 , that it was selling 65,000 handsets per day , or about 24 million per year .
In just one quarter , Android family has grown unit sales 54 % ( compared with RIM , who grew 4 % , or Apple , who grew 1 % , from the previous quarter ) .
This is an amazing growth rate .
It 's very likely that Android smartphones will pass RIM in quarterly sales during Q3 , even if RIM picks up speed and Android slows down considerably .
The difference in growth rates is that immense right now .
Oh , and it 's totally certain : Apple cannot recapture third place from Android during Q3 .
Apple needs to abandon its " one new smartphone model per year " strategy .
Android has already 61 phone models in the market -- out of 21 manufacturers , it means that on average each rival maker offers 3 Android models .
So think :
Just playing the averages , go to an average country , to an average carrier and find that LG offers 3 Android models , Motorola offers 3 Android models , Samsung offers 3 Android models , SonyEricsson offers 3 Android models , ZTE offers 3 Android models -- these are all dumbphone handset manufacturers who produce more dumbphones than Apple 's total sales .
Then , in the best case , that carrier is an authorized iPhone dealer who offers one iPhone model that is less than a year old ( the 3GS ) plus another iPhone ( 3G ) which is almost two years old by now .
And in the worst case , that carrier does not support Apple , but does offer these 15 Android smartphone models , many of which look to the average uninformed customer remarkably similar to an iPhone ( and usually even cost less ) .
Now , each of those global brands with global distributorships , offering phones through far more carriers than Apple , has on average 3 Android models already released ( and more coming ) .
So they can afford to do one " iPhone Clone " with a near - identical form factor , then do another QWERTY smartphone ( the QWERTY keyboards still outsell touchscreens , remember , so this is a huge market that Apple is abandoning to its rivals ) and then do a third , more special phone -- if you 're SonyEricsson , that could be the super cameraphone under the Cybershot brand , or if you 're ZTE , that could be the $ 100 super - cheap smartphone for Africa and India , etc .
Apple does n't have a prayer to catch up -- remember , last quarter , Apple grew 1 % , while Android grew 54 % .
The two platforms are now roughly similar size ( it 's easier for a small player to grow faster than a larger player ; that 's just the math of percentages ) .
So in this quarter , Q2 , Android is running neck - in - neck with Apple and passing it .
By Q3 , Android is challenging RIM and may well pass it , which would make Android the No. 2 best - selling smartphone platform in the world .
What of No. 1 ? In Q1 , Nokia ( NYSE : NOK ) was selling at the rate of 86 million smartphones per year ( more than twice the size of Android today ) .
If measured on a daily sales rate , Nokia sells 236,000 smartphones every day .
Nokia grew 3 % from the previous quarter .
So Nokia is not " threatened " by the Android invasion yet -- not at all .
But even the boys in Espoo take notice when a rival grows more than 50 % in just one quarter .
Android could become an unstoppable force if that continues .
The upside rosy scenario for Android
Let 's assume for the sake of argument that Android maintains its enormous growth rate for several consecutive quarters without slowing down ( an unlikely scenario ; currently , its major handset makers have been doing their ramp - up , so the growth rate in total Android sales is likely to slow down ) .
Note that I am simplifying the pattern , ignoring the Christmas sales peak , but just doing some linear projection .
So let 's see how the numbers stack up , if Android grows every quarter by 54 % .
And let 's assume that Nokia would also manage to continue to grow at its current rate of 3 % per quarter .
If that happened , Android would pass Nokia as early as Q1 of 2011 .
Please note , I am not making that forecast now .
I do n't think it 's plausible for Android to keep growing at such speeds for the next three quarters to come .
But it is so close to RIM already today , that almost certainly before the end of the year , and quite possibly already in Q3 , Android will become the second - best - selling smartphone OS in the world , behind only Symbian , and ahead of RIM and Apple .
And by the end of the year , Symbian will start to feel the heat .
Not from Apple , not from RIM , but yes , from Google Android .
I think a far more reasonable scenario has Android taking a solid second place by end of the year or early next year , and then doing a more gradual race against Symbian and Nokia in the next few years .
The reality bit
Three important caveats to bear in mind .
First , many major dumbphone handset makers who support Android , also support Microsoft 's ( Nasdaq : MSFT ) Windows Mobile ( including its newest incarnation , Windows Phone 7 , due out end of this year ) .
So especially Samsung , SonyEricsson , HTC , and Motorola are certainly going to consider how good the new Phone 7 OS will be , and may well use the Phone 7 platform to release some phones at least to differentiate from the 21 manufacturers who now offer very often " clone - like " copies of each others ' phones on Android .
So there may be some " leakage ' of market share away from Android to Phone 7 toward the end of the year and early in 2011 , when perhaps some makers shift their flagship models to the Microsoft OS .
For this to happen , it is absolutely crucial for Microsoft to deliver a well - debugged , highly competitive OS upgrade on time .
Microsoft 's surprise announcement of its first two Kin phones gives evidence that Microsoft is serious in the smartphone wars .
So do n't count them out .
Secondly , remember Samsung , the biggest of the dumbphone makers who support Android .
Samsung sells 21 % of all phones on the planet , and it sells for example more touchscreen phones than all Apple iPhones .
Samsung supports four smartphone OS platforms ( Symbian , Android , Microsoft , and its own new OS , Bada ) .
Samsung said that for 2010 , they intend to sell 24 million smartphones ; half of those will be on Android , and a third on Bada .
As Bada is Samsung 's own OS , they will no doubt increasingly prefer their own OS , so toward the end of the year , Samsung 's ' mix ' of OS platforms supported may well be tilted so , that in 4Q , over half of all smartphones are Bada and only a third on Android .
So some of the early hot growth in Android smartphone sales we see now in Q1 and Q2 of 2010 , is that heavy push by Samsung to shift to Android , which will then move to Bada toward the end of the year .
That will very likely cause Android sales growth to slow down as Bada ramps up .
Note again that since Samsung 's dumbphone maker rivals LG , SonyEricsson , Motorola and ZTE all support Android , but no others support Bada , there is no danger that if Samsung shifts its balance from Android to Bada , Android sales would stall .
But it does mean Android is having its golden time now , and that will probably change toward the end of the year .
And third , remember that Symbian is more than Nokia .
Symbian is the best - selling phone operating system in Japan , where the world 's most advanced phones are made .
The typical Japanese " featurephone " runs on Symbian , but is not considered a " real " smartphone , because it does not allow end - users to install apps ( the phone OS is closed to the user ) .
Yet this means significant Symbian sales out of Japan , come what may .
And NTT DoCoMo , the biggest operator in Japan , just announced a partnership with half a dozen Japanese mobile industry giants to create an app store , and a smartphone OS evolution path , to Symbian ( and to Linux Mobile , the other major smartphone OS platform used in Japan ) .
So yes , there is the occasional Samsung Symbian phone , and the Japanese contenders , and every so often even a SonyEricsson , etc .
So Symbian is not just Nokia , Symbian 's market share is about 45 % of the new phone sales globally , and the installed base of all smartphones in the world is nearly 60 % Symbian .
Now that Symbian is an open - source foundation , it is also finding new support , even as the OS obviously shows its age in many ways .
And while they are a microscopic player today , Palm ( Nasdaq : PALM ) just got bought out by Hewlett - Packard ( NYSE : HPQ ) the world 's biggest PC maker .
HP is a huge giant corporation -- it 's twice the size of Microsoft or Nokia , and four times as big as Apple or Motorola .
If HP wanted to make a serious effort as a latecomer to smartphones , it could turn Palm around and become a significant player .
Not in a year , but in a few years , it could be rivaling the Apples and RIMs of the world , with their own small OS families .
And then , if HP wanted to really try a major play , they might go open source and try to build a family of manufacturers around Palm 's OS .
I am not suggesting this is happening ; I am just imagining .
Alone , HP can't hope to even match Apple in the next three years -- much less what Apple achieved in the previous 3 years -- so even by the end of 2013 , HP and Palm cannot hold as much as 3 % of the global handset market .
So if HP wanted it as a niche mobile strategy for its own branded PCs in the shfit to the pocket , that is fine .
That would be in line with Apple 's OS / X strategy , building iPads and other Apple exclusive devices on that platform , even as its share of phones is tiny .
But if HP wanted Palm to become a rival to , say , Microsoft ( and Google ) , then it also would need to build partnerships quickly with other handset makers .
Let 's monitor this space ; it could be interesting .
But consider the " armies " involved
What do I think ?
I think the trend for Android is strong .
It can well be holding something like 25 % to 30 % by the end of the year ( Q4 market share ) , and for the full year 2010 , sales will edge past RIM in something like 22 % - 24 % levels of the total new smartphone sales market share .
Nokia will still be the clear leader , but no longer will Nokia be as big as No. 2 and No. 3 combined ( as it still is today ) .
I also want to mention something about the manufacturers supporting Android .
Every major company in mobile seems to be suddenly a smartphone maker .
As I 've written , the competition by giant global brands in smartphones has tripled in three years .
Back in 2006 , before the iPhone , only seven of the Global Fortune 500 largest corporations on the planet were involved in marketing smartphones under their own brands .
Today , that number is 23 and growing .
Also , a few years ago , most dumbphone makers were ambivalent about smartphones -- whether they would remain a niche luxury bracket item , or become a global major market opportunity .
Today , all major dumbphone makers have announced strong commitment to smartphones .
And obviously , the biggest PC makers , software makers , Internet companies , etc. believe in smartphones being relevant to their business future .
Provocative scenario
So , let 's take a quick " provocative " look at the market shares of the Global 10 biggest handset makers , and see how many of them support Android .
I am simplifying , and assuming Samsung will eventually shift from Android to only supporting Bada :
Nokia 35 % - Symbian ( and in future MeeGo )
Samsung 21 % - Bada
LG 9 % - Android
ZTE 5 % - Android
RIM 4 % - Blackberry
SonyEricsson
4 % - Android
Apple 3 % - iPhone OS / X
Motorola 3 % - Android
Sharp 2 % - n/a ( supports Symbian and Windows Mobile and Linux Mobile )
Huawei 2 % - Android
If we assumed all who make smartphones for multiple OSes would only pick their primary one , and if we assumed all dumbphone makers could transfer their existing dumbphone market share to smartphones ( a very unlikely scenario , as seen by the troubles of Motorola and SonyEricsson to achieve this ) then Android - supported major brands of dumbphones would give Android just 23 % out of these companies -- even allowing Samsung to " escape " completely .
So in that hypothetical model , the market shares among the Top 10 in a couple of years would be something like :
Symbian ( Nokia ) 35 %
Android ( LG , ZTE , SonyEricsson , Motorola , Huawei ) 23 %
Bada ( Samsung ) 21 %
Blackberry ( RIM ) 4 %
i Phone OS /X ( Apple ) 3 %
All other smartphone makers , which would include 15 more brands for Android , plus HP / Palm , Microsoft , plus some Japanese , etc. , on Symbian , Linux Mobile , etc. , would share the remaining 14 % .
Note , I do not see this split of market shares as plausible .
In particular , I do not see Bada being able to capture nearly all of Samsung 's current market share .
But consider , just by " market power " of the support of its " committed " partners in Android ( even allowing Samsung to be promiscuous , to be opportunitistic with Android now while it builds the rival Bada platform ) -- the other five major dumbphone makers in the Top 10 of the world who support Android have a dumbphone market share of 23 % .
Compared to RIM at 4 % or Apple at 3 % , I think it 's safe to say that Android will soon be one of the biggest smartphone platforms on the planet , come what may .
And by the end of this year , they are likely the second largest behind only Symbian .
So yes , the announcement of 100,000 Android handset sales per day is a very important milestone for Google 's smartphone platform .
More from The Bright Side of News *
THERE comes a moment in many debt crises when events spiral out of control .
As panic sets in , bond yields lurch sickeningly upwards and fear spreads to shares and currencies .
In September 2008 the failure of once - stellar Lehman Brothers almost brought down the world 's banking system .
A decade earlier , Russia 's chaotic default on its sovereign debt rocked the credit markets , felling Long Term Capital Management , a hugely profitable American hedge fund .
When the unthinkable suddenly becomes the inevitable , without pausing in the realm of the improbable , then you have contagion .
The Greek crisis — or more properly Europe 's sovereign - debt crisis — looks dangerously close to that ( see article ) .
Even as negotiators from the European Union and the IMF are haggling with the Greek government over an ever - growing bail - out package , the yield on Greek debt has ballooned : two - year bonds soared towards 20 % this week .
Portugal 's borrowing costs jumped .
Spain 's debt was downgraded , along with Portugal 's and Greece 's , and Italy came worryingly close to a failed debt auction .
European stockmarkets have slumped and the euro itself fell to its lowest level in a year against the dollar .
The road into Hades …
It will strike some as mystifying that a small , peripheral economy should suddenly threaten the world 's biggest economic area .
Yet , though it is only 2.6 % of euro - zone GDP , Greece sounds three warnings that reach far beyond its borders .
The first is economic .
Greece has become a symbol of government indebtedness .
This crisis began last October when its new government admitted that its predecessor had falsified the national accounts .
It is labouring under a budget deficit of 13.6 % and a stock of debt equal to 115 % of GDP .
It can not grow out of trouble because of fiscal retrenchment and its lack of export prowess .
It can not devalue , because it is in the euro zone .
And yet its people seem unwilling to endure the cuts in wages and services needed to make the economy competitive .
In short , Greece looks bust .
Few , if any , European countries suffer from all of Greece 's ills , but many scare investors .
Portugal has a high budget deficit and is chronically uncompetitive .
Spain has a low stock of debt , but it seems unable to restructure its economy .
So too Italy , which is heavily indebted to boot .
Non-euro - zone Britain has let its currency fall , but its budget deficit is unnerving .
The second lesson is political .
Two weeks ago , having concluded that an eventual Greek restructuring was all but inevitable , we said Europe 's leaders had “ three years to save the euro ” .
We presumed that they would quickly get a proposed € 45 billion ( $ 60 billion ) deal to stave off an imminent and chaotic Greek default , buying time for an orderly rescheduling and for the other weak economies to begin overdue structural reforms .
We overestimated their common sense .
The chief culprit is Germany .
All along , it has tried to have it every way — to back Greece , but to punish it for its mistakes ; to support the Greek economy , but not to spend any money doing so ; to treat this as just a Greek problem , when German banks and German citizens , who lend to Greece , stand to lose money too .
German voters do not favour aiding Greece .
But rather than explain to them why it is in Germany 's interest , the chancellor , Angela Merkel , has run scared of upsetting them before a big regional election on May 9th .
Playing for time has backfired .
Now the mooted rescue plan has climbed above € 100 billion because no private money is available .
The longer euro - zone governments dither , the more lenders doubt whether their promises to save Greece are worth anything .
Each time politicians blame “ speculators ” ( see article ) , investors wonder if they understand how bad things are ( or indeed that investors have a choice ) .
Euro - zone leaders initially refused to seek IMF help because it would be humiliating .
Their ineptitude has done far more than their eventual decision to call in the IMF to damage the euro .
This political and economic failure leads to the third Greek warning : that contagion can spread through a large number of routes .
A run on Greek banks is possible .
So is a “ sudden stop ” of capital to other weaker euro - zone countries .
Firms and banks in Spain and Portugal could find themselves shut out of global capital markets , as investors ' jitters spread from sovereign debt .
Europe 's inter - bank market could seize up , unsure which banks would be hit by sovereign defaults .
Even Britain could suffer , especially if the May 6th election is indecisive .
What then is to be done ?
The mounting crisis — and the fact that Greece will almost certainly not pay everybody back on time — will renew some calls to abandon it .
That would spell chaos for Greece , European banks and other European countries : the effect would indeed be Lehman - like .
Hence the necessity , even at this stage , of a show of financial force , linked to the construction of a stronger firewall between Greece and Europe 's other shaky countries .
The priority for European policymakers is to do the same as governments eventually did with the banks : to get ahead of the crisis and to convince investors that they will spend whatever is necessary .
… and the expensive way back
The economics starts with the politics .
Europe will not stem this crisis unless its decision - making apparatus is overhauled and Germany radically changes its tune .
Mrs Merkel needs to go on German television and explain to her people what is at stake — laying out how much Germany has gained from the euro and what it has to lose from a cascade of chaotic sovereign defaults .
Germans need to understand the risks to their banking system and their prosperity .
They need to understand that stemming Greece 's debt crisis is less an act of charity than of self - interest .
However unfair it seems — and the frugal Germans are as furious about the profligate Greeks as the rest of the world was about bankers — a bail - out is justifiable on the same logic : doing nothing would cost them even more .
The resolve cannot stop at Germany 's borders .
Financial markets have no idea who is in charge .
Europe 's Byzantine decision - making structure does not help but Germany needs to ensure that decisions are reached fast , that Europe speaks with one voice — and that co-ordination with the IMF is smooth .
As a way to convince financial markets that the political weather has changed , the euro zone should set up a single crisis - management committee , with the power to take decisions .
Political resolve wo n't work unless the underlying economics make sense .
The first test of this is the Greek package .
In return for fiscal and structural adjustments that give the economy a hope of stabilising its debts , this must provide enough money to prevent a forced default .
Up to € 150 billion may be needed over the next three years — better to err by offering too much .
But the firebreak between Greece and the other embattled sovereigns of the euro zone is even more important .
In economic terms , that should not be too hard to justify .
Despite their problems , no country other than Greece is manifestly bust .
Portugal is in the greatest danger , but it has a better history of fiscal adjustment which , under plausible assumptions , could allow its debt to stabilise at a manageable level .
Spain and Italy could be made insolvent by a long period of high interest rates .
But none has the near - inevitability of Greece .
Europe 's policymakers must make those distinctions clearer .
The vulnerable economies must step up the reforms they need to rein in deficits and boost growth .
Portugal , especially , needs action .
The European Central Bank should demonstrate that it has the tools to maintain liquidity even if there is panic .
Euro - zone governments should pre-emptively create inter-governmental liquidity lines .
Thanks to extraordinary incompetence , Europe 's leaders have almost ensured that the Greek rescue failed before it began .
They are paying for that today .
Jennifer Aniston Nude in a Blanket : Lolavie Perfume Ad ( PHOTOS )
is launching a new perfume and the clever ad campaign shows her wearing only a loosely wrapped blanket as she sits on a rocky shoal at sunset .
The shoot took place in Caba San Lucas , Mexico .
The fragrance is Lolavie and the actress describes it as a natural " nonperfume perfume " .
She wants people to say , " What is that ?
You smell great ! "
It combines a collection of ' sexy and clean ' floral notes that took eighteen months to develop .
David Lipman helped brand the new product .
He said , " We hope that if people like the purity and the naturalness of who she is , they will want to experience this product with her . "

Sir David Attenborough , Jonathon Porritt , Jeremy Irons and other " doomsters " are talking " dangerous nonsense " about the threat of overpopulation , according to the environmental writer Fred Pearce .
Speaking at the Hay festival , Pearce said that the global population " timebomb " was being defused by some of the world 's poorest women , thanks to the impact of feminism in Muslim , Christian , secular , developed and developing countries across the world .
Irons , the actor who recently told the Sunday Times " there are just too many of us " , and other environmentalists such as Attenborough and Porritt , who are patrons of the Optimum Population Trust , are modern - day Malthusians , according to Pearce , who fail to see that overconsumption , not overpopulation , is what really imperils the planet .
" I believe they are talking dangerous nonsense .
The population timebomb is being defused , fast , " Pearce told the festival .
The United Nations has predicted the world 's population could rise from 6.8bn to 9.2bn in 2050 , but , according to Pearce , it will only rise by up to 2bn and will then start to fall .
Half the world now has fertility rates below the replacement rate of 2.3 children .
Women in Iran were giving birth to eight children in the 1980s , but now give birth to less than two .
In Bangladesh , where many mothers are poor and badly educated , women have an average of just three children .
Birth rates have fallen to 2.8 in India and two in Brazil , despite the influence of Catholicism .
In China , " the one - child policy is brutal and repressive but it may not be making much difference anymore " , said Pearce , citing similarly low birth rates in Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore , where the government has been paying couples to have children for two decades .
Only in poverty - stricken parts of Africa , highly patriarchal societies such as Yemen and among " traumatised " people such as the Palestinians and Orthodox Jews in Israel , are birth rates soaring .
Pearce said he had not set out to write " a feminist tract " when researching his book , Peoplequake : Mass Migration , Ageing Nations and the Coming Population Crash , but discovered in all these societies the key factor was women being able to take decisions for themselves .
Given this power , if child mortality rates were such that they no longer needed five or six children for two or three to survive , women were choosing to have fewer children and " get on with their lives " .
With the time lag between fertility rates and population , Pearce said the population could still rise by 2bn but would then fall back as a smaller future generation of mothers created a " feedback loop " of smaller populations .
While this was " a good news story " , Pearce warned that the environmental threat to the world was not over .
" We have n't begun to defuse the consumption boom , " he said , arguing that environmentalists should focus not on restricting population growth in the developing world but on curing the developed world of its addiction to consumption .
The richest 500 million people ( 7 % of the world 's population ) are responsible for 50 % of CO2 emissions , while the poorest 3.5 bn people ( 50 % of the population ) are responsible for just 7 % of emissions .
One American 's emissions are equivalent to those of 250 Ethiopians .
Women having the right to decide how many children they bear may be the key to stabilising the world 's population , but Pearce said that in societies where the feminist revolution was incomplete and mothers were still expected to perform the lion 's share of child - rearing duties , many women were rebelling against childbirth .
This trend was particularly strong in southern Europe .
If Italy continues with its current birth rate , its population will fall by 86 % by the end of this century .
Mass migration and an ageing population would be challenges for the future , but Pearce speculated that an older population could be " wiser and greener " , living life at a slower pace with less desire for high - speed consumption .
He predicted that by the end of his lifetime , people would be more worried by a population crash than a population explosion .
A group of 10 Navy reserve officers who served as patrol boat commanders sent a harsh letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday in which they urge the establishment of an independent inquiry commission into the flotilla raid events .
International Inquiry ?
Netanyahu rejects
Ban 's call for int'l probe of flotilla raid Roni Sofer PM tells Likud ministers he did not accept UN chief 's proposal to set up commission of inquiry headed by former New Zealand prime minister and comprised of Israeli , American and Turkish reps .
' I am looking into other possibilities , ' Netanyahu says Netanyahu rejects Ban 's call for int'l probe of flotilla raid
" We believe the operation ended in a military and political disaster , " the letter noted .
The officers said they disagreed with claims of an intelligence or a PR failure as they believe the whole operation was doomed from the beginning .
" Most of all , we protest the fact that the responsibility for the disaster was immediately placed on the sail 's organizers , " the letter noted , suggesting that the commanding ranks and decision makers were the ones primarily responsible for the debacle .
" We regard this as contempt for professionalism , battle morals and human life . "
The officers demanded the establishment of an independent inquiry commission which would hold a thorough examination of the raid .
" We believe this is the best way to restore trust in the Navy command and decision makers , " the letter stated .
The officers were bewildered at the level of risk the Navy fighters were put under .
" We were dumbfounded at the dismal outcome of civilians ' deaths and injuries .
There is no shred of doubt in our minds that had a less trained and disciplined force been sent , the number of casualties would have been much greater , and therefore wish to express our appreciation of the combat forces .
" Nevertheless , we feel serious tactical mistakes in judgment and the use of force were made , primarily the inability to aptly characterize the mission while bearing in mind a civil vessel was being targeted . "
The officers stated that based on their experience as vessel commanders other ways could have been employed to stop the flotilla .
" The MO which was exercised included a high level of friction which we feel was unnecessary , regardless of the type of resistance discovered upon the raid . "
' Not endorsing disobedience '
One of the officers , Major Nir Barak told Ynet , " We have a lot of experience in this field .
The letter was thought up out of a feelings of discomfort , mainly at the subsequent events and the defense minister and Navy command 's failure to take responsibility .
" We believe mistakes were made by the security establishment 's higher echelons which need to be addressed .
We are not endorsing disobedience or draft - dodging but think one can show support for the forces and demand an examination at the same time . "
Major Barak stressed that the criticism is not directed at the soldiers but at the higher echelons which initiated and led the operation .
" We think that the Navy command could have better prepared itself for this operation .
The event was a military failure and there are questions which need to be answered . "

In my earlier posts about the killings aboard the Mavi Marmara , I used terms like “ kill shot ” and “ execution - style ” to describe these events .
I based my judgment on the narratives told by eyewitnesses and the Turkish autopsy reports .
Some readers were taken aback and accused me of overstatement , exaggeration and worse .
But this video vividly confirms my strong suspicions .
It shows IDF commandos executing a passenger on the Mavi Marmara with one and possibly two point blank shots from above into the victim who lies on the boat deck .
In truth , one cannot distinguish the face of the victim since it is blocked by a boat railing .
But from the muzzle flashes and weapon recoils and the downward direction in which the shooter looks at his victim , it is clear this is an execution just as I described earlier .
The video caption claims this is the murder of 19 year - old Turkish - American high school student Furkan Dogan .
While it is possible there is earlier footage not shown in this video that displayed the victim ’s face and enabled one to identify him , I wo n’t vouch for Dogan as being the specific victim .
But what is incontrovertible is that this is A Mavi Marmara passenger being murdered .
This changes everything .
Here for the first time is evidence that the IDF was not just engaged in a defensive operation , but that it had determined to murder passengers .
Gone are the hasbara rationales which defended Israel and blamed the victims for their own deaths .
I am ashamed of Israel .
I am ashamed of my president ’s response to Israel .
We must get all those governments like our own who were trying to finesse this crisis , trying to put the genie back in the bottle , to stop and take stock .
Sending fixers like Dan Shapiro to Israel to hondle about the the least damaging way to repair this mess simply wo n’t work .
Shapiro is trying to figure out Israel can give up the least and gain the most .
He and his boss , the president , want to figure out how Israel can ease the humanitarian crisis with a nip and a tuck–allow in more foods for example –while getting the UN to dismiss its international investigation .
The Telegraph published a similar report claiming the new Tory - led government had a deal with Israel on similar terms .
The report missed a few things though .
Nowhere did it say what Turkey thought about any of this .
And that country , after all , is the injured party since 9 ( more likely 15 ) of its citizens were murdered by the IDF .
Do the U.S. , Britain and Israel think they can work their way out of this mess without Turkey ’s acquiescence ?
Does Israel truly believe that its sham proposals for a two part domestic investigation will pass muster ?
It proposes a military panel under the leadership of an ex-general who will examine the failure without placing blame on any specific individuals .
Then Netanyahu proposes a panel composed of Israeli judges to be joined by up to two foreign “ observers . ”
This commission will not be permitted to question the actual commando killers .
Which in effect renders the proceedings toothless before they even begin .
If I were Prime Minister Erdogan I ’d do pretty much what he ’s done so far .
Put out my demands for a deal and then let everyone else scheme and manipulate in order to avoid my terms .
Once they ’ve exhausted themselves and come up empty , perhaps they ’ll realize there is only one way to resolve the matter .
Israel must apologize , pay reparations to victim ’s families and all the passengers , and end the siege .
There is a simmering rage within Turkey about the way its citizens were brutalized .
A Turkish - American journalist told me a poll said 60 % believe their government has not done enough to express its outrage .
So Israelis may express their shock at Erdogan ’s obstreperousness .
But they should know that behind Erdogan are 80 million very angry Turks .
Is Israel prepared to face them down ?
And I do n’t mean this only in a diplomatic sense .
I mean this in a very real , tangible sense .
Until now ,
Turks cared little for Palestine in the way that more devout Muslim nations do .
Their form of Islam is fairly tolerant and laid back .
That ’s why they could forge an alliance with Israel for so many years .
But now I can imagine Turkish shahids waging jihad on Israel .
This would be an unprecedented development both for Israel and Turkey .
Today , Barack Obama showed that he ’s still spinning his wheels .
He had Fatah ’s rump West Bank president , Mahmoud Abbas to the White House for a photo - op and offered $ 400 million for Gaza .
He offered this money to a man who has absolutely no sway in Gaza .
A man who hates the government that rules Gaza and who is hated in return .
Hell , Obama hates Hamas too .
So what kind of charade were the two of them playing earlier today ?
How will this money ever get to its destination if no one will talk to the only party who can spend it ?
It borders on sheer idiocy .
And I say this knowing that Obama is neither an idiot not badly - intentioned .
All one can say about the president ’s policy is that with George Bush you knew you were getting someone who did n’t give a whit for the Palestinians and who would n’t lift a finger for them .
With Obama , you get the illusion of a leader who cares , but who does n’t .
Or at least does n’t care enough to do anything substantive .
There are times when ineffectual leaders with good intentions can do even more damage than those like Bush who never had any good intentions to begin with .
The question is how long will Obama continue this masquerade .
How long before he faces the music and comes to the realization there is only one way to do the right thing .
The longer he delays the more chance there is for a deterioration in the status quo .
And I ’m not talking about incremental deterioration .
I ’m talking about catastrophic deterioration , about a situation in which Israel attacks its neighbors or is attacked in return .
Is Israel prepared for the next Gaza flotilla to be escorted by Turkish warships to its destination ?
Is it prepared for Turkey not just as an enemy but possibly a military enemy as well ?
Today , brings distressing news of a Rasmussen survey finding that 49 % of Americans blame the victims for their death on the Mavi Marmara .
But when I read such a poll I always examine the questions , since subtleties of wording can lead to tipping the respondents in a certain direction .
Indeed , the question asked in this poll which brought that result betrayed a “ tell ” as they say in poker :
Who is primarily to blame for the deadly outcome of the raid on the aid - carrying ships – Israel or the pro-Palestinian activists on the ships ?
While I agree that in actuality those on the ship were “ pro-Palestinian activists , ” this wording helped lead to an unreliable poll result .
Those three words , when suggested to the average American conjure up an unflattering image just as the phrase “ pro-Israeli activist ” would in a similar context ( though the revulsion would be less pronounced ) .
It would ’ve been much better had the pollsters come up with a less leading , less judgmental , less emotional phrase to describe those on the Mavi Marmara .
Why not just “ passengers ? ”
Or “ humanitarians ” or “ peace activists ? ”
Or “ anti- blockade activists ? ”
While I dispute the wording of the question , there is no doubt that Americans have bought the hasbara campaign about this tragedy .
They do not know what really happened .
That ’s why it ’s important that video like this be seen as widely as possible .
For a time , hasbara may prevail .
But in the longer term the real facts and enormity of this tragedy will sink in .
In the interests of such education , I ’m planning a conference here in Seattle at St. Mark ’s Cathedral on Friday , June 25th on the Gaza crisis .
Evergreen College Prof. Steve Niva will speak about the failure of U.S. policy in this crisis .
I will speak about the current political currents inside Israel and the assault on democracy and human rights that has accompanied external attacks like the one on the Gaza flotilla .
Dave Schermerhorn will speak about his experience as a Mavi Marmara survivor .
We will also present a Palestinian speaker who will address the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza .
So far , the conference is co-sponsored by SABEEL of the Puget Sound and the Mideast Focus Ministry .
New co-sponsors will be added including Jewish and Muslim organizations .
In order to bring one speaker to Seattle , we need to raise funds for her airfare and accommodations .

Your donation will defray these costs .
Anything exceeding them will go to Gaza humanitarian relief .

Baume : ' It 's not a decision that 's taken very often ' Senior civil servants were so concerned at Labour ministers ' spending decisions they asked for written orders to show who was responsible , says their union .
Union chief Jonathan Baume told the BBC asking for " letters of direction " was regarded as a " nuclear option " .
He said " a small number " were requested in 2010 , in Labour 's last months and showed " some unhappiness " at decisions .
Ex-ministers have previously dismissed claims of excessive spending as " spin " by the coalition government .
The Conservative - Lib Dem government has ordered a review of all spending commitments and pilot projects signed off by Labour ministers since the start of the year .
' Against advice '
On Monday , Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws told BBC Two 's Newsnight : " I think we 're very concerned indeed that over the last few months of this government there were a lot of spending commitments that were made and some of those may not represent good value for money . "
He said that in some cases the decisions " were made against accounting officer advice " .
The fact that these letters of direction were being issued ... does indicate that there was some unhappiness about spending decisions being taken
Jonathan Baume
FDA Mr Baume , general secretary of the First Division Association which represents senior civil servants , told BBC Radio 5 Live 's chief political correspondent John Pienaar : " When a permanent secretary asks for their letter of direction from a minister , it is because they feel that a serious decision is being taken , which they feel is not right .
" It 's not a decision that is taken very often to ask for such a letter of direction , which is why it is regarded something of a nuclear option .
" So when it happens it tends to be a big spending decision , where the civil service believes this is not the right thing to do . "
The instructions - formally titled " letters of direction " - have been sent to the Treasury , and will be sent on to the cross-party Commons public accounts committee , which evaluates public spending for propriety and value for money .
Audit trail Mr Baume said the letters meant there was an " audit trail " so the permanent secretaries - who are ultimately responsible for spending decisions - can explain why they were taken .
He said he did not know which departments had asked for the letters but they would become public in due course .
" The fact that these letters of direction were being issued - a small number , as David Laws said , but nonetheless the fact that a number appear to have been issued during 2010 does indicate that there was some unhappiness about spending decisions being taken . "
The Conservatives and Liberals are playing the oldest trick in the book .
What do you do when you are a new government ?
You blame your predecessors .
It is straight out of Yes Minister
Alistair Darling
Former chancellor
He said the letters might be on detailed issues on only affect a particular locality but added : " The fact that a permanent secretary feels the need to ask for a letter of direction - in other words an instruction from a minister to authorise spending , indicates that there has been a serious disagreement about that particular decision . "
On 8 April a list of 15 letters of direction issued in the previous five years was published by then Treasury Minister Lord Myners .
It gave details of two issued in 2010 , one relating to a shake - up of local authorities in Devon , Norfolk and Suffolk ordered by John Denham , and the other to Jack Straw 's decision to provide compensation to people diagnosed with pleural plaques following exposure to asbestos .
But the Department for Business confirmed that a letter of direction was issued by one of its ministers in the first three months of this year related to Blackpool leisure assets .
A £ 38.9 m scheme was announced by former business minister Rosie Winterton in March to refurbish and redevelop Blackpool Tower and its Winter Gardens conference centre .
Prime Minister David Cameron has said his ministers have found examples of " crazy " spending , including paying out bonuses to three - quarters of all senior civil servants .
In response , former Chancellor Alistair Darling accused the new coalition government of " playing the oldest trick on the book " by blaming its predecessor for the state of the economy .
" What do you do when you are a new government ?
You blame your predecessors .
It is straight out of Yes Minister , " he said on Monday .
On Monday , it emerged that Liam Byrne , Mr Laws ' predecessor , had left him a one - sentence letter , saying : " I 'm afraid to tell you there 's no money left . "
Mr Byrne later told the BBC that this " a phrase that chief secretaries have to get used to using " .

A FULL thickness artificial skin which should dramatically reduce the pain and scarring associated with skin grafts is being developed by Sydney researchers .
Burns experts from the University of Sydney and Concord Hospital have started animal trials of a living skin that is grown outside the body and is completely functional when grafted on to the body .
Unlike traditional skin grafts , which involve only the thin outer layer of the skin known as the epidermis , the new skin will be able to replace the crucial second layer of skin called the dermis .
This layer is responsible for functions such as temperature control , perspiration , toughness and elasticity , and when it is missing , the body reacts by producing large swathes of scarring underneath the skin graft .
" It takes the body weeks to grow into a skin graft and in that time a lot of excess elastic fibres and collagen will be produced that will then turn into a scar , " said the skin co-creator Peter Maitz , chairman for burn , injury and reconstructive surgery at the University of Sydney .
" This is a huge problem , particularly around the face , hands or genital area , " he said .
" The scar contracts and it can get so tight that patients lose the movement of their mouth and can't talk , or they can't bend their fingers " .
The actress Marlee Matlin shimmied her way onto “ Dancing With the Stars ” two years ago , memorably using sign language to tell viewers to “ read my hips . ”
But when Ms. Matlin , who is deaf , went to ABC.com to watch a replay of the show , she was impeded because the network ’s videos were missing captions .
Closed - captioning is mandatory on television , but not for TV programs on the Internet .
And that has turned Web sites like ABC.com into battlegrounds for advocates like Ms. Matlin , who have spoken up on the lack of captions on sites like CNN.com and services like Netflix .
Media companies say they are working hard to make online video more accessible .
YouTube , the world ’s biggest video
Web site by far , now supplies mostly accurate captions using voice - recognition software .
ESPN is offering captions for its live streams of World Cup matches .
And ABC now applies the TV captions for “ Dancing With the Stars ” to ABC.com .
But big gaps remain much to the dismay of deaf Web users .
Television episodes on CBS.com , news videos on CNN.com and entertainment clips on MSN.com all lack captions , to name a few .
I can probably spend an entire day at Tartine .
I ’ll start the day with a cup of coffee , a croissant , and the morning paper .
Then I ’ll power up my macbook and do a little work , granted I do n’t get too distracted by the Mission hipsters passing by .
For lunch , I ’ll have some pressed prosciutto and provolone , a side of greens and a bottle of sparkling water .
Then I ’ll dive into Tatiana de Rosnay , indulge in another cup of coffee , and satisfy my sweet tooth ( once again ) with Tartine ’s brioche bread pudding .
But , seriously , I really could n’t spend an entire day at Tartine .
The angry mob waiting for a table would constantly stare at me and my plate , waiting for me to pick up my crumbs , get up and leave .
A list of things I love about the city will not be complete without the bakery on the corner of 18th and Guerrero .
Back in December , I featured Tartine ’s brioche bread pudding in my list of my 12 favorite round sweet treats in the city .
This could very well be the best I ’ve ever had .
I love its milky moistness .
Its rich custard and light caramel flavors .
In hindsight , I could have populated that list solely with just Tartine treats : morning buns , frangipane croissants and eclairs to name a few .
As part of the festivities leading to Jun-Blog ’s first year , I made Tartine ’s brioche bread pudding , thanks to Pastry Chefs Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson and their wonderful Tartine cookbook .
And many thanks to Alexandra ’s Kitchen for documenting her experiences making the pudding on her gorgeous blog .
Her notes about the Tartine recipe proved invaluable .
“ I was shocked by how much more custard there was in my pan than bread , but I trusted the recipe and went with it .
That is the key !
The bread soaks up all the custard .
The key to producing a moist bread pudding is to not crowd the pan with bread . ”
– Alexandra ’s Kitchen
I , too , was shocked .
I had 6 slices of brioche bread in a baking pan and a huge bowl of custard .
How could I possibly fit this much custard in that tiny pan .
But as soon as I poured the custard in the pan and the bread eagerly soaked the milky - eggy mixture , I soon felt more confident that I was doing the right thing .
Sticking to the bread - to - custard ratio definitely gave a satisfyingly moist bread pudding .
Also , the cookbook makes a clear point to never crowd the bread slices in the pan .
When a bread pudding is dry , crowding is usually the cause .
The recipe suggests using a 9 ×5 - inch glass loaf pan .
But I , like Alexandra ’s Kitchen , used an 8×8 glass baking pan that worked perfectly fine .
I did not make my own brioche , which may end up as a future post after I muster enough courage to make it , and instead used loaves of brioche purchased from Whole Foods .
The cookbook notes that the recipe works equally well with croissants , chocolate - filled croissants , challah or panettone .
The cookbook did not mention any fruit being baked with the bread pudding but one thing I love about Tartine ’s is the delicious seasonal fruit they top it with , like apples , pears , peaches , and berries .
Again , thanks to Alexandra ’s Kitchen , I confirmed that Tartine indeed bakes the bread pudding without any fruit but instead warms seasonal fruits in a caramel sauce and uses it as a topping .
“ Moreover , when the busy bees in the bakery remove the pans of bread pudding from the oven , they poke holes in it to let steam out and to create space , and then they pour the warm fruit in caramel sauce over top .
Brilliant ! ” – Alexandra ’s Kitchen
Of course , I got too excited after I saw my own bread pudding fresh out of the oven that I forgot about the “ poking ” step .
I ended up simply pouring the warm fruit - caramel mixture on top of the bread pudding , which turned out to be fantastic .
Brioche Bread Pudding Recipe
Recipe by Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson from Tartine , makes 6 to 8 servings
6 brioche slices , cut 1 - inch thick
8 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
4 cups whole milk
1 -1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp salt
For the Caramel Sauce , makes 1 - 1/2 cups
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 of one vanilla bean
1 - 1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 tsp salt
2 Tbsp light corn syrup
3/4 tsp lemon juice
4 Tbsp unsalted butter
Making the Brioche Bread Pudding
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees .
Butter a 9×5 - inch glass loaf pan [ or an 8×8 - inch glass baking pan , which worked perfectly fine ] .
Arrange the brioche slices on a baking sheet .
Place in the oven until lightly toasted .
Remove from the oven and set aside to cool .
Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until blended .
Add the sugar and whisk until smooth .
Add the milk , vanilla and salt and whisk until completely blended .
Pour the custard through a fine - mesh sieve .
Place the toasted bread slices in the prepared loaf pan , cutting the slices to fit as needed .
Pour the custard evenly over the bread , filling the dish to the top .
You may not be able to add all of the custard at this point .
Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes , so that the bread can absorb the custard .
Just before baking , top off the dish with more of [ leftover ] custard if the previous addition has been completely absorbed .
Cover the dish with aluminum foil , place in the oven , and bake the pudding for about 1 hour .
To test for doneness , uncover the dish , slip a knife into the center , and push the bread aside .
If the custard is still very liquid , re-cover the dish and return the pudding to the oven for another 10 minutes .
If only a little liquid remains , the pudding is ready to come out of the oven .
The custard will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven and it will set up as it cools .
Let the pudding cool for about 10 minutes before serving .
You can serve the bread pudding by slicing it and removing each slice with an offset spatula , or by scooping it out with a serving spoon .
As I have mentioned above , the bread pudding can be served topped with seasonal fruits in delicious caramel sauce .
While the bread pudding is cooling , peel and slice a couple of peaches .
In a medium pan , warm the peaches together with some blueberries and raspberries or other fruits in season in Tartine ’s caramel sauce ( recipe below ) .
Top the bread pudding with the warm fruit - caramel mixture before serving .
If you have leftover bread pudding , the cookbook suggests chilling it , slicing it , and frying it as you would French toast .
Making the Caramel Sauce
Pour the cream into a small , heavy saucepan .
Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and use the tip of a sharp knife to scrape the seeds from the pod halves into the cream .
Place over medium - high heat and bring to just under a boil , stirring occasionally .
Reduce the heat to low to keep the cream warm .
In a medium , heavy saucepan , combine the sugar , water , salt and corn syrup .
Use a good - sized pan because the caramel will boil vigorously and the volume will increase dramatically as soon as the hot cream is added .
Bring to a boil over medium heat , stirring to dissolve the sugar .
Then let the mixture boil , without stirring , until the mixture is amber colored .
Watch the sugar mixture carefully as it cooks to avoid burning the sugar .
From the time the mixture started to boil , it took over 15 minutes to reach an amber color .
Remove from the heat .
The mixture will continue to cook off the heat and become darker , so make sure to have the cream close by .
Carefully and slowly add the cream to the sugar syrup .
The mixture will boil vigorously at first .
Let the mixture simmer down , and then whisk until smooth .
Add the lemon juice and let it cool for about 10 minutes .
Cut the butter into 1 - inch chunks and add them to the caramel one at a time , whisking constantly after each addition .
Then whisk the caramel periodically as it continues to cool .
Pour the caramel sauce in an airtight container such as a glass jar and store in the refrigerator .
This will keep for up to a month .
Organisers of eight - ship fleet predict standoff as they attempt to cross into 20 - mile exclusion zone off coast
The Israeli navy was today preparing to confront a flotilla of eight ships carrying hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists and 10,000 tons of aid which is attempting to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip .
The flotilla is expected to head towards the Gaza coastline tomorrow .
The Israeli military has declared its intention to block the flotilla 's progress as soon as it attempts to cross from international waters into the 20 - mile exclusion zone Israel maintains off Gaza 's coast .
The military declined to confirm a report in the Israeli daily Ma'ariv detailing a five - point plan for the confrontation , including warnings , takeover by force , and the detention and deportation of the activists on board .
A temporary detention centre has been established in the Israeli port of Ashdod , 23 miles north of Gaza City , where officials will reportedly offer activists the choice between immediate deportation to their country of origin or being bussed to jails across the country while a legal process to expel them takes its course .
Greta Berlin of the Free Gaza Movement , one of the organisations behind the flotilla , indicated today that most of those on board would refuse to comply with the Israeli authorities .
She said : " We are committed to getting into Gaza .
We expect a standoff at sea . "
The activists were braced for a violent confrontation , said Berlin , pointing to a previous incident in December 2008 when a similar attempt to reach Gaza by sea ended in the activists ' boat being rammed by the Israeli navy .
She claimed the navy was attempting to stop the eight boats converging into a flotilla by threatening to attack one of their number , a Turkish passenger ship carrying around 650 people .
" They 're going to try to pick us off one by one , " she said .
Israel had jammed satellite phones and radars on board the ships , she claimed .
However , an Israeli military spokesman said there had been no contact between the navy and the activists .
" We 're waiting to see what happens – it depends on how things proceed , " he said .
The Ma'ariv report said the military feared that there could be " terror activists " , explosives and weapons on board the ships .
Berlin denied this , saying every item on board each ship had been inspected by port authorities and manifests issued .
" Yet the Israelis are coming towards us armed to the teeth . "
As well as the prospect of a physical confrontation , a propaganda war between Israel and the activists was well under way today .
Avigdor Lieberman , Israel 's foreign minister , said the flotilla was " an attempt at violent propaganda against Israel , and Israel will not allow a violation of its sovereignty at sea , in the air , or on land . "
He added : " There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza , and despite the Hamas leadership 's war crimes and rocket fire , Israel is conducting itself in the most humanitarian manner , and is allowing the entrance of thousands of tons of food and equipment into Gaza . "
However , the UN and other aid organisations have repeatedly pointed to the devastating impact of the acute shortage of construction materials to rebuild homes and infrastructure following the 2008 - 9 war , as well as restrictions on foods , medical equipment and school supplies allowed into Gaza .
GRAND RAPIDS —
As one group of volunteers poured the cement bases for a pergola , another shoveled soil into wooden beds .
A child sprayed water from a hose at raspberry bushes .
Others spread mulch from a wheelbarrow with a “ Who ’s your farmer ? ” sticker on one side and a “ good things grow locally ” label on the other .
“ Want to help out , buddy ? ” a woman asked a child as she erected a trellis .
“ We need about four more ( branches ) of that size . ”
Welcome to the Fourth Street Garden Oasis , one of several gardens sprouting in Grand Rapids as part of a growing urban farming trend sweeping the nation .
In the process , it is confronting municipalities with zoning dilemmas and harboring the prospect of grassroots economic renewal .
In some cases — as in Detroit , where the CEO of a financial services firm aspires to create the world 's largest urban farm — a vision of fresh local food dovetails with job creation and profit .
At the Fourth Street garden , initiated by parents of children who attend the nearby Grand Rapids Child Discovery Center , the work is decidedly anti-capitalist .
“ It ’s a communal garden , ” said Chrysta Coronado , who is working at the garden west of Stocking Avenue NW .
“ This food does n’t belong to any one person .
This food is all of ours . ”
It ’s also about creating an oasis in what some claim has become an urban food desert .
“ It ’s not just about growing carrots .
It ’s about doing it together , ” Coronado said .
“ It ’s about bringing power back to ourselves and doing it in a way that ’s more just . ”
The sentiment is similar at The Barefoot Victory , where everyone is invited to help turn a vacant lot at 1350 Wealthy St. SE into a kind of old - school social network centered on growing and eating fresh local food .
And in the parking lot at Fuller Avenue Christian Reformed Church , 1239 Fuller Ave. SE , a new nonprofit venture called Green Sprawl Neighborhood Farms Inc. has planted tomatoes , peppers , radishes , turnips , peas and greens in seven 4 - foot by 24 - foot raised beds and several bucket containers .
The plan is to sell the harvest and use proceeds to fund gardens in other neighborhoods .
Ultimately , Green Sprawl aspires to equip urban residents with know - how to grow nutritious local food .
“ Our mission is to teach people these gardening methods and hope that they will do the same at their own house , ” said Paige Waldron , 23 , a Calvin College alum who started Green Sprawl with her husband , Ben .
“ In this particular neighborhood , there ’s no grocery store nearby and , since it ’s a lower income area , not everyone has cars . ”
An innovative market force
Urban gardens are symptoms of a broader local food movement that is developing into an innovative market force , may have the capacity to feed many people and be a salve for the local economy , according to one advocate who makes his living in the field .
" We ought to ask that question and pursue it and test it before we write it off , " said Tom Cary , treasurer of the Greater Grand Rapids Food Systems Council .
Cary , who helps run a subscription - based community supported agriculture , or CSA , farm near Zeeland , claims small - scale farming in West Michigan could create as many as 200,000 jobs to serve 1.5 million consumers who increasingly seek locally sourced food .
Local CSAs , for example , have gone from a novelty to a network of more than 20 in the past decade .
Farm markets and community gardens also continue to proliferate .
Still , less than 10 percent of food consumed in West Michigan is raised locally , Cary said .
“ The potential is there , ” he said .
“ It has to pass the litmus test of being economically viable .
The thing that ’s potent about this is they are .
It ’s working . ”
Selling local goods
On one hand , consumers are placing more value on fresh local food they perceive as healthier for themselves and the environment .
On the other hand , “ mission - driven ” producers sense a calling for an enterprise that matches their desire for sustainability and social justice , said Deb Steketee , associate professor of sustainable business at Aquinas College .
The market is responding in many ways , so “ we ’re going to need to rethink public policy and accommodate some of the innovation that ’s occurring , ” she said .
Nationwide , Seattle has loosened its rules for backyard goats and New York City ’s health department is taking steps to legalize beekeeping .
Urban farmers in Los Angeles are lobbying to allow cultivation and sale of flowers , fruits , nuts or vegetables in residential neighborhoods .
Closer to home , Zeeland and some other Michigan cities are facing demand for backyard chickens , and a Jamestown Township man has made a business of renting egg - laying hens and coops .
“ What we ’re seeing is a lot of trends coalescing around this , ” Steketee said .
“ At the bottom of it all is that food is the one thing that we all want to have control over , and it feels good to know what you ’re putting into your body is healthy , fresh food .
“ Today , we ’ve got the ‘ economic victory ’ motivation .
I can make a small investment in plants and basically feed our family for the summer from the vegetable garden . ”
In Wyoming , the local Moose Lodge has tilled its street frontage at 2630 Burlingame Ave.
SW into a garden of flowers and vegetables including cabbage , beans , carrots , lettuce , peas and onions .
The primary motivation ?
“ Nobody wanted to mow it , ” said Joe O’Neill , chairman of the lodge ’s gardening committee .
But , especially in this economy , why not plant a garden that can supplement people ’s food supply ?
“ You ’ve got fresh vegetables that taste good , and there ’s some community spirit , ” O’Neill said .
“ We ’re going to distribute them to the membership by just setting out baskets , first - come - first - served .
What ’s not used is going to go to a God ’s Kitchen ( or similar charitable organization ) . ”
Some local businesses and several area churches have planted gardens to feed employees and those in need .
In some cases , urban residents are replacing their lawns with gardens .
“ People are just understanding that it ’s kind of fun and enjoyable , ” said Cynthia Price , chairwoman of the food systems council .
“ It ’s also , for a lot of people , a health concern .
They think ‘ Well , I need to eat fresh , healthy food , and what easier way to get it ? ’
You can just go out and pick a tomato or pick a zucchini . ”

A WOMAN put the safety of her neighbours over her own modesty when she saved an apartment building from going up in flames - topless .
Fitness instructor Tash Bennett was sunbathing by the pool of the Alatai Apartments in Darwin when a nearby palm tree caught on fire , the Northern Territory News reports .
" I was just lying there when some ash fell on top of me , " she said .
" I was n't really paying attention because I was listening to my iPod . "
Ms Bennett raced to reception for help before rushing back to the pool to use the fire hose .
It was only after battling the blaze for five minutes that she looked down and realised that she was still topless from the sunbaking .
" I was pretty red faced on the day , having to hold myself while running to reception , " she said .
" I was sunbaking .
I was n't exactly prepared .
" But you 've got to put out the fire before you deal with that . "
After the blaze , Ms Bennett resumed her sunbaking while she waiting for the fire crew to arrive .
Her husband , Daniel McNamee said he was proud of his wife 's quick action in the emergency .
" Apparently the flame was pretty high .
It could have taken out the building , " he said .
" She was just lying there thinking , ' it 's getting pretty hot here ' . "
" It was only after the fire was out that she looked down and realised that she was topless .
" At one stage she had quite an audience , just having a laugh . "
One witness , Johnny McCoy , said Ms Bennett had a full audience of residents while she battled the blaze , which occurred last Thursday .
" For the record , she was smoking hot herself , but provided all the boys a pretty awesome sight , " he said .
" Once she had the blaze under control , she then got her bikini situation under control and put everything back where it should be . "
eso1019 — Photo Release
A Cluster and a Sea of Galaxies
A new wide - field image released today by ESO displays many thousands of distant galaxies , and more particularly a large group belonging to the massive galaxy cluster known as Abell 315 .
As crowded as it may appear , this assembly of galaxies is only the proverbial “ tip of the iceberg ” , as Abell 315 — like most galaxy clusters — is dominated by dark matter .
The huge mass of this cluster deflects light from background galaxies , distorting their observed shapes slightly .
When looking at the sky with the unaided eye , we mostly only see stars within our Milky Way galaxy and some of its closest neighbours .
More distant galaxies are just too faint to be perceived by the human eye , but if we could see them , they would literally cover the sky .
This new image released by ESO is both a wide - field and long - exposure one , and reveals thousands of galaxies crowding an area on the sky roughly as large as the full Moon .
These galaxies span a vast range of distances from us .
Some are relatively close , as it is possible to distinguish their spiral arms or elliptical halos , especially in the upper part of the image .
The more distant appear just like the faintest of blobs — their light has travelled through the Universe for eight billion years or more before reaching Earth .
Beginning in the centre of the image and extending below and to the left , a concentration of about a hundred yellowish galaxies identifies a massive galaxy cluster , designated with the number 315 in the catalogue compiled by the American astronomer George Abell in 1958 [ 1 ] .
The cluster is located between the faint , red and blue galaxies and the Earth , about two billion light - years away from us .
It lies in the constellation of Cetus ( the Whale ) .
Galaxy clusters are some of the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravity .
But there is more in these structures than the many galaxies we can see .
Galaxies in these giants contribute to only ten percent of the mass , with hot gas in between galaxies accounting for another ten percent [ 2 ] .
The remaining 80 percent is made of an invisible and unknown ingredient called dark matter that lies in between the galaxies .
The presence of dark matter is revealed through its gravitational effect : the enormous mass of a galaxy cluster acts on the light from galaxies behind the cluster like a cosmic magnifying glass , bending the trajectory of the light and thus making the galaxies appear slightly distorted [ 3 ] .
By observing and analysing the twisted shapes of these background galaxies , astronomers can infer the total mass of the cluster responsible for the distortion , even when this mass is mostly invisible .
However , this effect is usually tiny , and it is necessary to measure it over a huge number of galaxies to obtain significant results : in the case of Abell 315 , the shapes of almost 10 000 faint galaxies in this image were studied in order to estimate the total mass of the cluster , which amounts to over a hundred thousand billion times the mass of our Sun [ 4 ] .
To complement the enormous range of cosmic distances and sizes surveyed by this image , a handful of objects much smaller than galaxies and galaxy clusters and much closer to Earth are scattered throughout the field : besides several stars belonging to our galaxy , many asteroids are also visible as blue , green or red trails [ 5 ] .
These objects belong to the main asteroid belt , located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , and their dimensions vary from some tens of kilometres , for the brightest ones , to just a few kilometres in the case of the faintest ones .
This image has been taken with the Wide Field Imager on the MPG / ESO 2.2 - metre telescope at ESO ’s La Silla Observatory in Chile .
It is a composite of several exposures acquired using three different broadband filters , for a total of almost one hour in the B filter and about one and a half hours in the V and R filters .
The field of view is 34 x 33 arcminutes .
Notes
[ 1 ] The Abell catalogue from 1958 comprised 2712 clusters of galaxies , and was integrated with an additional 1361 clusters in 1989 .
Abell put together this impressive collection by visual inspection of photographic plates of the sky , seeking those areas where more galaxies than average were found at approximately the same distance from us .
[ 2 ]
Ten percent of a galaxy cluster ’s mass consists of a very hot mixture of protons and electrons ( a plasma ) , with temperatures as high as ten million degrees or more , which makes it visible to X - ray telescopes .
[ 3 ]
Astronomers refer to these slight distortions as weak gravitational lensing , as opposed to strong gravitational lensing , characterised by more spectacular phenomena such as giant arcs , rings and multiple images .
[ 4 ]
A weak lensing study of the galaxy cluster Abell 315 has been published in a paper that appeared in Astronomy & Astrophysics in 2009 ( “ Weak lensing observations of potentially X - ray underluminous galaxy clusters ” , by J. Dietrich et al . ) .
[ 5 ]
The blue , green or red tracks indicate that each asteroid has been detected through one of the three filters , respectively .
Each track is composed of several , smaller sub - tracks , reflecting the sequence of several exposures performed in each of the filters ; from the length of these sub- tracks , the distance to the asteroid can be calculated .

GNU social is building the first decentralized free software social network licensed under the GNU Affero GPL license , built on the StatusNet software stack and the OStatus protocol .
Leading the event will be Matt Lee , project lead for GNU social , who said " These meetings give us a real opportunity to bring people who are building the best tools for the social web together , to allow our developers to glean insight from the design decisions that go into creating social protocols and applications , and to allow us to quickly move forward in the development of GNU social . "
Face - to - face " hacker meets " have emerged as an important way of giving momentum to projects from documentation and code to animation and user - interface design .
Meeting face - to - face is doubly important for a project designed to free social network users from control by remote corporate interests .
Evan Prodromou , founder of StatusNet , Inc and operator of the popular identi.ca social messaging website said : " We 're excited that GNU social and StatusNet will be working together much more closely .
Working together , we think we can make great software that implements truly distributed social networking .
Everyone -- individuals , businesses , universities and non-profits -- deserve to manage their own connection to the social web without sacrificing privacy , security and control . "
Working together for free software
The event comes as another in a series of events and articles from the foundation .
In 2008 , the FSF hosted a group around the topic of free network services , which led to the creation of the autonomo.us group , and in March , foundation president Richard Stallman published the first in a series of philosophical articles on network services —
" Who does that server really serve ? "
Most Internet users know to watch for the telltale signs of a traditional phishing attack :
An e-mail that asks you to click on a link and enter your e-mail or banking credentials at the resulting Web site .
But a new phishing concept that exploits user inattention and trust in browser tabs is likely to fool even the most security - conscious Web surfers .
As Mozilla Firefox creative lead Aza Raskin describes it , the attack is as elegant as it is simple : A user has multiple tabs open , and surfs to a site that uses special javacript code to silently alter the contents of a tabbed page along with the information displayed on the tab itself , so that when the user switches back to that tab it appears to be the login page for a site the user normally visits .
Consider the following scenario : Bob has six or seven tabs open , and one of the sites he has open ( but not the tab currently being viewed ) contains a script that waits for a few minutes or hours , and then quietly changes both the content of the page and the icon and descriptor in the tab itself so that it appears to be the login page for Gmail .
In this attack , the phisher need not even change the Web address displayed in the browser ’s navigation toolbar .
Rather , this particular phishing attack takes advantage of user trust and inattention to detail , or what Raskin calls “ the perceived immutability of tabs . ”
Then , as the user scans their many open tabs , the favicon and title act as a strong visual cue , and the user will most likely simply think they left a Gmail tab open .
“ When they click back to the fake Gmail tab , they ’ll see the standard Gmail login page , assume they ’ve been logged out , and provide their credentials to log in , ” Raskin explained .
“ After the user has enter they have entered their login information and sent it back your server , you redirect them to Gmail .
Because they were never logged out in the first place , it will appear as if the login was successful . ”
Raskin includes a proof - of - concept at his site , which is sort of creepy when you let it run .
In fact , at least once while composing this blog post in Firefox I went to click on the tab that had my Gmail inbox open , only to discover I ’d accidentally clicked on Raskin ’s page , which had morphed into the fake Gmail site in the interim .
It ’s important to keep in mind that this attack could be used against any site , not just Gmail .
Also , Raskin includes a few suggestions about how this attack could be made far sneakier — such as taking advantage of CSS history attacks .
Of course , if you are browsing with the excellent “ Noscript ” add - on and this is a site you have not allowed to run javascript , the proof - of - concept wo n’t work until you allow javascript on the page .
It did not work completely against the Safari browser on my Mac ( no favicon ) , and the test page failed completely against Google Chrome .
[ Update :
As several readers have correctly pointed out , this attack does in fact work against Chrome , although it does n’t seem to change the favicon in Chrome tabs ] .
I ’m left wondering what this new form of phishing will be called if it is ever adopted by the bad guys .
Tabnabbing ?
Tabgrabbing ?
See if you can coin a better phrase in the comments below .
Update , May 25 , 7:55 p.m. ET : Researcher Aviv Raff has posted an interesting proof - of - concept of his own that shows how this attack can work against Firefox even when users have the Noscript add - on installed and in full paranoid mode .
Raff crafted his page , which is a mock up of this blog post , to morph into an image of the Gmail login page , and it will reload every 20 seconds but will only change to the sample phish page if you move to another tab with your mouse , or after 10 reloads ( in case you moved with the keyboard ) .
So it will change only after 3 minutes or so , unless you move to another tab with your mouse .
“ I was trying to find a way to work around the javascript need for the [ proof - of - concept ] , ” Raff said in an instant message .
“ First I was able to do this without knowing if the user moved to a new tab .
Now I can almost be sure of that . ”
Update , May 27 , 11:41 p.m. ET : For Firefox users with the Noscript plugin , there is an update to the program that can block these types of tabnabbing attacks .

Choosing a gym that ’s right for you can be challenging , so I created a checklist that will make the process much easier .
You can trust me because I ’ve seen hundreds of gyms over the years , even in different countries .
Here ’s the inside scoop on how to choose a gym that ’s right for you .
I listed the criteria in order of importance :
1 ) Convenience
I think the # 1 most important criterion by far is where the gym is located .
If you ’re living in suburbia and there ’s a gym right across from your office , or within a couple minutes of your home , you should probably just use that gym .
The gym that is most convenient is the one you should use , unless there is something seriously wrong ( for example , the gym fails a few of the criteria I ’ve listed below miserably ) .
We all know how hard it is to make it to the gym consistently , so you might as well make going to the gym as convenient as possible .
2 ) Crowd During Peak Hours
One thing that drives me mad about the gym I use right now is that from 5 - 7 pm , it ’s a complete zoo .
There ’s a line to use the cardio machines , people are throwing around weights all over the place , there ’s never a bench to use , and the dumbbells I want to use are unavailable .
It ’s basically impossible to get a great workout .
You want to make sure before you sign the contract that the times that you will be going to the gym are not overcrowded .
3 ) Price
Many people would put price first , but I do n’t think it ’s as important as the first two criteria .
The dirty little secret of the gym industry is that some gyms want to lock you into a 1 - 2 year contract and then pray you do n’t ever come !
In fact , as much as 30 % of the client base at some gyms never even workout .
I think the more money you pony up for your gym membership , the more skin you put in the game , which will motivate you more to hit the gym more than 0 times a week .
4 ) Equipment Quality and Variety
Every gym should offer up to date equipment that ’s safe .
Unfortunately , many gyms do n’t spend the money to take care of their facilities and buy new equipment .
One gym I use occasionally has dumbbells that are literally about to fall apart and the benches are unstable .
Needless to say , faulty equipment is very dangerous .
A gym should also have a variety of equipment , including cardio equipment such as treadmills , ellipticals , and stationary bikes , dumbbells that go heavy enough to match your strength levels , barbells , benches , exercise balls , and a padded area for stretching / core , and finally some machines .
5 ) Type of Membership Base
I like gyms where members are really serious about working out and training hard .
Now you do n’t have to have 5 % body fat and be able to do 25 pull - ups to be serious , but when I go to the gym , I ’m there to workout hard and I find it motivating if other people are working out hard as well .
If some have exceptional physiques , that ’s even better .
Some gyms only cater to women , some to those who are overweight , some are more corporate , and so on .
If who you are surrounded by at the gym is important to you , then you should take into consideration the types of people in general who go to a given gym .
6 ) Gym Layout
This is a pet peeve of mine when I go to a gym .
Some gyms will have the squat rack on one side of the room , the dumbbells on the other , and the barbells on a different floor .
I guess some people who design these gyms were probably thinking about how big their arms are rather than making a great layout .
Ideally , the barbells and dumbbells will be in one general area , the exercise machines / cables in another , separated from the cardio and abs / core area .
In addition , my favorite types of gyms , like I had in college , are simply one large open floor , so it ’s easy to hop from one exercise to another .
7 ) Locker Room
I do n’t really care for gym locker rooms because I never shower at the gym , but if you do , then the locker room may be an important criteria for you .
Some gyms have saunas , steam rooms , most should have showers , and all should have lockers where you can keep your clothes .
8 ) Cleanliness
It does n’t matter to me if a gym is clean because I ’m there to sweat , but I ’ve seen some gyms that are just disgusting .
They ’ve got sweat marks on every bench and machine , there ’s dust covering the dumbbells , and if you mistakenly drop your towel on the ground , it looks like it ’s covered in tar when you pick it up .
Gyms should be cleaned every day .
There are some other criteria such as friendliness and professionalism of staff , hours of operation , and exercise classes that are offered that I did n’t mention .
If you take a lot of classes , then that criteria should probably be very high up on this list .
If I left out any qualities of a gym that you think are important , or you have anything to add , leave a comment !
For Jezebel ’s 10th anniversary , we ’re revisiting some classic posts from our archive .
Here ’s to the next ten .

The Daily Show is many things : progressive darling , alleged news source for America ’s youth , righteous media critique .
And it ’s also a boys ’ club where women ’s contributions are often ignored and dismissed .
If Olivia Munn , the former videogame show host introduced to Daily Show viewers three weeks ago , survives her tryout , she ’ll be the first new female correspondent on the show in seven years .
With the notable exception of Samantha Bee , who ’s been on since 2001 , female correspondents have been a short - lived phenomenon .
As fiercely liberal and sharp - eyed an observer as Jon Stewart can be , getting women on the air may be his major blind spot .
Television comedy , and late night in particular , can be cutthroat and transitory , and no one is particularly surprised when the men who host these shows turn out to be not very nice guys , as anyone who cared to pay attention to the David Letterman fall - out could see .
Women are universally scarce , whether in the writer ’s room or on the air .
And the environment on The Daily Show was arguably worse in the Craig Kilborn era : Back in 1997 , the then - host was suspended after telling Esquire , ” To be honest , [ co - creator ] Lizz [ Winstead ] does find me very attractive .
If I wanted her to blow me , she would . ”
( Winstead quit not long afterward . )
Nowadays there may be less overt frat - boy humor , but that does n’t mean the institutionalized sexism is gone .

Given its politics and the near - universal adoration with which it ’s met , the current iteration of The Daily Show is held to a different standard by the viewing public .
But behind the scenes , numerous former female staffers tell us that working there was often a frustrating and alienating experience .
“ What I was told when I was hired is that they have a very hard time finding and keeping women , and that I was lucky to get a one year contract , ” says Lauren Weedman , a comedian and writer who worked on the show as an on -air correspondent from 2001 - 2002 .
This mentality arguably goes straight the top :
The host and executive producer ’s onscreen persona is lovable mensch , but one former executive on the show tells us “ there ’s a huge discrepancy between the Jon Stewart who goes on TV every night and the Jon Stewart who runs The Daily Show with joyless rage . ”
( A representative for Comedy Central said they would be unable to participate in this story . )
﻿ “ When I was there they were always having auditions for women .
I would see all these blonde women coming in — they ’d give them the same copy they gave me the night before .
And I knew I ’d be fired . ”
( She was . )

The story of Stewart throwing a newspaper or script at the show ’s co-creator and executive producer Madeleine Smithberg out of displeasure with her work is an oft - told one among Daily Show veterans .
Not long after the continued tension led Smithberg to quit in 2003 , sources say Stewart refused to allow her onstage to accept the show ’s Emmy , even though her work contributed to the win .
Stacey Grenrock Woods was on Stewart ’s show from 1999 - 2003 , longer than any other correspondent besides Bee .
( She later chronicled the experience in her book , I , California . )
She told me , “ Did I feel like there was a boy ’s club there ?
Yeah , sure .
Did I want to be part of it ?
Not necessarily .
So it kind of goes both ways . ”
This mutual disdain is perhaps why so few women stuck around , whether by choice or otherwise .
Weedman says that she knew her own days were numbered from the moment she was given the desk of Miriam Tolan , another female correspondent who did not yet know she ’d been fired .
“ When I was there they were always having auditions for women , ” she says .
“ I would see all these blonde women coming in — they ’d give them the same copy they gave me the night before .
And I knew I ’d be fired . ”
( She was . )
Overall , The Daily Show ’s environment was such that many women felt marginalized .
“ It was a place of just business , ” says one show veteran .
“ The business happened to be hilarious comedy , but you were n’t allowed to enjoy it ...
Any sort of emotional vulnerability is like blood to a shark .
And that is not great for women . ”

Misreading the culture could cost you .
Adrianne Frost , who worked briefly as a correspondent in 2002 , says , “ I did n’t know this at the time , but you needed to be too cool for school .
I was being grateful and thankful … .
With a woman it comes off as ‘ needy , crazy , insecure . ’ ”
﻿ “ ‘ They think you ’re crazy .
I told you not to be too friendly . ’ ”
After a single , well - received segment from Frost about a woman fighting for chicken ’s rights — which aired while Stewart was on vacation and Colbert was sitting in — Frost got a call telling her not to come back .
She says James Dixon , the comedy agent who recruited her and still represents both Stewart and Colbert screamed at her , “ ‘ They think you ’re crazy .
I told you not to be too friendly . ’ ”
Maybe that discomfort came out of a double standard .
Says Weedman , “ The irony was that as a woman my comedy came from being kind of insecure , broken , needy , neurotic .
And that works in a group of guys if you ’re a nerdy , insecure guy and you can all just banter away .
But if you ’re a woman , it was harder for me to be that person without some support . ”
Stewart and his show do have their female defenders .
Bee , for starters , has repeatedly said her gender has been no impediment .
Allison Silverman , a former Daily Show writer who returned after a stint working for Conan O’Brien to launch and executive produce The Colbert Report , says , “ I had a great experience at The Daily Show .
Jon ’s given me nothing but support . ”

And Smithberg blames larger societal forces for the dearth of women on staff , onscreen and off .
“ I do n’t think Jon is sexist , ” she says .
“ I do n’t think that there is a double standard at the Daily Show .
I do think that by the time it gets to the Daily Show it ’s already been through the horrible sexist double standard of the universe .
You ’re not hiring someone right out of school .
By the time they get to the candidates of the Daily Show , the herd has been thinned by the larger societal forces . ”
Of the greater talent pool of comedians , she said , “ All that ’s left are white men and Aziz Ansari . ”
“ The planet is sexist , ” Smithberg adds .
“ At least in comedy we do n’t have genital mutilation .
That we know of . ”
The show ’s producers are somewhat aware they have a problem .
Last fall , the writers ’ room went from being all male to having two women , a definite improvement .
“ We shook the trees a little , ” the head writer told The New York Times , and bringing on Olivia Munn would come out of the same impulse , according to numerous reports .
“ ﻿Ed Helms got to have his mole removed [ in a segment ] , but they were n’t going to do , a women goes to the gynecologist . ”

But two female writers do not a female - friendly environment make .
“ The writers want to be able to write for a female reporter — but not too female , ” says Weedman .
She says it was hard to figure out what that meant exactly .
“ I would pitch something like , can I do a segment on women ’s self help or on fitness .
And they did n’t want anything like that …
Ed Helms got to have his mole removed [ in a segment ] , but they were n’t going to do , a women goes to the gynecologist .
They felt like at the time it was n’t their audience . ”
According to Nielsen , the Daily Show ’s audience does lean male — about 60 percent .
That ’s who producers seemed to have in mind when they hired Olivia Munn .
Though it ’s far to early to assess
Munn ’s performance based on her few seconds onscreen so far , her previous career path has led some to criticize The Daily Show for hiring someone better known for suggestively putting things in her mouth on a video game show ( seen here ) and being on the covers of Playboy and Maxim than for her comedic chops .
Munn was hired after an exhaustive search for a female correspondent that included many professional comedians .
( Kristen Schaal is already an occasional contributor , but not a regular correspondent . )
Executive producer Rory Albanese told the Daily Beast that producers were previously unaware of Olivia ’s drooling fanboy base : “ We ’re stuck in a hard news cycle and we ’re nerdy .
If she was on the cover of The Economist , we would have been like , ‘ Yes !
Of course ! ’ ”
It ’s hard not to conclude that looks mattered more for women than for men .
Silverman jokes of Munn ’s hiring , “ I just hope it encourages Wyatt Cenac to take his top off more often . ”

One female comedian who has auditioned multiple times for the show says , “ Looking back , it was ridiculous of me to even prepare !
Should I have gone to the gym more ?
Done Playboy ?
It ’s such a joke . ”
That might have helped .
Says Weedman , “ It kept being said to me by people who worked there — not by Jon but by producers — ‘ I think that the thing is that Stacy Grenrock Woods does well on the show because she ’s cute .
And [ former correspondent ]
Beth Littleford , she was pretty , and it just helps . ’
They were saying this to my face .
They were trying to be honest . ”
One female correspondent says a producer summed it up for her this way : “ Think of the Daily Show as your pilot boyfriend .
He swoops into town , you have great sex , then you never know when you ’re going to see him again . ”

The Daily Show Tries Out New Female Correspondent

Do You Think She ’ll Mind ?
And Other Tales From Late Night TV
Guess How Many Female Writers There Are On Late Night ?
In humans and other primates , the prefrontal cortex is the seat of high - level functions such as learning , decision making , and planning .
Neuroscientists have long wondered whether neurons in that part of the brain are specialized for one type of task or if they are “ generalists ” — that is , able to participate in many functions .
A new study from MIT ’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory comes down in favor of the generalist theory .
MIT professor Earl Miller and others in his lab showed that when they trained monkeys to perform two different categorization tasks , about half of the neurons involved could switch between the two .
The findings , reported in the June 10 issue of the journal Neuron , suggest that neurons of the prefrontal cortex have a much greater ability to adapt to different cognitive demands than neurons in other parts of the brain .
These results support ideas about the malleability of neurons — nervous - system cells that process and transmit information — that Miller first proposed a decade ago .
Miller , the Picower Professor of Neuroscience in MIT ’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , says he ’s not surprised by the findings .
“ We have a lot of mental flexibility , ” he says .
“ We can change our topic of conversation , we can change what we ’re thinking about .
Some part of the brain has to have that flexibility on a neural level . ”
Listening to single neurons
Most neuroscientists who study brain activity in monkeys train the animals on only one task , so until now it had been impossible to reveal whether single neurons in the prefrontal cortex could be involved in more than one job .
In previous studies , Miller has shown that when monkeys are trained to categorize animals by distinguishing cats from dogs , some neurons in the prefrontal cortex become tuned to the concept of “ cat ” while others respond to the idea of “ dog . ”
This time , Miller , postdoctoral fellow Jason Cromer , and research scientist Jefferson Roy trained the monkeys to perform two different categorization tasks — distinguishing cats from dogs and sedans from sports cars .
They recorded activity from about 500 neurons in the monkeys ’ prefrontal cortex as the animals switched back and forth between the tasks .
Although they found that some neurons were more attuned to car images and others to animal images , they also identified many neurons that were active during both tasks .
In fact , these “ multitasking ” neurons were best at making correct identifications in both categories .
The findings suggest that neurons in the prefrontal cortex have a unique ability to adapt to different tasks , says Miller .
In other parts of the brain , earlier research has shown , most neurons are highly specialized .
Neurons in the visual cortex , for example , are programmed to respond to very specific inputs , such as a vertical line or a certain color .
Some have even been shown to fire only in response to one particular face .
“ Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex is different from the sensory cortex and the motor cortex .
It ’s highly plastic , ” says Miller .
“ That ’s important , because it means the human brain has the capacity to absorb a lot of information . ”
The Neuron study focused on two categorization tasks , but Miller hopes to run another study in which the monkeys learn a third task involving some other cognitive function .
That could give another hint about how much information our brains can handle , says David Freedman , an assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of Chicago .
“ We ’re very good at learning dozens , hundreds , or even thousands of categories , ” he says .
“ You wonder if there is some limit , or would these neurons be as flexible as we are as observers ? ”
Freedman says he would also be interested to see whether the same prefrontal - cortex neurons can multitask between activities that involve different kinds of sensory inputs — for example , a visual task and an auditory task .
Overstimulation
Meanwhile , Miller has a study under way that he believes could demonstrate a biological basis for the impaired categorization ability often seen in people with autism .
Autistic children often have a hard time understanding that two slightly different objects — for example , a red toothbrush and a blue toothbrush — both belong to the same category .
Miller theorizes that an evolutionarily older part of the brain , known as the basal ganglia , gathers information about new objects , and the prefrontal cortex learns how to categorize them .
“ The basal ganglia learn the pieces of the puzzle , and the prefrontal cortex puts the pieces together , ” he says .
In his current study , Miller is monitoring brain activity in monkeys as they learn a categorization task .
He expects to find a sharp peak in prefrontal - cortex activity at the moment when the monkeys learn that certain objects belong to the same category .
Eventually , he hopes to show that in autism , the balance between those two brain regions is thrown off : there is either too much activity in the basal ganglia or not enough in the prefrontal cortex .

I only spent five days in Senegal ’s St. Louis , but I saw a lot .
The heart of the old colonial town , located on a narrow island at the mouth of the Senegal River , was established in 1659 by French traders .
It owes much of it ’s individuality to the Metis ( merchant communities ) of the 17th and 18th centuries , who created a distinctive culture of public festivities and entertainment .
St. Louis continues to be an important centre for cultural exchange in the region — the town has many resident artisans striving for recognition and holds West Africa ’s most important jazz festival , along with numerous other music events throughout the year .
This year ’s festival will be held May 20 - 23 .

This is the sum of money held on unused Oyster cards April 2009 - 2010
Almost £ 30 m has been left unused on Oyster pay - as - you - go ( PAYG ) for at least a year , the BBC has learned .
A total of 16.5 m PAYG cards sat idle during the year from April 2009 to April 2010 .
The average amount on each card was £ 1.80 .
Transport for London ( TfL ) says no card is deemed as expired and users can always claim the balance back .
The smart cards are used to pay for travel in London .
There are plans to roll out similar schemes across the UK .
Oyster cards can be topped up for use on buses , tubes and trains across the capital .
Last year alone , 31,000 PAYG cards were issued and topped up but never subsequently used , even though they held £ 246,000 worth of travel on them , according to information obtained in a Freedom of Information ( FOI ) request .
Refunds
" Pay - as - you - go Oyster cards do not expire and customers are able to return their cards at any time for a refund of the remaining balance and card deposit , " Transport for London said .
" Revenue generated from fares , including Oyster fares , is used to operate , maintain and upgrade London 's transport network . ''
However , if your card is lost or stolen you will only be able to make a claim if you had already registered your card with Transport for London .
Director of fares and ticketing Shashi Verma added that TfL had tried to make it " as easy as possible " for commuters to reclaim the balance on their Oyster cards .
" Many do n't claim it back as it's just pennies and obviously some of these are tourists , " he added .
" One of the busiest places that we have issuing refunds is Heathrow Airport and we provided that facility at Heathrow precisely for this reason , because there are people exiting the country . "
TfL added that the £ 29.85 m balance on cards that have not been used for a year equates to just over a week revenue from PAYG top-ups .
The firm , which is a not - for - profit organisation , brings in a total of £ 3bn in revenues annually .
Spreading trend
A similar " smart card " scheme currently operates in Newport , and the Welsh city plans to introduce a pay - as - you - go service in several days .
However , unlike the Transport for London scheme , the new service will operate on a " use it or lose it " basis .
People do lose smart cards ... and , of course , the person who issues these cards effectively benefits David Everett , Managing Director Smartcard Group
A spokesman for Newport Bus said that while the Passport card would never expire , users would be unable to return the card to the company and recover the remaining balance .
Elsewhere in the UK , smart card provider Squid helped Bolton council launch a local services card in 2008 which allows residents to top - up their card and spend the balance on local buses , or services such as leisure centres and libraries and shops .
It now also operates a number of cashless schemes across Scotland .
And a number of local authorities have plans to introduce transport smart cards in the future - including Bristol , North and South Yorkshire , Reading , Bristol and the Midlands .
Business model
Smartcard Group managing director David Everett said he was " not surprised " by the £ 29.85 m left unspent on Oyster cards in the past year .
He said most people do n't realise that any kind of pre-payment card is likely to have unspent funds on it .
" People do lose smart cards , they do n't spend them , or they put them away and , of course , the person who issues these cards effectively benefits . "
Mr Everett added that the amount left unclaimed on pre-payment cards usually amounts to 2 - 10 % of the value issued and this amount can be built into a company 's business model .
" This allows you as a company to say your liabilities will reduce , but the only way to ensure this is if you say it expires over time - for example a gift card that expires after a year - then of course you get that value , " he explained .
A born - again Keynesian who remains an ardent opponent of big government , Posner may remind some readers of the two - headed pushmi-pullyu in the Doctor Dolittle books .
On the wickedness of Greenspan and the greatness of Keynes he sounds like Paul Krugman ’s doppelgänger .
But facing the other way on the fallibility of regulators is Posner ’s free - market Chicago head , which is scathing about attempts to police executive compensation , skeptical about the value of a new consumer protection agency and anxious about spiraling fiscal deficits and the risk of future inflation .
For Posner , the American system of government is “ cumbersome , clotted , ­competence - ­challenged , even rather shady . ”
He confesses himself “ perplexed by how government . . . has managed to escape most of the blame for our current economic state . ”
Well , maybe because his fellow Keynesians have relentlessly lauded government as the solution .
In his defense , Posner can cite Keynes ’s letter to President Roosevelt , published in December 1933 , which explicitly warned that “ even wise and necessary reform may , in some respects , impede and complicate recovery .
For it will upset the confidence of the business world and weaken their existing motives to action , before you have had time to put other motives in their place . ”
This is the essence of Posner ’s argument here .
“ Ambitious reforms are premature , ” he concludes , “ pending a rigorous inquiry into the causes of the depression . ”
Rather than hastily drafted thousand - page - long legislative measures , he would like to see an executive commission similar to the 9/11 commission to establish what those causes were .
Otherwise , we should apply lessons that have already been learned in the realm of counterterrorism .
We need more rotation of senior personnel among government financial agencies ; better funding of those agencies ; more pooling of intelligence between those agencies .
“ The Crisis of Capitalist Democracy ” has been written in haste , and it shows .
Characteristically , Posner has not just one but two blogs and too much of this book reads as if it first saw the light of day online .
But the trouble with blogging is that the more you blog , the less you read .
Since he is not an economist , Posner cannot afford to take as many shortcuts as he does .
The result is that confusions occasionally creep in , for example about what exactly constitutes a bank ’s capital and how exactly bank leverage ( the ratio of liabilities to capital ) was regulated before the crisis .
Most perplexing of all , the ­small - ­government Keynesian calls for a flurry of reforms as half - baked as anything in the current bills before Congress : end the S.E.C. certification of certain credit rating agencies as “ Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Agencies ” ; tie bank capital requirements to the business cycle , so that they rise in good times ; and restore the Glass - Steagall Act that separated commercial and investment banking during the Depression .
This last suggestion is especially strange as Posner must know that the preservation of Glass - Steagall would have done nothing whatever to alter the behavior of the men running Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers or A.I.G .
Posner makes it clear that he understands the risks the United States now faces as the crisis of private finance continues its metamorphosis into a crisis of public finance : an exploding debt relative to gross domestic product ; larger risk premiums as investors prepare for higher inflation or a weaker dollar ; rising interest rates ; a greater share of tax revenues going for interest payments ; a diminishing share of resources available for national security as opposed to Social Security .
“ As an economic power , ” Posner concludes , “ we may go the way of the British Empire . ” Indeed .
It seems not to have struck the judge that British decline and the rise of Keynesianism went hand in hand .
Queen 's University Belfast is a public body in the United Kingdom .
As such , it is required to make certain information available under the UK Freedom of Information Act .
The university holds some information about tree rings ( which is important in climate studies and in archaeology ) .
Following discusses my attempt to obtain that information , using the Act .
When a tree is cut , you can often see many concentric rings .
Typically , there is one ring for each year during which the tree grew .
Some rings will be thick : those indicate years in which the environment was good for the tree .
Other rings will be thin : those indicate the opposite .
Tree rings are studied by scientists for two main purposes .
One purpose is to learn something about what the climate was like many years ago .
For instance , if many trees in a region had thick rings in some particular years , then climatic conditions in those years were presumably good ( e.g. warm and with lots of rain ) ; tree rings have been used in this way to learn about the climate centuries ago .
The other purpose in studying tree rings is to date artefacts found in archaeological contexts ; for an example , see here .
Tree-ring data from Northern Ireland
One of the world 's leading centers for tree - ring work is in Northern Ireland , at Queen 's University Belfast ( QUB ) .
The tree -ring data that QUB has gathered is valuable for studying the global climate during the past 7000 years : for a brief explanation of this , see here .
Almost all of the tree - ring data held by QUB was gathered decades ago ; yet it has never been published .
There is a standard place on the internet to publish such data : the International Tree - Ring Data Bank ( ITRDB ) , which currently holds tree - ring data from over 1500 sites around the world .
QUB refuses to publish or otherwise disclose most of its data , though .
So I have tried to obtain the data by applying under the UK Freedom of Information Act ( FoI Act ) .
I have submitted three separate requests for the data .
Each request described the data in a different way , in an attempt to avoid nit-picking objections .
All three requests were for the data in electronic form , e.g. placed on the internet or sent as an e-mail attachment .
The first request was submitted in April 2007 .
QUB refused the first request in May 2007 .
I appealed the refusal to a Pro-Vice - Chancellor of QUB , who rejected the appeal .
The primary reason that the Pro-Vice - Chancellor gave for rejection was that some of the data was in paper form and had not been converted to electronic form .
The Pro-Vice - Chancellor additionally claimed that after data was converted to electronic form , “ It is then uploaded to the International Tree Ring Data Base ” .
There might indeed be some small portion of the data that is not in electronic form .
My request , though , was for a copy of the data that is in electronic form .
So , is all data that is in electronic form available at the ITRDB , as the Pro-Vice - Chancellor claimed ?
QUB has published the results of various analyses of its tree - ring data ( most notably its claim to have sequences of overlapping tree rings extending back in time many millennia ) .
In doing the analyses , the sequences of tree - ring data are analyzed statistically , and the statistical computations are done by computer .
This is well known , and moreover has been stated by QUB 's former head tree - ring researcher , Michael G.L. Baillie , in several his publications .
( Indeed , Baillie and his colleague Jon R. Pilcher , also at QUB , wrote a widely - used computer program for tree - ring matching , CROS . )
Obviously the data that was used for those computations is in electronic form — and it has not been uploaded to the ITRDB .
Thus the claim by the Pro-Vice - Chancellor is untrue .
The Pro-Vice - Chancellor further claimed that to organize the data in “ the very precise categories which [ I ] have specified ” [ in my request ] would entail a vast amount of work .
My request , though , was merely for the tree - ring data that had been obtained and used by the university ; that hardly seems like precise categorization .
Moreover , I later submitted a second request for “ the data about tree rings that has been obtained by [ QUB ] and that is held in electronic form by the university ” .
That request was also refused .
And a third request that was very similar to the second was refused .
All three requests were refused in whole , even though the university is required to make partial fulfillment when that is practicable .
The UK Information Commissioner 's Office
After half a year of trying to obtain the information from QUB , I appealed to the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) .
The ICO is charged with ensuring that the FoI Act is enforced .
My appeal to the ICO was submitted on 24 October 2007 .
The ICO notified me that an officer had been assigned to begin investigating my case on 14 October 2008 .
Such a long delay is clearly incompatible with effective working of the Act .
The ICO then contacted QUB , asking for more information .
QUB then admitted that almost all the data was stored in electronic form .
Thus QUB implicitly admitted that its prior claims were untruthful .
QUB now asserted , however , that the data was on 150 separate disks and that it would take 100 hours to copy those disks .
( These were floppy disks — the type that slide into computers and , prior to the internet , were commonly used to carry electronic data . )
It takes only a few minutes to copy a floppy disk , however ; so the claim of 100 hours to copy 150 floppy disks is an unrealistic exaggeration .
QUB also said that it considered photocopying a printed version of the data , but that this would take over 1800 hours .
As noted above , all my requests were for data that is in electronic form ; moreover , I have repeated this point in subsequent correspondences with QUB .
The statement from QUB about photocopying is thus not relevant .
On 22 December 2008 , the ICO sent me a letter rejecting my appeal , on the grounds that the time needed by QUB would exceed an “ appropriate limit ” ( as stipulated in the FoI Act ) .
The ICO had accepted QUB 's explanation for refusing to disclose the data without question , and without discussing the explanation with me .
I telephoned the ICO to raise some objections .
To each objection that I raised , the ICO case officer gave the same reply : “ I 'm satisfied with their [ QUB 's ] explanation ” .
I also offered to visit QUB with the case officer , to demonstrate how quickly the data could be copied ( e.g. from floppy disks ) , and to copy the data myself .
This seemed particularly appropriate because the officer had told me when she started on the case that she would visit QUB as a standard part of investigation , yet she had not made such a visit .
The officer , though , declined my offer , again saying that she was satisfied with QUB 's explanation .
There is a mechanism to appeal an ICO decision , to a tribunal .
I told the case officer that I wanted to do so .
The officer replied that , in order to file an appeal , I would need a formal Decision Notice from the ICO .
I requested a Decision Notice .
The officer then informed me that the ICO would send a Notice , but that , because they were busy , it would take about two years to do so .
Environmental Information Regulations
I discussed the above with a colleague , David Holland .
Holland said that my request should not have been processed under the FoI Act .
His reasoning was that the information I was requesting was about the environment : environmental information is exempt from the FoI Act and requests for such information should instead be processed under the Environmental Information Regulations ( EIR ) .
He pointed out that the tree-ring data clearly fits the definition of “ environmental information ” given in the EIR .
It also clearly fits the common ( dictionary ) definition .
I had been aware that the EIR existed , but had assumed that the EIR was essentially the same as the FoI Act .
After the discussion with Holland , though , I checked and found that there is one major difference between the EIR and the FoI Act : under the EIR , there is no limit on the amount of time that a public institution requires to process a request .
In other words , even if QUB 's original claim that some of the data was only available on paper were true , or even if QUB 's revised claim that copying data from disks would take 100 hours were true , that would still not be a valid reason for refusing to supply the information .
I am not an expert in how to apply the EIR or FoI Act , though .
So I telephoned the ICO headquarters to ask for guidance .
There I spoke with a Customer Service Advisor , Mike Chamberlain .
Chamberlain told me the following : that the information seemed obviously environmental ; that there was no limit on processing time that could be used to refuse a request for environmental information ; that I could freely visit a site where environmental information was held in order to examine the information ; and that it was the duty of the public authority ( i.e. QUB ) to determine whether the EIR or the FoI Act was applicable .
Chamberlain also confirmed everything that he told me with someone more senior at the ICO .
It is regrettable that I had not realized the above earlier .
My initial request to QUB , in April 2007 , had stated the following .
It might be that this request is exempt from the FOIAct , because the data being requested is environmental information .
If you believe that to be so , process my request under the Environmental Information Regulations .
QUB , however , had not processed my application correctly .
I should have caught that .
There is another issue .
I had described the information to the ICO case officer by telephone and also by e-mail ( on 24 November 2008 ) .
Hence the case officer must have known that the information was environmental , and thus exempt under the FoI Act and only requestable under the EIR .
Why did the ICO not act on that ?
On 29 January 2009 , I e-mailed the case officer , citing the above - quoted statement from my request to QUB and saying “ I would like to know the reasoning that led to my request being processed under the Freedom of Information Act , instead of EIR ” .
Initially , there was no reply .
The EIR was enacted pursuant to the Aarhus Convention , an international treaty on environmental information that the UK promoted , signed , and ratified .
Failure to implement the EIR would constitute a failure by the UK to adhere to the Convention .
Hence , a few weeks after e-mailing my question to the ICO , and with no reply , I contacted the Aarhus Convention Secretariat ( ACS ) , at the United Nations in Geneva .
The ACS has a mechanism whereby individuals can file a complaint against a country for breaching the Convention .
I had an initial discussion with the ACS about this .
That turned out to be unnecessary though .
The Assistant Information Commissioner for Northern Ireland contacted me , on 10 March 2009 : he was now handling my case and , moreover , he had visited QUB and seen some of the data .
On 22 April 2009 , I received a telephone call from the Assistant Information Commissioner for Northern Ireland .
The Assistant Commissioner said that he was preparing a Decision Notice for the case , and he made it clear that the Notice would state that the data should be disclosed under the EIR .
The next I heard anything was on 13 July 2009 , when it was announced that the Assistant Commissioner had been suspended .
On 13 August 2009 , I telephoned the ICO , to find out what was happening .
I was told that a new officer would be assigned to the case within the next few days and that a draft Decision Notice was in the signatory process .
My next communication from the ICO was an e-mail on 23 November 2009 .
The e-mail said that an officer had been assigned to my case and that a new Notice was being drafted .
Decision Notice
The ICO issued its Decision Notice on 29 March 2010 .
The Notice Summary is as follows .
The complainant requested electronic data relating to tree ring research ( dendrochronology ) .
The public authority [ i.e. QUB ] confirmed that it held the requested information but refused to provide it citing section 12 of the [ FoI ] Act .
The Commissioner indicated to the public authority that the withheld information fell within the definition of environmental information under the EIR .
The public authority subsequently cited the exceptions at regulations 12 ( 4 ) ( d ) , 12 ( 4 ) ( b ) , 12 ( 5 ) ( c ) and 12 ( 5 ) ( e ) to refuse the information .
The Commissioner finds that none of the exceptions is engaged and the withheld information should therefore be disclosed .
The Commissioner also recorded a number of procedural breaches in the public authority 's handling of the request .
The Notice is 21 pages long .
A few selections are below .
Paragraph 29 states this : “ QUB also contended that there was " negligible " public interest in disclosing the requested information given that it did not relate to issues of national / regional debate , public safety or decisions taken by QUB that directly affected the public ” .
The contention by QUB is clearly untruthful , given that the information can potentially shed significant new light on global warming ( as outlined here ) .
Paragraphs 43 – 44 state the following .
QUB had stated that there were approximately 150 disks of data , but at the inspection of 26 February 2009 the Commissioner noted that there were in fact only 67 disks , which contained 150 folders of relevant data . ….
Although QUB had argued that copying this information would be extremely time consuming , the Commissioner established during the inspection that on average it would take approximately 5 minutes to transfer the data folder to folder using Notepad .
Accordingly , the Commissioner estimated that it would take approximately 12.5 hours to complete the transfer of all disks and make a copy .
The Commissioner is of the view that this would not constitute a significant burden on QUB .
Paragraphs 47 – 49 state the following .
Regulation 12 ( 4 ) ( d ) provides that a public authority may refuse to disclose information where the request relates to material which is still in the course of completion , to unfinished documents or to incomplete data .
This exception is class - based , so there is no requirement to demonstrate prejudice or adverse effect , although there is still a requirement to consider the public interest .
QUB stated that the information requested ( the raw tree ring data held electronically ) is currently being used in ongoing research which would result in future publications .
Furthermore the data is used to update and develop new tree ring chronologies , the results of which are ultimately published via the internet on the ITRDB . ….
…. QUB has advised that the raw data was collected over a period of 40 years , and is now being used for research .
This does not suggest to the Commissioner that the data is unfinished or incomplete , rather that , whilst the research utilising this data is ongoing ie the analysis of the data , the data itself has already been collected and is therefore not unfinished or incomplete .
I would add that since the tree-ring lab was effectively closed in 2009 ( see further below ) , QUB 's advice is even more misleading .
Paragraph 54 states the following .
QUB argued to the Commissioner that the requested data had been subject to significant labour , skill and judgement on the part of the individuals who had prepared it over almost 40 years .
QUB further argued that the data was used as a tool for undertaking research into dendrochronology in Ireland and for teaching students and this research included “ very significant know - how and confidential information ” .
Accordingly QUB was of the view that disclosure of the requested information would adversely affect QUB 's ability to protect and maintain this know - how , thereby impacting on its academic research and expertise in this area .
Thus QUB has , over a period of almost 40 years , developed scientific understandings that very significantly advance the study of tree - rings , and it wants to keep those understandings confidential .
You might judge for yourself how concordant that is with the values of science .
The ICO 's Decision gained some publicity .
In particular , The Times ( of London ) interviewed the chairman of the UK parliament 's Science and Technology Committee on the Decision ; the chairman , Phil Willis , stated that “ data has to be made publicly available ” and that “ Any university or scientist that has n't got that message needs a total rethink of the way they do research ” .
Several other media outlets , both in the UK and elsewhere , also carried the story ( a partial list is below ) .
Most prominent was the Wall Street Journal , which ran an editorial entitled “ Free the data , save the science ” , strongly supporting disclosure of the QUB data .
QUB had the right to appeal the Decision to a tribunal .
The deadline for an appeal was 26 April 2010 .
The day after the deadline , I was told by the tribunal office that QUB had not filed an appeal .
Disclosed data
On 28 April 2010 , QUB sent me a letter saying that “ in compliance with the Decision Notice … the University has now disclosed the information requested in [ my ] FOI requests ” .
The letter gave the web address for the information ( copied here ) .
The disclosed data comprises the widths of the ( annual ) rings of the trees , which is the principal information that I requested .
The data , however , does not specify the locations of most of the trees ; yet my FoI requests included specifying the locations .
The data also does not specify the years in which any of the tree rings grew ; yet my FoI requests included specifying those years .
Moreover , the data comprises ring widths from less than 10 000 tree samples ; yet QUB previously stated that they had measured 11 000 tree samples .
At first , the disclosed data did not appear to fulfil my FoI requests .
My requests , though , were for the data in electronic form : QUB claimed that the additional information that I requested ( tree locations , ring dates , etc. ) was not held in electronic form .
I had both telephone and e-mail discussions with the ICO and QUB about this .
Ultimately , I accepted QUB 's claim .
I then submitted new FoI requests for additional information , regardless of what form that information was in .
Those requests resulted in the disclosure of one additional set of data .
The additional disclosed data set specified which trees were living at the time of sampling .
The ring dates of those trees are thus known with certainty .
That information , together with the information previously available in the ITRDB , implies that it is possible to date almost all the trees whose ring sequences were disclosed , at least in principle .
The task of comparing the ring sequences from all the individual trees has been attempted by two researchers in Sweden , Petra & Lars - Åke Larsson .
I will report on that in the future .
Another example — Gothenburg University
I have previously been involved with obtaining tree - ring data from another institution : Gothenburg University , in Sweden .
Sweden has a law that is similar to the UK's Freedom of Information Act ( the Swedish law is the Principle of Public Access ) .
In 2004 , Swedish courts ruled that the law applied to research data held by universities .
In a famous case known as the “ Gillberg affair ” , a researcher at Gothenburg University refused to obey the law .
As a result , both the researcher and the rector of the university were convicted of criminal malfeasance .
( The researcher received a suspended sentence and a fine ; the rector received a fine . )
Gothenburg University does substantial tree - ring research .
On 10 April 2007 , I requested their tree - ring data .
The university 's lead tree - ring researcher repeatedly resisted , claiming that it would take weeks of his time , and that he was too busy to do it .
On 22 April 2008 , I sent a letter to the ( new ) rector of Gothenburg University , saying that if the data was not supplied , I would file complaints with both the Court and the Parliamentary Ombudsmen of Sweden .
The next day , all the data was submitted to the ITRDB .
Potential legal issues
QUB has obviously been repeatedly and materially dishonest and dishonorable in its replies to my requests for information .
Is it possible to have anyone at QUB face criminal prosecution for that ?
The example of Sweden shows how useful such prosecutions can be .
In the UK , as I understand things , there can be criminal charges for breach of the FoI Act , but such charges must be made within six months of the breach occurring .
In the case of QUB , the various delays thus imply that such charges cannot be made .
It has been suggested , however , that if more than one person conspired to breach the FoI Act , then it might be possible to charge those people with the offence of conspiracy ( under Section 1 ( 1 ) of the Criminal Law Act ) .
Whether such a charge is feasible does not seem to be known — it has not been attempted before .
Note : I have no training in law , and I am not alleging that there has been a criminal offence .
The QUB tree - ring laboratory is part of QUB's Centre for Climate , the Environment , and Chronology .
The director of the Centre is Paula J. Reimer .
Thus Reimer has presumably been involved in developing QUB 's responses to my FoI requests .
I therefore submitted a new FoI request for all e-mails received by a QUB Vice - Chancellor or Pro-Vice - Chancellor ( past or present ) that contained the word “ Reimer ” .
Thus , QUB 's response to my request should include all e-mails received from Reimer and all e-mails received from someone else in which Reimer was Cc'd .
QUB 's response to my request was sent on 13 April 2010 .
It contains only five e-mails , the earliest from September 2009 .
Reimer joined QUB in about September 2004 ; so QUB 's response was surprising for me , and I appealed it .
QUB answered my appeal on 19 May 2010 .
The answer stated that a “ complete check of all relevant email accounts has been undertaken ” and that there were no additional e-mails because e-mails are “ deleted periodically ” .
I also requested a copy of all e-mails exchanged between Baillie and Reimer since submitting my first FoI request in April 2007 .
QUB sent their response on 24 May 2010 .
The response does not show any evidence of a conspiracy .
Political aftermath
The forced disclosure of the QUB data set a legal precedent in the UK .
The precedent was analyzed in law journals , mass media , etc .
The precedent was received very negatively by some scientists .
Several media outlets had supportive interviews with Baillie , and credulously repeated Baillie 's falsehoods .
Other scientists also got involved .
For example , one of the UK's leading climate scientists , Phil Jones , gave an interview to New Scientist magazine : the published interview was very critical of the FoI Act ; yet its criticisms were wholly based on falsehoods about what the Act says .
The UK government remained adamant that research data should be disclosed .
The Minister of State for Universities and Science , David Willetts , stated the following , on 22 July 2010 .
The Government attaches a lot of importance to transparency , making sure that research data are accessible to the wider public as easily and quickly as possible .
… it is very important and people think that it is absolutely clear that that kind of data should be accessible ….
The backlash from scientists , though , continued .
E.g. on 16 February 2011 , Cambridge University held a seminar entitled “ What does the Freedom of Information Act mean for Research ? ” , with Baillie as the lead speaker .
The backlash , together with fallout from the Climategate scandal , led to the Royal Society ( which acts as the UK's Academy of Sciences ) launching a study on openness in science .
I talked with the person who was going to chair the study , Geoffrey Boulton .
Boulton made it clear that he wanted more exemptions put in the FoI Act and the EIR — exemptions strong enough to often prevent information from being disclosed .
I also talked with the president of the Royal Society , Sir Paul Nurse .
Nurse made it clear that he strongly advocated for what scientists wanted .
In May 2011 , US President Barack Obama visited the UK .
On 25 May 2011 , he and Prime Minister David Cameron issued a joint statement , saying inter alia , that they “ emphasized the importance of data sharing and open science data policies that support climate research and modelling ” ( UK version , US version ) .
After that , the backlash from scientists seemed to fade .
And the report from the study by the Royal Society , which was published in 2012 , unequivocally supported data openness .
Motivations for withholding data
Some people have asked why QUB does not want to disclose the data .
In fact , most tree - ring laboratories do not make their data available : it is not just QUB and Gothenburg that have been reluctant .
The reason for this was elucidated by Peter M. Brown , in April 2007 .
At the time , Brown was president of the Tree - Ring Society , which is the main international organization for tree - ring researchers .
The elucidation is here ; following is an excerpt .
… they ARE my data .
Funding agencies pay me for my expertise , my imagination , and my insights to be able to make some advance in our understanding of how nature works , not for raw data sets . …
It is the understanding and inferences supplied by the scientist that funding agencies are interested in , not her or his raw data .
In other words , even if the research and the researcher 's salary are fully paid for by the public — as is the case at QUB — the researcher still regards the data as his or her personal property .
Baillie confirmed this in an interview with Times Higher Education in July 2010 , saying “ As far as we were concerned , it was our data … the data belonged to the people who made the measurements ” .
There are a few tree - ring laboratories where attitudes are different .
One example is the University of St Andrews , in the UK .
Almost all tree - ring data held by St Andrews is freely available in the ITRDB .
It is notable that QUB continues to withhold data even though , in 2009 , the tree-ring laboratory at QUB was effectively closed .
The closure was primarily due to the lab lacking funds , which presumably resulted from having almost no research publications ( i.e. the lab had not been producing anything ; so funding agencies declined to support it ) .
The dearth of publications occurred even though the lab has some very valuable data on what is arguably the world 's most important scientific topic — global warming ( as outlined here ) .
This problem arises because the QUB researchers do not have expertise to analyze the data themselves and they do not want to share their data with other researchers who do .
The tree -ring data currently held by QUB primarily consists of the widths of the ( annual ) rings of trees .
Additional data could be obtained from the wood ( e.g. density , isotopic chemistry , etc. , of each ring ) , which would make the full data set even more valuable .
Given the great importance of global - warming studies , it would presumably have been easy for QUB to obtain funding to gather the additional data , as well as to analyze the full data set .
Doing that would have established QUB as a leading institution for the study of past climates .
In other words , that would have benefited QUB , benefited science , and given the importance of global warming , benefited the world .
Yet instead of doing that , QUB closed the lab .
Concluding remarks
It is now both the law and the accepted practice that , in the UK , data supporting published scientific research generally must be disclosed .
That should bring two main benefits : first , higher quality research , as researchers realize that their analyses can be thoroughly scrutinized ; second , improved cross-fertilization of science , as data is available to all interested researchers .
A handheld laser likened to a Star Wars lightsaber -- and so powerful it can instantly blind and " set fire to skin and other body parts " -- can be bought readily ( and inexpensively ) online .
The device -- with a beam 1,000 times stronger than sunlight on the skin -- is touted by makers as " the most dangerous laser ever created . "
And Wicked Lasers ' Spyder III Pro Arctic lasers cost less than $ 200 .
Trading standards chiefs in England said they were " seriously concerned " about the sale of the model in the country , and have warned against its use .
As well as blinding , burning and causing cancer , its Hong Kong - based maker admits that " a split - second laser light in a plane cockpit ( ... ) can be disastrous . "
Star Wars fans are among hundreds of people who have already shown an interest in buying the laser , for sale to the general public .
Laser safety expert John Colton , director of Lucid Optical Services , told Sky News Online that the lasers were " horrendously dangerous . "
" Under no circumstances should they be on sale on the Internet , " he said .
Colton said the 1W beam was 1,000 times stronger than laser pointers normally available to the public .
They could be " deadly " if aimed at car drivers or even pilots in planes , he added .
Wicked Lasers said the device would have cost thousands to build not long ago , but technological advances have made it available much more cheaply .
" This laser possesses the most burning capabilities of any portable laser in existence , " the website reads .
" That 's why it 's also the most dangerous laser ever created . "
The website goes on to warn that " extremely dangerous is an understatement to the power of 1W of laser power .
It will blind permanently and instantly and set fire quickly to skin and other body parts . "
It adds that users should use eye protection and must read and agree the " Laser Hazard Acknowledgment Form . "

A Florida Panhandle community that 's been victimized by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico says it can fight the destruction of its beaches and waterways better than the federal government -- but it 's left with one problem : " Who will pay the bill ?
Now that tar balls are washing ashore along the beaches of Okaloosa Island , county commissioners say it 's time to stop waiting for the federal government 's Unified Command Center to approve closing its East Pass -- the area leading to the docks of the profitable fishing village in the town of Destin .
“ Over the last 50 days , " Okaloosa County Commissioner Chairman Wayne Harris told FoxNews.com , " I like to say we played the game , if you will .
We did what we were required to do , which was wait for all the permitting processes and wait for all the permission ....
" Over that period of time , it was obvious to us that somebody in those levels were not communicating with each other . ”
Frustration started when the county devised a $ 9 million plan to implement an extensive boom system of barges and air curtains to close off all inlets and bayous from incoming oil .
But the government rejected that proposal and began reducing the number of areas a system would protect .
That , Harris says , is when the county decided to take matters into its own hands .
“ We were getting the bureaucratic shuffle , " he said .
" We could n’t wait for the bureaucratic process .
We could not wait for indecisiveness .
" This is our county , and our people depend on us to make decisions . ”
John Ward , public information officer for the Unified Command Center in Mobile , Ala. , says a 14,000 - foot boom system is being placed in nearby Choctawhatchee Bay this week .
But Okaloosa has already begun preparing to install its own boom system at East Pass , which also is combating an erosion problem .
For now , Harris says , the county is using credit cards to pay the tab .
He says the county has a limited reserve fund that can cover just one month of the cost of the system .
“ Now they ’re letting us do what we want to do , ” he said .
“ The dilemma is , doing what we want to do ... we ’ve stood the chance of not getting reimbursed . ”
And Okaloosa is n't alone in its decision to go it alone .
“ A lot of counties are going beyond what the Unified Command Center is doing … A lot of people are concerned about their counties , ” Ward says .
Harris says Okaloosa will file a claim with BP for the cost of its boom system , but it also hopes to use some of a $ 25 million grant BP has given the state of Florida to help pay for costs like $ 16,500 for the use of an air curtain each day and $ 850,000 each month for six barges .
Okaloosa is already hurting financially , as the oil spill has caused many tourists to cancel their summer vacations to the area .
The Breakers condominium on Okaloosa Island is 37 percent behind compared with the same time last year , says General Manager Kathy Houchins .
And by the end of this month , she said , that number probably will pass 50 percent .
Houchins , a board member on the county ’s Tourist Development Council , says the area ’s total loss is anywhere from 40 percent to 60 percent so far .
“ Cancellations are coming in left and right .
It does n’t take long for the word to get out , ” she said .
“ People are calling in saying , ‘ We are n’t going to vacation where there is oil at , we ’re just not going to fight that . ’ ”
July is the area 's busiest month for tourists , and the Breakers is usually at full occupancy .
But the resort , which has experienced more than a $ 100,000 loss in revenue so far , has laid off four employees and cut back its full - time workers ’ hours .
“ Right now , we are wide open for availability , ” Houchins says .
“ I ’ll bet you we ’re probably going to look at $ 700,000 or $ 800,000 loss in our season . ”
JOHANNESBURG , South Africa — South Africa may be the powerhouse economy of the continent but it lags far behind even other African countries when it comes to internet usage .
Going online in South Africa is expensive and frustratingly slow , perhaps best exemplified by the story of Winston the pigeon , who last year famously proved that it was faster to send data by carrier pigeon than on an ADSL line operated by South Africa ’s main web firm .
To the surprise of few internet users in South Africa , Winston flew a 4GB memory stick 60 miles in the same time the Telkom line had sent only 4 percent of the data .
But this may finally be changing .
A new study has found that the number of South Africans going online via broadband internet connections had grown by more than 50 percent in the past year , thanks to new undersea cables and the licensing of greater numbers of service providers that has started to result in cheaper , faster internet .
( Read about Sierra Leone 's efforts to connect to fiberoptic cables . )
After years of relatively stagnant growth , the number of internet users in South Africa jumped by 15 percent in 2009 , and is forecasted to grow by a similar rate in 2010 , according to the study by Johannesburg - based technology market research organization World Wide Worx and Cisco , the networking equipment firm .
There are now more than 5 million internet users in South Africa , or 10 percent of the population of 49.3 million .
“ It ’s people who are economically active and have computers but previously found it too expensive to come online , ” said Arthur Goldstuck , managing director of World Wide Worx .
Most of the growth in broadband internet came from small - and medium - sized businesses upgrading to ADSL , which in turn provided internet access to more than half a million South Africans working in offices who were not previously online .
The study also found that larger companies are increasingly giving 3G cards to their employees so that they can work outside the office , driving growth in wireless internet .
The number of wireless internet subscribers jumped by 88 percent in the past year , and high speed internet connections by 21 percent .
Despite having the largest GDP of any African country , South Africa ranks fourth in terms of the total number of internet connections , behind Egypt , Nigeria and Morocco .
“ We are below other African countries when we actually should be the leading African country , ” said Matthew Buckland , CEO of South Africa - based memeburn.com , which is focused on tech culture and innovation in the emerging market sector .
According to Buckland , South Africa is an “ underachiever ” when it comes to internet penetration given the size of its economy , because of the country ’s wide gap between rich and poor and the fact that the government has been slow to open up the country ’s telecom market .
“ We ’re a country of economic disparities , ” said Buckland .
Among the wealthy in South Africa , internet penetration is high , comparable to that of the developed world , but among the poor it is extremely low due to years of apartheid and underdevelopment of a large part of South Africa ’s population .
“ That ’s a legacy that we ’re still dealing with , ” he said .
The lack of competition in South Africa ’s telecom market has resulted in sky - high prices for internet and telephone services , but this is starting to change .
The Seacom undersea cable began operating last July , linking South Africa to East Africa , Asia and Europe by a fiber optic line designed to carry 1.28 terabytes per second .
Other similar cables that are expected to come online in the next few years will also help to greatly expand the amount of available bandwidth .
Meanwhile , changes in South Africa ’s licensing regime has resulted in a flurry of new internet service providers , resulting in more competitive internet packages for consumers .
One service provider last month for the first time began offering unlimited internet access at a relatively reasonable fixed monthly rate — a standard service in Western and Asian countries , but not in South Africa .
Usually consumers pay for a pre-determined amount of bandwidth a month that is restricted to a certain amount of local and international internet usage , and are cut off if they exceed the specified amount .
According to Buckland , the internet has until now been a medium for the middle class and elites , and outside the reach of the average South African .
“ This is all starting to change now , ” he said .
The country is seeing “ incredible growth ” in mobile internet , he said .
While internet and telephone services are expensive in South Africa , mobile data rates are among the cheapest in the world .
Mobile phone penetration in South Africa is close to 100 percent .
“ That is an exciting thing for the country because it means that for the first time the web has the potential to become a mass medium , via a mobile device , ” Buckland said .
But more users online will also mean that internet crimes will increase in South Africa .
Internet security analysts Symantec warned recently that South Africa will see a jump in internet crime linked to the World Cup — which kicks off in the country in June — targeting soccer fans booking tickets and hotels online .
This in combination with the increase in new broadband internet users will worsen internet security , according to Symantec .
The company explained in a report that “ malicious activity in a country tends to increase in relation to growth in broadband infrastructure .
One particular reason for this is because new users may be unaccustomed to , or unaware of , the increased risk of exposure to malicious attacks from such robust connections . ”
Faaaake .
a True Aussie always has a knife to deal with snakes with them .
They would simply cut then continue on after a jolly beer to be had .
It was an astonishing gamble that went off like clockwork .
A fleet of drivers were deployed to lay bets at more than 100 different bookies in an elaborate betting coup in the Republic that landed up to € 200,000 ( £ 165,659 ) .
The masterminds won the six - figure sum by paying a massive team to each back the winning horse with small stakes of € 200 ( £ 165 ) each , at long odds of as much as 14/1 .
And last night the Irish Bookmakers Association reluctantly saluted the audacious gamble , admitting : “ It 's a classic .
They did nothing illegal . ”
Businessman Douglas Taylor , the joint - owner of the horse at the centre of the plan , is understood to have reaped a share of the rewards .
Mr Taylor is managing director of recruitment company MCR , which is understood to have been involved in bringing together the people power to pull off the plan .
Up to 200 agency workers arrived at betting shops at 6.55 pm on Monday evening , when an alarm on a watch sounded the signal to place the bets on D Four Dave .
They were given strict instructions to be at the counter before the alarm went off .
They were told to tell staff they would take the odds available , which were as high as 14/1 before later falling to 5/1 .
If big money had been laid on the horse earlier in the day then the bookies would immediately have become wary and slashed odds on the horse .
But instead the gamble was landed in style , as drivers were dispatched by to more than 100 bookmakers in counties Dublin and Kildare .

Ladies and Gents ,
After all the hype , hoopla and speculation the 2010 NBA Draft finally graced us .
This year has undeniably ushered in one of the best dressed group of ballplayers , however will they be able to step up thier games and flourish in the next level ?
In comparison to years in the past this draft class is comparably weak and it was shown as teams like the Heat , Bulls and newly Russian owned New Jersey Nets ( or Nyets if you will … ) were trading back in the draft or shipping their picks to clear up some salary cap space .
As we all know this was done in preparation for the most anticipated free agent class in the history of sports .
Regardless of this draft being sub-par , specifically in the point guard category , there was still some overall value and lots of potential surrounding some of these players .
Ill provide my insight on the lottery picks of this years draft and will audit the effectiveness of how they can contribute to their squads .
CC has got you covered .
1. Wizards - John Wall , Point Guard , Kentucky
This was obviously not a shocker to anyone in MSG when his name was called .
Wall himself did n’t even flinch when commissioner Stern announced his name and walked up there without a nerve in his body .
He cracked a quick smile for a photo op and now hes ready to begin his legacy in the NBA .
He ’s an electrifying talent that is a hybrid between Rajon Rondo and Lebron James .
He is deadly in the transition game and will be able to burn just about any guard that is backpedaling trying to defend him .
He has great court vision and jump - out - the - gym athleticism .
He ’s gonna be a good one but Wall must show improvement in the half court aspect and work to improve his perimeter skills .
His game inside the arc is exceptional and has all the tools to be able to defend in the league .
2. Sixers - Evan Turner , Shooting Guard , Ohio State
Turner is a solid player that has improved his game drastically over his three years in college .
His basketball acumen and admirable court vision allowed him to play primarily at the point guard position at OSU .
He has the best versatility out of any player in this draft and will be able to defend three positions respectfully .
Turner ’s smarts and and offensive abilities will allow him to be a very good player in the NBA for a long time .
In terms of star potential , i’m not quite sure as he is n’t the best athlete must improve the consistency of his shot .
3. Nets - Derrick Favours , Power Forward , Georgia Tech
Favours is a 6 ’10 power forward with a long and athletic body .
This all ACC rookie of the year PF left Georgia Tech only after his freshmen year to pursue his dreams in the NBA .
Sounds familiar ?
A little like 2010 free agent Chris Bosh back in 2003 .
Now im not drawing to any comparisons but I do think Favours will be doing more than just favours for New Jersey .
His strength in the paint and respectable 15 foot jumper will allow him to make an immediate impact and his youth and room for development can surely allow Favours to see his name checked off on all star ballots .
4. Timberwolves - Wes Johnson , Small Forward , Syracuse
Minnesota should be pleased to be receiving the best SF in the class to meet their positional needs .
Johnson has bounce that is just plain sick .
His 37 inch vertical and 6 ’ 8 frame allows him to raise up and throw down spectacular dunks in the transition stages .
He is sweet shooting as well and will be able to stick the open mid-range or three consistently .
A knock on Johnson is that he did not have the ability to take over games and was very much a scorer within the “ system ” .
He should be able to fill in the small forward spot for the T - wolves , but his potential to be a premier scorer is questionable .
5. Kings - DeMarcus Cousins , Center , Kentucky
The addition of Cousins will directly create a nice one - two punch with their emerging star player , Tyreke Evans .
Cousins is just a monster at 6 ’10 , 270 and teams will need their own personal forklifts to get him out of the key .
He has a smooth free - throw range jumper and nimble feet for a man of his size .
Despite his past “ character issues ” I do not think he lacks maturity and desire to be a great player .
Look out for Mr .
Cousins and the Kings this year as I expect them to make a splash .
6. Warriors - Ekpe Udoh , Center / Forward , Baylor
To me this pick was a kinda surprising , but once it sunk in I realized this was a very strong pick that fills a huge need .
Even though the city by The Bay could have traded down to acquire
Udoh this is still a safe of a pick as you can get .
Udoh will bring a defensive presence that the Warriors have been missing since … well … always .
Udoh will block shots , rebound the ball for you and run down the floor like a thoroughbred .
This can hopefully derail opponents from dropping 105 to 110 points on a nightly basis .
With Udoh , a new logo and a decent free agent summer the Warriors can concievably turn their fortunes around .
7. Pistons - Greg Monroe , Center , Georgetown
This super sophomore is a great addition to the Pistons .
He is very crafty for a player for his position and will be able to contribute on both sides of the ball .
He is known as being the best big man passer in the last few drafts and this is an extreme positive as Monroe will be able to find shooters on the wing for open shots .
He is a good character pick and he will be able to provide an impact whether its off the bench or in the starting 5 .
8. Clippers - Al Farouq Aminu , Small Forward , Wake Forest
Al Farouq Aminu is one of the most intriguing players in the draft .
He is solid defensively with very active hands and makes many steals out in the perimeter from players that put the ball on the floor .
This draftee is one of the most athletic players in his class and loves finishing strong with 3 - point plays and dunks in the paint .
A negative about Aminu oddly enough is his personality , according to scouts .
During interviews and speaking with the media Al Farouq or “ The Chief has Arrived ” ( what his name translates to ) is a dud .
Speaking to him in person is the same as speaking to brick wall and many think that he does n’t have that ‘ chutspa ’ and killer instinct to live up to his potential and be a great player in this game .
9. Jazz - Gordon Hayward , Small Forward , Butler
The addition of Gordon Hayward for the Jazz was just another step in achieving their ultimate goal , a height not reached since the 1950 ’s , an all white professional basketball team … just kidding , but they were close in ’03
But on a serious note Hayward is a player that will fit right into the system and infuse the Jazz with quality minutes off the bench .
His real question mark will be , can he defend ?
I ’m not very sure of this as he ’s decent athletically but not superb .
However he plays the game with heart and will be able to contribute .
10 . Pacers - Paul George , Guard / Small Forward , Fresno State
George is one of my favorite players in the draft and is somewhat of a poor man ’s Joe Johnson .
Both players attended small exposure schools but were able to progressively improve their skills throughout their years at their respective Alma maters .
George has great size for his position and has a smooth stroke from anywhere on the floor .
His jumper is very fluid and his release is effortless and consistent every time down .
George is a player that has great abilities and intangibles and his only knock will be his adaptation to the talent gap from small school competition to the NBA .
I love this pick and I think he can be a premier scorer in the next level if he puts his work in .
11 . Hornets ( traded to Thunder ) - Cole Aldrich , Center , Kansas
Aldrich is nearly a mirror image of Greg Ostertag , former Jazz Center and GQ model .
Aldrich is will be a solid player that will control the paint defensively .
I can see him as a 8 pts , 8 reb and 2 blocks kind of player which is perfect for the Thunder .
Scoring from him will not be needed but the defensive presence is a necessity for him to get his minutes .
12 . Grizzlies - Xavier Henry , Shooting Guard , Kansas
The former Kansas Jayhawk , Henry , is a sweet shooting guard with an NBA body .
He is moderate athletically speaking , but he still shows the ability to defend the 2 spot at a high level .
He will have trouble finding time at the position unless former rookie of the year OJ Mayo is shifted to the point guard slot , which is a definite possibility .
He ’s a great addition to the already young Grizz .
13 . Raptors - Ed Davis , Power Forward , North Carolina
Davis has a long and skinny build which is something that he needs to work on .
What will make him an effective player in the raptors rotation is his hustle and high motor .
His ability to go after rebounds and 50/50 balls is what will keep him on the floor .
His overall game is very unpolished but hes known to have a good work ethic and is willing to put time in the gym to better himself .
He did n’t do anything special at the collegiate level , but Davis is a prospect that has a high ceiling and loads of potential .
14 . Rockets - Patrick Patterson , Power Forward , Kentucky
Patterson is a great fit for the Rockets and will be slid into the rotation from the get - go .
He is a tenacious rebounder and has the ability to be a double - double player .
In his Junior season at Kentucky his production decreased because he was on the floor with other great players like Cousins and Wall .
This took away from his touches on the floor and decreased his need to rebound the ball for the Wildcats .
Patterson is a very team oriented player that will do anything and make any adjustments for his team to win , Exhibit A ; his Junior season at UK .
He was an overlooked player in this draft even though he got picked at 14 and I like him as one of the top players in the 2010 class .
So there you have it , look out for these young ballplayers next season and lemme know what you think of the critiques …

People like food .
It fills you up , gives you a reason to leave your bed in the morning and tastes good … some of the time .
For those other times , when the stuff you ’re jamming into your greasy maw is n’t up to par but you ’re determined to eat it anyway , there are condiments .
Maybe you splash a half - ton of ranch dressing on some crummy French fries or slather a diabetic coma-inducing level of ketchup your overdone burger .
The point is , condiments can rescue an otherwise disastrous meal or jazz up an old favorite with just a little sugar or oil or spice .
Then there are these condiments .
For those not content with a little butter , there is a wide variety of disgusting things you can put on your food that can make even the most ironclad stomach churn .
And we ’re not just talking about those freaks that put ketchup on their macaroni and cheese .
Miracle Whip ( United States )
The miracle is that they get away with selling it in the grocery store .
Mayonnaise , like many condiments , is a “ love it or hate it ” affair .
While ketchup and mustard have enjoyed fairly even popularity across the demographics of western culture , mayo has consistently been viewed as the red- headed stepchild of the mainstream condiment family .
Considered a foodstuff for the extremely white or Canadian , the relatively simple concoction consists mostly of eggs , oil , some vinegar , and spices .
What ’s missing from that recipe ?
Well if you said lots of high glucose corn syrup , you might prefer the “ tangy zip ” of miracle whip .
The whiter - than - white stuff was invented in 1933 as a result of the Great Depression , which caused huge price increases in foods like eggs and oil .
The good people a Kraft realized that all they had to do was invent a new “ the emulsifying machine ” to blend mayo with cheap dressing and sugar to make an unholy goop that provided people with fewer calories at a marginally lower price .
Sure it makes Miracle Whip , but it can also turn out 250 mood rings every hour !
Well , that was the idea .
Just because the ingredients cost less did n’t stop the price from creeping up over time .
Also , according to the label , it ’s technically a salad dressing .
Try serving that one on romaine at your next dinner party .
2. Jeotgal ( Korea )
And this is only the part that goes on top of something else .
Have you ever been tucking into a nice seafood dinner and thought : this is good , but is there a way I could get this fishy taste on everything ?
In semi-liquid from ?
Two months from now ?
As it turns out , the people of Korea have had their best people working on the problem for thousands of years .
Whereas countries like America have many varieties of mustard or barbeque sauce , Korea has an entire range of fermented seafood sauces which vary based on what they let die in them and whether they bothered to cook it first .
While often used as a pickling agent in the popular dish kimchi , Jeotgal is also found adorning other dishes as well as being used for dipping delicacies like pig ’s feet or blood sausage .
Some varieties of Jeotgal may also differ only by when the product was harvested .
Apparently shrimp caught in May and shrimp caught in June taste completely different , even after you let them sit around in the Sun until August .
Other types of jeotgal use raw crab , oysters and fish eggs as bases .
Curiously , there is no Fido Jeotgal , even though dog meat is a consistently popular dish in Korea .
Although , now that I think about it … that looks pretty good .
3. Vegemite ( Australia )
… please do n’t be made of termites .
With the exception of shrimp laden “ barbies ” , skin cancer or crocodiles and the men that hunt them , there ’s nothing more stereotypically Australian than Vegemite .
The salty , savory paste is commonly consumed while spreading over toast or on bread as part of a sandwich .
“ The Veg ” , as nobody calls it , provides an incredibly rich source of B vitamins and fodder for comedy writers .
It ’s made by a process that involves spices , yeasty slush from beer - making that would otherwise go to feed to cattle and a lot of salt .
In case that was n’t unappetizing enough , it comes in the form of sticky black tar .
Another acquisition of the Kraft corporation , Vegemite was invented ( read : ripped off ) in 1922 when a very similar product called Marmite became difficult to import .
Initially , the product underperformed its competitor when imports resumed but eventually became accepted as a cultural icon .
It is also noted to have a milder or “ blander ” taste than the original .
On the other hand , Australia has done some things right in the past .
Choosing Vegemite over Marmite is , therefore , an important step towards consuming “ food ” that does n’t taste like industrial byproducts .
4. Hair Soy Sauce ( China )
Looks pretty good !
Must have come from a brunette .
While the Chinese are n’t the first or only ones to pull this stunt , they have been caught most recently .
Soy sauce , a staple of a number of Asian cuisines , is made from fermenting soybeans .
It can also be produced chemically , though this produces a lower quality product that even the same Chinese who produce poison baby formula look down on .
Most of the taste in soy sauce there because the fermentation process releases amino acids from the beans .
As it turns out , those same amino acids can be found in human hair .
The concept of hair sauce has been around for over half a century , stemming from food shortages during WWII .
If you were thinking to yourself : “ Hey , if it tastes the same , who cares ? ” then you ’ve probably not considered the repercussions and complications of acquiring human hair .
Hair has to come from somewhere , namely barbershops and hospitals .
In the case of the Chinese sauce , there may also be a heapin ’ helpin ’ of other medical wastes mixed in there ( possibly for flavor ) .
Toss in a number of cancer - causing chemicals required to produce the required proteins , and you have something not even the workers who made it were willing to consume .
No , I could n’t possibly eat another bite .
I ’ll take the rest to go .
And you thought you just had to worry whether that was real chicken in the Kung - pow .
The ability to diagnose and treat brain dysfunction without surgery , may rely on a new method of noninvasive brain stimulation using pulsed ultrasound developed by a team of scientists led by William " Jamie " Tyler , a neuroscientist at Arizona State University .
The approach , published in the journal Neuron on June 9 , shows that pulsed ultrasound not only stimulates action potentials in intact motor cortex in mice but it also " elicits motor responses comparable to those only previously achieved with implanted electrodes and related techniques , " says Yusuf Tufail , the lead author from ASU 's School of Life Sciences .
Other techniques such as transcranial magnetic and deep brain stimulation , electroconvulsive shock therapy and transcranial direct current stimulation are used to treat a range of brain dysfunctions , including epilepsy , Parkinson 's disease , chronic pain , coma , dystonia , psychoses and depression .
However , most of these approaches suffer from " critical weaknesses , " Tyler says , including requirements for surgery , low spatial resolution or genetic manipulations .
Optogenetics , for example , is one state - of - the - art technology that merges genes from plants and other organisms with the intact brains of animals to offer control of neural circuitry .
" Scientists have known for more than 80 years that ultrasound can influence nerve activity , " observes Tufail .
" Pioneers in this field transmitted ultrasound into neural tissues prior to stimulation with traditional electrodes that required invasive procedures .
Those studies demonstrated that ultrasound pre-treatments could make nerves more or less excitable in response to electrical stimulation .
" In our study , however , we used ultrasound alone to directly stimulate action potentials and drive intact brain activity without doing any kind of surgery , " Tufail says .
" It is fascinating to witness these effects firsthand , " he adds .
Tufail is one of four doctoral students in ASU 's School of Life Sciences who worked with Tyler on the project .
The team also included Alexei Matyushov , an physics undergraduate student in ASU 's Barrett Honors College working with Tyler , and Nathan Baldwin , a doctoral student in bioengineering , and Stephen Helms Tillery , an assistant professor , with ASU 's Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering .

" We knew from some of our previous work that ultrasound could directly stimulate action potentials in dishes containing slices of brain tissue , " says Tyler .
" Moving to transmit ultrasound through the skin and skull to stimulate the intact brain inside a living animal posed a much greater challenge . "
Despite such challenges , the study shows how ultrasound can be used to stimulate brain circuits with millimeter spatial resolution .
" We 've come a long way from the observations of Scribonius Largus , a Roman physician in the 1st century A.D. who placed electric torpedo fish on headache sufferers ' foreheads to ease their pain , " Tyler quips .
" Our method paves the way for using sound waves to study and manipulate brain function , as well as to diagnose and treat its dysfunction . "
In addition to advancing hope for noninvasive treatments of brain injury and disease , the groups ' experiments in deeper subcortical brain circuits also revealed that ultrasound may be useful for modifying cognitive abilities .
" We were surprised to find that ultrasound activated brain waves in the hippocampus known as sharp - wave ripples , " Tufail says .
" These brain activity patterns are known to underlie certain behavioral states and the formation of memories . "
The scientists also found that ultrasound stimulated the production of brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) in the hippocampus -- one of the most potent regulators of brain plasticity .

Tyler says the fact that ultrasound can be used to stimulate action potentials , meaningful brain wave activity patterns , and BDNF leads him to believe that , in the future , ultrasound will be useful for enhancing cognitive performance ; perhaps even in the treatment of cognitive disabilities such as mental retardation or Alzheimer 's disease .
Tyler 's students have also collected data that suggests that repeated exposure to low intensity ultrasound does not pose a health risk to rodents .
" We examined many aspects of brain health following stimulation and found that low - intensity ultrasound is safe for repeatedly stimulating the brains of mice , " noted Anna Yoshihiro , a neuroscience doctoral student in ASU 's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and co-author of the journal article .
Yoshihiro works to treat Parkinsonian monkeys and has achieved some early success in treating epileptic seizures in mice using ultrasonic neuromodulation .
Monica Li Tauchmann , Yoshihiro 's contemporary and co-author on the article , recalls the first time the method worked : " I was helping with experiments .
We were trying to stimulate the brain of a living mouse with ultrasound .
Not a whole lot was happening at first .
Then , Dr. Tyler changed some of the ultrasound waveform parameters and the mouse started moving .
We spent the rest of that day repeating the stimulation and the mouse was perfectly fine .
It recovered from anesthesia as if nothing had happened .
I think we were all astonished . "
Tyler believes that there are a host of potential applications for ultrasound in brain manipulation .
Besides basic science and medical uses , ultrasound represents a core platform around which future brain - machine interfaces can also be designed for gaming , entertainment and communication purposes because of its noninvasive nature .
" Space travel , hand - held computers , the Internet , and global positioning -- not even a lifetime ago these things were mere science fiction .
Today , they are commonplace , " Tyler says .
" Maybe the next generation of social entertainment networks will involve downloading customized information or experiences from personalized computer clouds while encoding them into the brain using ultrasound .
I see no reason to rule out that possibility . "
" To be honest , " he adds , " we simply do n't know yet how far we can push the envelope .
That is why many refer to the brain as the last frontier -- we still have a lot to learn . "
ONCE a jolly baggie man camped for a bigger bong , under the shade of a coolabah tree .
Smoking weed is as Australian as the annual Bong Bong Picnic Race Club Race Meeting in Bowral , so it is disconcerting to observe that mere possession of marijuana is still a criminal offence in most states .
Drug dogs run wild in Kings Cross , city and Darlinghurst nightclubs , sitting down next to poor possessors they have sniffed out .
People walking out of the local railway station can be tracked down by an addicted dachshund or labrador and be legally searched .
Sniffer dogs do not seem to be the ideal or fair way to catch the Mr Bigs of baggies .
Outdoor concerts are ruined by packs of dogs running like pelted torpedoes through crowds of partygoers .
In California there seem to be more outlets for cannibusiness – dispensaries , co-operatives , wellness clinics and taxi delivery services – than all the Starbucks , McDonald 's and 7 - Eleven stores in the state combined .
Since November 1996 , when Proposition 215 ( the Compassionate Act ) was voted into law , the number of medical marijuana dispensaries in California has skyrocketed to more 800 .
There were only 183 in 2007 .
In case the dispensary is too far away , or you are too stoned to go out and get weed , a secondary industry has developed in which couriers are employed to deliver it to your door , like pizza .
Given grass 's propensity to give one the munchies , this is a handy way to kill two birds using one stone .
This semi-legality is based on the proposition that a medical recommendation that the patient / user would benefit from medical marijuana .
On the state level in California the doctor , the dispenser and the user are protected from criminal process , if these conditions are met .
In November voters in California can pass legislation to regulate and tax production and sale to persons 21 or older .
But it prohibits smoking in schools or public places .
The proposal has been certified by California Secretary of State Debra Bowen .
Under federal US law , medical users and providers in California are still vulnerable but there is no political or legal will to prosecute .
Under the November proposition , the will of the federal government and policing authorities will be further tested .
Lawyers believe federal law trumps state law but the invocation of states ' rights to leave their grass smokers alone , in a Republican state under Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , is staggering .

Sick of the barrage of Facebook privacy scandals ?
Do n't trust a multi-billion - dollar corporation with your photos and personal information ?
Well , there may be an online social network for you yet .
It 's called Diaspora , and it's an idea from four New York University students who say in a video pitch that big online companies like Facebook should n't be allowed to have access to , and to some degree " own , " all of the personal data that flows in and out of their social networks .
The site , which is still in development , has been dubbed " the anti-Facebook " by tech blogs .
The solution sounds a little wonky : Diaspora basically enables computers to share updates , photos and videos directly with each other .
It eliminates the middleman , i.e. Facebook , Flickr , Google or Twitter , so no one has access to your data but you and your friends .
To set things up this way , each user has to have server space .
In Diaspora - speak , these machines are called " seeds . "
But , despite the potential technical confusion , the result , the site 's founders say , is a fully private and secure network , without cutting down on the " sharing " aspect of the internet , which is such a trend at the moment .
" Social networks have only really existed for 10 years , " one of the Diaspora founders says in a video introduction .
" We do n’t know what ’s going to happen to our data .
It ’s going to exist into the foreseeable future .
We need to take control of it . "
" Because once you give it away once it ’s no longer yours .
You can not stake claim to it , " another chimes in .
Diaspora 's founders - who look kind of like they jumped out of " Revenge of the Nerds , " and , according to NYTimes.com , consider themselves to be pretty nerdy - posted their idea on the crowd - funding site Kickstarter to get money for the venture .
If you 're not familiar with Kickstarter , it 's a site where people post information about their projects and ask random members of the internet for funding .
So far , about 900 people have contributed a total of nearly $ 29,000 .
That 's more than the $ 10,000 the Diaspora founders said they needed to start the site .
ReadWriteWeb says that the way Diaspora works may confuse some general users .
But , the blog notes , Diaspora may offer a paid service that would be simpler to use .
Positioning itself as the anti-Facebook may help , too :
" If Diaspora is realized , it will be up to technology advocates to position the turn - key service in a way that will make it sound simple and appealing to precisely those sorts of mainstream users if it is to ever succeed .
Taking shots at Facebook 's privacy issues may be a good course ( Take back control with Diaspora ! ) , " the blog writes .
" We would like to see Diaspora come to be , even if it never goes mainstream , because it would finally offer privacy advocates a real alternative to the increasingly data - hungry Facebook . "
Check out Project Diaspora 's website and let us know what you think .
Mark Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook in 2004 out of his Harvard dorm room ; it now has 400 million users worldwide .
Is it too late for a challenger ?
Or do the latest privacy concerns leave it vulnerable ?

Beijing , China ( CNN ) --
More than a week after their coal mine in northern China was flooded by a rush of underground water , 115 miners were pulled out alive Monday , China 's state - run TV reported .
Rescuers worked to reach another 38 believed to be still trapped inside .
CCTV , which carried the rescue efforts live , showed the miners being brought out in stretchers to loud cheers .
The workers were wrapped in blankets and rushed to ambulances where they were in stable condition , local media said .
The miners were part of a larger group of 261 working in the Wangjialing mine when it flooded March 28 .
Rescuers were able to reach 108 miners immediately after the flooding .
Monday 's rescue , which began shortly after midnight , comes two days after tapping was heard from within the mine .
Late Sunday night , rescuers noticed swaying lamp lights inside the mine -- indicating signs of life , the state - run Xinhua news agency said .
Some of the miners attached their mining belts to shaft walls as water first rushed in .
They remained suspended for three days until a mining cart floated by and they jumped in , CCTV said .
Two hundred people , as part of 50 rescue groups , were working around - the - clock to drain water , monitor gas and pull out miners , said Wang Jun , governor of Shanxi province where the mine is situated .
" So far the coordination is in order , the effect is obvious , " he told CCTV .
Mine accidents are common in China .
In 2009 , 2,631 people were killed in such accidents .
The figure , while high , is down from 2002 when 6,995 people died .
On Monday , the country launched a two - month campaign to inspect safety regulations in mines and other industries that have had serious accidents .
The Associated Press reports , “ Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen is saying that a saw has become stuck as it was cutting through a pipe on a busted well , stalling the latest attempt to contain the Gulf oil gusher . ”
The AP adds , “ Allen said Wednesday the goal is to free the saw and finish the cut later in the day .
This is the second major cut in the effort to contain Ã¢â‚¬â€ not plug Ã¢â‚¬â€ the nation ’s worst spill . ”

Oil closes in on Florida coast
The giant Gulf of Mexico oil slick was Wednesday closing in on the pristine Florida coast , as deep sea robotic submarines worked on BP ’s latest bid to contain the spill .
Forecasters said it was virtually certain Florida ’s panhandle , a major draw for tourists from around the world , would be hit by the spill this week .
A Florida official told AFP the latest official projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) show the slick to be about seven miles ( 11 kilometers ) off the state ’s shores .
Advertisement : Story continues below
“ Within the next 72 hours it should affect our coast , ” the official with Florida ’s Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday .
Florida would be the fourth state hit by the oil since an April 20 explosion ripped through the Deepwater Horizon rig , 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) off the Louisiana coast , killing 11 workers .
The BP - operated rig sank two days later .

More than 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) of Louisiana coast has since been contaminated by the oil , which has also been spotted on Alabama and Mississippi shores , amid fears for the region ’s already endangered wildlife .
With the ribbons of oil spreading , US officials extended new fishing restrictions , with about one - third of the Gulf of Mexico off limits .
NOAA said the ban was expanded “ to capture portions of the slick moving into waters off eastern Alabama and the western tip of the Florida panhandle , as well as some large patches of sheen moving onto the west Florida shelf and southward to Cuban waters . ”

As the British energy giant battles to contain the six - week spill now the worst in US history , robotic submarines succeeded late Tuesday in making the first clean cut to the end of the fractured pipe .
The next step will be to try to cap the end of the pipeline and then siphon the oil to a containment ship on surface .
ADVERTISEMENT
Underwater robots cut away pipes around the main riser pipe , and then moved in with a diamond wire cutter to cleanly sever the main riser pipe , officials said .
BP ’s chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the cap should be installed on the pipe later Wednesday , but acknowledged that until it is in place the flow of oil into the Gulf would likely increase by as much as 20 percent .
The US government has estimated the flow of oil before the riser was cut away at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day — meaning at least 20 million gallons have poured into the Gulf since April .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I think if this works , we should capture the vast majority of the flow , ” Suttles said on CNN Tuesday .
“ We ca n’t say it ’ll capture all of it , because it ’s not a tight mechanical seal , but if it functions well it should capture the vast majority of the flow . ”
As BP works to drill two relief wells to permanently stop the leak which will not be in place until August , US officials on Tuesday said the environmental disaster now was the subject of a criminal probe .
In New Orleans , Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters his office “ will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who has violated the law . ”

Holder said the criminal probe began “ some weeks ago ” but declined to elaborate on what kind of charges could be brought and against whom .
US President Barack Obama has also threatened to take legal action against those to blame , saying the government had an “ obligation ” to determine the cause of the “ greatest environmental disaster of its kind in our history . ”
“ If our laws were broken leading to this death and destruction , my solemn pledge is that we will bring those responsible to justice on behalf of the victims of this catastrophe and the people of the Gulf region , ” Obama vowed .
BP shares plunged 13 percent on Tuesday , wiping off 12 billion pounds ( 17.6 billion US dollars ) off its market value after a string of failures to plug the leak .
The company also acknowledged that it spent a billion pounds on dealing with the disaster .

Tuesday ’s official start of the hurricane season has worsened the outlook for Gulf residents , amid warnings the 2010 storm season will be more than active than usual , with up to 14 hurricanes .

Very interesting look at notable examples of product placement in the movies .
Product placement is fully entrenched at all levels of the entertainment industry as an effective way to manage risk , and it remains an area of tension and debate between creatives and executive producers .
On The Rig , we worked out a deal with an energy drink company to feature their products in the film , by showing the roughnecks on the rig using the drinks to stay awake during the long night of the storm .
We had a producer on set whose main task was to make sure the label on the drinks could be seen in the shots .
It was something that made sense at the time because of our low budget , but over the course of production we realized how distracting and artificial the scenes that included product placement started to feel .
Watching them , you ’d stop paying attention to the characters and start noticing the energy drinks ( the ugly bright colors of the label design did n’t help ) .
We finally made the decision to give the product placement money back and cut around the product shots in the scenes with the drinks .
A few still remain , but for the most part it ’s no longer noticeable or distracting .
The movie is better as a result .

A BP report tersely described the results : “ No indication of movement . ”
But engineers could not be absolutely sure .
Without any way to see into the blowout preventer , engineers had essentially been operating blind , using the rate of oil flow , for example , to deduce the conditions inside .
Help came from Scott Watson , an expert in gamma ray imaging at Los Alamos National Laboratory .
Gamma rays , a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to X - rays but higher in energy , might at least penetrate a few inches into the blowout preventer ’s thick steel walls .
Then engineers might be able to see a device called a wedge lock , which slides into place behind the shear ram to hold it closed .
In mid-May , Mr. Watson ventured to the well site , where robotic submersibles were sent down to the seafloor with cobalt 60 , a radioactive isotope that generates gamma rays .
The team from Los Alamos was able to get a clear view of only one half of the blind shear ram .
But the images showed one wedge lock fully engaged , meaning at least one half of the shear ram had deployed .
“ I do n’t think anybody who saw the pictures thought it was ambiguous , ” Mr. Watson said .
It was a crushing moment .
Engineers realized that all their efforts to revive the blowout preventer had probably never budged the critical component at the machine ’s core , the blind shear ram .
They had assumed that at some point early on , the blades had tried to close .
They had hoped to close them all the way .
But now , the gamma ray images showed that at least one blade was fully deployed , and they had run out of options for forcing the other one closed .
Continuing to push on the ram ’s pistons with more hydraulic fluid would achieve nothing .
The last line of defense was a useless carcass of steel .
False Sense of Security
Barely three weeks before the Deepwater Horizon disaster , President Obama announced that he planned to open vast new tracts of ocean for oil exploration , including environmentally sensitive areas that for decades had been declared off limits by presidents from both parties .
Environmental groups were bitterly disappointed , but Mr. Obama said he had arrived at his decision after more than a year of study by his administration , including a careful weighing of environmental risks .
Yet the administration ’s examination did not question the oil industry ’s confident assertions about its drilling technology .
The well - known weaknesses of blowout preventers and blind shear rams simply did not make it onto the administration ’s radar , interviews and documents show .
Image caption Many Spaniards have not welcomed the austerity measures
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has raised fresh concerns about Spain 's economy , saying " far - reaching " reforms are needed to ensure its recovery .
It said the country faced " severe " challenges , including the need to urgently reform a " dysfunctional " labour market , and its banking sector .
The IMF 's comments came after Spanish authorities had to rescue regional lender Cajasur at the weekend .
Last week , Spain 's government passed austerity measures to cut its deficit .
It is not the first time that the IMF has said Spain needs economic reform , but the language has a much greater sense of urgency Andrew Walker , BBC economics correspondent
This deficit - the money the administration has to borrow to pay for public services due to insufficient tax returns and other revenues - currently equates to 11 % of Spain 's economic output .
This is substantially higher than the eurozone ceiling of 3 % and another concern that the IMF has highlighted .
It also pointed to Spain 's property market slump , heavy indebtedness in the private sector , and weak productivity and competitiveness .
' Bluntly '
" It is not the first time that the IMF has said Spain needs economic reform , but the language has a much greater sense of urgency , " said BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker .
" The IMF says bluntly , the Spanish labour market is not working and needs reform of pay bargaining and lower payments for fired workers . "
Last week , the Spanish government approved a 15bn euro austerity plan , including a 5 % cut to public sector salaries , as it aims to reduce its deficit .
Spain is also having to cope with unemployment of more than 20 % .
Concerns about the Spanish economy have to be seen in the light of the recent financial crisis in Greece , which has a deficit amounting to 13.6 % of GDP .
Amid fears that Greece could default on its debt payments and that the crisis could spread to Spain , the 27 member states of the European Union and the IMF joined together to agree an emergency package worth 750bn euros ( $ 975bn ; £ 650 bn ) .
This includes access to 440bn euros of loan guarantees for struggling nations , and 60bn euros of emergency European Commission funding .
The remaining 250bn euros comes from the IMF .
Why do we like this ?
Given the tempo shared by both songs , it does n't take much to realize that mashing together Radiohead 's " 15 Step " with Dave Brubeck 's " Take Five " makes perfect sense .
But upon hitting play , the beauty of these two tracks intertwining becomes quickly evident .
Overall : A+ , worth re-sharing .
Roughly five million liters of dispersants have now been used to break up the oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico , making this the largest use of such chemicals in U.S. history .
If it continues for 10 months , as long as Mexico 's Ixtoc 1 blowout in 1979 in the same region , the Macondo well disaster has a good chance of achieving the largest global use of these chemicals , surpassing 10 million liters .
And there is no doubt that dispersants are toxic :
Both types of the dispersal compound COREXIT used in the Gulf so far are capable of killing or depressing the growth of a wide range of aquatic species , ranging from phytoplankton to fish .
" It 's a trade - off decision to lessen the overall environmental impact , " explained marine biologist Jane Lubchenco , director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , at a press conference on May 12 .
" When an oil spill occurs , there are no good outcomes . "
The trade - off in this case is the addition of toxic chemicals in a bid to protect the marshes of Louisiana and the beaches of Florida .
But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , for one , has become concerned about the toxicity of the most - used dispersant at the Gulf of Mexico spill — COREXIT 9500 — and ordered BP to look at alternatives .
( COREXIT 9527 was used earlier during the spill , but it was discontinued because it was considered too toxic . )
The problem ?
The EPA 's industry - generated data is unclear as to the relative toxicity of various dispersants .
" If you think the data on COREXIT is bad , try to find any decent toxicology data on the alternatives , " says toxicologist Carys Mitchelmore of the University of Maryland 's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory , who helped write a 2005 National Research Council ( NRC ) report on dispersants .
" I could n't compare and contrast which one was more toxic than the other based on that . "
Dispersed oil
Both COREXIT 9500 and 9527 are produced by Naperville , Ill. –based Nalco , a company better known for its water purification work with the oil industry .
" For every barrel of oil produced , 3.5 barrels of water are produced , " explains chemist Mani Ramesh , chief technology officer for Nalco .
" That needs to be treated before it can be released .
That water treatment has been a core area for us . "
But at the same time Nalco keeps busy cleaning the oil industry 's water , it also provides COREXIT , a product to minimize the impact of any oil that spills into the water .
Developed in a joint venture with ExxonMobil , the compound is largely made at facilities in Sugarland , Tex. , and Garyville , La .
The company expects to sell some $ 40 - million worth of COREXIT as a result of the latest spill .
" What the dispersant process enables is to prevent the oil from reaching the shore and converts that oil to easy food for naturally occurring microbes , " Ramesh says .
" If the oil reaches the shore the decomposition rate of oil is so low it would remain on the shore for probably 100 years . "
By last week , the EPA and Nalco had both released the ingredient list for COREXIT 9500 in response to widespread public concern .
Its constituents include butanedioic acid ( a wetting agent in cosmetics ) , sorbitan ( found in everything from baby bath to food ) , and petroleum distillates in varying proportions — and it decomposes almost entirely in 28 days .
" All six [ ingredients ] are used in day - to - day life — in mouthwash , toothpaste , ice cream , pickles , " Ramesh argues .
" We believe COREXIT 9500 is very safe . "
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees , noting in a document for health professionals that " the dispersants contain proven , biodegradable and low - toxicity surfactants , " which are " detergentlike " and " in low toxicity solvents . "
However , those solvents — petroleum distillates — are also known animal carcinogens , according to toxicology data , and make up 10 to 30 percent of a given volume of COREXIT .
And those same everyday products can be deadly to wildlife .
" It 's the same products in Dawn dishwasher soap , " Mitchelmore notes , which is being used widely to clean up oiled birds and other animals .
" I would n't want to put a fish in Dawn dishwashing soap either .
That would kill it . "
As a result , the EPA ordered BP to stop spraying dispersants on the oil slick on May 26 .
The EPA also ordered BP to look for less toxic alternatives on May 20 , and the company responded in a letter dated that same day that " BP continues to believe that COREXIT EC9500A is the best alternative . "
The dispersant continues to be sprayed onto the ongoing oil spill .
No alternative
One reason BP can make such claims is due to a lack of clear data on any of the alternative dispersants .
As part of the National Contingency Plan required for offshore drilling , one of 18 EPA - approved dispersants must be on hand to handle spilled oil .
Each of those dispersants has been preapproved for use , and each of those dispersants has been tested — by the companies that make them — for toxicity using representative species of estuarine shrimp ( Mysidopsis bahia ) and fish ( Menidia beryllina ) .
Specifically , these animals are exposed to a mix of one liter of dispersant for every 10 liters of heavy fuel oil in water .
Yet , the results of those tests vary wildly , from toxic impacts occurring at levels of just 2.6 parts per million for COREXIT to 100 ppm for another dispersant , NOKOMIS 3 - F4 .
That suggests to experts that the tests which showed lower toxicity may have employed heavy fuel oil that had lost its potency .
After all , volatile organic compounds in oil evaporate quickly when exposed to air and can even wash off in water .
" These are order of magnitude differences , " Mitchelmore notes .
" A lot of that can relate to how those tests were set up . "
Adds Nalco toxicologist Sergio Alex Villalobos , " If the oil is aged , then the oil loses its toxicity .
Using an oil that is not very toxic , if you disperse that oil you are going to get very favorable numbers .
Do those numbers really exist ? "
EPA , for its part , did not show the best understanding of toxicological data in making its recommendations , urging BP to use dispersants with less than a certain cutoff of toxicity ( pdf ) .
Of course , in toxicology the lower the concentration the more toxic a given substance is .
" They completely got that wrong , " Mitchelmore says .
EPA is now undertaking its own toxicology testing of COREXIT and Louisiana crude oil , but results are pending .
Nevertheless , just 20 ppm of COREXIT 9500 — or one drop in 2.5 liters of water — inhibits growth of Skeletonema costatum , a Gulf of Mexico diatom , according to toxicology test data presented in the 2005 NRC report .
It appears to inhibit the phytoplankton 's ability to perform photosynthesis , specifically blocking part of the biochemistry that enables the photosystem II complex , Villalobos says .
" Skeletonema seems to fall among the most sensitive ones , " he says .
" Like many aquatic plants , these are organisms that are resilient , that tend to come back even though you wipe them out in some cases chemically . "
COREXIT is also not approved for use in U.K. waters because it fails the so - called " limpet test " .
That test involves spraying the dispersant and oil on rocks and seeing if limpets ( a type of small mollusk ) can still cling to them , a test which COREXIT and many other dispersants with slippery surfactants fail .
" This is not a product for rocky shores , " Villalobos says .
" These are only for open sea waters . "
Novel use
Of course , in the case of the oil spewing from BP's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico , COREXIT is being used in another unapproved way .
A wand from one of the remote - operated robots has sprayed more than 1.5 million liters of dispersants directly onto the escaping oil and natural gas roughly 1,500 meters beneath the ocean 's surface .
" I do n't think anybody knows what would happen by applying the dispersants at depth , " Ramesh says .
" We do not have any knowledge that would allow us to predict what would happen . "
In addition to creating subsurface plumes ( and providing a rich feast for oil - eating microbes ) , it remains unclear what kind of dosage of dispersed oil sea life throughout the water column is facing .
NOAA measurements show that levels reach 100 ppm of dispersed oil in the first half - meter of water , dropping to 12.5 ppm at 10 meters and unknown levels even deeper .
" There is n't any information on what is the environmentally relevant level of dispersant , " Mitchelmore notes .
" Dispersed oils are going to be toxic , particularly in the top 10 meters that contains all the sensitive life stages .
Anything that has sensitive membranes can be affected by dispersants and dispersed oil . "
Sunlight falling on the dispersed oil may make the problem worse through a phenomenon known as phototoxicity .
Compounds in the oil act as a catalyst to transfer some of the sun 's energy into oxygen , converting the latter to a more reactive state that can literally burn up cells .
And as fish and other sea life ingest the dispersed oil , it can be broken down into more toxic by - products .
" What do these things break down into ? " Mitchelmore says .
" In toxicology it 's quite often not the original compound that 's the toxic entity . "
Ultimately , the problem is that too little is known about the dispersants and the dispersed oil .
" Given that this is a billion - dollar industry , why were those data gaps not filled ? "
Mitchelmore asks .
" The whole issue regarding limited toxicity data — that 's not just common to dispersants , that 's common to tens of thousands of chemicals we 're putting out into the environment daily . "
After all , it was only after decades of using bisphenol A , polybrominated flame retardants and other chemicals that significant concerns began to manifest .
In effect , usage replaced safety testing — and that 's exactly what is happening with dispersants and the massive spill in the Gulf .
Different regulation of chemicals and the chemical industry might forestall toxicological mysteries like those surrounding dispersants — and their thousands of chemical cousins — in the future .
" We 're using an awful lot of dispersants , " said EPA administrator Lisa Jackson during the same May 12 press briefing on the chemical 's use at which NOAA 's Lubchenco spoke .
" This is going on longer than one might have known on day three or four .
We 're still dealing with a constant release of fresh oil and we need to continue to disperse . "
My curiosity into fractals was piqued by a full - length film on Google Video called Hunting the Hidden Dimension .
Then I began exploring the web for examples of fractal and generative art .
My search led me to an ex-physicist named Tom Beddard whose site is a virtual cornucopia of 3D fractals , butterfly curves , generative structures and videos of Mandelbulb fractals .
Beddard creates simulations using Adobe After Effects , allowing one to experience the intricacies and geometric beauty of fractals .
The work he does is truly inspiring as it gets as close as possible to the intersection between mathematics and art .
Both the right and left brain are stimulated by the infinite possibilities rendered in these visual wonders .
Beddard took an interest in Guilloché patterns after reading about them on the blog , Ministry of Type .
He explains that “ Guilloché machines ( also known as geometric lathes ) have been used since the 17th century by watchmakers and goldsmiths , such as Fabergè , for ornamentation . ”
Using a set of equations , he built a flash application to experiment with different parameters .
You can visit this page and create your own Guilloché patterns .
Set to the atmospheric music of We Are The Formula , this is a wild fractal video where our 3D view of the Mandlebulb fractal creates the illusion of being inside the space of its structure .
According to Beddard , the video was made from “ two sequences of continuously morphing Mandelbulb fractals . ”
He achieves this effect by using a plugin he developed for Adobe After Effects .
About Mandelbulbs , which I had never heard of before , Beddard writes , “ Mandelbulbs are a new class of 3D Mandelbrot fractals .
Unlike many other 3D fractals the Mandelbulb continues to reveal finer details the closer you look . ”
This is a fascinating simulation which produces examples of the Gumowski - Mira pattern .
Beddard tells us that the Gumowski-Mira was developed to calculate the trajectories of sub-atomic particles .
He continues , “ Its nonlinear nature creates a wide variety of organic looking images ranging from galaxies to feathers and marine - like creatures to the cross-section of fruit . ”
The application allows you to move your cursor over the patterns and watch them zoom , transform , and cause a number of parameters to change .
According to Beddard , the “ harmonograph was a 19th century curiosity for visualising the mathematics of music . ”
He describes an example of a harmonograph where two pendulums swing at right angles of each other , and a pen attached to the pendulums traces shapes on a piece of paper based upon the relative swinging frequencies .
In Beddard ’s interactive harmonograph , we can set the amplitude , x and y ratios , spin phase , and various other parameters .
When you check the boxes beside the parameters , the harmongraph simulation moves side to side as a pendulum would , responding to the exact changes you ’ve made .
The recursive images and patterns that made MC Escher famous are explored by Beddard with a filter he created for After Effects and Photoshop CS4 .
You can download this filter on his website .
In an interesting blog post about Escher ’s Droste Effect , he describes the process of how the technique was developed and expanded upon .
He writes , “ ( MC Escher ) only got so far with pen and paper leaving an enigmatic white centre .
It was n’t until the Dutch mathematician , Hendrik Lenstra , worked out the maths behind the image transformation that the complete effect could be visualised . ”

Stabenow : Republicans in ‘ Cynical Game ’ to Crater Economy by Stopping Jobs Bill
Created : June 24 , 2010 14:55 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) ( Zuma Press )
Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) , whose state has the second - highest unemployment rate in the country , just held a conference call with reporters , in which she expressed her belief that Republicans have cynically joined together to stop the jobs bill , also known as the tax extenders package or H.R. 4213 , to keep the unemployment situation bad , or possibly make it worse , for their own electoral gains in the fall .
[ Congress1 ]
Here is a flash transcript of some of her remarks :
* On Republican obstruction : *
It ’s an extremely maddening and concerning time right now , and frankly we need your help .
We ’re in a situation where , after spending at least eight weeks on the floor trying to pass this jobs bill , which focuses on creating jobs as well as helping people … not one Republican is willing to help us stop this Republican filibuster .
We ’ve spent a tremendous amount of time and discussions to get just one person to join us .
And we do n’t have that .
So , we will be voting again today to stop the filibuster and we have every anticipation that we wo n’t have the votes .
It is very clear that the Republicans in the Senate want this economy to fail .
They see that things are beginning to turn around .
You know the numbers .
When this president took office , we were losing 750,000 jobs a month . …
Now we are gaining jobs .
…
Unfortunately , and cynically [ on their part ] , in cynical political terms , it does n’t serve them in terms of their elections if things are beginning to turn around .
I believe when you look at this bill , which is all paid for — we raised revenues to pay for it — the one piece that is technically not paid for [ is the federal unemployment benefit extensions and ] that is done in a way that we have always done it , … [ those are ] always categorized as an emergency .
And , frankly , if 15 million people without jobs is not an emergency , I do n’t know what is .
* On who Republicans are helping : *
When you look as well underneath they are protecting wealthy investors , corporations sending jobs overseas and big oil companies — because we have included provisions to close tax loopholes in each of those areas .
Republicans are standing with them at a time when we desperately need to keep this economic recovery going and we desperately need to help people who are hurt .
In Michigan , it ’s estimated that by the end of this month we ’re going to have 87,400 who are going to lose help , temporary help , in their unemployment benefits , by the end of this month .
That ’s literally the difference between somebody keeping a roof over their head , food on the table and a little gas in the car to go look for work .
I ’m frankly outraged about what has been happening .
* On what will happen if the bill fails : *
We will put this temporarily aside .
We have no choice .
We met every single objection , we ’ve negotiated — we ’ve tried to meet what we ’re viewed as concerns on the other side .
Every time we tried to do that they changed the concerns .
We can come back to it in a moment ’s notice . … [ But ] we will temporarily put it aside .
We ’re going to move on to another jobs bill , focused on small businesses .
* On the impact of Republican intransigence : *
They ’re willing to take down the people of this country with them .
Republicans are out of work too .
There are Republicans ’ and Democrats ’ businesses that need the access to capital and [ other provisions ] in this bill .
* On the White House ’s involvement in pressing Sens. Susan Collins ( Maine ) , Olympia Snowe ( Maine ) and Scott Brown ( Mass . ) , viewed as the most likely Republicans to switch : *
They ’re very strongly pushing to get this passed .
The negotiations have been primarily been with senators at this point .
But the president and the White House are on the phone multiple times a day with the [ majority ] leader Sen . [ Max ] Baucus ( D - Mont . ) .
On what this augurs for future jobs bills :
This is an extremely bad sign , because , based on the inability to get at least one Republican — in the past , we ’ve had the ability to work , certainly , with members of the Republican caucus and get people of good will , willing to negotiate .
The fact that ’s not happening now and everything seems to be turned over to [ Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) ] , it appears that everybody in the Republican caucus has gone purely into election mode [ before ] the fall .
If they can stop the recovery from occurring , if they can create as much pain as possible , people will be angry and will not vote at all or will vote against those in the majority .
This is a very cynical political strategy and I sure hope it does n’t work .
* On continuing to fight : *
My hair is even redder than ever .
This is about real people .
This is not some political , cynical game here .

BBC News , Delhi
More than 100,000 poor families have already been evicted , the report says
Tens of millions of dollars have been diverted in India from schemes to fight poverty and used to fund Delhi's Commonwealth Games , a report says .
The Housing and Land Rights Network pressure group says its report is based on official documents obtained under India 's right to information act .
The group says there should be an independent inquiry into how this was allowed to happen .
Government officials in Delhi say they are looking into the allegations .
' Clear evidence '
This report is a damning indictment of the way the Commonwealth Games have been financed and planned by the central and state governments .
It says tens of millions of dollars have been diverted from funds which are supposed to help raise underprivileged low caste communities out of poverty .
The report also says spending on the Games has spiralled out of control : expenditure on sports infrastructure alone is more than 2,000 % of the initial projected budget .
In addition , more than 100,000 poor families have already been evicted due to projects connected with the Games , and up to 40,000 families are likely to be displaced before the Games begin in October , the document says .
The report 's author , Miloon Kothari , a former UN human rights rapporteur , told the BBC that the evidence was clear .
The determination , he said , to portray Delhi as a world - class city and an international sports destination , had led the government to lose sight of its legal and moral commitments to its people .

Mozilla is rolling out an update of its Firefox Web browser that adds support for plugin isolation .
Version 3.6.4 , which includes the new feature , was officially released on Tuesday and will be deployed soon through the browser 's automated update system .
It is unusual for Mozilla to deploy a major new feature in a minor point update , but the plugin isolation capability is a worthy exception to the rule , since it will significantly improve the browser 's stability .
In the new version of Firefox , plugin components like Flash and Silverlight will run in external processes .
When these plugins crash , the browser itself will not be terminated .
Browser vendors are increasingly adopting the multiprocess approach in order to improve stability and security .
In some browsers , such as Chrome and Internet Explorer , the tabs themselves are sandboxed into separate processes .
Mozilla launched a project last year called Electrolysis with the aim of bringing experimental multiprocess browsing to Firefox .
Isolating plugin runtimes in separate processes is Firefox 's first step towards full multiprocess browsing .
The plugin isolation feature by itself has significant value for end users , which is why Mozilla is rolling it out as an addition to the current stable 3.6 series .
" Results from our beta testing show Firefox 3.6.4 will significantly reduce the number of Firefox crashes experienced by users who are watching online videos or playing games , " Mozilla 's Mike Beltzner wrote in the official Mozilla blog .
" When a plugin crashes or freezes while using Firefox , users can enjoy uninterrupted browsing by simply refreshing the page . "
We tested the feature several months ago when it was previewed in early experimental builds .
When the Flash plugin crashes , the Flash content in webpages is replaced with an error message informing the user of the crash .
The browser itself will survive and continue running .
For more details about Firefox 's plugin isolation , you can refer to the Crash Protection FAQ at the Mozilla wiki .
You can find a download link and more details about version 3.6.4 in the official release notes .
Winnipeg filmmakers BlinkWorks have just gone live with their Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for Indie Game : The Movie , a feature length documentary chronicling and examining " independent game developers as a way to understand the medium and the theory behind video games . "
As you can tell from the portion above — a look back at the childhood of Super Meat Boy , Aether and Time Fcuk creator Edmund McMillen — the parts already completed are gorgeously shot and animated , and put the focus precisely where it should be : on the people behind the games , and how their experiences and thought processes are distilled into their work .
For more of BlinkWorks ' prior game dev documentary experience , see also this early profile on Infinite Ammo head Alec Holowka ( he of Aquaria , Paper Moon and the upcoming Marian , and donate to the film for your own DVD of the finished product via Kickstarter .

Lunes 17 de mayo de 2010
La noche del domingo se cumplieron las primeras 48 horas de la desaparición de Diego Fernández de Cevallos , tiempo precioso en el que se preservan todos las evidencias de un potencial acto criminal .
Rebasado ese tiempo , según los expertos forenses , cada minuto aleja la posibilidad de encontrar a un extraviado , secuestrado o asesinado .
Ya están en el tercer día , y los investigadores del extravío de Diego no saben nada sobre la naturaleza de la desaparición ; si es un secuestro con fines de obtener rescate , una venganza , un rapto político o un levantón del crimen organizado .
Sin embargo —y a reserva de confirmar con el tiempo las causas de la desaparición — , nada se ha dicho sobre las razones por las que habría sido seleccionado como víctima el polémico Diego .
Y es que por donde se le vea , Fernández de Cevallos es “ un pollo gordo ” para secuestradores , potenciales guerrilleros y criminales organizados .
¿ Por qué Diego ?
Porque si los responsables son vividores del secuestro , sabían que se trata de un político acaudalado al que sacarían mucho dinero .
Si fuera un grupo guerrillero de los que operan en Querétaro , tendrían la reivindicación perfecta de su lucha de clases , al tiempo que tendrían dinero en abundancia para seguir la lucha .
Si se trata del crimen organizado , el mensaje resulta demoledor para gobierno y Estado , ya que se confirma que la impunidad galopante estimula la agresión a cualquiera ; desde Diego , para abajo .
Pero cualquiera que sea la causa de la desaparición , el mensaje que se envía y la sensación que queda en la sociedad son aplastantes ; cualquier grupo criminal , político , del narco o , incluso , cualquier venganza personal , son capaces de exhibir las debilidades del Estado , su ineficacia , hoyos negros y , por si hiciera falta , la ingobernabilidad imperante .
Nadie sabe por qué desapareció Diego .
Nadie conoce el trasfondo y menos a los responsables ; si es crimen organizado , venganza , secuestro… pero todos sabemos que si a 48 horas de la desaparición nada se sabe de Diego , es que estamos ante un Estado ineficaz , incapaz de cumplir su razón de ser .
Y si nada pueden hacer por Diego , ¿qué podemos esperar los de a pie ?
Nada hicieron en los casos Martí , Vargas y Coppel ; nada contra los sicarios que acribillaron a la secretaria de Seguridad de Michoacán , y nada contra los criminales del candidato panista en Tamaulipas .
Nada harán por Diego .
Y menos por los de a pie .
EN EL CAMINO Una disculpa a los lectores .
En el Itinerario Político del domingo apareció “ desbocado ” escrito como “ desvocado ” .
Resulta que una mano ignorante quitó la palabra “ descocado ” acreditada a Manuel Espino y la cambió por “ desvocado ” .
Además de ignorante , torpe .
Washington ( CNN ) -- U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan could someday be awarded medals for restraint that prevents civilian casualties in combat .
The possibility is under consideration by the staff of Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the commander in Afghanistan , according to Lt. Col .
Tadd Sholtis , McChrystal 's spokesman .
The idea of rewarding battlefield restraint was proposed by British Maj .
Gen. Nick Carter , who is in charge of the international forces in southern Afghanistan .
Sholtis said the idea is still in its " conceptual stage . "
" Although no decisions have been made on the award itself , the idea is consistent with our strategic approach , " Sholtis said .
" Our young men and women display remarkable courage every day , including situations where they refrain from using lethal force , even at risk to themselves , in order to prevent possible harm to civilians .
In some situations our forces face in Afghanistan , that restraint is an act of discipline and courage not much different than those combat actions that merit awards for valor . "
Sholtis said troops would still have the right of self defense .
" Let me be clear .
We absolutely support the right of our forces to defend themselves .
Valuing restraint in a potentially dangerous situation is not the same thing as denying troops the right to employ lethal force when they determine that it is necessary . "
McChrystal has placed a priority on reducing civilian casualties as a means of gaining support of the Afghan people .
A number of recent high - profile incidents in which civilians have been killed have given the Taliban a propaganda tool against the coalition , U.S. officials said .
McChrystal has instituted other rules to help minimize civilian deaths , including restricting the use of airstrikes in areas where there may be civilians , and limiting nighttime raids by U.S. forces .
I 'd like to share with you an important yet infrequently discussed secret for success and satisfaction in life :
It 's putting the brakes on impulses .
Think about it .
Most of the troubles that people get themselves into include some variation on the theme of acting too quickly on impulses without adequate and careful thought .
People get themselves into all sorts of trouble by eating too much , drinking too much , spending too much money ( e. . , credit card and other debt ) , with the wrong person ( and perhaps going further than one should in this regard ) , saying things that they later regret ( especially in ) such as telling off a boss , a spouse , a boyfriend / girlfriend , an in - law , a neighbor , a close friend , a police officer .
Think of the troubles that so many celebrities in the news get themselves into ( e.g. , Tiger Wood , Lawrence Taylor , Ben Roethlisberger , Jonathan Edwards , Elliott Spitzer , Jesse James , Lindsay Lohan ) .
Much of these issues are closely related to impulse control .
You may have heard of a famous research study conducted many years ago at a pre-school located at Stanford University .
Children were given a choice between having one marshmallow now or two later .
Those who were able to delay gratification by selecting the two later option were more likely to complete their , have better jobs , stay married , and live healthier lives many years after the study than those who went for the one marshmallow option .
Remarkable .
We live in a culture that is very id based .
We want it all and we want it now .
Why put off for later what you can have now ?
If it feels good then do it .
You get the picture .
But what this way of being in the world results in is lots of problems .
While we are quick to judge the behavior of celebrities , politicians , and others who we read about in the news it is easy to see why they get themselves into so much trouble with their impulses .
For example , if you are someone who has unlimited financial resources , surrounded by " yes " men and women , and strangers fawn all over you , do n't you think you might feel pretty entitled and feel like you can pretty much have whatever you want whenever you want it ?
Do n't you think you might lose your moral and behavioral compass under these circumstances ?
Many of us might the fame and fortune enjoyed by those we read about in the news but we may not realize that their risk of having difficulty controling impulses can make what seems to be a fabulous life pretty miserable pretty fast .
Even for us regular folks , managing impulses is a constant battle in our society .
I typically tell my college students at Santa Clara University that success in college ( and in life ) often depends on how well you learn to manage your impulses .
So many of the top college students , for example , are n't necessarily the smartest students from an intellectual point of view .
Rather , they are the ones who are disciplined enough to study , plan ahead , and say no to their impulses that encourage them to stay up late , drink and eat too much , do fun things rather than study , skip class , sleep in , put things off that they do n't want to do until the last minute , and so forth .
They are the two marshmallow people , not the one marshmallow folks .
Learning to control impulses is n't so easy in our culture and is getting a lot harder .
Higher standards of living , technological advances , high expectations , the undo to the lives of the rich and famous , and so forth contribute to the problem .
But if we focus on doing this right , are attentive to the benefits of counting to 10 before acting as well as attending to putting brakes on impulses , then we are likely to live a more successful , satisfying , and happier life .
Doing the right thing for ourselves and others involves being countercultural letting our ego and superego override our id more often than not .
Saying no to impulses is very hard but likely will make you a better person as well as a more satisfied and successful person too .
Plus , you are likely to become a person who others appreciate being around .
So , when given the option for ( 1 ) one marshmallow now or ( 2 ) two later , go for the second option .
Not everybody was pleased with President Obama 's uncharacteristic line on the Today Show , spoken in the pre-school hours Tuesday morning , that he wants some " ass to kick " in the Gulf oil crisis .
Becky Quick , who co-hosts Squawk Box with lead anchor Joe Kernen and co-host Carl Quintanilla , slapped Obama for using unpresidential language in an interview he knew would be aired as children prepared for school .
" If you 're the president of the United States and you go on the Today Show which is a morning show , where you 're going to have a lot of kids sitting around watching this , I think you choose your words more carefully , " said Quick .
" Using the A word when you are on the Today Show talking with Matt Lauer , yeah , that disturbs me .
But I also think that this is a way of trying to prove that I 'm mad , to do exactly what everybody 's been pushing me to do , and it does n't ring true . "
Obama has been under pressure in the media and even among his friends , notably film director Spike Lee , to air more passion when addressing the oil crisis .
But Quick , who said she likes the president , said he sullied the office on the Today Show .
" When you are the president of the United States , you should speak of the office and there are events and time and places where maybe you get fired up about things .
It sounded like he was using this to try and prove that he was mad and I think that 's silly , " she added .
" You can point to people who say these things all the time , we 've used these words , but again , if you 're the president of the United States and you are on the Today Show I would expect a different choice of words , " she said .
Watch the segment here .
They work hard to deliver hot , cheesy goodness to your front door and expect only a paltry tip in return .
They are pizza guys and their stories deserve to be heard .
The following is the tale as told to me by such a pizza guy .
Should he attach his name to this bit of prose it is absolutely certain that he would be fired by the corporate pizza powers that be .
To preserve his job ( and my extra large with pepperoni and mushrooms ) while allowing him a theraputic release , I present to you the reasons your pizza delivery guy hates you .
Recently , New Times intern Sarah Ventre provided an exhaustive list of reasons why your cocktail waitress hates you ( Note : Sarah works at an indie bar that has a sense of humor about this sort of thing .
This pizza guy 's corporate bosses do not . )
Judging by some of the comments her article received , the list clearly hit a nerve -- both with her fellow servers who share her pain and with the rude customers who got a sobering dose of reality .
Not to be outdone , I have decided that , as an even lower member of the food service hierarchy , I deserve to have my voice heard .
I am a pizza guy .
I 'm not really sure why pizza guys are viewed with such pity and disdain by the general public , but please understand that telling people you 're a waitress / server is like telling them you 're a Fortune 500 CEO compared to telling people you deliver pizzas .
Exhibit A :
Q : How do you get a University of Nebraska graduate off your doorstep ?
A : Pay him for the pizza .
Exhibit B : This article from The Onion .
So , yeah , I 'm not familiar with any college football jokes or Onion articles featuring servers as the punchline .
I do n't want to turn this into a pizza guys vs. servers debate , since , in the words of the late , great Eazy - E , we 're all in the same gang .
But it 's at least worth noting that , unlike a server , whose primary challenge is delivering your food from the kitchen to your table in a reasonable amount of time , a pizza guy uses his own vehicle filled with gas he paid for and literally risks life and limb to bring your dinner to your front fucking door .
At a bare minimum , being a pizza guy requires the ability to read a map , understand block numbering systems ( which , in the Valley , inexplicably vary from one suburb to the next ) and know which way is north , south , east or west .
If you think these are fairly simple criteria , you probably have n't asked the average person for directions lately .
So without further ado , here is my list of reasons why your pizza guy hates you .
It 's not a comprehensive list ( I do n't think New Times has the bandwidth for that ) , and I 'm not going to rank them or give them clever names .
These are just the biggest pet peeves I 've accumulated in nearly two decades of delivering pizzas .
If I can change the behavior of even a handful of jackass customers , then this has been time well spent .
You 're a shitty tipper
Okay , we might as well get this one out of the way right out of the gate .
Unless your pizza guy shows up two hours late with cold pizza , warm soda and a cigarette dangling from his mouth , there is simply no excuse for stiffing us or giving us a shitty tip .
It might be hard to believe , but nine times out of 10 , when your pizza guy shows up a little late , it probably was n't even his fault .
We can only deliver orders as fast as they come out of the oven and most of the time , late orders are the result of the store being understaffed and subsequently falling behind on the production end .
Ideally in this situation , you hope that the manager in charge is communicating with order - takers and making sure that customers are being quoted a reasonable delivery time when they place their order .
In the real world , this is n't always the case .
But try to keep in mind that even if the store has fallen behind and you get your pizza 20 minutes later than you were quoted , odds are good that it 's still hot and fresh out of the oven .
It 's not like the driver has been running personal errands while your pizza is getting cold in his passenger seat .
Rather than stiffing the driver , a better way to resolve the situation would be to call the pizza place and ( politely ) let the manager know that you were disappointed with your experience .
You 'll most likely get some sort of compensation for your next order .
On the off chance that the delivery driver was actually at fault , a customer complaint is much more likely to light a fire under his ass than a shitty tip .
In my experience , however , most shitty tips are less a result of bad service than of customer ignorance or apathy .
Here are some common excuses for giving a shitty tip ( or no tip at all ) , followed by why you are either wrong or just do n't care :
" There was a delivery charge already added to the order . "
Yes , most pizza places add a delivery charge to your order , but not all of that goes to the driver .
Some of it is used to offset the insurance costs involved with having delivery drivers on the road .
The rest of it ( usually between 75 cents and $ 1.50 ) is , in fact , given to the driver .
However , this is not a " tip . "
When you add up the cost of gas , plus the costs of repairs and maintenance on a vehicle that logs anywhere from 50 - 200 miles per shift , we would n't even break even on delivery fees alone .
" Pizza guys make a better hourly wage than servers . "
While this is generally true , it is starting to change .
The place that I work at , for example , pays drivers minimum wage while they 're in the store , but only $ 4.25 / hour while they 're on a delivery .
For a driver who works primarily rush shifts and spends most of his / her time on the road , they are making almost exactly what a server would make .
Generally speaking , pizza guys do n't expect as much as the 18 - 20 percent you should be tipping servers .
As a rule of thumb , an acceptable tip for a pizza guy is whatever is greater between $ 3 or 10 percent of the bill .
Of course , if you can afford to tip more than that , it is greatly appreciated , because there will always be assholes out there who stiff the pizza guy regardless .
" Sorry .
I do n't have any cash on me . "
Um , did you notice the little line on the credit card slip you just signed that read " tip " ?
You can go ahead and write it in there .
The store will reimburse me , I promise .
Alternately , maybe you could ask one of your 20 or so co-workers standing right behind you to loan you a few bucks so you can tip the pizza guy .
Just sayin' .
" Sorry .
I can't really afford to give you a tip .
Times are tough , you know . "
To quote the first commenter from Sarah 's article , " cry me a river . "
If you 're so broke , go eat at fucking McDonald's .
Or better yet , go to the grocery store and cook your own goddamn food .
Times are tough for everyone , and I rely on tips to pay my mortgage and put food in my pets ' bowls .
If you can't afford to tip the pizza guy , you should n't be ordering pizza in the first place .
" There 's no law that says I have to tip .
If you do n't like it , ask your boss for a raise or get a different job . "
Listen , dickwad , while you are technically correct that you are not mandated to tip anyone for anything , that 's just how the system works , and people like you are taking advantage of that system .
Let 's imagine for a moment that everyone shared your point of view .
If nobody tipped , then nobody would work for the shit wages that tipped employees get paid .
Employers would have to pay those employees more , and if you think that cost is n't going to get passed on to the customer by simply charging more for the product , then you need to go back to school and sign up for Econ 101 .
You 're either going to pay $ 12 for your pizza and tip the pizza guy $ 3 , or you 're eventually just going to pay $ 15 for your pizza .
Pick your poison , cheapskate .
One final note on tipping : Before you decide to stiff the pizza guy , it 's a good idea to keep in mind that we are bringing you food that you 're going to ingest into your system .
Pizza guys ( and servers , for that matter ) have memories like elephants and we will remember who tips poorly and who tips well .
While I can honestly say that I have never spat in or otherwise " altered " a customer 's food because they have tipped me poorly , there are plenty of other people in the food service industry with fewer scruples than me .
One thing I will freely admit to , though , is playing favorites .
If I 'm leaving the store with two or more deliveries and one of them is going to a customer who consistently tips poorly , you 'd better believe that order is getting delivered last , regardless of which one is older .
By the same token , if I know one of them is a consistently good tipper , that order is getting taken first .
So just remember the old axiom - you get what you pay for ( and sometimes , god forbid , a little something extra ) .
With that out of the way , let 's look at some of the more minor ways you can piss off your pizza guy :
You wo n't answer your phone
Ever wonder why the first thing you 're asked for when placing a pizza order is your phone number ?
It 's so that if we have a question about your order , we can actually contact you .
Sometimes unforeseen shit comes up .
Maybe we 're out of Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi or anchovies .
Maybe the order - taker got your address wrong .
Maybe I was attacked by a pack of javelinas en route to your house .
In any case , if you do n't provide a working phone number that you 're willing to answer , we can't relay any of this information to you and find a mutually agreeable solution .
Just answer your damn phone .
You did n't give enough information to the order - taker
When ordering a pizza , try to keep in mind that the 16 - year - old high school sophomore taking your order is not psychic .
If your name is John and you work at a company with 300 other people , you should probably provide a last name .
If you 're staying at a hotel , the room number would be helpful .
If you live in a gated community , let us know the gate code .
( When coupled with not answering your phone , these can be especially annoying . )
You did n't turn your porch light on
Even if I have the right address and I'm on the right street , it 's not going to do a lot of good if I can't read the address on your house .
I 'll eventually find you , of course , but you 're only slowing down the process by leaving your porch light off .
You left your pit bull loose in the front yard
I 'm sure Fido is really a sweetheart , and I 'll be happy to give him a pat on the head once you 've confirmed that he's not going to chew my nuts off , but for god 's sake , keep him in the house until after I show up .
You want to pay with a $ 50 or $ 100 bill
This is perfectly fine , assuming your total comes to more than $ 30 or $ 80 , respectively .
Otherwise , you 're not getting your food until you break out the " real " money .
Seriously , why do people even carry big bills anymore ?
Does it make you feel rich ?
Do you not trust banks ?
Have you not noticed the signs in damn near every store you walk into that say " We will not accept bills larger than $ 20 " ?
They 're a fucking inconvenience , and you know it , or else you would n't be asking me to break the goddamn thing .
From now on , when you cash your paycheck at the convenience store , just ask them for twenties .
You want to pay in coins
A couple bucks in quarters is no big deal , but please do n't hand me a baggie full of loose change unless you want to stand there and wait for me to count it before you get your food .
You keep me waiting in the lobby of your workplace for more than five minutes
Look , I really do n't care if you were just closing a big sale and could n't get off the phone .
If you ordered pizza 30 minutes ago , you should n't have even made that call in the first place .
This is why I remove the pizzas from the hot bag as soon as the receptionist tells you your pizza is here .
The clock is ticking , Ricky Roma .
You let your kids answer the door and / or pay for the pizza
This might seem really cute to you , but really , it 's just annoying .
Even if your little angel manages not to drop the two extra large pizzas and 50 wings I just handed to him , odds are good the little fucker just pocketed half my tip .
You called five minutes before we close
Yeah , yeah , yeah .
If we 're open ' til 11 , that means 11 , not 10:55 .
That does n't make it any less sucky to have to drag all the shit back out of the walk - in to make your small one - topping pie .
At least try to tip me a couple extra bucks .
There are people that need killing on Modern Warfare 2 and I could almost taste that first beer , goddamnit .
You 're not ready to order when you call
Pizza Guy :
Thanks for calling Pizza Shack , what can I get for you tonight ?
Customer : Hold on a sec. ( to friends )
Hey , what do you guys want on your pizza ?
Could n't you have had this conversation before you called the pizza place ?
Also , do n't ask me what toppings we have .
If you want to know if we have a specific topping , I 'll gladly tell you , but if you think I 'm going to recite our entire menu for you over the phone , you 're sorely mistaken .
You try to wheel and deal when placing an order
It 's amazing how many times I 'll answer the phone and suddenly feel like a Tijuana street vendor .
Do you haggle over the price of your food at Durant 's , or even at fucking Applebee 's , for that matter ?
If you want to know what kind of specials we 're running , just ask , but do n't act like I 'm a fucking used car salesman .
You do n't offer a hit when it 's obvious you 've been smoking weed
It 's a tired cliché that every pizza guy is a stoner .
Those kinds of unfair stereotypes are what perpetuates the negative image of pizza guys in the first place .
That said , when you answer the door in a tie - dyed Widespread Panic T - shirt and a cloud of smoke billowing around you , hook a brotha up .
Do n't bother offering a beer , what with Arizona 's awesome DUI laws and all , but a little toke of the ol ' ganja sure takes the edge off of dealing with a bunch of filthy hippies who are too baked to count their change .
By the way , thanks for that $ 10 tip , Cheech .

It occurred to me that perhaps much of what I have been discussing recently is a bit too esoteric for normal people who do n’t live and breathe Woodfordian monetary theory .
So today I ’m going to try to explain the basic ideas in a very simple way .
Then in part 2 .
I ’ll try to explain how I can use the same Woodfordian model that people like Thoma and Krugman use , and reach different conclusions .
I ’ll start where Nick Rowe left off yesterday .
Nick spent a lot of time discussing all the perplexities of trying to control the economy by controlling real interest rates .
Unfortunately my brain is not wired properly to understand monetary policy based on manipulating real interest rates .
I see the new Keynesians as taking a peripheral stylized fact ( prices are sticky ) , exaggerating to the point of inaccuracy ( prices do n’t change at all in the short run ) , and then making it centerpiece of their model .
But Nick ends on a more hopeful note , which is where I ’ll pick up :
Tinkerbell and framing aside , this reveals another critique of our thinking about monetary policy as setting interest rates .
Why did we ever think that cutting real interest rates would increase demand permanently , as Old Keynesian models suggest ?
Cutting real interest rates merely shifts demand towards the present , and away from the future .
That wo n’t work if both present and future demand are too low .
Maybe monetary policy is about the supply and demand for money ?
I ’ll start with the last line of Nick ’s post .
The only knowledge I am going to assume that you have is an understanding of the Quantity Theory of Money — the idea that if you double the money supply , the price level will also double over time , leaving every real variable in the economy unchanged .
I want you to imagine that everyone understands and believes in the QTM .
Imagine you live in a country where a typical 3 bedroom ranch house sells for $ 200,000 .
Also assume the money supply has been stable for years .
Now the Fed suddenly doubles the money supply .
What will happen to the price of that house ?
Keynesians will say “ nothing ” ; prices are sticky .
If they are right , I plan to buy up as many houses as I can , right after the money supply doubles .
And then sell them again when the house prices double later on .
But I actually think it more likely that the sellers will also understand this implication of the doubled money supply , and wo n’t hand me a $ 200,000 profit on a silver platter .
They ’ll immediately demand higher prices .
The Keynesians are right that in the real world many prices rise more slowly , but in any case they do eventually rise .
So far there is nothing controversial in my application of the QTM .
But now let ’s assume that as the Fed doubles the money supply , they announce that 4 months later they plan to withdraw the extra money from circulation .
Does the price level still double in that case ?
Or , if you are a sticky - price Keynesian , does the expected future price level still double ?
If we think about that $ 200,000 house , I think the answer is clear .
Who in their right mind would pay $ 400,000 for a house expected to be worth only $ 200,000 very soon , after the monetary injection is withdrawn in 4 months ?
Indeed we would expect almost no increase in the price of the house , despite the doubling of the money supply .
And the reason is simple , the efficient markets hypothesis is far more fundamental than the QTM .
It ’s simply not plausible that house prices would rise from $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 , if people expected them to return back to $ 200,000 in the near future .
So let ’s review .
If you double the money supply , and the increase is expected to be permanent , speculators will rapidly bid up the prices of houses .
And even the prices of sticky goods will be expected to rise as their prices are readjusted over time .
But if you double the money supply , and the monetary injections are expected to be withdrawn in the near future , then house prices will barely budge , and sticky prices wo n’t be expected to eventually rise upward .
This is an incredibly powerful insight .
What does this all mean ?
It means that the effect of changes in current monetary policy on current aggregate demand and prices is utterly trivial compared to the effect of changes in the future path of monetary policy on AD and prices .
Change the current money supply and leave all future money supplies unchanged , and almost nothing happens .
Leave the current money supply unchanged and change all future money supplies for year 2 , 3 , 4 , etc , and you have a powerful and immediate effect on AD and prices .
The current price level basically depends on the future expected path of monetary policy .
Woodford did n’t discover this idea , but it forms the centerpiece of his model .
OK , but how does all this relate to the “ Tinkerbell principle ? ”
And why do we only hear about this principle during “ liquidity traps ? ”
The reasons are complicated .
One reason is that Keynesians like Woodford and Krugman think of monetary policy in terms of the path of interest rates .
This leads to very different assumptions from using the money supply as your policy instrument .
Let ’s redo the previous example with interest rates .
The Fed cuts the interest rate this year , but leaves all future expected interest rates unchanged .
Unlike with the monetary base , the expansionary effect of today ’s action is not completely negated by the fact that future monetary policy is unchanged .
Those who trust me can skip the next paragraph .
[ You can think of this in two ways .
Assume the current expansionary cut in rates boosts the economy this year .
Because AD is higher at the end of the year , even an unchanged level of future interest rates means an effectively lower policy rate in the Wicksellian sense .
The rate has fallen relative to the natural right ( which is higher in a stronger economy . )
If this makes no sense here is another explanation .
To cut rates this year the Fed must increase the monetary base .
This boosts NGDP .
If they plan to keep all future rates unchanged , then they must keep a higher monetary base at the end of the year when interest rates return to their normal level .
This is because with more spending in the economy , you have more demand for base money , and hence must supply more base money to keep rates at the predetermined level .
So a one - time cut in short term rates leads to a permanent rise in the monetary base .
That ’s why even temporary monetary policy changes can have an effect if you use interest rates as your policy tool .
but even there , future expected changes are far more powerful . ]
What about the “ liquidity trap ? ”
Recall that Keynesians think that monetary policy becomes ineffective once rates hit zero .
( Modern Keynesians use short term rates , but Michael Belongia reminded me that Keynes actually was thinking in terms of long rates .
So we are n’t actually in a Keynesian liquidity trap , as the Fed ’s QE in March 2009 did substantially affect long rates . )
You might wonder ; “ Why do n’t the Keynesians think a permanent doubling of the monetary base would raise prices , even if interest rates were zero today ? ”
After all , my initial example with the $ 200,000 house and doubled money supply seems very straightforward .
The answer is that smart Keynesians like Woodford and Krugman and Thoma do understand that a permanent doubling of the money supply would raise prices .
Their argument is different from Keynes ’s original liquidity trap argument .
They fear that any monetary injection would not be expected to be permanent .
More specifically , they fear that the Fed would not be able to convince the public that the increase would be permanent .
And if they ca n’t do that , then they ca n’t convince them that the price rise would be permanent .
And if that $ 200,000 house is only expected to temporarily rise to $ 400,000 , then it will never rise in price in the first place .
So to create current inflation you have to believe the inflation will be permanent .
“ If we believe we can inflate , then we can inflate . ”
That ’s Tinkerbell .
Part 2 .
So far I agree , but now let ’s look where I disagree with the standard Woodfordian approach to monetary policy traps .
To do that we need to think more about what the Fed is really doing .
Recall that the most important thing the Fed does is not to set the current value of the money supply ( or interest rates ) , but rather to signal intentions about future policy .
But how do they do this ?
There are many ways .
They could change the monetary base , and let the public guess what that meant .
They could announce permanent changes in the money supply .
They could adjust the exchange rate .
They could announce that they are targeting the expected inflation rate in the TIPS markets .
And so on .
In practice , most central banks send signals by changing short term nominal interest rates .
Unlike all the other options that I mentioned , nominal interest rates have an Achilles heel .
They might need to go significantly below zero , but cannot .
This means that if rates fall to zero , and the Fed wants them to be lower , and the Fed is incapable of communicating with the public in any way other than interest rate changes , then the Fed becomes literally dumb ( in the sense of speechless , although I ’d argue that slang for ‘ stupid ’ also applies here . )
[ Note , here and in a few other places I am shamelessly stealing ideas from Nick Rowe ’s brilliant “ social construction of monetary policy ” post . ]
So the markets look to the Fed for direction , and they have nothing to say .
During the first 10 days of October , 2008 , the markets saw that the short term rate needed to go well below zero to prevent a severe recession .
They looked to the Fed for some signal that it was switching out of interest rate “ talk ” and into some other language like price level targeting .
But like most big bureaucracies , the Fed is not as nimble and quick as Tinkerbell .
They remained mute — and the asset markets understood that this meant future monetary policy would be constrained by the zero rate bound on short rates , and would be far too contractionary .
Asset prices crashed .
Modern central banks do n’t just have one language , they have two .
In addition to signaling short term intentions with interest rates , they signal long term policy goals with inflation targets .
So even when rates hit zero , the Fed could have signaled a higher inflation target .
Indeed Krugman and Woodford both recommended this .
This would be a signal that once we exited the liquidity trap , the Fed would keep monetary policy more expansionary than usual , so that prices could rise by more than the normal 2 % .
Here ’s where the expectations trap comes in .
Once we have exited the liquidity trap , the Fed might not want the high inflation to actually occur .
It makes sense to promise inflation , as that will lower real interest rates today and help us recover .
But once the deflation and recession have ended the Fed might renege on this promise , because they are conservative central bankers who do n’t like high inflation .
Here ’s an analogy .
A mom promises a child that she ’ll get a lollipop if she finishes her homework .
After homework is finished , the mom reneges on her promise , because lollipops are bad for the child ’s teeth .
And after all , the homework is done so the inducement has achieved its purpose–even if it was all a lie .
I hope you can see the problem here .
This sort of thing almost never happens .
Moms do give the lollipop , and for two very good reasons :
1. Moms are not evil witches .
2. Moms may have to promise lollipops in the future .
So although the “ expectations trap ” is a nice clever theory , it almost certainly has no implications for the real world .
If the central bank publicly promised a certain inflation or price level path in an emergency , they would almost certainly carry through with the promise .
Why then was this silly theory developed ?
Because I think people gave far too much respect to the Bank of Japan protestations of innocence in the 1990s , and focused far too little on the fact that the BOJ was unwilling to actually promise inflation .
So it looked like the BOJ was stuck , unable to move AD and prices , when in fact they were n’t really trying .
Even worse , the BOJ actually did eventually do a temporary currency injection somewhere around 2001 - 02 , and then withdrew the money in 2006 .
And remember , the whole expectations trap idea is based on the insight that temporary currency injections have almost no effect .
So when the temporary currency injection had almost no effect , it seemed to support the model .
It does support the model that temporary currency injections do n’t have much effect , but does n’t support the assumption that the central bank ca n’t signal inflation .
After all , they never tried to signal inflation .
So why does the Woodford model seem to suggest that fiscal policy can work when monetary policy is stuck in an expectations trap ?
This is very complicated , as ( I am pretty sure ) it rests on two dubious assumptions :
1 . The Fed can only signal short term policy by targeting short term rates .
2 . The Fed targets inflation at 2 % , come hell or high water .
If you buy both assumptions , then it is indeed true that when short term rates are zero , the Fed can do nothing .
They ca n’t cut short rates and they wo n’t change their long run 2 % inflation target .
And it ’s also assumed that if they did promise higher inflation , no one would believe them .
Here ’s my problem with that view .
The term ‘ trap ’ suggests there is nothing they can do .
But in fact this “ trap ” is completely self - inflicted .
They can target some other variable , such as the money supply , or long term interest rates , or exchange rates , or TIPs spreads , and signal a more expansionary policy in that way .
They are n’t dumb ( well , at least in the “ mute ” sense . )
And even Woodford himself has argued that if they are at the zero rate bound , their long run target should be the price level , not inflation .
Either changing the short run policy indicator or changing the long run policy goal would allow them to boost AD .
A skeptic might say : “ But you have n’t really addressed the expectations trap .
Suppose they set a higher price level target , and no one believes them ?
Then we are still stuck . ”
I have three problems with this view :
1 . They would be believed .
2 . Even if they were n’t they can use other short term tools like currency depreciation or TIPS spread targeting .
3 . If there is still a problem it is even more applicable to fiscal policy .
And now we have come full circle to my post that raised such a fuss .
I argued that if you take the Woodfordian view that future expected monetary policy has a far greater impact than changes in current monetary policy ( which I accept ) then it is equally true that changes in future expected monetary policy can have far more effect than changes in the current stance of fiscal policy .
And if you go on to assume that heartless future monetary policymakers will sabotage current attempts by the Fed to boost the future expected price level , then they would be even more likely to sabotage current fiscal policymakers , for whom that have a far greater distaste .
So why did n’t Woodford get this result ?
In the Woodford model once rates hit zero the monetary authority is literally speechless , except if they can signal changes in the future path of interest rates , i.e. promise to hold them at zero for an “ extended period of time . ”
( Sound familiar ? )
But if they have a 2 % inflation target ( which is assumed ) they have no incentive to do this after they have exited a liquidity trap .
And the public understands this and hence does n’t believe Fed promises to inflate .
Fiscal policy is different .
They can do something meaningful right now .
Even if short term rates stay at zero , fiscal expansion can boost AD in the normal Keynesian way ( or by boosting velocity in the monetarist approach . )
The fact that the inflation target stays at 2 % in the long run does n’t sabotage current fiscal policymakers , as current fiscal expansion it least is able to get you out of the deflation much sooner , and back on to that long run 2 % inflation track .
So what ’s wrong with this approach .
Technically , there is nothing wrong with it .
But it ’s not what I consider an expectations trap .
Monetary policymakers ( especially Bernanke ) know all this .
They know that if they want to escape the liquidity trap quickly , they need to target the price level , not inflation .
Bernanke said as much when he recommended that Japan do this .
Woodford recently recommended a price level targeting approach .
So at a minimum , a Fed that really wanted to be more expansionary would adopt a price level target , aka ‘ level targeting ’ .
They would promise to catch up for shortfalls .
But if this is their promise , and they are assumed to renege on the promise , and sabotage current monetary policy , then fiscal policy is equally screwed .
If fiscal policy is to work , then it must raise AD , and hence the future expected price level .
If the Fed wo n’t let them do that , then it wo n’t work .
It does n’t even matter if the short term rate is stuck at zero right now , and there is nothing the Fed can do right now to sabotage fiscal policy .
Just the expectation that in the future they will act to prevent the price level from rising as the fiscal authorities hope , is enough to sabotage current fiscal policy .
That ’s why I started this entire overlong essay with the thought experiment about house prices , to try to convince you that what drives current assets prices , and current AD , is future expected monetary policy .
To summarize ; future expected monetary policy is what drives AD .
Fiscal policy may be effective , but only of the future Fed is expected to allow it to be .
Current monetary policy may be effective at the zero rate , but only if the future Fed is expected to allow it to be .
And there is almost no reason to expect that a future Fed ( probably headed by Ben Bernanke ) would try to sabotage and humiliate a current
Fed that made a very public and explicit price level target in the midst of a severe crisis .
Wo n’t happen .
Period .
End of story .

When many people start thinking about buying a home , they usually get excited about figuring out how big a house they can get and use online mortgage calculators to help them estimate monthly payments at a specific interest .
What many of these calculators do n’t include , though , are additional costs .
We often forget that homes need to be maintained — by the owner .
Other costs come into play as well , from property taxes to insurance to upkeep .
Additionally , when many people move , they do so into a larger place .
This often requires that you spend more in utilities , and you may have additional expenses , such as buying furniture , yard maintenance , and more .
The following infographic from CreditLoan.com offers a sobering look at how much it can cost to own a home .
It also compares renting to buying , and your costs in each case :
You can experiment with your own set of numbers at New York Times .
There are a number of financial experts that recommend you plan to live in your home for five to seven years if you buy .
This infographic backs that up by showing that it takes five years for a home purchase to be “ worth it . ”
It also brings up the point that sometimes it is n’t always better to buy .
There is also debate over whether or not a home purchased as your residence is truly an investment , and in many cases , by the time you add up the costs and interest , you are unlikely to get it all back , even with tax advantages and if your home increases in value .
Before you run out to buy a home , it is a good idea to carefully consider the costs .
You want to be able to afford your home , since it is a Major Financial Commitment .
If you are thinking about “ upgrading ” , you need to factor in potential losses from selling your home .
My husband and I have just decided not to buy a new place , even though we have found some screaming deals , because the time , hassle and loss involved in selling this home are so great .
Finally , consider other options before you buy a home .
You might be able to take the difference in cost between buying and renting and invest more every month .
There are those who maintain that they do n’t mind renting the same home or apartment for years .
They do n’t have to take care of maintenance , and they can invest the savings and end up with more in the long run .
Wisdom from Our Readers
Many of our astute readers have pointed out that all of the factors are not present on this infographic .
So we ’d like to take a moment to point them out , as you might expect , whether buying or renting makes more sense for you depends on a number of individual factors , including your local housing market .
Here are some of the other points that readers have made about what is missing from the infographic :
Tax Deduction :
This infographic did n’t figure in the fact that you can deduct your mortgage interest from your taxes .
This is an itemized deduction that can lower your taxable income .
Realize , though , that your interest payment goes down as the years progress , so the benefit you get from this diminishes .
Property taxes can also be deducted on your tax return , and that can be a benefit of homeownership .

Appreciation : Your home may not always appreciate in value .
Indeed , a recession can set you back a long way on the path to appreciation .
Whether your home truly appreciates in value depends a great deal on your local market .

Home Improvements :
It ’s important to note that even though home improvements can add value to your home , it is not an increase that equals 100 % of what you spent .
If you spend $ 1,000 on home improvements , your home may only increase in value by $ 700 or $ 800 .
Rarely do improvements add to the value of your home to the amount you spent on them .

Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) :
This infographic leaves off PMI .
If you do n’t put 20 % down , you have to pay for private mortgage insurance , and that adds another cost to home ownership .

Rental Utilities :
Unfortunately , the infographic fails to take into account that many renters have to pay their utilities .
This is a cost of renting that needs to be considered , as does the difference between how much utilities will cost in your new home .

Investing the Difference :
If you can rent for less than a mortgage , it is possible to the difference into another investment .
Indeed , since by the time you pay interest and pay for increased utilities and maintenance on a home , it is possible that you will not actually , dollar for dollar , break even on your home — even if it does appreciate in value .
Some maintain that you are better off investing your money in bonds , index funds or something else likely to offer better returns .
As always , you need to run the numbers for yourself , since situations are different , and market conditions vary .

If your childhood was anything like mine , you probably spent a fair amount of time dreaming of the day , far off in the future , that you could buy a Tron Light Cycle and use it as your daily driver .
Well , that day is here .
2010 has now officially become the future .
Only 5 of these bikes will be built and the purchaser will have the option of selecting either a high performance all electric drive - train or a high performance gasoline engine / transmission .
There will be one built in each colour and the Parker Brothers swear they will build 5 and 5 only , to ensure the value does n’t decline for the 5 people ready to spend $ 35,000 USD to live out their childhood dreams .
From the builder ;
Now , about the bikes themselves , the wheels are custom made 22 ″ x12 ″ dual hubless wheels with custom made tires ( Hoosier is custom making 5 sets just for us specifically for this project ) .
( Buyers will have the option of additional tires as needed )
The frame is 2 ″ cold rolled and boxed hardened steel with carbon fiber / fiberglass bodies .
Accent colors are neon glowing from behind frosted plexiglass and can be turned off or on with the flip of a switch .
Unlike the “ Batpod ” replica , the “ Lightcycle ” is being built for everyday street use .
Each bike will come with a manufacterers build sheet and a certificate of title with purchase .
Each bike will come with either a high powered electric motor or a high performance gasoline motor and transmission depending on the buyers needs .
Be the envy of everyone who sees this bike as it will make motorcycles as you now know them seem like antiques on the road .
No future “ Lightcycles ” will be made to ensure the value of these custom motorcycles in the coming years .
They will get individual vin numbers at first order 001 to last 005 as well as the original prototype vin number 000 .
The back cover opens up at the push of a button and there is a neon glow that exits from the back of the bike to resemble the lightcycles colored light trail from the original game .
These bikes will also come with a TRON style helmet ( Not DOT Approved ) and all bikes will be available within 6 - 8 weeks of contract .
A nominal deposit will be required to start the build and you will receive a youtube uplink to follow the progress of your individual bike until completion .
Please contact us if you have questions and we can iron out the details before starting your build .
$ 35,000 is n’t actually that bad when you realise that a Mavizen or MotoCzysz EP1C electric motorcycle will cost about the same or a little more and as cool as the Mavizen and EP1C are , they are n’t freaking Light Cycles .
The Parker Brothers also built a BatPod racer that works and was recently sold via Ebay so it ’s safe to say this is n’t a cash grab by a fantastically enterprising Nigerian prince .
If we had $ 35,000 burning a hole in my pocket I ’d already be on the phone , sadly it looks like I am going to have to settle for stealing one .
The word “ superstition ” has a pejorative connotation – superstitious beliefs are generally considered to be silly and irrational .
People often engage in superstitious behavior with a slightly embarrassed smile , pretending like they do n’t take it seriously even while they feel compelled to perform their lucky ritual .
This is all appropriate , in my opinion , as superstitions are magical beliefs .
Research has also shown that they are psychologically motivated – a way of dealing with a sense of lack of control .
The magical ritual gives us a false sense of control over events ( if I wear my lucky T - shirt , my team will win ) .
In fact , research by Whitson and Galinsky shows that feeling a lack of control increases pattern perception even in unrelated areas :
Participants who lacked control were more likely to perceive a variety of illusory patterns , including seeing images in noise , forming illusory correlations in stock market information , perceiving conspiracies , and developing superstitions .
A 2006 study by Perkins and Allen shows that people with a history of physical abuse as children are more likely to believe in the paranormal , especially those beliefs that provide a sense of control , like ESP and witchcraft .
The motivation for superstitions seems to be dominantly about control .
The process is hyperactive pattern recognition and agency detection .
We see patterns that are not there and then attribute an invisible agent to explain them .
At it ’s simplest level , this can just be assuming cause and effect for two completely unrelated events , like wearing a certain shirt and the outcome of a sports competition .
Some people are struck with the sense that there is some mystical power in the universe that connects these two events .
Recent studies by Damisch et. al. show another aspect of superstition , however – a potentially beneficial effect .
Researchers looked at task performance and the carrying out ritual superstitions , like crossing one ’s fingers .
They found :
“ Activating a superstition boosts participants ’ confidence in mastering upcoming tasks , which in turn improves performance . ”
They also found this improved performance effect was partly explained by improved “ self efficacy assessment ” and partly by increased task persistence .
Subjects were more confident and they engaged in the task more .
If true that could mean that belief in superstitions may provide a specific selective advantage , and not just be a side effect of our psychological makeup .
To make things more interesting , other research indicates a small tendency for superstitious beliefs to correlate with a lower self - efficacy assessment .
So superstitious people may have lower confidence at baseline .
But what is the cause and effect ?
Do superstitions arise in people with low confidence as a compensatory mechanism , or does belief in superstitions cause lower confidence – perhaps a surrendering of control to the magical agent ?
Both directions of causation could be at work in a self - reinforcing effect .
So while acting out superstitious rituals may temporarily improve confidence and therefore performance , not having the superstitious beliefs in the first place is also associated with higher confidence .
These effects have not been studied together , however , and follow up research comparing various groups would be very interesting .
This relationship between superstition , confidence , and performance reminds me of Richard Wiseman ’s The Luck Factor .
In this book he describes the research showing that people who think they are lucky actually are more “ lucky ” than people who believe they are unlucky .
However – people seem to make their own luck .
Believing in one ’s own good fortune motivates people to take chances , seize opportunities , and create the opportunity for good fortune to come to fruition .
Whereas “ unlucky ” people doom themselves by failing to do these things .
We may therefore be seeing a more general principle – self confidence , even if it is propped up by magical beliefs , translates to better “ luck ” and performance .
But it is the self - confidence that really works , and certainly this can be derived from non-superstitious sources .
I instinctively recoil from vacuous self - affirmations ( like Stewart Smalley ) , but the research does seem to indicate that believing in oneself really does translate into success .
I prefer to bolster my self - confidence with knowledge and understanding .
Call it the skeptic ’s self - affirmation .
Dan Lauzon was unsuccessful in his bid to secure his first win inside the Octagon when he fought Ultimate Fighter 8 Champion Efrain Escudero at UFC 114 : " Rampage vs. Evans " over the Memorial Day Weekend in Las Vegas .
And now it looks as if he may never get it .
Boston Herald is reporting that " The Upgrade " was downgraded by the world 's largest fight promotion and given his walking papers after an 0 - 2 start under the UFC banner .
From friend and business partner Joe Cavallaro :
" His contract was terminated .
He 's just got to go back and get more experience .
Danny is very very young guy .
He is a tremendous fighter .
He needs to get the right training , the right camp and get a handful of wins again .
I was talking to Joe Silva about it and he said ‘ we 'll definitely have him back .
We love him , he 's a tough kid .
He just needs more experience , a consistent camp . ' "
It was the latest blow in what turned out to be a very tumultuous camp for the former Affliction fighter .
Lauzon accused his trainers , along with brother and fellow UFC lightweight Joe Lauzon , of walking away from him two weeks before his big fight against Escudero at UFC 114 .
" The Upgrade " contends that he was holding up his end of the bargain after Team Lauzon issued him an ultimatum about his training schedule .
Of course Joe defended his position and warned that Dan would learn the hard way , which apparently he did .
But where does the talented young up - and - comer go from here ?
Strikeforce ?
Bellator ?

* Toyota to invest $ 50 mln in Tesla , sees stake about 2.5 pct
* Tesla to build new electric sedan in closed Toyota - GM plant
* Toyota chief approached Tesla about cooperation
* Toyota stock ends down 1.9 pct , roughly in line with Nikkei ( Rewrites throughout , adds analyst comment , details , background )
By Poornima Gupta and Chang - Ran Kim
PALO ALTO , Calif. / TOKYO , May 20 ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203 .T said it would take a $ 50 million stake in U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Motors , a move that gives the Japanese automaker a chance to repair its dented public image and vaults the California start - up on to the the world stage .
The two companies said on Thursday they would cooperate on the development of electric vehicles , parts and production system .
Separately , Tesla will take over a plant Toyota closed in the San Francisco area and build its upcoming all - electric Model S sedan at the site from 2012 .
The David - and - Goliath handshake highlights a changing dynamic in the auto industry , where newcomers such as Tesla and BYD Co 1211 .
HK of China are challenging established players in the uncharted field of mass - produced all - electric vehicles .
At a joint news conference in California , Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk described the investment as a “ gesture of support ” from Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda , who approached him in a whirlwind corporate romance that included dinner at Musk ’s house and a test ride around Los Angeles in Tesla ’s pricey electric Roadster sport car over the last month .
Tesla aims to tap Toyota ’s expertise in mass production while Toyota wants to win back public support hurt by its Prius hybrid recalls and San Francisco Bay Area protests against its decision to close the plant that Tesla is buying .
" Toyota gets to save face in California and give the impression that they 're beefing up their electric vehicle strategy , which is seen as lagging Nissan Motor 's 7201.T and Mitsubishi Motors ' 7211.T , " said Tatsuo Yoshida , Tokyo - based auto analyst at UBS Securities .
“ An investment of $ 50 million is not much for Toyota , and it seems like a win - win for everyone involved , ” he said .
President Toyoda , a licensed car racer who has pledged to turn the company founded by his grandfather into a more nimble one , said Toyota could learn a lot from Tesla ’s entrepreneurial drive .
“ Toyota was once a start - up company , ” he said through a translator at the news conference , also attended by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
“ Working with Tesla will provide us with a powerful stimulus , ” he said .
ELECTRIC RETHINK
Toyota will take the stake in a private placement to close immediately after Tesla 's much - anticipated initial public offering , and estimated the $ 50 million would amount to a stake of around 2.5 percent .
Musk said that another Tesla investor , Germany 's Daimler AG DAIGn.DE , approved of the Toyota stake .
Toyota shares fell 1.9 percent to close at 3,355 yen in Tokyo on Friday , compared with a 2.5 percent drop in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index .
The sudden interest in Tesla signals a shift in Toyota ’s hitherto skeptical view of battery - run electric vehicles as a viable alternative to today ’s internal combustion engine cars .
While stressing that it still considered gasoline - electric hybrid vehicles the most promising and effective alternative to reducing emissions and fuel use , Toyota said Tesla ’s cars , capable of long range highway driving , made it rethink the real potential of all - electric vehicles .
Most global automakers , including Nissan and Renault SA RENA .
PA , which have most vocally championed electric cars , have said the high price of batteries meant such zero-emission cars were most suitable for short - range driving .
Toyota said it wanted to know more about Tesla 's technology , which packs together lithium - ion batteries similar to those used in cell phones , to see whether it could be adopted for its own cars .
Toyota develops and produces batteries mainly in a joint venture with Panasonic Corp 6752.T .
Tesla ’s $ 109,000 Roadster sports car has become an emblem of California ’s plans to reinvent itself as the hub of clean technology of all sorts .
Tesla has sold more than 1,000 Roadsters in North America , Europe and Asia so far .
Production of Tesla ’s Model S will begin at the plant , called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc ( NUMMI ) , in 2012 and ramp up to 20,000 per year .
Toyota closed the sprawling NUMMI plant in Fremont , Calif. , in April , laying off over 4,500 workers after former partner General Motors [ GM.UL ] pulled out of the joint venture plant as part of its post - bankruptcy restructuring .
NUMMI had a capacity of 400,000 cars per year , so the Model S production will occupy only a small corner of the plant , acknowledged Musk , who called it an investment in the future .
Governor Schwarzenegger said Tesla eventually could create 1,000 jobs .
The six - year - old start - up has been granted $ 465 million of loans from the U.S. government to build a new lower - cost model .
It had been hunting for a manufacturing site in California and initially rejected NUMMI as too big .

Judge Blocks Deep - Water Drilling Moratorium 22 Jun 2010
A federal judge in New Orleans on Tuesday blocked a six - month moratorium on new deepwater drilling projects imposed in response to the massive Gulf oil spill .
The White House promised an immediate appeal .
President Barack Obama 's administration had halted approval of any new permits for deepwater drilling and suspended drilling of 33 exploratory wells in the Gulf .
( CNN ) --
An underground explosion in a coal mine in central China 's Henan province killed at least 46 miners early Monday , state media reported .
The Xinhua news agency said 26 of the 72 miners trapped by the explosion were able to escape .
Officials are investigating what caused the blast , which apparently occurred in the explosives storage area of the mine around 1:40 a.m. ( 1:40 p.m. ET ) , Xinhua said .
The mine , located in Pingdingshan City , has an annual production capacity of 90,000 metric tons of coal , according to Xinhua .
Mine accidents are common in China .
On May 30 , a coal mine blast killed 17 miners in Hunan province .
On May 13 , a coal mine explosion in southwestern Guizhou province killed 21 workers .
And in April , the Wangjialing mine in Shaxi province flooded , leaving 153 workers trapped .
Rescue workers pulled out 115 alive .
In 2009 , 2,631 people were killed in mine accidents in the country .
The figure , while high , is down from 2002 when 6,995 people died .
In April , China launched a two - month campaign to review safety regulations in mines and other industries that have had serious accidents .
Greg Lemond ( R ) talks ( Image credit : AFP )
Triple Tour de France winner Greg LeMond has called for widespread reform within cycling and for the UCI to change the way in which it governs .
LeMond would like to see the testing of riders and sentencing of dopers controlled by national federations and independent laboratories , while the UCI works on enhancing cycling 's reputation around the world .
LeMond 's comments come on the back of allegations made by Floyd Landis against the sport 's governing body , Lance Amstrong , Johan Bruyneel and several other riders .
The allegations centred on doping practices at the US Postal and Phonak teams , but perhaps more damaging , bribery between the UCI and Lance Armstrong and Bruyneel over an alleged failed dope test .
Speaking to Cyclingnews , LeMond , who in the last decade has clashed with Landis , Armstrong , Trek and the UCI , said that the best way forward for the sport would be for everything to come out and for no stone left unturned in the Landis investigation .
" I hope it 's a bloodbath and a cleansing , " he told Cyclingnews .
“ I think that those named by Landis whatever their circumstances , guilt or innocence would be better off cooperating with the investigation as a way to help change the direction of the sport . ”
" I think it 's the beginning of the end for a lot of people , " LeMond added .
" This is going to go pretty far .
It will shed a lot of light on a lot of people who have been silenced .
The doping part is almost a side show , in this case the cover up is worse than the crime .
I hope that those that have been silenced because of the system will get some relief to free their minds with the hope that they will help bring down those that really control how the sport future will unfold . "
" But I think it could be a good time for cycling and I hope the UCI do something positive . "
However , according to LeMond , so far the UCI have n't acted appropriately since Landis 's public confession .
They have discredited Landis with Pat McQuaid , the UCI 's president , recently telling the media , that , " Landis is just bitter and is claiming that all these guys doped because he got caught doping and thinks that other people got away with it .
He thinks he was selected to be caught but he denied doping for four years and now he 's saying the total opposite .
I do n't think he 's believable . "
LeMond added that McQuaid 's comments were in stark contrast to those from WADA , who said they would cooperate in any way with the investigation .
However LeMond also feels that the UCI are pushing their efforts in the wrong direction and that unlike previous whistle blowers , like Christophe Basson and Paul Kimmage , Landis should be welcomed to tell the truth .
" For me the UCI would be really smart if they said they wanted to do everything they could for the sport and promote it and leave the drug testing , the penalties and the sanctions to the independent agencies that has no connection to them , the Tour or the riders , just scientists and the police .
That 's the only answer . "
HTC - Columbia and Garmin- Transitions both have riders and team personnel – or in Columbia 's case , ex-riders – named by Landis .
Both teams have set their stales out as being at the forefront of promoting clean sport .
Garmin also recently said they would support any rider that cooperated with the investigation and LeMond is also a sponsor for the team .
" I really like the Garmin stance of supporting their riders .
People can make mistakes but they can move on .
There are teams like Garmin and Columbia that may get harmed , but I hope that their sponsors realise that they 're trying to make a difference and stick with them . "
" I think a lot of riders will come forward .
If they were involved they have this on their conscience .
A lot of these guys got into the sport because they love it and I do n't think that the majority ever thought they'd get into doping , but it 's a slow seduction and the drugs today are so powerful today that there 's a real benefit . "
" People that have no conscience have no problem lying , they have no problem with trying to get away with it .
People with a conscience wo n't be happy , they 'll self destruct and unfortunately Floyd went through that .
He made some mistake but the whole culture is geared to lying . "
LeMond does however believe that cycling has cleaned up in the last few years , and that the culture that for so long encouraged doping , is finally changing .
" There has been a shift in mentality and I do believe that things are cleaner than four years ago but the problem is that it only takes two percent to throw things out of whack . "
For LeMond though , the channels in which riders can come forward and admit to doping are hindrances rather than the helps they should be .
" Armstrong is very vindictive and he's hurt a lot of people in the process .
My gut is that guys like Floyd Landis are nervous and scared and do n't know what to do when the system only punishes people that come forward and want to clean up the sport . "
( Natural News )
It is likely a no - brainer to many in natural health world that processed , refined sweeteners like white sugar and high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) are unhealthy .
Studies continue to show that these toxic sweeteners lead to obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and other serious illness .
But in the mainstream world , these is still somehow a debate over whether or not these toxins are actually harmful , and over which one is preferable .
It should come as no surprise that the biggest defenders of processed sugar and HFCS are the industries that produce them .
Of course the Corn Refiners Association is now spending big money marketing HFCS as safe  after all , it is one of their primary cash cows .
Some of this group 's untruthful claims include alleging that HFCS is natural  because it comes from corn  and that it is safe in moderation .
Most people with even the slightest bit of understanding into the subject wholly disagree with such claims .
So does the myriad of scientific studies that indicate that processed sweeteners like HFCS are partially responsible for America 's growing disease and obesity epidemic .
Even the American Heart Association agrees that excessive sugar is harmful , as do many nutrition experts who recognize the dangers associated with excessive sugar consumption .
There is still a problem , though .
The battle is mainly between processed sugar and HFCS and whether or not one is healthier than the other , not whether there is a difference between highly - refined and natural sugars .
Most of the Western world seems to adhere to an ideology that makes no differentiation between refined and unrefined , but rather assesses health based on the number of calories a person consumes .
Many so - called nutrition experts agree , claiming that low - to - moderate intake of sugar and HFCS should not be a problem as long as calorie - intake is kept in the proper range .
The problem with this way of thinking is that it fails to assess whether or not a highly - processed substance in - and - of - itself poses health problems in spite of its caloric content .
A calorie is a generic measure of energy , and the way the body processes food is far more complex than a simple measure of calories .
The truth of the matter is that both refined white sugar and HFCS are harmful to health , whether consumed moderately or in excess .
Obviously the more one consumes , the worse off he is , but the point is that the debate is focusing entirely on the wrong hypothesis .
The best forms of sugar are the ones that occur naturally in things like fruit and vegetables .
And when a recipe calls for an added sweetener , natural options like stevia , raw agave and coconut sugar are far superior to refined sugars because they contain vitamins , minerals and nutrients that are otherwise stripped away during refining .
These co-factors contribute to the digestion and assimilation of sugars , keeping the blood sugar at proper levels .
When these are not present , the body is unable to process the sugar properly , leading to all sorts of health problems .
Rather than model themselves after Big Tobacco by defending their harmful products , the refined sugar industries should confess that their products are harmful and begin investing in natural alternatives .
But since they likely never will , health - conscious individuals can continue educating their friends and neighbors about the truth , and steering consumer preference away from the toxic sweeteners that currently dominate the mainstream food and beverage markets .

So if lawmakers are wondering why consumer confidence and the stock market are tanking ( the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index hit a new low for the year on Tuesday ) , they need look no further than a mirror .
The situation cries out for policies to support economic growth  specifically jobless benefits and fiscal aid to states .
But instead of delivering , Congressional Republicans and many Democrats have been asserting that the nation must act instead to cut the deficit .
The debate has little to do with economic reality and everything to do with political posturing .
A lot of lawmakers have concluded that the best way to keep their jobs is to pander to the nation ’s new populist mood and play off the fears of the very Americans whose economic well - being Congress is threatening .
Deficits matter , but not more than economic recovery , and not more urgently than the economic survival of millions of Americans .
A sane approach would couple near - term federal spending with a credible plan for deficit reduction  a mix of tax increases and spending cuts  as the economic recovery takes hold .
But today ’s deficit hawks  many of whom eagerly participated in digging the deficit ever deeper during the George W. Bush years  are not interested in the sane approach .
In the Senate , even as they blocked the extension of unemployment benefits , they succeeded in preserving a tax loophole that benefits wealthy money managers at private equity firms and other investment partnerships .
They also derailed an effort to end widespread tax avoidance by owners of small businesses organized as S - corporations .
If they are really so worried about the deficit , why balk at these evidently sensible ways to close tax loopholes and end tax avoidance ?
House lawmakers made an effort on Tuesday to extend jobless benefits but failed to get the necessary votes , and it remains uncertain if an extension can pass both the House and Senate before Congress leaves town on Friday for a weeklong break .
What ’s needed , and what ’s lacking , is leadership , both in Congress and from the White House , to set the terms of the debate  jobs before deficit reduction  and to fight for those terms , with failure not an option .
Botox may be famous for erasing frown lines , but it also may disrupt an important chain of communication between the face and the brain .
Not only do our facial expressions reflect our emotional ups and downs , they appear to send crucial feedback to our brain , suggests a growing body of research .
Without that full feedback loop , our ability to understand — and be understood — might be constrained .
In a recent study of women undergoing cosmetic treatment with Botox , researchers found that the treatment , which blocks facial nerve impulses , seemed to slow the ability to comprehend emotional language .
“ We know that language moves us emotionally , ” said the lead author , David Havas , a psychology graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
“ What this study shows is that that ’s partly because it moves us physically . ”
Those findings , which will be published in the journal Psychological Science , complement earlier research showing that mimicking emotional expression triggers a matching emotional response , says Fritz Strack , a psychologist who was not involved in the research and who studies emotion and cognition at the University of Würzburg in Germany .
He cited , as an example , the response elicited by holding a pen in one ’s teeth , activating the muscles used in smiling .
In studies using this pen-in - mouth procedure , which Strack and his colleagues pioneered , people actually feel happier and respond more positively to stimuli such as cartoons when they hold a pen between their teeth than when they hold it between their lips , which forces a frown .
In a study published in 2007 , Havas and colleagues built upon those findings .
They found that participants holding a pen in the “ smile ” position read happy sentences — such as “ Finally , you reach the summit of the tall mountain ” — more quickly than they did while holding the pen in the “ frown ” position .
In contrast , participants read sad sentences — such as “ You hold back your tears as you enter the funeral home ” — more quickly when holding a pen in the “ frown ” position .
Similarly , research using electromyography , or EMG , to measure fine muscle activity indicates that written materials ’ emotional meaning triggers activity in specific facial muscles .
For example , reading words such as “ murder ” or “ fight ” activates the corrugator supercilii , a muscle anchored above the nose that spreads outward across the brow .
This muscle is responsible for the parallel , vertical furrows produced when a person frowns .
Frown line links
Such findings have raised the question of whether emotional expression is itself necessary for fluid processing of emotional language , Havas says .
In the new study , he and colleagues investigated whether temporarily paralyzing the corrugator muscle blocked people ’s ability to process negative emotional language .
The researchers asked 40 women waiting to receive first - time Botox injections to read a series of 60 sentences on a computer , pressing a key when they understood each sentence .
To make sure participants were actually reading the sentences , the researchers periodically checked their reading comprehension .
Participants repeated the test , using a fresh set of questions , two weeks later when the Botox treatment ’s paralyzing effect was at its height .
After treatment , participants were slower to understand sentences conveying sadness or anger than they had been before treatment .
There was no such change for happy sentences .
Mood analyses ruled out the possibility that the women were simply happier after receiving Botox , making them quicker to comprehend happier material .
The results indicate that our own facial expressions help the brain make sense of the social world , Havas says .
“ Our facial expressions reveal social context by mirroring expressions of those around us , giving us insight into their emotions , states of mind , and future actions , ” he says .
The Botox study , he says , suggests that our facial expressions also guide how we interpret language .
When the face ’s ability to provide feedback is disabled , as in Botox treatment , our understanding is hindered .
The new findings fit with the increasingly accepted theory that aspects of higher thought , such as language , judgment , and memory , are shaped by our bodily sensations and movements , says Paula Niedenthal , a psychologist at Blaise Pascal University in Clermont - Ferrand , France , and a leading scholar on the role of the body in emotion .
According to this “ embodied ” view of cognition , which has gained popularity over the last decade or so , the brain makes sense of the world at least partly by simulating action .
In keeping with this view , some researchers suspect emotional language triggers the same neural systems used in real emotional experiences — including those brain signals produced by our own facial expressions .
This idea finds support in neuroscience .
Last year , scientists in Germany used neuroimaging to study people ’s brain activity while they were imitating emotional facial expressions such as anger .
They found that Botox treatment of frown muscles blunted neural activity in brain areas that are involved in emotional responding .
Useful muscles
It might be tempting to conclude , from such results , that getting Botox could help blot out unhappiness .
But Niedenthal cautions that the opposite is true .
“ There are about 20 muscles of the face that produce the major expressions of emotion , ” she says .
“ We are supposed to use them in order to understand and communicate subtle meaning in social life . ”
In the new study , Botox - induced paralysis only slowed down participants ’ response to angry and sad sentences by about a tenth of a second , on average .
But such effects can snowball when communicating with others .
“ Language is highly interactive , and we ’re very , very sensitive to all kinds of cues that happen on the order of milliseconds , ” says Arizona State University psychologist Arthur Glenberg , one of the study ’s authors .
Timing is crucial , for example , in the ritual of taking turns during conversation .
Let ’s say that , in a marital disagreement , your spouse is repeatedly just a tenth of a second too slow in responding , leaving the mounting impression of disinterest or failure to comprehend .
If such delays were chronic , Glenberg says , “ That ’s enough time for a person to get really pissed off . ”

A woman who allegedly slammed a toddler 's head against a door with such force it left dents in the wood , is undoubtedly responsible for his death , a court has been told .
Dylan Rimoni , 3 , died on April 18 , 2008 , in Auckland 's Starship children 's hospital after his life support was turned off .
An autopsy showed he died from head injuries .
His carer , Patricia Angela Pickering , 38 , is charged with murdering the boy after bashing his head against a hard surface .
Pickering , who is on trial in the High Court at Auckland , also faces two charges of grievous bodily harm and one charge of assault .
She has denied all charges .
Yesterday , Crown prosecutor Philip Hamlin told the court Dylan was given to Pickering to care for because the boy was in need of a mother and Pickering wanted a child .
He had been removed from his birth parents ' care after allegations of neglect and abuse .
Although it appeared a dream come true for both Pickering and the boy , the reality was quite different , Mr Hamlin said .
" This child was beaten for a long time .
He was hit , cut and maltreated over the period he was in Ms Pickering 's care .
In the end he was dead , in her arms , effectively . "
The jury was shown a cupboard door with two dents in the wood that the Crown claims were caused by the boy 's head hitting it with force .
Evidence had been given to the court by Pickering 's neighbours , who heard angry yelling at the house .
One neighbour had heard Pickering yell : " Shut the f ... up , shut up " .
Another heard her say : " If you do not shut your mouth , I 'm going to punch your head . "
Neighbours also gave evidence of seeing Pickering roughly handling a child outside the house a month before Dylan 's death , Mr Hamlin said .
Pickering had then lied to police about what had really happened , blaming Dylan 's injuries on him being a " clumsy " child .
" Toddlers do not run around and get significant brain injuries . "
The trial is continuing .
Following the Perl Cookbook ( by Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington , published by O'Reilly ) spirit , the PLEAC Project aims to gather fans of programming , in order to implement the solutions in other programming languages .
In this document , you 'll find an implementation of the Solutions of the Perl Cookbook in the Common Lisp language .
Various submissions rely on third party http://cliki.net/ASDF packages ( e.g. cl- ppcre , soundex , etc ) and specific helper utility functions ( WHEN - LET , CHOMP , etc ) .

Last year , we noticed that Pat Robertson ’s American Center for Law and Justice was setting up satellite offices in both Zimbabwe and Kenya with plans to participate in the drafting of their respective constitutions .
A few months ago , we saw how the ACLJ was working out outlaw abortion in Kenya ’s constitution , and this story makes me wonder what sort of impact they might be having on Zimbabwe’s :
Didymus Mutasa , a powerful figure in President Robert Mugabe ’s Zanu PF political party , said his party will see to it that homosexuality is outlawed in the new constitution and that stiff penalties will be put in place for those who engage in the practice .
Mutasa , Minister of Presidential Affairs and Zanu ( PF ) politburo Secretary for administration , told villagers that his party had already taken a position on what should be included or excluded in the new constitution .
“ As a party , we now have our positions for inclusion in the new constitution and we hope these will be captured accurately , ” Mutasa said .
“ Practices such as homosexuality , abortion and euthanasia which offend human and public morality should be outlawed . ”
Mutasa said the new document should contain stiff penalties to ensure those who indulged in homosexuality were dealt with severely .
He said he had been angered by some Christian organisations , which were lobbying for the inclusion of gay rights in the new document .
Mutasa said foreign interference on such matters was unacceptable .
“ We are surprised that some Christian organisations are advocating for gay rights to be included in the constitution , yet we know that gay marriages are even forbidden in the Bible , ” Mutasa said .
The Search and Surveillance Bill is an attempt to rewrite New Zealand ’s laws around search and surveillance .
One thing that has become clear in the debate around the bill is that many people are not fully aware of the existing powers that government agencies have to pry into our personal affairs .
It ’s not uncommon for someone to decry a ‘ new ’ power in the Search and Surveillance Bill , only to be told that it is already in existing law .
This article lists , to the best of our knowledge , the current ways that the government can use to watch us .
We will expand / correct it as additional knowledge comes to light .
This article has not yet been updated to reflect the changes made when the Search & Surveillance Act became law .
Contents
General surveillance
Common rights
Everyone has the right to ( in broad terms and with exceptions ) :
Record conversations that they are part of .
Report on things they see .
Take photos or video of anyone and anything .
Follow someone to see where they go and what they do .
The media can use these rights and , if not prohibited , so can government departments .
For example , the Police do n’t need to get a warrant to tail someone or to pay an informer to report what they ’ve heard .
However , it is illegal to intercept other people ’s private communications or to sell equipment designed to do that .
it is also illegal to make “ intimate visual recordings ” without permission .
Note that licensed private investigators are not allowed to photograph , video or record people without the written consent of the target .
This has been superseded by the Private Security Personnel and Private Investigators Act .
Video cameras
Video cameras are increasingly common in public and private places in New Zealand .
Some examples :
Cameras in banks and shops that watch both the customers and the workers .
Council operated cameras in streets and squares .
Road cameras operated by the NZ Transport Agency .
Security cameras at airports .
The Police can normally gain access to camera records upon request .
ACC – Accident Compensation Corporation
The Accident Compensation Corporation is known to use private investigators to check up on claimants , but it appears that they have no particular legal powers to do their own surveillance .
Customs
The same law that gives the Police the power to install tracking devices on vehicles or anything else can also be used by the Customs Service .
The Comptroller of Customs must submit an annual report to Parliament listing the use of tracking devices .
In 2008 /2009 the use was as follows :
Warrants issued : 14
Average duration ( days ) : 27
Devices used without warrant : 1
Customs officers have the ability to patrol the bank of any river or lake and the adjacent land , and to enter any building there or part of an air strip for the purpose of surveillance .
Ministry of Fisheries
This law gives Fisheries the power to place a person as an observer on any vessel to collect fishery - related information .
The owner of the vessel must provide them with food and accommodation .
The Ministry of Fisheries also use investigators to watch and follow people who they suspect of breaching fishing laws .
IRD – Inland Revenue Department
While the IRD has extensive powers to search it appears to have no powers to engage in surveillance .
GCSB – Government Communications Security Bureau
The GCSB derives its powers from the Government Communications Security Bureau Act of 2003 .
The GCSB has two roles – interception of communications and the protection of the government ’s communications from interception .
However , the interception explicitly excludes NZ citizens or permanent residents :
Neither the Director , nor an employee of the Bureau , nor a person acting on behalf of the Bureau may authorise or take any action for the purpose of intercepting the communications of a person ( not being a foreign organisation or a foreign person ) who is a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident .
However , there is some doubt about the exact workings of the GCSB ’s satellite interception stations and how much control the GCSB has over the information captured by the other countries it partners with .
The GCSB has recently issued a statement denying these allegations .
Police
The Police surveillance and interception powers come from a wide variety of Acts .
We have sorted it by act :
Summary offences are petty crimes that are dealt with “ summarily ” – i.e. by a District Court judge without a jury .
This law includes provisions for the use of tracking devices .
These are devices that reveal the location of a person or thing and / or whether something has been opened / tampered with .
Warrants to use a tracking device must be issued by a High Court or District Court judge .
They can be granted for the investigation of any offence .
Warrants are issued for up to 60 days but can be renewed .
The warrant also gives the office the ability to enter premises to install the device .
An officer can install a tracking device without a warrant if it is not practicable to get one and the officer believes that a judge would issue one .
The Commissioner of Police must submit an annual report to Parliament listing the use of tracking devices .
In 2008 /2009 the use was as follows :
Warrants issued : 22
Average duration ( days ) : 40
Devices used without warrant : 0
This law allows the Police to apply to a High Court judge to get a warrant to intercept private communications for the purpose of collecting evidence about drug crimes .
This includes the ability to install interception devices ( see note below ) .
Any intercepted information that is not about drug dealing or other serious crime must be deleted .
The Commissioner of Police must submit an annual report to Parliament listing the use of interception warrants .
The report must also include the number of prosecutions taken against the Police for misusing the information gained .
In 2008 /2009 the use was as follows :
Warrants granted : 38
Warrants refused : 0
Warrants that authorised entry onto private premises : 19
Average duration ( days ) : 24
Emergency permits : 1
Interceptions recorded from emergency permits : 326
People prosecuted : 111
People convicted : 16
People still being prosecuted : 82
Number of prosecutions of police for misusing information : 0
Part 11A of the Crimes Act 1961 allows for the Police to apply to a High Court Judge for a warrant to intercept private communications where the target is a participant in an organised criminal enterprise or has committed or is about to commit a serious violent offence or act of terrorism .
This includes the ability to install interception devices ( see note below ) .
Any intercepted information that is not about serious crime must be deleted .
As a general rule , Judges should only grant warrants where they believe there are reasonable grounds for believing that the crime has occurred or will occur ; that the evidence could be collected in no other way ; and that the intercepted communications are not likely to be privileged ( i.e. talking to your lawyer ) .
A police constable with the rank of inspector or higher can authorise the use of an interception device in an emergency situation where one person is threatening to kill or seriously injure another .
The Commissioner of Police must submit an annual report to Parliament listing the use of interception warrants .
In 2008 /2009 the use was as follows :
Warrants granted : 30
Warrants refused : 0
Warrants that authorised entry onto private premises : 14
Average duration ( days ) : 19
Emergency permits : 8
Interceptions recorded from emergency permits : 1763
People prosecuted : 46
People convicted : 1
People still being prosecuted : 36
Number of prosecutions of police for misusing information : 0
The Prime Minister and three other Ministers can declare an international terrorist emergency .
This gives the police the power to , amongst other things , intercept private communications for the purpose of preserving life .
This power is also extended to the armed forces when working alongside the police .
This law says that anyone who owns or controls anything that they suspect might belong to a designated terrorist entity must report any transactions concerning it to the police .
This law says that communications companies ( e.g. phones and internet ) must provide facilities that enable law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept communications and gather information about those communications ( e.g. when they were made ) .
The warrants themselves are issued under the authority of the other acts mentioned in this article .
This law says that financial institutions and casinos must report to the police any transactions that they suspect may be relevant to the prosecution and investigation of money laundering , drug crimes , terrorism , proceeds of crime or any other serious offence .
The Police Commissioner provides guidelines that the banks use to determine whether a transaction is suspicious and therefore must be reported .
Note : Interception Devices
The Misuse of Drugs and Crimes Acts both refer to “ interception devices ” .
interception device means any electronic , mechanical , or electromagnetic instrument , apparatus , equipment , or other device that is used or is capable of being used to intercept a private communication
This is generally taken to exclude video recording ( one of the justifications for the Search and Surveillance Bill is to add rules around video recording ) .
SIS – Security Intelligence Service
The SIS gets its powers from the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969 .
The SIS can also take advantage of the Telecommunications ( Interception Capability ) Act 2004 .
The SIS can “ install or modify any device or equipment ” to watch someone .
We take this to mean audio bugs , cameras , computer monitoring devices , etc .
The Act has very few limitations on how this surveillance can be carried out .
They require a warrant , which is applied for by the Director of the SIS and granted by the Minister ( traditionally the PM ) and the Commissioner of Security Warrants .
The warrant can be granted for up to 12 months at which point a new warrant must be applied for .
While the warrant is only to be used to collect information for the “ detection of activities prejudicial to security ” , if they uncover information relating to any serious crime they can pass that information to the NZ Police .
The SIS must submit an annual report to Parliament listing the use of domestic and foreign interception warrants .
In 2008 /2009 the use was as follows :
Warrants issued : 24
Average duration ( days ) : 158
Methods used : telecommunications interception , listening devices , copying of documents
The SIS also said that there some foreign interception warrants .
Having gone to a minor ( read : high school seminary , I can say this tradition generally applies to any priest , though it has since ( thankfully , and before I got there ) died out .
Any priest is required to be free of physical defect , and in good health .
The current Archbishop of Chicago was refused admission into the diocesan seminary because he suffered from ill health ; asthma and polio , if I am not mistaken .
Part of the physical examination is to make sure the prospective seminarian has got a pair , and that both have , * ahem * , descended .
Dear Cecil : Everyone has heard the great American folk legend of Paul Bunyan and Babe the blue ox .
But I have heard that Paul Bunyan is nothing more than the invention of a lumber company — a corporate logo no more mythological than Mr. Clean or the Pillsbury Doughboy .
I 've tried searching this on the Internet , and I 've found some sites that claim that the Red River Lumber Company did indeed create the character , whereas others say the company just took the legend and used it in their ads .
You seem to be the man who knows his stuff , and I figure if anyone can come up with a definitive answer to this question it 's you .
Andrew Micak
Cecil replies :
The Paul Bunyan tales have been described as “ fakelore ” — “ a slender vein of oral anecdote ” embellished by copywriters for low commercial ends .
That ’s putting it a little harshly ; the stories are a cut above the usual promotional puffery .
Still , there ’s no denying the truth : Most of the Paul Bunyan yarns , commonly thought of as tall tales spun by loggers during winter evenings in the north woods , were actually the work of inspired hacks .
The first Paul Bunyan story to appear in print was “ The Round River Drive ” ( research kindly contributed by Straight Dope Science Advisory Board member bibliophage ) .
In it Paul and the other lumberjacks try to float logs to the sawmill , only to realize after the scenery starts to repeat itself that the river they ’re using is circular .
In 1910 the Detroit News - Tribune published a version of this tale by James MacGillivray , who ’d heard it while working at a lumber camp in Michigan a few years earlier .
MacGillivray coauthored a versified version that appeared in American Lumberman magazine in 1914 .
That same year William B. Laughead wrote and illustrated Introducing Mr. Paul Bunyan of Westwood , California , the first in a series of Paul Bunyan advertising pamphlets for the Red River Lumber Company .
The firm was headquartered in Minneapolis but by then had moved most of its logging operations to the west coast .
Some of the stories in the pamphlet were based on Bunyan tales Laughead had heard a decade earlier in a lumber camp near Bemidji , Minnesota .
A few were based on other logging yarns or Laughead ’s own experiences , presumably exaggerated .
Laughead is credited with naming Babe the blue ox and Johnny Inkslinger , the clerk who has an ink hose connected to his pen .
The first two Paul Bunyan pamphlets in 1914 and 1916 enjoyed only modest success , but the third in 1922 was a hit and brought the giant lumberjack international fame .
Additional Bunyan pamphlets appeared sporadically until the company went out of business in the 1940s .
Red River trademarked a Paul Bunyan image described as looking like “ Shirley Temple with a mustache . ”
But neither it nor Laughead ever copyrighted the stories , which were distributed for free .
Other writers also contributed Bunyan stories .
Two collections appeared in 1916 , one presenting tales gathered from loggers in five states and British Columbia , the other stories from Oregon .
Esther Shephard published a collection in 1924 ; James Stevens released another in 1925 , when Bunyan and Babe were at the height of their fame .
Stevens ’s stories are among the best known in the genre but probably the least faithful to the oral tradition .
One big change : what were surely ribald tales in the original telling had morphed by the mid-1920s into stories for kids .
Scholars have long debated the authenticity of the Bunyan tales .
In his 1940 article “ Paul Bunyan , Myth or Hoax ? ” Carleton C. Ames argued that there was little evidence the stories were widely told among loggers before appearing in print .
However , interviews with retired lumberjacks turned up good evidence that Paul Bunyan stories had circulated at logging camps in the U.S. and Canada in the 1880s and ’90s and possibly earlier .
The name Bunyan may derive from Bon Jean , a trickster in French Canadian folklore also known as Ti Jean or Petit Jean .
But that seems doubtful — for one thing , Petit Jean is petite .
What does seem clear is that much of the Paul Bunyan legend was invented by writers who were paid to do so .
That may offend the sensibilities of some folklore experts .
But speaking on behalf of the underpaid scribblers of the world , I say good for them .

Couple discover they are siblings : Child courts blamed after strangers fall in love , have a son - and then find out they are half - brother and sister
A young couple have revealed how they fell in love after meeting at a nightclub , moved in together , had a child – and then discovered they were , in fact , half - brother and sister .
The extraordinary discovery was confirmed by DNA testing just last month .
It has left the couple stunned and shaken – but they are nonetheless vowing to stay together and have more children .
They both blame the legal system which prevented the young man from being told his true identity .
He only discovered who he really was long after he and his half - sister had got together and had the child .
Aged in their 20s and living in Leinster , they have decided to speak out in a bid to help others who might find themselves in a similar situation .
Couple :
The siblings say despite their discovery they are going to have more children
But they have to remain anonymous for fear of the impact it might have on their son – or on their lives .
Some who know them fear there could be legal repercussions over their relationship , which is illegal in the eyes of the law .
Now they are considering taking a landmark civil case against the judge and a child psychologist involved in the family law case that ultimately sealed their fate by refusing let a child be told the truth about his parentage because of the secrecy that shrouds Irish family law .
Speaking to the Irish Mail on Sunday this weekend , the young man at the centre of this staggering tale said he understood how his story might initially make people feel .
‘ I ’m not blind and I ’m not oblivious to what people might think , ’ he said .
‘ We ’re not from a bad background and if someone had said to me that they were in a relationship like this , I would have said they were sickos .
‘ We ’re not from a bad
background and if someone had said to me that they were in a relationship like this , I would have said they were sickos '
‘ When we found out that we were half - brother and half - sister , we were devastated .
When I got the phone call with the DNA tests , it was like when you hear about someone you know has died or like when you are in a car crash .
‘ The shock is not physical .
It ’s that sinking feeling in your stomach which comes all over you .
If we did n’t have a child , we would have left it .
' Before we found out that my girlfriend is my half - sister , we were talking about getting married and we would like more children .
But we will get married and we will have more children . ’
The couple do not want their identities revealed because they fear that to do so would have a devastating impact on their young son .
They believe their little boy would be stigmatised by society and singled out for ridicule by his school mates .
And , naturally , they also want to protect themselves until they ’ve had a chance to come to terms with their extraordinary situation .
So instead of using their real names , they have asked to be known as James and Maura .
They have asked that their son be referred to as Mark ; James ’s mother as Carmel , and his stepfather as Vincent .
The name ‘ Tom ’ is given to the man who , it turns out , fathered both James and Maura .
James and Maura met several years ago in a nightclub .
Even though they live 100 miles apart , both were out socialising with friends in a town which neither is from .
They were instantly smitten and so strong was their mutual attraction that just one week later they both felt they ’d known each other for a lifetime .
Recalling the first time they met , James explained : ‘ We grew up in separate towns about 100 miles apart .
We met by chance in a town neither of us is from .
We ’d never met before and there is about two years between us .
‘ When we found out that we were half - brother
and half - sister , we were devastated '
‘ We got on very well .
We are very similar in what we like and dislike .
We really hit it off .
We agreed on everything .
I ’d been in relationships before but I just knew this was different .
We met that night and after a week it felt like we ’d known each other forever .
‘ You know when you meet certain people you just click ?
It never happened in that way before .
After the first week we met every evening .
We would drive to see one another and I ’d either go to her place or she ’d go to mine . ’
Two years after they met , Maura became pregnant and they moved in together .
Later that year their son , Mark , was born .
By then James ’s fraught relationship with his mother , Carmel , was nearing breaking point .
He had not seen Vincent – the man he had been brought up to call ‘ father ’ – for years .
Vincent had left the family home when James was about 10 or 11 .
So strained was their relationship that the young boy was relieved when his ‘ father ’ walked out the door .
He and his mother had drifted even further apart since then .
‘ I have always been evasive about my parents , ’ said James , ‘ and when Maura would ask me when she was going to meet my parents , I would put her off knowing it would never happen .
‘ My mother has always done everything wrong and with girlfriends I would be evasive so my mother would n’t be able to upset them .
' I was dreading the Christening because I thought the priest might ask about my mother and I thought people at the Christening would be asking me about my parents .
' I have always been evasive about my parents '
‘ When my mother did n’t come to the ceremony , I just thought that ’s it .
We do n’t get on and I did n’t see her until the day before last Christmas Eve .
It was Christmas and I knew she was by herself and I thought I ’ll just call in and see her . ’
Maura , who had a happy family background , encouraged James to make peace with his estranged mother .
Sadly for them , the encounter , engineered from the best of human motives , uncovered a secret past that both of them will struggle with for many years to come .
‘ My mother was by herself and I was just going to call in and see her before Christmas , ’ said James .
‘ That was it .
I started to tell her about my girlfriend and our child .
' She asked me who my girlfriend ’s parents were , what their names were .
She asked me what was my girlfriend ’s father ’s name was , where was he from and what did he do .
‘ My mother got hysterical .
She just put her hands on her face and said : “ You ’re not serious . ” I thought : “ She has lost it . ”
‘ She went upstairs , closed the door and would n’t come out .
I stayed in the kitchen .
It was just weird ; then I went up and asked her if she was okay .
She said to me to stay away from Maura , but she would n’t come out of the room so after a while I went away .
‘ I turned my phone off for a few days and , when I turned it on after Christmas , I thought there might be a text from her but there was n’t .
Three or four days after Christmas , my mother rang and told me that Maura ’s father was my father .
‘ I thought she had really lost it and I told Maura so .
I thought maybe she was saying these things because she was lonely and that this would get me to go and stay with her .
' There are others like us and I think that if mothers were forced to name the child 's father on the birth certificate , then this would not happen '
‘ But somehow in the back of my mind I knew it was true .
When I was growing up , I always knew something was being held back .
The man I thought was my father , who I now know is my stepfather , always treated his nephews better than me .
It was n’t that he was physically abusive , it was more mental .
‘ I remember doing something , I ca n’t remember exactly what it was .
It was Christmas and I did n’t get anything for Christmas .
I could n’t cry in front of him .
It was n’t because I would n’t please him to cry in front of him , it was because I would get a belt .
‘ When I was in the house , I did n’t know what time he would be coming home from work but I could sense when he was and then I would change .
My mother always went with what he said . ’
Since Christmas , and with the help of DNA tests and gentle questioning , James and Maura have discovered the following :
Carmel had met
Tom on a night out during the 1980s .
She was 19 .
They dated for the next four to five weeks but the romance soon fizzled out and they went their separate ways .
But they did sleep together – and during her month - long relationship with Tom , Carmel became pregnant with James .
However , she did n’t tell Tom that she was expecting his child and , by the time James was born , she was already involved in a relationship with Vincent .
So it was Vincent who was named as James ’s father on his birth certificate .
It was not until about four years later that Tom discovered that Carmel had a child .
Keen to find out whether he was the little boy ’s father , he made contact but many of the details about what happened next are sketchy .
However , what is clear is that even though Tom was by now married and the father of a young daughter , he was so determined to be a part of his son ’s life that he embarked on a legal battle to win access .
It was the late 1980s and no doubt court cases like this were few and far between .
' Somehow in the back of my mind I knew it was true .
When I was growing up , I always knew something was being held back '
But Tom was undeterred and , when the case was heard behind closed doors in the family law court , Carmel admitted that Tom was indeed James ’s father .
She conceded that Vincent was not James ’s father but his stepfather .
However , the court ruled that James should not be told who his real father was or be given access to him .
Even though James was only about five , he does have some recollections of the time .
‘ I did n’t know what was going on but I remember thinking there was something strange , ’ he said .
‘ I met a child psychologist with Vincent and my mother , then with my mother and me , and then by myself .
‘ The child psychologist asked me to point to my father , which was Vincent , and he said in court that it would be too upsetting for me to have my real father come into my life .
‘ My father was not seen by the child psychologist and the judge said he admired Vincent for standing by my mother .
I now look at Maura ’s father , who is my father , and he is a broken man .
He has failed physically and I can see how it must have been for him when this happened years ago .
‘ We do n’t look alike but when I am standing beside one of his brothers who is about 20 years older than me , I can see that we are identical .
‘ Tom and I always got on well before we knew all this .
In fact , I used to be jealous of Maura going home to her family and having a father who would ring her up and see how she is and what was happening .
‘ I never had a father like that .
Tom knows it is n’t right for us to be together so Maura and I do n’t go to see him together .
‘ Maura ’s mother has been good about it .
Her brother , who is my stepbrother , does not know about this and he will never know .
We have decided to keep it between ourselves for now .
‘ People reading this will think our situation is a one - off and that the chances of this happening are the same as the chances of winning the lottery – but every week someone wins the lottery .
‘ There are others like us and I think that if mothers were forced to name the child ’s father on the birth certificate , then this would not happen . ’
Meanwhile , James has contacted the General Registrar of Births to rectify his birth certificate and he is also considering taking a civil case .
‘ I would like to meet the judge and the psychologist and ask them how they thought this was the right decision .
They would not do this to their own families . ’
This disturbing case was first raised by MoS columnist John Waters , who has long campaigned for more rights for fathers in the courts .
He said last night it illustrated what could happen if fathers are not given equal rights under the law .
“ The facts of this case reveal the moral destination point of our corrupt and inhuman system of family law .
Such cases are inevitable in a culture which regards with contempt the bind of blood and soul that exists between a father and a child .
‘ It is a crime committed by the State , but the crime does not hinge only on this outcome and on these facts .
It is committed every day , in courts all over the country , by lawyers , judges , social workers , so - called experts .
It is the crime of contempt for the humanity of certain categories of people . ’
He added : ‘ Back in the 1980s , we had major stories like Joanne Hayes and Eileen Flynn , which the Irish media were anxious to prosecute because they exposed aspects of our society that needed to change .
' This is that type of story , and yet , since I first publicised it on Friday , it has been ignored by everyone apart from the MoS .
Why ?
Not because it is n’t shocking , that ’s for sure .
No , because it is n’t ideologically convenient for those who decide what we should be shocked by and why . ’
The pinko left of the left at Fortune magazine really are too harsh .
Ca n’t they embrace change and accept that the Wall Street elite knows what is best for America ?
Oh sure , maybe there is less competition and the proprietary trading systems have rigged the system but that ’s what progress is all about .
Then there are those who might suggest that it was anything other than chance or good luck that the big trading houses managed to avoid any losses on any day in the opening quarter of 2010 .
Well , some were jealous of Barry Bonds homerun records or Floyd Landis winning the Tour .
I ’m just glad we have an administration that knows how to let Wall Street be Wall Street without hassle .
HTC has filed a law suit against Apple seeking a ban on imports of Asian - manufactured iPhones , iPods and iPads into the United States .
The HTC caction alleges that Apple products infringed five HTC patents and seeks to have them barred from sale in the United States from their manufacturing facilities in Asia .
Apple declined to comment .
Apple iPad .
" We are taking this action against Apple to protect our intellectual property , our industry partners , and most importantly our customers that use HTC phones , " HTC vice president for North America Jason Mackenzie said .
" HTC believes the industry should be driven by healthy competition and innovation that offer consumers the best , most accessible mobile experiences possible , " Mackenzie said in a statement .
The federal government on Wednesday charged the former chairman of a major mortgage lender with $ 1.5 billion in fraud related to the financial bailout .
The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) alleged Lee Farkas , former chairman and majority owner of Taylor , Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. , sold $ 1.5 billion in fabricated or impaired loans to Colonial Bank .
The government alleged those loans were falsely represented as high - value assets .
Farkas was also responsible for a " bogus " equity investment in the bank that allowed Colonial to satisfy requirements to receive money from the $ 700 billion bailout package , according to the SEC .
ADVERTISEMENT
" As the country 's mortgage markets began to falter , Farkas arranged the sale of more than $ 1 billion dollars worth of mortgage loans and securities he knew to be fictitious or impaired , " said Lorin Reisner , deputy director of the SEC 's division of enforcement .
The SEC said the scheme involved $ 500 million in fake residential loans and $ 1 billion in impaired residential loans and securities .
Taylor , Bean & Whitaker was once the nation ’s largest non-depository mortgage lender , according to the SEC , but it fell into trouble during the housing crisis and filed for bankruptcy in August 2009 .
Farkas was not a major contributor to political campaigns , but he gave $ 2,250 to the National Republican Congressional Committee ( NRCC ) in 2006 and 2007 .
24/7 Wall St. Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2011
24/7 Wall St. has created a new list of brands that will disappear , which includes Readers Digest , Kia Motors , Dollar Thrifty ( NYSE : DTG ) , Zale ( NYSE : ZLC ) , Blockbuster ( NYSE : BBI ) , T - Mobile , BP plc ( NYSE : BP ) , RadioShack ( NYSE : RSH ) , Merrill Lynch , and Moody ’s ( NYSE : MCO ) .
24/7 Wall St. regularly compiles a report of brands that are likely to disappear in the near - term .
Last April , and again in December , we published our findings .
Usually , it would take a full year before such a list could be compiled again .
However , the current economic climate has accelerated this process and a majority of the brands on the first two lists are either gone , have been acquired , or have filed for bankruptcy .
Last April , 24/7 Wall St. identified twelve brands that our analysis showed would disappear , including Saturn , Borders , Palm , AIG and Eddie Bauer .
We also accurately identified brands that would disappear in our December list .
The first brand on that list was Newsweek .
The publication was founded in 1933 .
Parent firm , The Washington Post Company ( NYSE : WPO ) , has given up on the magazine , which it has owned since 1961 .
None of the buyout offers made thus far seem to be serious .
Closing magazines was in vogue during the depths of the recession .
Newsweek has little chance of staying open .
Another brand on last year ’s list was Palm .
Its sales were so slow and its new mobile device , the Pre , sold so poorly that Hewlett - Packard ( NYSE : HPQ ) was able to buy Palm for next to nothing .
The Palm brand is so badly damaged that HP is likely to keep the technology and kill the name .
Borders Group ( NYSE : BGP ) , which was also on the December list , is still in business – barely .
The company has closed most of its Waldenbooks stores , gone through serial layoffs and has now had two consecutive majority shareholders .
It recently fired a number of the people in its UK operation .
Borders is burdened with $ 300 million in debt , and its stock recently traded as low as $ .35 .
The company is outmatched by larger and more successful competitors , Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble .
Fannie Mae ( NYSE : FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( NYSE : FRE ) were on our earlier list .
We were wrong about them closing .
They have become “ wards of the state , ” kept open by the US government to help maintain an orderly mortgage market .
It is estimated that keeping the two firms open costs taxpayers about $ 7 billion a month .
The companies lost a combined $ 291 billion in 2009 .
Members of Congress are pushing to have the companies shuttered .
It is almost certain that they will not be around , at least in their current forms , much longer .
One estimate is that the cost of supporting the two companies will total $ 1 trillion , making it more likely that they will be closed in the favor of other alternatives to maintain the mortgage market .
Another financial firm on our list , bond insurance firm Ambac ( NYSE : ABK ) , warned last week that it may have to file for bankruptcy in the near - term .
That news caused the stock to drop from a 52 - week high of $ 3.39 to a $ .51 .
Ambac ’s stock traded at $ 96 three years ago .
Sun Microsystems failed so badly in its core server market that it was forced to downsize to the point where it was not a viable standalone company .
It was sold to Oracle ( NASDAQ : ORCL ) for a fraction of what it was worth three years ago .
We also completely missed the mark on a few companies .
They include Eastman Kodak , Motorola , and The GAP ’s Old Navy brand .
With a number of the brands on the December list either gone or on a short - term path to extinction , 24/7 Wall St. has put together the latest version of the Ten Brands that Will Disappear .
To qualify , we expect that brand to be gone by the end of 2011 , or for its parent to be sold or go into Chapter 11 .
According to a report from French blog MacGeneration , one of the announcements on tap for Monday 's WWDC 2010 keynote ( which we 'll be covering live , by the way ) is a major update for Safari -- namely , version 5 .
If you believe the docs the site has obtained , there are more than a few big changes coming , including Bing now alongside Yahoo ! and Google search options , a new " Safari Reader " for better / easier RSS reading ( we 're hoping they 're taking a cue from Google on this ) , 25 percent faster JavaScript performance and DNS prefetching ( hello , Chrome ) , improved HTML5 support ( no big surprise there ) , and new developer tools which we assume will be along the lines of Firebug or Chrome 's developer helpers .
So we hope .
The update will allegedly also add hardware acceleration for Windows PCs , an address field that auto - predicts URLs ( they 're calling it a " Smart Address Field " ) , and a handful of other minor tweaks and snips .
Furthermore , there 's an expected minor bump to Snow Leopard ( 10.6.4 ) which will resolve some nagging issues , though nothing really more than that .
As we 're sure you 're aware , the next 48 hours or so are going to be filled with all sorts of nutty rumors about what 's happening at Monday 's keynote -- we 'll try and separate the wheat from the chaff for you .

Thanks for your support , Damian !
12:35 p.m. I 'm writing these words at the " Thinking Spot " in Capilano Suspension Bridge Park , located in Vancouver 's North Shore , across the Burrard Inlet .
The nifty SeaBus transported me across the water and the # 246 bus delivered me to the park .
Dangling 230 feet above the Capilano River in North Vancouver , this swaying wood suspension bridge is 459 feet long and held up by sturdy wire steel cables that are imbedded into massive blocks of concrete .
The temptation to sway the bridge is great and a young lady is posted by at its entrance to warn visitors , not to engage in such juvenile behavior .
The walk across the bridge was breathtaking , but also exhausting and I 'm sure I 'll feel it in my leg muscles later .
It cost me $ 8.51 Canadian to experience this private park but I managed to get a $ 5 discount from the full adult ticket price by showing my student pass from the university .
There are many authentic Totem Poles placed around the visitor area .
They are over 60 years old and in perfect condition because they have been well - maintained .
The park has sturdy wood walkways that lead to some very lovely vistas along the nature path .
I am surrounded by towering Douglas Firs that reach high into the heavens and in the background , I hear a waterfall and the call of birds .
1:15 p.m. I 'm seated in the back seat of a very comfortable bus that will return me to the Seabus and Vancouver .
Capillano Bridge was a great way to kill time and riding the Seabus is a hoot .
The weather could not be more perfect :
Blue skies and sunshine , lots of pretty houses to look at along the way surrounded by neatly manicured lawns .
And unlike the packed bus that was heading to Capillano Bridge , this coach is only half full .
3 p.m. A gas clock that does n't tell the right time is one of the highlights of the Gastown District .
And if you stick around that very same clock will blow its top on the half - hour , an event I did n't have the patience to experience .
I did , however , have the patience to discover one of the best bars in Vancouver B.C : The Irish Heather .
Locally owned and operated by a fellow from Limerick , Ireland , they feature the best local beer in the Universe : " Red Boar Organic Ale . "
" Everything in the ale is grown on certified organic land and all by - products of the brewing process are fed to their livestock .
The beer is made from organic potatoes , giving it an earthy flavor and rich dark body , " said the bartender .
7 p.m. I 'm aboard the Amtrak Cascades train heading to Seattle and crossing customs was pretty intense .
Fortunately , the fellow examining me was from Albuquerque and he let me waltz through the process without much scrutiny .
The coach car on this single - level train has nice big windows , comfy cushions , and a dynamite view but the tracks are in really bad shape and for the life of me , I can't figure out how to make my seat recline .
These trains are manufactured in Spain by the Talgo company and according to their website and differ from Amtrak 's traditional design in that the coaches are held together with articulated unions that deliver a more comfortable and modern railroading experience .
But having said this , the Talgo is still a single level train , lacking the inherent robustness , roominess , and American brawn that categorizes Amtrak 's iconic , homegrown Superliners .
( Some safety issues have entered the conversation about the Talgos , which I will not explore today . )
When everything is said and done , these trains are lighter than most American long - haul passenger trains and weight does make a difference .
This is not your typical American " heavy Chevy , man . "
The bathrooms are small , but well supplied and configured .
I had a full dinner of beef stroganoff , clam chowder , and coffee for $ 16 including tip but was disappointed with the cheap plastic dishes .
No salad came with the meal but the food was good .
Bald eagles can be seen flying outside the window of the train , hanging out on the rocks , huge creatures with white necks .
Lots of people bathing on the beach .
9:45 p.m .
We are fast approaching Seattle and despite the condition of the tracks ( some of them are in good condition , in all fairness ) I am dazzled by the beauty of the surrounding country and oceanside .
I am amazed at how quickly the tides advance and the beauty of the sunset is overwhelming .
Watched an interesting Kevin Costner movie , " Dragonfly " on the monitors , and listened to the dialogue through the headset .
I 'm getting used to the cramped seating but most definitely would not want to ride on these so - called Talgo cars for a long - haul ride .
Incidentally , I spent about $ 6 Canadian on bus tickets and none were ever checked .
It 's the honor system in Canada and I 'm impressed with the honesty of those around me .
Hell , I 'm impressed with my honesty ( I guess it rubs off ) !
I barely made it back to the train station on time because I neglected to transfer on the SkyTrain and ended up exactly where I started .
Then I had to run across the street to find a bathroom because there were n't any at the SkyTrain station --- so I wasted an hour going around in circles just to find a place to pee .
Security was intense at the Vancouver Amtrak station and I was glad for that : it 's about time !
I was able to watch the progress of the " Talgo Train " on TV monitors as it made its 467 - mile way from Vancouver BC to Seattle , complete with projected arrival time , current time , temperature , and its next stop .
In the meantime , I find that my pen is running out of ink and my stuff , as usual , is scattered all over the place .
It 's time to gather myself together because I have a big night ahead .
Tuesday , June 2 , 9:30 a.m. King Street Station , Seattle .
Why are hostels so smelly ?
Merciful God in heaven , the stink is straight out of the most inner circle of Dante 's Inferno , particularly in the dorm rooms .
But I guess that 's what $ 25 a night will buy you in " The Emerald City . "
This hostel , unlike the one in Vancouver , had no elevators and instead of four beds to a room , they had ten !
One very big plus was that they had lockers in the lobby large enough to accommodate my massive bags and they were relatively new , unlike the lockers at the Vancouver main station that were on their last leg .
My Talgo train arrived in Seattle about 20 minutes late and after I wearily checked in to the hostel and locked away my two bags in the lobby , I went straight to bed .
The fellow at the front desk had given me some sort of weirdly sewn bed liner that I spent a good five minutes trying to crawl into .
I soon gave up , shed my clothes , and climbed into the lower berth of my assigned bunk bed .
I draped my arm over my pants because it contained all my money , tickets , etc .
And then I drifted off into a deep sleep , waking at around 6 a.m .
After getting dressed I explored the nearby waterfront and then the historic market area , complete with cobblestones and a myriad of delightful stalls that sold flowers and seafood .
The vendors were beginning to arrive and stock their shelves and I felt privileged to witness the awakening of this historic , revived marketplace , though somewhat sad that I would not see it in full force .
I wondered if this place was like the " Maxwell Street " my dad used to talk about in the Chicago of his youth .
At 7 a.m . I found a nice restaurant where I ordered French toast and coffee for $ 7.25 and had a pleasant conversation with a 46 - year - old English chap named John who shared the room in my hostel with me .
I was pleased to discover somebody my age who chose to travel frugally and we discussed this subject at length .
We also spoke about education and life in Manchester .
At 8 a.m . I returned to the hostel , checked out , retrieved my bag , and called a cab that took me back to the train station where I sit now .
This place is about to undergo a major renovation , returning it to its classical 1906 look .
For some reason somebody covered up the ornate ceiling with lowered tiles , to retain heat , I suppose .
Soon , the crappy fake ceiling will be removed and a new day will arrive :
The renaissance of train travel ( please God ! ) and the coordination of municipal transportation systems .
10:30 a.m . Very comfortably situated in a coach seat of the Coast Starlight en route to Los Angeles .
Since I know the ropes quite well by now , I was the very first in line and the first to enter the coach where it was open seating .
I grabbed the only seat that had an electrical outlet , intent on soothing my aching muscles with my heating pad .
Regrettably , I noticed at the last moment that I had picked the " wrong side " of the train ̶ that is I took a seat that will not be facing the ocean .
I suppose I can watch the ocean from the observation car , though .
One of the very most important things about traveling by train is keeping one 's hygiene up and I am feeling refreshed after having cleaned myself up with " Wet One 's " antibacterial moist towelettes .
Four towelettes are what it took to clean my entire body and it does make all the difference in the world .
I have my Sunday paper yet to read and I 've brushed my teeth and powdered my balls with Gold Bond , the powder with a methyl tang , yeah !
I neglected , however , to change my underwear and hope to take care of this once we head out of the station at Tacoma , Washington .
Quite a few passengers were waiting at the platform and I am pleased to say that the seat next to me remains empty .
The car attendant is a stern taskmaster and I have managed to stay out of his way , except when I first entered the train and inadvertently blocked everybody 's passage to the upper coach level .
And you know what they say : First impressions are lasting impressions .
I was concerned that he would get even by making me change my seat , away from the electrical outlet , but he has not done so and when I asked him , quite directly , " Are we all right ? " he said " yes . "
So I took this as a general affirmation of my situation and existence in general .
I am removing everything from my bulging suitcases and settling in for the thirty - hour ordeal to Los Angeles .
I am hopeful that we will arrive in Los Angeles in time for me to catch the last bus to Pasadena .
Contingency measures are sort of in place , should I miss the bus , with a very last resort :
An expensive taxi ride to Mom 's retirement home .
8:45 p.m. Somewhere in Oregon .
Almost twelve hours into the train ride and feeling pretty good .
Just enjoyed a pleasant dinner with our two tour guides whose delightful and edifying explanation of the sights was cut short by an announcement that the movie " Ocean 11 " was about to be broadcast on the monitors in the sightseer lounge car .
Our other dining companion was a 28 - year - old biochemist from South Carolina who is studying a way to take the buzz out of drinking alcohol .
This did not make a whole lot of sense to me , but I 'm always glad to see the youth of America gainfully employed in scientific research .
I 'm getting a bit nervous about my toothpaste situation .
At the rate I 'm going I figure , if I 'm really careful , I just might make it to the final leg of the journey ( three meals left ) .
Wow !
A freight train just passed us with 85 cars and five engines !
Darkness is slowly settling in with only about 24 hours more to go .
Thank goodness the scenery is so pretty and the cars are so comfortable . . .
I just might not get bored !
Monday , June 3 . Oakland .
8:45 a.m .
It took two sleeping pills to knock me out last night after spending an hour trying to find a comfortable resting position in a coach seat .
I actually had two seats to myself and I eventually found a restful position , but I had to wear my sleep masque to get to LaLa Land .
I got eight hours of sleep and now I feel refreshed .
I was delighted to meet the New Zealand man and his white wife who I had met earlier on the Talgo train to Seattle .
They were now making their way back home and we exchanged our experiences and tales of our adventures .
I had a pleasant breakfast in the dining car , but am always amazed at the way they consistently overcharge me for my meals .
Yesterday they charged me $ 6 for my pie a la mode that cost $ 5 and they charged me $ 2 for a bowl of soup that never quite made it to my table .
And this morning they charged me $ 2 for a side of bacon that I did not order .
Oh well , I still give the dining car attendant a good tip , but I 'm not foolish enough to pay for something that I did not receive .
It 's a bit chilly and overcast .
The Japanese girls on the other side of the aisle ( who I thought were mocking my every movement ) have detrained and I have joyfully taken their seats .
So now I 'm on the oceanside of the train and I should find it quite enjoyable since the best scenery is about to come !
Only twelve hours to go and I feel great .
I 'm all clean and well - fed .
And now the conductor tells me there is a phone in the lounge car .
I have to go check this out .
10:30 a.m .
The train filled up in Oakland and nearly every seat in the coach is full and I 'm getting more than a little stressed out .
Downstairs an old lady is very upset upon discovering that the bag she had left in the vestibule was missing .
She is very distraught and I spent some time trying to help her locate it to no avail .
I found myself surrounded by people speaking Chinese : Loudly , emphatically .
To secure my own seat , I pulled out a Playboy that had a very graphic picture of Miss June on its cover .
I opened the magazine to a section that shouted out the headline , " Who Owns Your Sperm ? " in heavy 72 - point Bold San Serif type .
As people were searching for a seat I read the article feverishly , fully aware that people have difficulty minding their own business .
In the end , some middle - aged Indian fellow took the seat , but he has a family in another part of the car and he is spending his time with them .
It is so bizarre that in this permissive day and age , a tame Playboy magazine can generate such concern and raise eyebrows .
I bought it second hand at a newsstand in Albuquerque and even the young college - age lady who sold it to me seemed intent on putting it in a brown paper bag .
No , I insisted , I 'll just carry it out , I said .
Strange timeus we live in when a person has to hide a great publication like Playboy from people 's eyes .
All this talk about a young naked woman displaying her finer features distresses me .
Those tired - looking feminists call it " objectifying " and " degrading . "
That 's because they 're jealous and do n't have much to look at .
A young lady can easily make three thousand a day , if not more , modeling for a photographer on the East coast .
Hey , if you 've got it , flaunt it !
I 'll buy into it .
No problemo .
Here 's the cash .
Show me the money , honey .
Tuesday , June 4 , 6:30 p.m. Aboard the Southwest Chief .
Sitting at the back of the train , awaiting its departure from Los Angeles Union Station .
I 'm listening intently to the cell conversation of the lady sitting next to me .
She has a very distinct voice , one that projects well .
It 's a mystery to me why people think they can carry on a phone conversation and that it does not disturb others .
Recent research has shown that such conversations subject the rest of the cabin with dangerous electromagnetic frequencies .
This woman has lost her credit card and is running out of money .
Perhaps this is divine justice for her obnoxious phone habits .
I really screwed up last night .
The Coast Starlight arrived in Los Angeles at 8:35 pm , almost one half - hour ahead of schedule .
Instead of calling Mom or my sister , I headed to the bus stop , almost five blocks away , schlepping all my stuff on my handy cart .
When I arrived at the bus stop , I was greeted by the sight of my bus , the 401 North , leaving without me .
I 've learned to be philosophical about the sudden departure of buses .
There 's really not much one can do about them , so why fret ?
I figured that the next bus would be coming along in an hour and I would just wait for it to arrive .
In other words , when it comes to public transportation , I subscribe to the immortal words of G.K. Chesterton , " " The only way of catching a train I have ever discovered is to miss the train before . "
( Who says you ca n't end a sentence with a preposition ? )
Since I was essentially stuck on a busy street in the middle of downtown LA , a half - mile away from the station , and no payphones to be found , waiting seemed like a sensible solution ( remember , these were the days before I had a cell phone ) .
Unfortunately , as I learned later , the 9:30 401N bus to Pasadena broke down , so I waited for two mortal hours before the next bus arrived .... at 10:30 p.m .
In the meantime , the folks at home were getting worried and Selma jumped in the car and searched for me in the proximity of Union Station .
Regrettably , 95 percent of the buses do not pass by Union Station , so she must have been roaming the streets a few blocks away from where I was anxiously waiting .
So , instead of spending a lovely evening with Selma , I spent the evening at a bus stop in an unsavory part of downtown Los Angeles .
Thank God a bus driver finally did show up .
A soulful man , he recited poetry and chatted very pleasantly with the local natives in Spanish .
I enjoyed his company and rode to Mom 's retirement home in one piece .
When I finally appeared at her door at 11 p.m. , the inquisition began .
" We were so worried about you , why did n't you call when you got in ? "
" I thought the plan was for me to take the bus . "
" Selma said you agreed to call her . . . "
" Yes , if I got in trouble .
But I thought she was going to be on the other side of town .
I did n't know the bus would break down . "
Anyway , I screwed up .
I should have used a payphone to call Mom or Selma the moment I arrived in LA .
That would have saved me a lot of trouble and prevented hurt feelings .
I keep imposing my obsession with taking mass transportation on the lives of other people .
I assume I am doing them a favor by not making them pick me up .
The reality is that Los Angelinos do n't think twice about jumping in a car .
Sometimes I think they enjoy having an excuse to do so .
There 's something else haunting me .
These so - called sleeping pills that my doctor prescribed , these Ativan , are affecting me in strange ways .
They do n't so much as put me to sleep as cause me not to think right .
They do n't even put me to sleep .
They sedate me .
They make the muscles in my legs unresponsive .
I may be an Ativan junky .
Although I have tried to be moderate in their consumption , I have become dependent and gradually increased my dosage when I noticed they did n't kick in readily .
This whole escapade of not phoning home when I arrived at Union Station might be an indication that something is going terribly wrong in my head .
And I 'm sure that my tendency to mix the pills with alcohol has not helped the situation .
Oh my God , what have I done ?
Maybe I should dig deeper , beyond the pills .
There are times I think , when I am around my family my self - esteem plummets to the absolute depths of the ocean .
I feel like I have disrupted something important , that I am somehow in the way .
Not around Mom , of course , and not around Linda and Paul .
Not even so much around Selma really , just around her husband , Ace .
He 's a good fellow , really .
But I just can't be around him for very long before I feel like I 'm somehow in the way .
And so , here I am , returning to Albuquerque feeling refreshed but a little sad after last night 's screw up .
Well , things can't always work out perfectly and I assumed total responsibility for the mess and apologized to Selma ( on her answering machine ) .
I know it sounds crazy but the resolution of this misunderstanding took place entirely on the incoming tapes of Selma and Mom 's answering machines , as though the devices were some kind of electronic mediator .
I think we were both a bit angry , irritated , and disappointed by the events ( or lack thereof ) last night .
But somehow , despite the potential for this simple misunderstanding to totally flare out of control , the fire has been contained and extinguished .
A few glowing embers remain , but on the whole , I think everything has resolved itself quite neatly .
I feel much better having written about this and I regret the boredom that the gentle reader must feel in reading these words .
But I needed to write them down .
I need to vent in a way that I do not normally vent .
I needed to try to understand the complex dynamics between myself and my family .
Anyway , when I got home to mom's retirement hotel , after being properly reprimanded , Mother fed me , I took a shower and after watching a little TV , went to sleep .
I slept late into the morning and then listened to a message Selma had left for me before her departure on a plane to Mexico .
She was sorry we did not connect , regretted my disastrous bus experience and told me she loved me , several times .
She said it like she meant it and I believed her .
I called her and left a message on her machine , explaining to the best of my ability , what happened and why .
I apologized , showed remorse , all while Mother was listening and nodding in approval .
And so the matter was officially and forever CLOSED .
Next , we threw a couple loads in the washing machine and headed off for lunch at our favorite Chinese restaurant .
I ordered spicy seafood and Mom ordered sweet and sour chicken .
It was very pleasant .
Noteworthy was my fortune cookie that read , " The love that you seek is within you . "
Mom 's was something pragmatic , about financial planning .
Following lunch , we gathered our stuff together and she drove me to the corner where I caught the 401 South to the general area of Union Station .
Now I 'm sitting on an absolutely packed Southwest Chief Amtrak train bound for Albuquerque .
I stationed my very graphic " Playboy " magazine in the mesh pocket of the seatback in front of me , for all prospective passengers to see .
Eventually , I landed a pretty mellow guy who just plopped down next to me .
I must say , I am getting a kick out of displaying my Playboy magazine and Miss June for all to see .
Conductors and ticket collectors do n't seem to be shocked by it .
But the young women do n't seem to like it at all .
Oh well !
Wednesday , June 5 , 12:45 p.m. The Southwest Chief is running about 45 minutes late .
The Sandia Mountains loom in the distance and it's about time for me to pack it up and get ready to detrain .
I ate pancakes for breakfast but skipped dinner and lunch because I know the menu backward and forwards and I 'm sick of it .
Half the train got off in Flagstaff so they could connect with the bus that goes to the Grand Canyon .
I headed down to the lounge car where I met up with my seatmate , Jeff .
We drank two bottles of red wine together and talked about women .
Later , I grabbed my sleeping role and bunked down on the soft leather bench seats of the ground level café car and swallowed two sleeping pills .
I found it hard to get to sleep , being so close to the tracks and the bench was narrow .
Next time I will definitely sleep on the sightseer car , one floor overhead .
Perhaps that will hold the key to a good night 's rest .
Well , it has been an excellent trip .
Hope the three rolls of the film I took turn out all right .
This vacation had a few setbacks , but all relatively minor .
Now it 's back to work tomorrow .
But first I will take a nice bath and then a good night 's sleep .
When I arrive in town I grab a couple newspapers and am delighted to see that a couple editorials that I had written to editors actually made it to print .
A happy coincidence indeed !

Letter to the editor
Long Train Runnin '?
By Charles Reuben
Do n't you just feel a chill run down your spine every time you see Amtrak 's Southwest Chief pull into the downtown station bound for Chicago or Los Angeles ?
I gave up flying altogether five years ago and have been traveling long distances exclusively by Amtrak ever since .
We are truly blessed to have the train run right through the center of town .
Traveling by passenger train is a fascinating experience from a technical standpoint , as well as ecologically ( the Sierra Club loves it ) and financially ( it 's dirt cheap ) .
Train travel has also taught me that people are in way too much of a hurry to get from A to B .
I mean , what 's the rush ?
Unfortunately , if you have never traveled cross-country by Amtrak , you may never have the chance ; Amtrak is in danger of becoming extinct .
You may never know what it is like to eat outstanding food served to you on linen tablecloths by attentive waiters in the dining car .
You may never know what it is like to lounge in the observation car and watch the scenery pass you by .
Amtrak is very much on the chopping block this year .
Although it may manage to survive on the East and West coasts , its long - distance routes are in jeopardy .
The High - Speed Rail Investment Act ( S.250 ) is now before Congress and if it passes , Amtrak will have the means to stay alive and improve its service .
Senator Bingaman is a member of the Senate Committee on Finance to which this bill has been referred and would like to hear from you .
Senator Domenici wrote me a personal letter on June 13 .
He said , " I recognize the importance of Amtrak to our nation , and to New Mexico in particular .
Amtrak provides many Americans with a viable alternative to air and highway travel . "
" In addition , as America continues to grow exponentially , we must have the necessary infrastructure to utilize different modes of travel , including rail transit . "
" Amtrak serves as a safe , energy - efficient mode of travel , providing transportation for Americans of all levels of income . "
In the U.S. , taxpayers spend more money on road salt than they do on passenger rail travel .
Consider the numbers :
Last year we spent 33 billion dollars on highways .
We also spent $ 14 billion to support air transport .
But we only spent around $ 500 million on passenger rail .
Amtrak ridership has been going up dramatically in the past few years thanks to its low fares , its " satisfaction guarantee " ( the only guarantee of its nature in the travel business ) , and its new frequent rider program .
The revenue generated by Amtrak has also gone up .
Furthermore , Amtrak is now diversifying its services to carry mail and freight as well , which will further cut its costs .
So why on earth would we want to disband Amtrak ?
Highways and airports do little to generate money that will support their own infrastructure .
They contribute to urban sprawl , congestion , pollution , and the mortality rate .
They are also the most fuel - inefficient means of transportation .
Write , e-mail or phone your Senator or Congressperson right now and tell them that you want to see long - distance passenger train travel continue and flourish in this country .
Because if you have n't traveled by Amtrak , you just do n't know what you 're missing .

Editorial
Lamenting the Loss of the Southwest Chief
By Charles Reuben
When people ask me , " What brought you to New Mexico from Chicago ? "
I say , " The Southwest Chief . "
I 'm talking about that coach - sleeper - dining - sightseer - baggage - freight - combination that makes up the best damn train ride in the continental United States .
( And do n't forget those four massive 4,200 horsepower GE locomotives , each capable of generating enough electricity to light 800 homes ! )
I am talking about one of only 16 surviving long - distance , overnight national treasures that the politicians in Washington want to kill .
When Amtrak , our national passenger train system is gone , the only way we 'll be able to get out of town will be to hop on an airplane or jump on the freeway .
In 1920 there were 254,000 miles of passenger rails covering the USA .
At last count there were 21,400 miles of surviving passenger rails spread out over 44 routes .
And Amtrak actually owns only 623 miles of that track !
I do n't give a damn if the locks on the bathrooms of those ' 70s - era Streamliner coach cars open by themselves .
I do n't care if the ride 's a little bumpy because the roadbed is pulverized by freight trains .
And I do n't care if the Southwest Chief travels at only 90 miles per hour .
I think Amtrak runs a helluva fine railroad with the crumbs Congress throws its way and it would be a crime if they gave it the axe .
And it looks like Amtrak will die in October 2002 , unless a miracle happens soon .
Did you know that Amtrak spends about as much to keep its 21,400 - mile intercity passenger rail system running as San Francisco spends on its 95 - mile Bay Area Rapid Transit system ?
Or that Amtrak serves more than 500 communities in more than 45 states ?
Did you know that more than 23,000 people get on the train in Albuquerque every year and 22,000 people get off ?
Last year , Amtrak served more than 23.5 million people :
The rich , the poor , the handicapped , tourists from home and abroad , all enjoyed the tiny subsidy taxpayers enthusiastically invest in rail transit .
Those oilmen in Washington actually think somebody would be crazy enough to buy the Southwest Chief and run it in the place of Amtrak .
Do you know any buyers ?
England spent the last five years privatizing its railroads and all it got out of it was spectacular train wrecks , skyrocketing ticket prices and bankruptcy .
Let 's face it :
When the Southwest Chief is gone , intercity train travel will be gone and the U.S. will be the only industrialized nation without a national passenger train service .
As it is , I know I can buy a $ 120 round trip ticket to Los Angeles and visit my Mom or go to Chicago round trip for a couple hundred bucks .
Along the way I 'll eat gourmet food served on a white tablecloth in the dining car and watch a nimble waiter pour a hot stream of coffee from two feet high and not spill a drop .
Where else can I kick back in an observation car with a bottle of wine , meander through pristine wilderness and watch a buxom Amish woman attempt to control her impish children ?
Where else can I get a seat in coach next to somebody like Albuquerque - based massage therapist Martha Hillegass , become the best of friends and end my long voyage with a free Hawaiian Lomi Lomi treatment ?
Fact is , I can't just jump on a jet fuel - guzzling plane like the rest of you .
First , I 've got to go to Lovelace Hospital and subject myself to a macabre $ 1,000 operation where the surgeon implants little " pressure equalization " tubes in my eardrums .
Having done that , my eardrums wo n't perforate when the plane lands , causing me to scream and frighten the other passengers .
But the tubes are more trouble than they 're worth :
They fall out after six months and cause infections .
That 's why I gave up flying five years ago .
Yes , the Southwest Chief brought me to New Mexico when I was a gangly 14 - year - old on my way to the Philmont Boy Scout Ranch in Cimarron .
And it brought me to Lamy , New Mexico when I was a know - it - all 18 - year - old on my way to St. John 's College in Santa Fe .
In the last six months alone , I have traveled 11,679 miles on Amtrak , from Vancouver B.C. all the way to Miami , Florida .
And I loved every single mile of it .
But unless a miracle happens , long - distance train travel will no longer be regarded as basic , affordable transportation for the American public .
Passenger rail will go the way of the ocean liners :
Only for people with money to burn .
I have written my congressmen , published letters in the paper , and driven my friends crazy discussing Amtrak : I am an Amtrak activist , and I am praying for a miracle .
However , I am also beginning to see the writing on the wall and am preparing for the worst .

Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder affecting one in 100 people worldwide .
Most cases are n't detected until a person starts experiencing symptoms like delusions and hallucinations as a teenager or adult .
By that time , the disease has often progressed so far that it can be difficult to treat .
In a paper published recently online by the American Journal of Psychiatry , researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Columbia University provide the first evidence that brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia risk are detectable in babies only a few weeks old .
" It allows us to start thinking about how we can identify kids at risk for schizophrenia very early and whether there things that we can do very early on to lessen the risk , " said lead study author John H. Gilmore , MD , professor of psychiatry and director of the UNC Schizophrenia Research Center .
The scientists used ultrasound and MRI to examine brain development in 26 babies born to mothers with schizophrenia .
Having a first - degree relative with the disease raises a person 's risk of schizophrenia to one in 10 .
Among boys , the high - risk babies had larger brains and larger lateral ventricles -- fluid - filled spaces in the brain -- than babies of mothers with no psychiatric illness .
" Could it be that enlargement is an early marker of a brain that 's going to be different ? "
Gilmore speculated .
Larger brain size in infants is also associated with autism .
The researchers found no difference in brain size among girls in the study .
This fits the overall pattern of schizophrenia , which is more common , and often more severe , in males .
The findings do not necessarily mean the boys with larger brains will develop schizophrenia .
Relatives of people with schizophrenia sometimes have subtle brain abnormalities but exhibit few or no symptoms .
" This is just the very beginning , " said Gilmore .
" We 're following these children through childhood . "
The team will continue to measure the children 's brains and will also track their language skills , motor skills and memory development .
They will also continue to recruit women to the study to increase the sample size .
This research provides the first indication that brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia can be detected early in life .
Improving early detection could allow doctors to develop new approaches to prevent high - risk children from developing the disease .
" The research will give us a better sense of when brain development becomes different , " said Gilmore .
" And that will help us target interventions . "
The paper is available now online and will be published in the September issue of the journal .
The study was funded by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Foundation of Hope .
In addition to Gilmore , authors of the study were Chaeryon Kang , Dianne D. Evans , Honor M. Wolfe , J. Keith Smith , Weili Lin , Robert M. Hamer , Martin Styner , and Guido Gerig .
Author Jeffrey A. Lieberman , chairs the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University .
When Marty Mueller 's baby was stillborn a few weeks before she was due to give birth , she and her husband spent several hours at the hospital , holding their son , grieving , and snapping photographs before sending him to the mortuary .
As the day wore on , Troy 's skin became discolored , and the signs of decay were clearly visible in the developed pictures .
So Marty , a professional photographer , did what came naturally to her : she re-touched the snapshots to make them look better , digitally creating the rosy - cheeked , healthy baby she never had .
She shared Troy 's pictures at a bereavement group in Santa Cruz , California , and was soon besieged by requests from anguished parents asking her to retouch their stillborn photographs as well .
Today , she has turned the requests into a sideline business , for which she suggests a donation of $ 30 to $ 50 per picture .
" It ’s difficult for parents to share these pictures with people because many times the pictures are too gruesome and they do n't want to shock anyone , " Mueller said .
" It 's much easier to share pictures if it looks like normal baby . "
Many of her clients , who hail from around the world , carry the photographs in their wallets or display them , portrait - style , in their homes .
While grieving parents have long shared pictures of their stillborn babies in support groups , and have recently created virtual memorials to their lost children on the Internet , doctoring the images and publicly exhibiting them is a relatively new phenomenon .
Parents who request the service say the touched - up photos help them deal with their devastating loss , but some experts fear that they may be avoiding reality .
" I keep a framed pictures of my daughter in my living room so everyone can see how beautiful she was , " said Jennifer Johnstone , one of Mueller 's clients who lost her baby at 35 weeks .
( Babies are normally born 40 weeks from the mother 's last menstrual period ) .
" We have a 3 - year - old son , who can look at this picture and say , " Hey , that 's my baby sister , Madison .
She 's in heaven . "
Jenese Parra only had one photo of her son Nathan – snapped by nursing staff after her full - term son was born lifeless at 39 weeks – and it was a lousy one .
His skin was bruised and peeling badly .
" Even though I could look past that and see my son for what he really looked like , I knew others would n't look past it and wanted his photos retouched so ( they ) could see Nathan as I did , " said Parra , who carries Mueller 's picture of her son in her billfold and displays them in her house and in her work cubicle .
" He looks just like a sleeping baby and it makes people more comfortable talking about it with me , which in turn makes me feel better because I can talk about it . "
Historically , world cultures have treated stillborns as less - than - human tragedies that should be quickly disposed of and forgotten .
In medieval Europe , for example , children who did not live long enough to be christened were not buried in hallowed ground , said Francesca Bray , an anthropology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara .
But modern technologies such as ultrasounds have given expectant parents a deeper connection to their unborn child than ever before , revealing the fetus 's sex , health and development mere weeks from conception .
" It seems to me the wish to make a true and memorable person of a stillborn connects to a completely new sense of connection that people now have to the fetus from very early in its existence , " Bray said .
But one psychologist said that doctored photographs are a " step away from reality . "
" It 's unnatural , " said Matt Zimmerman , a psychologist who specializes in loss .
" It goes against the grain of what actually happened .
How can you come to accept a loss if you 're working towards pretending it did n't occur ?
This goes against my clinical experience and substantial research on grief . "
But the photographers doctoring the images disagree .
" If you have a child that was lost at age 2 or 5 or 20 and you hung their picture on the living room wall , no one would say anything .
What makes a stillborn less of a child ? " asked Deanna Roy , an Austin photographer who has retouched over 100 pictures of stillborns .
She does not charge her clients , who come to her by word - of - mouth .
Roy , who miscarried a baby at 5 months , still regrets having the baby surgically removed instead of delivering it and holding it in her arms .
She says that giving other parents a memento of what they lost has helped alleviate her loss .
Her work is grueling – she spends two to four hours on each picture - – but she has yet to turn down a photograph , no matter how grisly .
Some of the photographs she gets are of 20 - week fetuses with transparent skin .
Others are of babies that have been dead in the womb for so long that their facial features have dissolved , requiring her to redraw them .
" The fact that they 're so gruesome is what motivates me to fix them , " said Roy , who is so overwhelmed by requests that she asked that her website not be linked in this article .
When she e-mails the photos to her clients , she advises them to open the attachment in a quiet place , because they are frequently shaken by renewed anguish at seeing a reflection of what their baby would have looked like , had it lived .
For Hector Davila , who runs a photo restoration service at the corner of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles , most of his work focuses on prolonging the youth and beauty of Hollywood actors or restoring cracked snapshots from bygone eras .
The number of clients requesting photo touch - ups of stillborn babies has steadily grown in the past few years , he says .
" Stillborn babies are the hardest pictures I 've worked on , " said Davila , who set up a separate website for this niche market .
" Try staring at one of those pictures for a couple of hours .
It 's almost like working in a funeral home .
But it 's the least I can do for the mothers of the world . "

Gulf states also begin to flee from collapsing single currency
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , June 2 , 2010
The Central Bank of Iran is set to dump a whopping 45 billion euros in exchange for gold bullion and dollars as Gulf states also prepare to flee from the ailing single currency amidst debt turmoil in Europe that threatens to disintegrate the entire region .
According to the Iranian state website Press TV , Iran ’s central bank has already begun converting its euro reserves into gold and dollars as a response to the “ downward spiral ” of the euro , in the first of a three phase movement to flee from the currency .
The report also claims that Gulf states are also beginning to switch their euro reserves into dollars and gold as some forecast the single currency could sink to parity with the U.S. dollar by next year .
“ The new decision comes as the financial crisis that began in the US about two years ago resulted in the sharp devaluation of the dollar , pushing the Iranian government to order the replacement of the greenback with the euro in the country ’s foreign exchange accounts , ” adds the report .
This is all a far cry from the days when businesses in New York accepted payments in euros as the currency reigned supreme over the beaten up U.S. dollar .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The European Central Bank has blatantly been manipulating currency markets over recent days in an effort to rescue the euro , which has been in free fall .
Sinking to as low as $ 1.2111 yesterday , the euro staged a rapid and dramatic recovery against the dollar , soaring back to 1.2339 , an intraday move of 250 pips and a transparent intervention that had “ all the grace of a drunk Keynesian at an Austrian economists meeting , ” reports Zero Hedge .
But while central bank interventions would in the past keep a currency buoyant for days or weeks , the euro immediately slipped down again , indicating a clear crisis of confidence and a currency in terminal decline .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Gold has hit record highs against all major currencies in the last few months as it remains the only true store of wealth in times of economic chaos and depreciating fiat money .
Demand for the precious metal is once again hitting fever pitch as the U.S. Mint announces that it has sold 190,000 1 - ounce American Eagle gold coins in May , the largest amount in a single month for over 11 years .
Buyers in Europe are also desperately scrambling to purchase the scant amounts of gold available , with the Greek Central Bank now selling one ounce coins at the equivalent of $ 1,700 dollars , nearly $ 500 dollars above spot price .
“ As long as governments continue to struggle with spiraling debts and are forced to crank up the printing presses , gold will continue to outperform currencies , a situation which is unlikely to change any time soon , ” we wrote on April 30 .
Now gold bulls like Peter Schiff are predicting the incredible – that gold could soar to around $ 10,000 an ounce as a consequence of a dramatic fall in supply due to significantly less gold mining .
Gold companies now have to drill as much as 2.3 miles to get to the yellow metal in places like South Africa , whereas central banks merely need to press a button to increase the supply of depreciating fiat money .

June 17 , 2010 , Durban -- Daily News --
The sound of vuvuzelas cut through the air in Durban on June 16 -- but for one large group there was little to celebrate .
Amid cries of phansi ngama - fat cats , phansi ( down with fat cats , down ) and a sea of banners proclaiming the government cared only for the rich , civil rights organisations took to the streets protesting against poor service delivery and the World Cup .
[ Photos below . ]
Abahlali Base Mjondolo , KwaZulu - Natal Subsistence Fisher 's Forum , Clairwood Social Forum and about 17 other organisations gathered for what they dubbed an " anti- Thiefa " protest march which started at Dinizulu Park and ended at City Hall yesterday .
" The R40 billion the government has spent on the World Cup could have comfortably housed three million homeless South Africans " , said Alice Thomson of the Durban Social Forum .
" Soccer will not make a better life for all -- it will only make the rich richer and the poor poorer , " Thomson said .
This week , Thomson was arrested for distributing anti-FIFA pamphlets at the Fifa Fan Fest in Durban .
Bongani Mthembu , of the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance , said that the decision to hold the protest on Youth Day was deliberate .
" Youth Day is an opportunity for us as the youth to air our grievances and raise our concerns .
We can show the foreigners here the truth about what 's happening behind the World Cup " , he said .
Chairman of KZN Subsistence Fisher 's Forum Essop Mohamed said : " Some people were ' tired of falling by the wayside ' .
We are marching against oppression . "
They let FIFA come here and do what they want , but they wo n't let us fish " , he said , referring to a city ruling to bar fishing in certain areas along the beachfront .
Said Shamitha Naidoo , community chairwoman in Pinetown of Abahlali Base Mjondolo : " We need to show them ( tourists ) what 's happening .
How will these poor people benefit from the World Cup ? "
Protester Kirubavathi Pillay , 68 , was also angry at what she said was the inability of the eThekwini Municipality to deliver adequate services .
" No one worries about us .
We can't manage without some help from the government , " Pillay said .
" They are not fighting for us .
We must fight for us " , added Jaysh Ramphul , another marcher .

MEMORANDUM OF GRIEVANCES
DATE : June 16 , 2010
TO : KZN Premier Zweli Mkhize , Durban Mayor Obed Mlaba , Deputy Mayor Logie Naidoo and Durban City Manager Michael Sutcliffe
RE : Grievances about World Cup 2010 management
We are the citizenry of Durban .
Our organisations have long registered grievances about the way the city is being run .
In recent months , we have found that many of our problems are worsening , especially because of the way the World Cup has been implemented by FIFA , its corporate partners , politicians and bureaucrats .
While in principle we do not oppose Durban hosting seven World Cup games , we are very opposed to many decisions made by FIFA and city , provincial and national officials .
The problems we record below require urgent attention and immediate remedial action .
Economic burden
• Whereas Durban ’s 70 000 - seater Moses Mabhida Stadium cost taxpayers R3.1 billion ; the cost escalation for Mabhida rose from an initial R1.8 billion ; and redirecting most of this spending could have erased the majority of the vast backlogs Durban faces , of housing , water / sanitation , electricity , clinics , schools and roads ;
• Mabhida ’s next - door neighbour is Absa Stadium , home of Sharks rugby , which seats 52 000 and which could easily have been extended
( considering that Durban municipality will knock out 15 000 seats from Mabhida after July ) ;
• the companies and individuals that have profited most from Mabhida ’s construction include multinational corporations and those responsible for notorious municipal disasters , such as bus privatiser Remant Alton and Point development failure Dolphin Whispers , along with at least one fake Black Economic Empowerment front company ;
• the import bill for Mabhida appears unreasonable , as reflected in breakdowns of Mabhida ’s Sky Car due to imported German cables held up for repair by the Icelandic volcano , and in imported German tents erected next to Mabhida by an imported German marquee construction crew ;
• the soaring foreign and domestic debt we are now suffering because of World Cup expenses will cause untold problems for the SA economy in years to come ; FIFA is not subject to South African taxes ; FIFA is also allowed to ignore SA exchange control regulations ; and the FIFA profit estimate is more than R25 billion ;
Corruption and state failure
• whereas this kind of extreme waste and crony capitalism typifies the relationship of FIFA to host governments ; bribery and corruption have been associated with FIFA ’s operations ( as documented in lawsuits in Zug and New York ) ; bribes have been predicted ( by England ’s former World Cup bid manager ) that would distort play by some of the leading teams coming to South Africa ; and corruption whistle - blowing in Mpumalanga Province led to several suspicious deaths , reportedly by organised hit squads ;
• Durban ’s own recent corruption in the construction of low - cost housing by Zikhulise Cleaning , Maintenance and Transport became a national scandal ; Durban housing official Nigel Gumede and City Manager Mike Sutcliffe rejected the findings of the National Home Builders ’ Registration Council report which shows extensive wrongdoing – one third of houses in Umlazi requiring reconstruction - in a R300 million contract begun in December 2006 ; politically - connected Zikhulise owners Shauwn and S’bu Mpisane have a notoriously luxurious lifestyle with a car fleet worth a reported R100 million ;
• Durban ’s Council and ward committee system has become a form of top - down political control ; Council does not take our voices upwards ; the democratic gains that were won in 1994 are also our victories , but have been taken from us ;
• the September 2009 attack on the Abahlali baseMjondolo ( AbM ) movement , its leaders and well known members , their family members and its offices in the Kennedy Road settlement apparently received the backing of the local ruling party and government structures ; many AbM members cannot go back to Kennedy Road ; and several of the Kennedy Road 13 are being imprisoned interminably without bail or being charged ;
• the Durban council has made clear its intent to demolish the Early Morning Market at Warwick Junction in favour of a shopping mall ; the Early Morning Market is one of the surviving monuments of the indentured Indian labourers ; and hundreds of jobs – as well as affordable edibles – for poor people are at stake ;
• Durban fisherfolk have witnessed rich people fishing off expensive boats and yachts unhindered while working - class subsistence fishermen suffer police harassment and arrests ; fishermen have recently been denied access to New Pier , the South Pier , the Bluff military base and the quayside shore ( Gunter Gulley , Yacht Mole , Lucky Dip ) ; and there is worsening sea-water pollution – rubbish , oil and chemicals in the harbour – and apparently no environmental precautions being taken ;
• Durban ’s hundreds of thousands of immigrants are under sustained attack ; the May 2008 xenophobic attacks demonstrated a failed municipal state which by August washed its hands of ongoing xenophobia crisis and by November used police brutality to displace desperate refugees ; Lesotho migrant workers are protesting the revocation of the ‘ six month ’ system of border concessions ; there remain inadequate support systems and preventative measures against another xenophobia attack ; and immigrants continue to face oppression in their dealings with the South African government and police ;
Workers , the poor and communities under attack
• whereas this country is rich because of the theft of our land and because of our work in the farms , mines , factories , kitchens and laundries of the rich ; and that wealth is therefore also our wealth ;
• the working class and poor of Durban are under severe pressure because of the world and SA economic crises , which have not yet lifted for us , costing the country more than a million lost jobs and leaving Durban badly exposed in sectors like shipping , clothing and textiles ; poor and working people are being pushed out of any meaningful access to citizenship ; recent government statistics prove the urban poor are becoming poorer ; and we are being forced off land and out of our cities ;
• too many of us who have formal water and electricity connections have not been able to afford the fast - rising costs of these services and face disconnection ; the promise of housing has been downgraded to forced removal to a transit camp more like prisons than homes ; housing that has been built exists in human dumping grounds far outside of the cities and far from work , schools , clinics and libraries ; and there is a new , heavy - handed , privatised municipal debt collection strategy that is wrecking state - community relationships ;
• poor flat dwellers have suffered from unaffordable and exploitative rents ; and the poor have been forced to sign exploitative rental agreements under duress and threat of eviction ;
• farm dwellers have suffered the impoundment of cattle , demolition of homes , denial of the right to bury loved ones , denial of basic service and brutality ( and sometimes murder ) at the hands of some farmers ; and a biased justice system which has systematically undermined farm dwellers ;
• outsourcing of casualised labour has become a full - fledged crisis , as witnessed in the revolt by Stallion Security workers who were exploited at Moses Mabhida and four other stadiums to the extent of protesting in the face of police stun grenades , tear gas and rubber bullets ; crises caused by Durban ’s labour brokers include the ports – partly responsible for a recent three - week strike by transport workers – and the University of KwaZulu - Natal , where underpaid workers ( less than R1000 take - home pay for UKZN cleaners ) are suffering ;
World Cup ’s pro-rich bias
• whereas while the rich have benefited from the World Cup , the poor have not ; the Zakumi doll mascot and other memorabilia were made in China not South Africa ; Durban ’s informal street traders have been displaced and barred from selling in the vicinity of stadiums ; and Durban fisherfolk have been evicted from the city ’s main North Beach and South Beach piers ;
• township soccer facilities were meant to be created and maintained with state subsidies but have not been ; and street kids were brutally displaced from central Durban in advance of the World Cup ; according to former chief executive of the South African Premier Soccer League Trevor Phillips ; “ Durban has two football teams which attract crowds of only a few thousand .
It would have been more sensible to have built smaller stadiums nearer the football - loving heartlands and used the surplus funds to have constructed training facilities in the townships ” ;
• FIFA ’s tourist initiatives are based on what it calls ‘ luxurious ambiance ’ not working - class hospitality ; promises of 450 000 international visitors for the World Cup were high overestimates ; and many jobs in the tourism sector were shed when the overestimates became apparent ;
Public transport
• whereas many in Durban continue to be dependent upon private automobiles ( with resulting adverse impacts on climate change ) ; there has been a sharp decline in Durban ’s public transport compared to other South African cities which have begun investing in the Bus Rapid Transit system ; a government web - site ( www.sa2010.gov.za) promised benefits for the host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Soccer including “ a fast , comfortable and low cost urban transport system … for central business districts but also in townships ” ;
• Durban officials have implemented air - conditioned “ People Mover ” buses with security guards at every stop , running every 15 minutes from 06h00 until 23h00 , but only in the city centre and along the beachfront , mostly for the benefit of tourists ; there is still terribly inadequate public transport in both the townships and suburbs , and many areas are currently unserviced , and others have with an infrequent and unreliable service with no bus timetables available ;
Environment
• whereas the ‘ greenwashing ’ of the World Cup includes incorrect claims by Durban officials that the CO2 permanently emitted in the vast cement construction plus increased air travel can be ‘ offset ’ by planting trees ( which themselves are only a temporary , fragile container of CO2 because they emit the same carbon when they die and biodegrade ) ; officials brag about ‘ carbon credits ’ from burning methane from rubbish dumps in a World Bank Clean Development Mechanism project ( even though such ‘ emissions trading ’ is a dangerous distraction from fighting climate change ) , and the poorest people of Durban will suffer the most from climate change ;
• there is no sense in constructing new coal - fired plants ( such as Medupi ) and nuclear generators so as to give further electricity subsidies to vast multinational corporations such as BHP Billiton ( which receives the world ’s cheapest power ) ; 100 % renewable energy is a pre-requisite to avert global climate disruptions ; the refusal to phase out coal , oil and gas also causes military conflicts , magnifying social and environmental injustice ; and governments ; corporations such as BP continue to support and finance fossil fuel exploration , extraction and activities that worsen global warming such as forest degradation and destruction on a massive scale , while dedicating only token sums to renewable energy , and leaving areas like South Durban with some of the world ’s worst air pollution due to oil refining ;
• global climate disruptions – extreme weather events , droughts , floods , increased disease , scarce water - are already disproportionately felt by small island states , coastal peoples , indigenous peoples , local communities , fisherfolk , women , youth , poor people , elderly and marginalised communities ;
Our rights of expression
• whereas according to the bid proposal and subsequent contracts with the South African government , FIFA was given full indemnity “ against all proceedings , claims and related costs ( including professional adviser fees ) which may be incurred or suffered by or threatened by others ; ” and in addition , “ Police officers and other peace officials will be provided to enforce the protection of the marketing rights , broadcast rights , marks and other intellectual property rights of FIFA an its commercial partners ” – as witnessed in the ridiculous arrest of Dutch women whose only crime was to wear an orange dress to Soccer City for the Holland - Denmark game ;
• our own leading journalists are stifled from reporting on FIFA ’s wrongdoing because of a required pledge not to throw the organisation into ‘ disrepute ’ as a prerequisite for accreditation , as witnessed by the refusal of the national broadcaster to show the documentary film Fahrenheit 2010 made partly in Durban ;
• the murder of three young men in Phoenix earlier this month is yet more evidence of local police brutality , as was the excessive force – stun grenades , tear gas and rubber bullets - used to subdue non-violent Stallion Security workers protesting at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Monday , June 14 ;
We therefore demand
• adequate compensation to Durban ratepayers and national taxpayers for the windfall profits made by construction of unnecessary stadiums such as Moses Mabhida , investigations into extreme cost escalations , and a renewed commitment for a fiscal boost to remove South Africa ’s vast backlogs of housing , water / sanitation , electricity , clinics , schools and roads ;
• immediate imposition of taxation and exchange controls on multinational and local corporations associated with the World Cup , on grounds that contracts entered into with FIFA are legally Odious ;
• investigations into bribery and corruption associated with FIFA contracts and World Cup construction in Durban and especially in Mpumalanga Province , and full criminal investigations into Durban ’s own recent corruption scandals ;
• a thorough overhaul of Durban ’s Council and ward committee system so as to introduce genuine democracy and popular participation ;
• a commission of inquiry into events associated with the jailing of the Abahlali baseMjondolo Kennedy Road 13 , their unconditional release , and the right - of - return of AbM to Kennedy Road ;
• the end of municipal harassment of traders , especially in the Early Morning Market at Warwick Junction , and subsidies that would permit it to become an historic monument , having just marked the market ’s centenary ;
• the end of municipal harassment of Durban fisherfolk , the imposition of more reasonable fishing license fees , and a recommitment to cleaning the harbour and beaches of pollution of all sorts ;
• a renewed commitment to combating the scourge of xenophobia ;
• a redistribution of the society ’s income and wealth so that South Africa is no longer the world ’s most unequal major economy , an end to the municipal debt collection strategy and other systems that worsen inequality , and increases in free basic water and electricity allotments financed through a luxury consumption tax on those who use too much ;
• an end to exploitative rental and housing arrangements , to oppression of rural people and to injustice against farm dwellers ;
• a ban on labour broking , as has long been promised by the ruling party ;
• a dramatic increase in township soccer and sports facilities ;
• follow - through on the promise of “ a fast , comfortable and low cost urban transport system … for central business districts but also in townships ” and an expansion of “ People Mover ” buses across metro eThekwini ;
• an end to new coal - fired plants and nuclear generators so as to save the environment from certain destruction , stringent monitoring of air and water quality and public access to the findings , strict law enforcement against polluters and littering , a commitment to proper maintenance of all Durban ’s green areas in a cohesive , sensitive , responsible and inclusive manner for the benefit of the environment and the people of Durban not just the city elite , dedication to the eradication and control of alien species with a view to permanent job creation , and strict enforcement of city bylaws by Metro Police to prevent urban decay , slum development and the resultant health hazards and environmental degradation ;
• a retraction of indemnity to FIFA and end to the order prohibiting journalists from throwing FIFA into ‘ disrepute ’ as a prerequisite for accreditation ;
• an end to police brutality , proper policing of all neighbourhoods , and redirection of policing resources spent on FIFA to all citizens ;
• an end to the arrogant , authoritarian , exclusive , insensitive , parochial decision - making processes undertaken by the Ethekwini Municipality throughout all areas of its jurisdiction .
When considering the speed and lavishness with which services were delivered for the 2010 World Cup , we have no doubt the above demands can be met timeously and professionally .
Oh go read this essay by 15 - year - old gay Kentucky blogger Brent , about his quest to get gay characters stocked in local libraries .
This is a kid who runs his own book blog (! ) and , rather than list his favorite Top 40 artists on an overstuffed MySpace page , lists his favorite book characters and authors that inspire him .
Fall in love .
He writes : “ When I set out to find more LGBT titles , I turned to my school ’s library .
Honestly ?
It was pathetic .
There was not one single LGBT novel .
But oh , of course the librarian went out of her way to buy books about gangs , drugs , and teen pregnancy .
Like , for real , the people who actually do care about gangs , drugs , and teen sex sure as hell do n’t read–they ’re too busy ( note : gangs , drugs , and teen sex .
Yeah , they ’re going to interrupt all that fabulous action to sit and read a good novel ! ) .
When I asked her about it , she replied , ‘ This is a school library .
If you are looking to read inappropriate titles , go to a book store . ’
Uhm , how in the hell is LGBT YA lit ‘ inappropriate ’ ? ”
When Brent went to his city library , the only gay book he could find was The Meaning of Matthew .
“ The world needs more librarians who serve the purpose of finding the right book to put in the right person ’s lap .
Not librarians who think that they can decide what ’s ‘ inappropriate ’ and what ’s not , based on their personal prejudices . ”
Do we need a new Star Trek TV series ?
Yes — with the present vacuum of big - ticket scifi and adventure shows , a new , Federation - centric
Trek series could rule the ratings .
Advertisement
Hollywood has had a thing for remakes lately .
This weekend alone will see new adaptations of The Karate Kid and The A - Team .
We 've already had Nightmare on Elm Street and silly Clash of the Titans .
The Birds , Child 's Play and Footloose are all in the works .
It 's irritating and tiresome that Hollywood feels so overwhelmingly nostalgic .
But if they can't help themselves , I suggest that take a recent reproduction , Star Trek , and spin it back to television .
Advertisement
I would never call myself a Trekkie .
I was a comic book nerd , yes , but not sufficiently geeky to wander into outer space .
In fact , I 'm still not sure I 've seen Star Wars from original start to original finish .
Star Trek : The Next Generation , however , proved to be the exception .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Perhaps it was the technology , or the compelling , storylines .
Perhaps it was Captain Picard with his sultry , philosophical ways .
Whatever the reason , Next Generation remained a secret pleasure for at least a few of my adolescent years .
It 's still a favorite , and recently I 've found myself recording episodes and thinking , " They could do this again . "
The televisual grounds are fertile for a new Trek installment .
With Lost , 24 and Ugly Betty all off the air , and Sci-Fi smash Battlestar Galactica 's cultural influence ebbing , viewers will be hungry for compelling action , adventure and romance .
And space presents endless possibilities .
But what would be appealing to people who have fond Trek memories , although are n't rabid fans ?
The people like me [ men 19 - 49 ] who can bring in big ratings ?
I asked some of my peers that exact question .
Advertisement
A new series would need to address timely , relevant questions .
How does the Utopia -esque Federation of Planets incorporate its globes and colonies ?
How do you balance innate cultures with the Federation 's lofty ideals ?
" Star Trek is all about finding new cultures and , when possible , adding them to the Federation , " wondered my friend Teelin .
" In the stories it always is a good thing , but in reality whenever that happens we force religion and bring smallpox . "
The Federation would become the European Union of a fictionalized future .
Another pal , Ben agreed on this possible plot , but did us one better .
" Yeah , your direction is kind of interesting , " he said , " but it could even be broadened to have a sort of Law and Order type plot .
The ship goes out to bring new worlds into the Federation , and / or addresses interstellar crime and punishment . "
The crew and viewer are then forced to address a moral , possibly even serialized , dilemma decorated in top - notch Sci-Fi accoutrements .
What could be better ?
Advertisement
Plus , there are loads of angles writers could take with the Federation 's " prime directive , " a political philosophy that forbids member " states " from getting involved in other planet 's domestic affairs .
It 's kind of like today 's Westphalian sovereignty , only on a larger scale , and not as endangered .
Okay , so now we 're onto something .
But one of the most complicated plot problems when approaching a franchise is when .
That Terminator reboot , which I gave a fair shot , had a few problems with chronology , and Star Trek 's collective time line gets more than a little convoluted .
The newest movie introduced time travel , a device that does n't necessarily translate well to television .
Case - in - point : Heroes , where even the characters could n't keep track of their respective eras .
Advertisement
To solve time - related conundrums , this new fantasy Trek can take place around the time of last chronological installment , Star Trek : Voyager , which ended in 2378 , only 8 television years after Next Generation .
According to my data , Captain , some kind of Cold War has been brewing , a perfect way to slip in the intergalactic political angle .
Patrick Stewart could even make a return as Picard to add some street cred and gravitas , like Jennie Garth on the new 90210 , and then a fresh cast can take the helm .
Oh , wait … the Cast .
Of course the biggest hurdle to a new Trek would be the movie version itself .
The producers want to build the mega - hit into a franchise complete with hot young stars and even hotter contracts .
Is it feasible , or even legal , for television franchise owner CBS to support a small screen
Trek team , while Paramount , which owns the movie franchise , simultaneously promotes their own actors ?
Advertisement
Business aspects aside , with the movie installments so far apart – the next one wo n't hit until 2012 – and the potential storylines happening at either end of the fictional timeline , there are n't too many insurmountable hurdles , not even market saturation , to prevent a successful TV launch .
It 's totally feasible to capitalize on a franchise with fresh blood and endless possibilites .
Just think about it , Hollywood , because the Star Trek story could – and should – live on indefinitely , and not just as a summer blockbuster .

From the Conference Board : Consumer Confidence Index® Drops Sharply
The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index ® which had been on the rise for three consecutive months , declined sharply in June .
The Index now stands at 52.9 ( 1985=100 ) , down from 62.7 in May .
...
Says Lynn Franco , Director of The Conference Board Consumer Research Center : “ Consumer confidence , which had posted three consecutive monthly gains and appeared to be gaining some traction , retreated sharply in June .
Increasing uncertainty and apprehension about the future state of the economy and labor market , no doubt a result of the recent slowdown in job growth , are the primary reasons for the sharp reversal in confidence .
Until the pace of job growth picks up , consumer confidence is not likely to pick up . ”
I rarely mention consumer confidence because it is mostly a coincident indicator , but this is quite a miss ( expectations were for about the same level as May ) .
This would be only the second time the state has borrowed money from its pension fund , and it would involve much more money than the previous time , which occurred in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
New York State faces a $ 9.2 billion deficit this fiscal year , which began on April 1 , and the budget is already more than two months late .
The governor and legislative leaders are under pressure to make structural changes that will bring new discipline to state spending , but few expect them to do so .
Instead , they are expected to rely heavily on borrowing , tax or fee increases and an array of one - time maneuvers , like tapping the coffers of public authorities .
The governor and Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli back borrowing against the pension system , and a tentative agreement to do so was reached after negotiations on Thursday among key lawmakers and the governor ’s representatives .
The plan excludes New York City , which has its own pension system .
The initial plan in the governor ’s budget called for the borrowing of up to $ 9 billion over the next six years .
Under the agreed - upon plan , the state would be authorized to borrow $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion over the next three years , according to forecasts provided by the governor ’s office and the Senate .
Municipalities would be allowed to borrow nearly $ 4 billion , according to a Senate estimate .
Senator Diane J. Savino , a Staten Island Democrat who negotiated the agreement for the Senate , said she pushed for a limit .
“ There ’s a question as to whether or not we should do this , ” she said , adding , “ I did n’t want to leave it open - ended , because six years is too long .
The temptation is too great to do it over and over again . ”
Windows 7
Backup is getting trashed in a Microsoft forum for being unbelievably bad and stupefyingly slow .
Users are posting stories that should defy belief .
Jon
Hell posted on April 23 that he is backing up 900 GB of data on a quad core PC with 7GB of RAM ; " After twenty four hours Windows Backup had managed to complete 18 per cent of the backup , but after forty eight hours , it had got even slower , and had only reached 23 per cent of the full backup . "
He gave up and changed to Acronis True Image Home which completed the backup in six hours .
His conclusion about Windows Backup ?
" It is an insult . "
This backup thread started in August 2009 with the Windows 7 RTM ( Release To Manufacturing ) code .
John Dougrez - Lewis was the first poster , and wrote that he could use file copy to move 250 GB of file data to an external eSATA drive in an hour at a speed of 72MB / sec .
When he did the same job using Windows 7 RTM Backup it took 14 hours , roughly 5MB / sec - more than 14 times slower .
Windows 7
Backup does compressed backups , which extends backup time compared to file copying , and the first backup is a full one , necessarily taking longer than the subsequent incremental backups .
It does not try to compress already compressed files , though .
The surprising thing is that this is a disk - to - disk backup and Microsoft has produced a disk - based backup that is slower than some tape backup jobs , and slower than Vista backup .
A Microsoft person , SriramB , responded to the first post , saying :
Thanks for trying out Windows Backup .
We have made significant changes in the backup application since Vista to address major customer pain - points .
Hope you find the Windows7 backup / restore solution meeting all your needs .
We are committed to continue engaging with customers like you , listening to valuable feedback and addressing them in future releases .
But more complaints flooded in on the thread , and Microsoft continued to say it was doing something about it .
For example , MS program manager Christine Fok replied to user Cathode on September 22 , 2009 , saying : " We hear your concern and … we 're looking into this issue . "
SriramB responded to another thread poster in October , saying :
In Windows7 we simplified the confusion around when users should take a file backup and when users should take a system image backup .
Now both these can be scheduled as part of same backup configuration .
However ... it has the side - effect of backing up data potentially twice ( depending on what is selected for file backup ) .
System image backup includes all the critical volumes ( boot volume , system volume , volume where any Windows service is installed ) .
It would backup the entire volume ( all the used space on the volume ) as VHD files ( one per volume ) .
File backup backups up the folders included in backup .
It would backup the files inside them as ZIP files .
The amount of duplication depends on whether the folders selected as part of file backup are present on any of the critical volumes .
Note that the slowness is expected only for the full backups .
The subsequent incremental backups should be faster as only the changes are backed up .
We hear your feedback and will definitely try to address this in future release .
Posters noted that if Windows 7 is shut down during backup then backup starts afresh next time it is run .
If the PC is shut down each day before backup is complete , it will never be protected .
There is apparently no warning in the shutdown window to leave your PC on if backup is still running .
Christine Fok responded : " I agree that a warning prior to shutdown and / or a mechanism to automatically continue with the backup afterwards should be considered .
We 'll attempt to improve this experience in future releases . "
Poster mcb offered this thought on December 16 :
I confirm this problem .
I have a 1 TB system partition and a 2 TB data / work partition , and the initial backup is so slow that I ended up finding this thread .
It is doing about 2 - 5 % per day , and the status indicator is a generic " Copying files to F : \ " most of the time ( only occasionally do you see the file that is being copied ) .
Not sure it is a compression issue : the four CPU cores are mostly idle .
Does Microsoft really expect customers to wait weeks for a backup to complete , with not even a decent progress indicator ?
Evilwm folks , you will love it .

Exclusive to STR
During a recent trip to St. Louis , I became quite intrigued by a seemingly mundane phenomenon .
The city experienced a fairly intense thunderstorm , which resulted in the temporary breakdown of certain street lights .
Upon my arrival at one of these intersections , I was fascinated by the orderliness that characterized motorists ’ behavior .
In spite of there being no functioning street light , drivers essentially behaved as if they were at a normal four - way stop : the last driver to get to the intersection let all others proceed before proceeding himself .
To most of my contemporaries , such an occurrence is normal and to be expected .
Few are likely to have considered the profound implications this event has on the viability of anarcho - capitalist legal institutions .
Supporters of centralized legislatures find it difficult to appreciate the importance of institutions in governing human behavior .
They often reason that if it were n’t for the ingenious laws their benevolent legislators were crafting and coercively enforcing , society would inevitably descend into chaos .
There are myriad examples that one could present to counter such an assertion , in addition to that aforementioned .
For example , how does one explain a diner ’s decision to tip at a restaurant ?
Tipping is not legally required and one could certainly save quite a chunk of money if he always stiffs his waiter .
To put it succinctly , reciprocity is the motivating factor behind much of the behavior for which government takes credit .
An illuminating , albeit crude , test of this hypothesis ’ accuracy would be to seriously question a typical law - abiding citizen on the reasons the latter abstains from murder , rape , theft , etc .
He is likely to discover that very little , if any , of the citizen ’s abstinence from such behavior is attributable to its statutory illegality .
It is far more probable that he understands the value of adhering to social norms that have evolved over time .
Murder , rape , and theft are acts that essentially make the perpetrator unable to smoothly function in society .
Even if there were no law prohibiting such behavior , the market would give rise to mechanisms that effectively isolate the social deviant from civil society .
If these criminals were not put in jail , they would find it nearly impossible to gain employment , set foot on most property , and develop and maintain relationships with others .
In the absence of statutory law , the overwhelming majority of people would indubitably recognize the reciprocal benefits of conducting themselves in a socially proper manner .
If statutory law magically disappeared , very few would become murderers , rapists , and thieves overnight .
Let us return to our previous example .
What reasons did the motorists have for adhering to conventional traffic rules when the street light ceased to operate ?
Easy : they recognized the danger of a unilateral attempt to speed through the intersection without regard to the other automobiles .
Such a decision to “ go against the grain ” would not only result in the destruction of other drivers ’ person and property , but would also adversely affect the renegade motorist .
Legislators , despite their practically incessant rhetoric about their invaluable service to society , are simply unnecessary .
At best , they can create laws that formalize informal social institutions .
The prohibition of murder , rape , and theft are a prime example of such formalization .
At worst , legislators craft laws that are contrary to , or perhaps completely contradict , institutions that have developed over many years .
Unfortunately , most laws today are created with virtually no consideration to those norms that have arisen over time to facilitate orderly human interaction .
Hence the enormous amount of resources required to enforce the prohibition of narcotics , prostitution , and gambling , the confiscatory tax code , and innumerable other laws .
These laws , implemented in a top - down fashion , are simply unnecessary for the functioning of a civilized society and were not concretized informal norms before becoming statutory law .
They may even serve as impediments to the maintenance of a peaceable community in some instances .
It is due time our legislative oligarchs recognize that they are not benevolent indispensables upholding individual rights , but rather these rights ’ most profound threat .

Quantum gas in free fall
Physicists produce a Bose - Einstein condensate at zero gravity - a step towards extremely sensitive quantum sensors for gravitation
A sensitive measuring device must not be dropped - because this usually destroys the precision of the instrument .
A team of researchers including scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics has done exactly this , however .
And the researchers want to use this experience to make the measuring instrument even more sensitive .
The team , headed by physicists from the University of Hanover , dropped a piece of apparatus , in which they generated a weightless Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) , to the bottom of a drop tower at the University of Bremen .
The particles in a BEC lose their individuality and can be considered to be a ' super - particle ' .
The researchers want to use such an ultra-cold quantum gas at zero gravity to construct a very sensitive measuring device for the Earth 's gravitational field - in order to find deposits of minerals , and also to settle fundamental issues in physics .
( Science , June 18 , 2010 )
Experiment with a dramatic fall :
The capsule is pulled up to the starting position in the drop tower , where the physicists generate a Bose - Einstein condensate by remote control and observe how it behaves at zero gravity - a step towards extremely - sensitive measuring devices for gravitation .

In a vacuum , a feather falls as quickly as a lead ball - something that is already presented to students as being irrefutable .
" However , the equivalence principle is only a postulate that needs to be tested , " says Ernst Maria Rasel , professor at the University of Hanover .
According to the equivalence principle , the heavy mass with which bodies attract each other corresponds to the inertial mass , which resists an accelerating force .
This means that in a vacuum all bodies hit the ground with the same speed .
Physicists want to use a measuring device that measures gravity extremely accurately to investigate whether this hypothesis can really become a physical law .
Ernst Maria
Rasel ’s team has now taken an initial step in this direction .
The researchers generated a Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) in zero gravity and observed , for more than a second , how the atomic cloud behaves in free fall .
To this end , they installed an atom chip developed by researchers working with Theodor W. Hänsch , Director at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics , and solenoids , lasers , a camera and the necessary energy supply into a cylindrical capsule , which is about as high and wide as a door .
After they had moved a cloud of several million rubidium atoms onto the atom chip , they dropped the complete apparatus 146 metres into the depths .
A tower at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity of the University of Bremen specializes in such scientific cases .
As the capsule was falling to the ground for four seconds in the drop tower , the researchers generated the BEC on the atom chip , initially by remote control : strong magnetic fields and lasers hold the particles on the chip and cool them .
At a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero , the temperature at minus 273.16 degrees Celsius , the particles have lost almost all of their energy and assume a new physical state : all atoms are now in the quantum mechanical ground state so that they can no longer be distinguished as individual particles in the quantum gas .
An atom chip - the fast path to ultra-cold quantum gas
" They behave completely coherently , practically like a heap of atoms that assumes the properties of a single huge atom , " says Tilo Steinmetz , who was involved in the experiment as a researcher from the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics .
Since the laws of quantum mechanics say that every particle can also be considered to be a wave , it is possible to describe what is happening in a different way :
A wave packet of matter forms in which the atoms no longer stay at fixed locations - they are delocalized .
This grouping is maintained until an energetic push , however small , mixes it up .
Physicists at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics generate the Bose - Einstein condensate on the atom chip quickly and with little electrical power - ideal conditions to repeat the experiment in a capsule in free fall .

" We generate a BEC in less than a second on our atom chip .
With conventional laboratory apparatus , this takes up to one minute , " says Tilo Steinmetz .
In addition , an experiment on an atom chip requires significantly less electrical power .
" It is thus ideal for use in a drop tower capsule , where energy supply and cooling present a logistical challenge , " says Steinmetz .
Ten times more time for a measurement
As soon as the atoms on the chip had merged into the super - particle , the researchers carefully loosened the hold of the trap and released the BEC .
The camera in the capsule now enabled them to observe how the condensate spread .
This movement reacts extremely sensitively to external fields - to differences in Earth ’s gravitational field , for example .
These differences exist because the gravitation at a certain point on Earth depends on the local density of the Earth 's crust .
The longer the Bose - Einstein condensate expands , i.e. the longer it floats in zero gravity , the clearer these differences make themselves felt as it expands .
With the experiment in the drop tower alone , the researchers extended the time available for a measurement by more than tenfold when compared to a laboratory experiment .
This could help in the future to drastically improve the accuracy of measurement data .
The differences can be measured in an atom interferometer : A quantum gas , that is the wave - packet of matter , is split into two parts and moves in the gravitational field along different paths through space - time .
Gravitation behaves like an optical medium , whose refractive index refracts the waves .
As soon as the two parts reunite , there is interference , as is also generated when waves on a water surface run into each other .
The interference pattern depends on how differently the two matter waves expand .
If matter waves of different composition are compared , a test of the equivalence principle with matter waves is performed .
The physicists in Ernst Maria Rasel ’s group now want to construct such an atom interferometer for the capsule of the Bremen drop tower .
" Ultimately , we would like to perform such experiments in space , " says Ernst Maria Rasel .
The equivalence principle could also be tested there .
To this end , the researchers must drop clouds of different atoms to Earth for as long as possible .
They could then find out whether all bodies really fall with the same speed .
And the longer the atom clouds remain in zero gravity - that is , the further they fall - the more chance there is of clarifying this .
Louisiana state bird among those affected
BP said on Monday it has spent at least 1.25 billion dollars on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as the energy giant launched an effort to further contain the environmental calamity .
BP said the cap fitted on the leaking pipe a mile ( 1,600 meters ) down on the sea bed has allowed the firm to capture more than 10,000 barrels of crude a day from the ruptured well , but was working to improve that .

“ Optimization continues and improvement in oil collection is expected over the next several days , ” the British firm said in a statement .
“ It will be a few days before an assessment can be made as to the success of this containment effort . ”
BP said that on Saturday a total of 10,500 barrels of oil was collected and 22 million cubic feet of natural gas was flared .
The number of birds picked up by wildlife rescue workers in five coastal states jumped by nearly 100 from Saturday ’s toll .
Of the 820 birds found so far , 597 have been dead , and all 223 found alive have been visibly oiled , officials said .
For the first time , oiled birds showed up in Texas .
Among them are the brown pelican — the Louisiana state symbol , which was only removed from the endangered list in November .

BP said the new containment effort involved inserting feeding pipes into the leaking blow - out preventer that could siphon more oil .
Company chief executive Tony Hayward said the system could be ready by next week and , despite criticism of his handling of the disaster , said he had the “ absolute intention of seeing this through to the end . ”
Government scientists have estimated that up to 19,000 barrels a day could be spewing into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion sank the BP - leased Deepwater Horizon rig just off the Louisiana coast .

US Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top government coordinator for the crisis , warned that clean - up teams were fighting an “ insidious enemy ” as they battle to keep the oil from reaching the shores , amid fears Florida ’s beaches could be badly hit with tar balls already washing up in Mississippi and Alabama .
On Monday , BP acknowledged it had already spent 1.25 billion dollars on efforts to contain the spill .
But the estimated cost did not include 360 million dollars earmarked for the construction of artificial barrier islands between the leak and the Louisiana coastline .

Florida Governor Charlie Crist said he hoped the impact on his state would not be as severe as the oozing , toxic soup the Deepwater Horizon oil spill has created in marshlands further west .
“ It is easy to clean up off the beaches , as we were able to do this past weekend in Pensacola .
We were disappointed that it came on the beach at all but able to clean it up fairly rapidly , ” he told CNN .
“ It is much more difficult is what we have seen in Louisiana , when it gets into the marshes and the estuaries , once it gets in there , it is very difficult to clean up . ”

The Deepwater Horizon response team has launched an oil - slick monitoring plan with vessels along the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas islands to detect oil and dispersants that threaten the coral reefs and wildlife preserves on the island chain .
So far , there are no signs of the oil in southern Florida , but experts said edges of the massive plumes were reaching the Loop Current and even the Gulf Stream that could sweep the pollution by Florida and along the eastern coast of the United States .
The slick has now spread around a 200 - mile ( 320 - kilometer ) radius from the fractured wellhead , but has broken into smaller spills .
“ It ’s not a monolithic spill .
It is literally hundreds of thousands of smaller spills , ” Allen explained on ABC .
Pictures of birds smothered in thick layers of oil have shown the impact of the disaster .

Massive spreads of boom have been deployed to protect coastlines , with Canada sending another 3,000 meters to the United States on Sunday , but in many places it has proved ineffective .
Around 660 kilometers ( 410 miles ) of boom , mostly from private oil company stock , have been deployed to contain the spill in the Gulf of Mexico , according to US government figures .
Allen warned that regardless of how much oil is now being contained , the leak will not be completely stopped until BP completes the drilling of two relief wells , sometime in August .
“ There will be oil out there for months to come , ” he told CBS television .
“ This spill is keeping everybody hostage . ”
Image caption Supporters of the vote say jobs for local people must be protected
Voters in a city in the US state of Nebraska have backed a ban on local businesses and landlords hiring or renting to illegal immigrants .
About 57 % of voters supported the move , which is likely to be the subject of a court challenge .
The vote in Fremont is the result of a two - year fight by residents concerned by an influx of Hispanic workers .
It follows an immigration law passed recently in Arizona which critics have said could lead to racial profiling .
Other states and cities want similar laws , saying the federal government has failed to tackle the problem .
US President Barack Obama has made immigration reform a priority , but has warned the task is being made harder by the actions of Arizona , Fremont and others .
Lawsuit threat
The campaign for a law began two years ago amid concerns that the Hispanic population in the 25,000 - strong city had gone from 165 in the 1990s to an estimated 2,000 - drawn mainly to work at a nearby meat - packing plant .
Image caption Critics say the vote is dividing the city of Fremont
A proposed law - similar to the one now passed - was narrowly defeated when put forward by a city council member in 2008 .
Residents disappointed by that result collected more than 3,000 signatures for another ballot ; they finally got approval in the Nebraska Supreme Court .
Supporters of the vote say it is necessary to protect jobs , healthcare and education for local people , while critics say it will divide the city and fuel discrimination .
The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had threatened to sue the city if the law were passed .
The Arizona immigration law , which comes into effect next month , requires police , in the context of enforcing other laws , to question people about their immigration status if the officers have reasonable suspicion the person is in the US illegally .
As longtime readers know , I think the cellphone industry is one step away from a big -city mugger .
Some of their practices are outrageous ripoffs - like how they charge so much for text messages ( both the sender and the receiver ) , even though text messages cost them nothing .
Or how the purpose of two - year contract is to sell you an expensive phone cheaply , on the premise that you 'll pay it off over the next 24 months -- but once you 've paid off the phone , your monthly bill does n't go down .
( Except at T - Mobile . )
A few months ago , I wrote about Verizon Wireless 's outrageous practice of selling phones whose arrow keys are preprogrammed to connect to the Web -- and if you hit one accidentally , you get zapped with a $ 2 Internet charge , instantly .
After much outcry and even an FCC investigation , Verizon Wireless installed a " landing page " -- a page on the phone that lets you cancel before you incur the charge .
But plenty of people still find those mysterious $ 2 charges .
If you truly never use Internet features , you can call Verizon to request a " data block " -- to say , " I just do n't use the Internet on my phone , and I do n't want to run the risk of getting hit with those $ 2 charges . "
Last month , I heard from a customer - service rep who , despite working for Verizon Wireless , is on my side on this issue .
He wrote with two alarming internal developments at Verizon that could affect you :
" Effective this past month , all CSRs [ customer - service reps} were versed on the usage of blocks .
A new policy has gone into effect regarding how to handle Escalated Calls regarding data charges .
Now , a representative can be reprimanded and even terminated for proactively offering to block any of the following :
Web Access Blocks
Data Blocks
Premium SMS blocking
Application download blocking
Vcast Music or Vcast Video download blocks
" Essentially , we are to upsell customers on the $ 9.99 25 mb / month or $ 29.99 unlimited packages for customers .
Customers are not to be credited for charges unless they ask for the credit .
And in cases such as data or premium SMS , where the occurrences may have gone months without the consumer noticing , only an initial credit can be issued . "

Image caption Thousands have been displaced by the fighting in Darfur
About 600 people died in fighting in the Sudan region of Darfur in May , the highest monthly toll since peacekeepers were deployed in 2008 , officials say .
The joint UN - African Union peacekeeping force said most had died in fighting between Sudan 's army and rebels of the Justice and Equality Movement ( Jem ) .
The number of deaths has risen sharply since Jem walked out of peace talks last month .
The rebels had signed a preliminary peace deal and ceasefire in February .
This meant Sudan 's first multiparty elections for 24 years held in April , were relatively quiet in Darfur .
But Jem then left the negotiations in Qatar , claiming the government had launched new raids .
A report by the Unamid peacekeeping mission said 440 people died in fighting in May between rebels and government forces , 126 in tribal violence and 31 in other violence , including murder .
Boycott ' to continue '
The confidential document , seen by news agencies , said two rival Arab groups , the Rezeigat and Misseriya , had also clashed in Darfur since March .
On Monday Jem said it would continue to boycott peace talks and was clashing " continuously " with Sudanese army forces in south and central Darfur .
According to the UN , an estimated 300,000 people have been killed in Darfur and more than 2.6 million displaced since ethnic rebels took up arms in 2003 .
The Sudanese government , however , says such figures are a massive exaggeration .
Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) for alleged war crimes committed in Darfur - charges he strongly denies .

There 's been a fair discussion recently about what some folks mean when they say HTML5 .
I use HTML5 in the wider sense , so it 's only right that I take a stab at defining what I mean when I say something is part of HTML5 .
From a very high level , when I say HTML5 I mean : " Everything that is in the formal W3C HTML5 spec ; everything that used to be in there but was broken out for various reasons ; sibling and related technologies and developments like CSS3 , SVG , EcmaScript 5 , etc. ; and experimental explorations that are pushing the boundaries .
" I wo n't go into the reasons why I use HTML5 in these more expansive terms , as I blogged about that recently Going deeper , I 've broken these down into separate areas :
One small note ; there are actually HTML5 specs , one maintained by the W3C and the other maintained by the WhatWG
You need to understand that HTML5 began as a revolution to the established order , initiated by the WhatWG .
A peace of sorts developed over the years , with the upstart " Web Applications " and " Web Forms " specs brought in - house to the W3C under the moniker HTML5 .
Over time I 'm assuming that the W3C spec , when Final Call has happened , will be the canonical spec .
To simplify things below , I 'm only referencing the W3C HTML5 spec for now .
Here 's how I would break things down based on what I said above ; if you think something should be somewhere else or things get moved around email me and I 'll update this ( ) .
If you want to know the state of where these technologies are implemented see caniuse.com ; if you want your code to detect what is available see Mark Pilgrim 's book for details
June 11 , 2010 — Restructure !
In Drawings of Scientists , seventh graders draw and describe their image of scientists before and after a visit to Fermilab .
BEFORE AFTER
The scientist has big square - shaped glasses and a big geeky nose with brown hair and blue eyes .
I see a scientist working in a lab with a white lab coat . . . holding a beaker filled with solutions only he knows .
Scientists are very interesting people who can figure out things we do n’t even know exist .
My picture of a scientist is completely different than what it used to be !
The scientist I saw doesn¹t wear a lab coat .
. . .
The scientists used good vocabulary and spoke like they knew what they were talking about .
Beth BEFORE AFTER
I think of a scientist as very dedicated to his work .
He is kind of crazy , talking always quickly .
He constantly is getting new ideas .
He is always asking questions and can be annoying .
He listens to others ’ ideas and questions them .
I know scientists are just normal people with a not so normal job .
. . .
Scientists lead a normal life outside of being a scientist .
They are interested in dancing , pottery , jogging and even racquetball .
Being a scientist is just another job which can be much more exciting .
Amy BEFORE AFTER
A scientist is hard working , studious , detail - oriented , observant , intelligent , exacting , and patient .
Most people think of a scientist as a person who is nerdy , studious , scholarly , and a person who is devoted to her job and doesn¹t have much of a personality or is n¹t very interesting .
This is a stereotype and today just proves that scientists have lives , interests , hobbies , families and friends .
I find that scientists are very , very interesting Marisa
Here are some interesting gender statistics about these drawings ( if I correctly perceive the children ’s genders and the scientists ’ genders in the children ’s drawings ) :
Among girls ( 14 in total ) , 36 % portrayed a female scientist in the “ before ” drawing , and 57 % portrayed a female scientist in the “ after ” drawing .
( 14 in total ) , portrayed a in the “ before ” drawing , and portrayed a in the “ after ” drawing .
Among boys ( 17 in total ) , 100 % portrayed a male scientist in the “ before ” drawing , and 100 % portrayed a male scientist in the “ after ” drawing .
It looks like a visit to Fermilab has no impact on boys ’ gender stereotypes about scientists , but it has a strong impact on challenging girls ’ gender stereotypes about scientists .
For girls , there was a 58 % increase in female scientist representation in their drawings ; for boys , there was a 0 % increase in female scientist representation in their drawings .
If boys grow up to be men , and empirical evidence has no effect on males ’ gender stereotypes about scientists , how do we challenge males ’ association of science with maleness ?
Here are more statistics :
94 % of the children portrayed a scientist wearing a lab coat in the “ before ” drawings , but only 3 % ( 1 person ) portrayed a scientist wearing a lab coat in the “ after ” drawing .
in the “ before ” drawings , but only 3 % ( 1 person ) portrayed a scientist wearing a lab coat in the “ after ” drawing .
Among the “ after ” drawings and descriptions of scientists , 29 % of children explicitly noted that scientists were “ normal people ” or that a scientist is a “ normal person ” or “ regular person ” .
Among the “ after ” drawings , 65 % suggested or explicitly noted that scientists were normal people ( e.g. , they noted that everyone / anyone can be a scientist ; that a scientist can have hobbies , friends , and a family ; or that a scientist “ is a person with a life ” . )
Not only do seventh graders have these stereotypes about scientists , but it appears that most adults do as well .
Perhaps the anti-science sentiment among some adults arises from the common stereotype that scientists are elitist white male geniuses who are not “ regular ” people , which was impressed into their minds at a tender age and reinforced through years of mass media consumption .
While it may be true that scientists can have very different life experiences , the same can be said for any other occupation or social group .
There is nothing inherently male about science or scientists .
Stereotypes and discrimination exist among scientific communities , just like in “ regular ” communities .
UPDATE :
Scientific Stereotype :
A fairly formal assay of children ’s views of scientists was undertaken recently by a team at Leicester University in England and Australia ’s Curtin University of Technology .
Although the results have not yet been published , based on preliminary analysis the main conclusion from the research is that children think of scientists as boring white men with glasses , beards , and strange hair .
According to lead researcher Tina Jarvis , director of Leicester ’s School of Education , many children say they do not want to be a scientist because scientists never have fun !
Jarvis and colleagues , along with Lionie Rennie of Curtin , studied the responses of more than 4,000 children in Britain and Australia over the last eight years and concluded that the stereotypes persist , at least among six - to eight - year - olds .
Worryingly , children of Asian and African - Caribbean descent generally held the same opinion as their white peers .
Most children ’s sketches of scientists endowed them with a white , male face and the usual eccentric hair .
Boys , Jarvis says , never drew women , and girls did so only very occasionally .
While there may well be a minority of scientists who fit the category , it indicates a very narrow view of scientists , one that is so very often reinforced through TV programs and cartoons , comic books , and comments from nonscientist parents and other adults .
We then wonder why so many girls and non-white children find it very difficult to envision themselves as future scientists .

Even before President Obama spoke about his decision to remove Gen. Stanley McChrystal , Fox News and Monica Crowley used the decision to attack Obama ’s character .
Crowley said , “ It is going to look like he is reacting out anger , and out of a thin skinned response to this . ”
Fox News can’t decide whether Obama is not angry enough or angry all of the time .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Crowley called Obama ’s removal of McCrystal a blown opportunity , “ I really think that McChrystal should not have been relieved by this ….
This is a blown opportunity for President Obama , because he has been criticized for not getting angry over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Yet this was an opportunity for President Obama to show us that cool , dispassionate , unemotional side of him , and now he ’s coming out , and it ’s going to look like , I do n’t care how calm he is in a couple of minutes .
It is going to look like he is reacting out anger , and out of a thin skinned response to this . ”
The Fox News point of view on Obama is America is mad at him for not getting angry enough over the Gulf oil spill and he missed an opportunity to show off his calm side , which he has shown during the oil spill by getting angry about McChrystal .
That argument makes absolutely no sense .
It was interesting how Monica Crowley was prejudicing the perceptions of the Fox audience before he even spoke .
She even went as far as to say that Obama might sound calm , but do n’t pay any attention to that because he is really thin skinned and angry .
It was a not so subtle way to push the Fox News narrative about Obama .
She preemptively set out to undermine Obama ’s tone , so that she could push the right wing narrative of Obama the angry thin skinned black president .
However , Fox ca n’t seem to decide whether Obama is angry all of the time , or never angry enough .
Their criticism changes by the day .
One minute Obama is a weak president , but the next he is a bully .
Fox News is straining so hard to criticize Obama that they often contradict their own earlier criticisms .
Is it any wonder that Fox News viewers make no sense ?
Their only source of information is a garbled mess that ca n’t keep its story straight from one day to the next .
A Toronto Transit Commission bus driver charged with impaired driving Wednesday was under the influence of drugs prescribed by his doctor , according to the transit workers ’ union .
“ He was apparently affected by doctor - prescribed medication he had been taking for several months , ” Bob Kinnear , president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 , said in a statement .
“ He had not been advised that his medication might cause impairment .
There had been no prior indication of impairment from the medication .
A medical investigation is underway , ” he said .
Zvi Domb of Toronto received one charge of impaired driving after police responded to a call from a citizen near Senlac Rd. in the Yonge St. and Finch Ave. area , at about 8 p.m. , Const .
Hugh Smith said .
“ When we got there , the bus was already stopped and pulled over , ” he said , adding that police did n’t know whether the bus was in service or on its route .
There were no passengers on the bus , Smith said .
The driver , 47 , failed a field sobriety test administered on site .
He was arrested and charged .
Smith said the driver was released Thursday morning and cannot operate a motor vehicle until his court appearance on June 24 .
The TTC is conducting its own investigation .
It ’s not yet known if the driver saw a supervisor during the course of his shift , said TTC spokesman Brad Ross .
Wednesday ’s was the third incident in which a TTC driver has been charged for impaired driving since June 2008 .
In March , a TTC bus driver was suspended after failing a breathalyzer test administered by police .
The bus had been pulled over after passengers called police to complain about the driver ’s behaviour .
Ross would n’t say how many incidents there have been in which no one was charged .
The TTC began drug and alcohol testing for its new employees in February .
Since then , 11 of 197 tests have come back positive , he said .
In August , the TTC will implement the remainder of its new fitness - for - duty policy , which requires employees with a record or suspicion of workplace impairment to undergo testing .
Employees are still being trained in the new procedure and policy , which was approved by the transit commission nearly two years ago , said Ross .
Although TTC staff recommended that all employees be subjected to random drug and alcohol testing , the councillors on the transit commission rejected the move .
The policy affects all safety sensitive positions at the TTC , which covers the majority of employees .
“ Our policy is you must be fit for duty and not impaired in any way , ” including fatigue , drugs and alcohol , said Ross .
“ We do have 12,000 employees .
Whenever these incidents come to our attention they are considered isolated incidents .
We do n’t feel there is a systemic problem , ” he said .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. Coast Guard official has told BP
Plc the company ’s plans to contain the gushing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico do not go far enough or contain enough back - up measures .

“ BP must identify in the next 48 hours additional leak containment capacity that could be operationalized and expedited , ” Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson said in a letter to BP dated June 11 .
Watson , the federal on - scene coordinator for spill response , noted estimates of the amount of oil leaking from BP ’s damaged well have been raised sharply .
He did not suggest what actions could be taken if the 48 - hour deadline was not met .
Watson ’s letter was a response to one from BP that described the company ’s multi-phase plans to contain the spill , involving several elements to be phased in by mid-July .
“ The combination of Phase One and Two results in a capacity of 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day , ” said Doug Suttles , BP ’s chief operating officer .
“ We believe this plan is responsive to your order , ” Suttles said , adding the company cannot assure that “ complete collection rates ” are guaranteed .
Not good enough , said Watson .
“ You indicate that some of the systems you have planned to deploy may take a month or more to bring online .
Recognizing the complexity of this challenge , every effort must be expended to speed up the process , ” he wrote .
“ I am also concerned that your plan does not go far enough to mobilize redundant resources in the event of an equipment failure with one of the vessels , or some other unforeseen problem . ”
howdy !
this is the very first of my new webcomic , gronk !
a monster ’s story .
it ’s an all ages comic about a monster who rejects monster society and finds herself trying to fit in in the human world .
really , stay tuned .
it ’ll get awesome …. and adorable .
right now , expect it to be updated EVERY FRIDAY ( may switch to saturday , but that decision will be made very soon ) !

Geithner rejected comparisons , advanced in large part by Republicans in Congress , between the fiscal situation in the U.S. and the debt crisis in Greece that has roiled the European Union , sent Greece to the brink of default and weakened the euro .
" It 's not going to happen in the United States , " Geithner said during an appearance on CNBC .
The Treasury secretary said a better - than - expected economy would help strengthen government accounts and stave off any parallels to Greece .

" I think the important thing is you 're seeing the United States in a much stronger recovery than people expected even three months ago , " he said .
Greek found itself mired in debt after copious government spending , in part to finance social programs and pensions that allow some public employees to retire in their 50s .
The nation 's hosting of the Olympics in 2004 also ramped up public spending .
Republicans have warned that similar spending patterns could bankrupt the U.S .
" Unless we change course , our debt is on track to reach levels we 're seeing in Greece , which is already receiving an international bailout , " House Minority Leader John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerLongtime House parliamentarian to step down

Conservatives also seized over the weekend on a report from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) that shows U.S. debt possibly nearing 100 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) by 2015 .
The U.S. is set to participate in a bailout of Greece and other European economies through its membership in the IMF , which has pledged billions to assist with nations ' debts and stabilize the euro .
Republicans have also loudly protested such a move , introducing legislation in the House on Wednesday that seeks to prevent the U.S. from supporting a European bailout .
Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate .
Easy money in the West pumps emerging market inflows
We 've talked before about how loose monetary policy in deflation - fearing developed nations is a huge problem for their inflation - fearing emerging market neighbors .
Research by the International Monetary Fund confirms that liquidity in developed nations ( Advanced Economies , AE ) indeed flows into emerging markets ( EM ) , thanks to today 's global financial market linkages .
Thus the easy money policy of the West becomes the easy money policy for the world , even when the developing world is trying to tighten its policy .
Why ?
Well , if emerging markets tighten monetary policy too much , by raising their interest rates , it will increase the flow of capital into their economies since interest rates will still remain low in developed nations .
( Money tends to chase higher returns via interest rates )
Thus as they try to reduce domestic liquidity by tightening monetary policy with higher interest rates , they will be hit by a counter - productive inflow of global liquidity chasing higher interest rates , which sort of kills their attempt to tighten .
Higher relative interest rates also lead to currency appreciation , which many emerging markets are loathe to endure since it hurts export competitiveness .
That 's how easy money in America and Europe becomes easy money everywhere , and it 's already priming potential emerging market asset bubbles :
IMF :
Capital inflows have resumed in EMs that came out relatively unscathed from the crisis .
Such flows could be driven by a combination of push and pull factors .
Historically , accommodative monetary policies in AEs have been associated with rising capital flows to EMs [ See the chart above ] .
Continued easy policies in the near term in AEs could thus push even more capital to EMs .
At the same time , EMs that are recovering briskly from the crisis with better fiscal sustainability indicators than AEs may continue to pull capital by offering promising investment opportunities in a high growth macroeconomic environment .
Overall , such inflows are just returning to pre-crisis levels .
Although they do not generally pose a problem yet , surges in such flows going forward may complicate policy challenges for EMs recovering quickly from the crisis .
That 's why emerging markets could be the next bubble we inflate .
There 's certainly no shortage of bullishness for emerging markets stocks .
Just beware that there are huge concerns all investors should have in regards to how much control foreign investors actually have when they buy so - called ' ownership ' via emerging markets shares .
We 've embedded the full IMF emerging markets report below , which is more broadly about how EM weathered the recent financial crisis .

This one might not be for everyone , some people just do n’t like fish , and others just do n’t like Catholics .
However , for those Ents who like smoked salmon , this recipe is hard to beat .
To make it , you will need the following :
A sealable bowl A fork or potato masher Smoked Salmon Cream Cheese Garlic Salt
Once you have everything you need , follow these steps to make some Creamy Smoked Salmon Dip for yourself :
Mix smoked salmon and cream cheese in a bowl at a ration of 1 part salmon to 2 parts cream cheese ( eg. one ounce salmon to 2 ounces of cream cheese , or a ratio of 1:2 ) .
I like to use a scale for this part .
Since this is Food For Stoners , I ’m guessing you probably have a scale handy .
Thoroughly mash the salmon and cream cheese with your fork .
Add just a bit of garlic salt at this point to enhance the flavor .
Mash it .
Mash it !
MASH IT !
Enjoy .
This dip goes great with wheat thins or ritz and some sharp cheddar cheese .
Also , it taste way better than any bullshit overly processed store - bought snack dip .

Interviews : Cast and crew of Cannes hit Un Prophète : ' Audiard is like a sculptor ' guardian.co.uk
Du Rififi Chez les Hommes was the full title of Jules Dassin 's classic tough - guy thriller from 1955 – aggro among men .
Here , it is more a case of Rififi Among Men and God alike , in a blisteringly ­powerful prison - gangster picture from the French director Jacques Audiard .
It comports itself like a modern classic from the very first frames , instantly ­hitting its massively confident stride .
This is the work of the rarest kind of film - maker , the kind who knows ­precisely what he is doing and where he is going .
The film 's every effect is ­entirely intentional .
Newcomer Tahar Rahim plays Malik El Djebena , a young Arab guy about to start a six - year stretch in prison for what appears to be violence against police ­officers .
He is a 19 - year - old petty ­criminal , and this is his debut in adult detention .
Malik is very frightened , cringing almost visibly into his clothes on walking the grim corridors of jail , and into his nakedness when he is inspected by medical officers .
On what is apparently his very first day in the exercise yard , Malik 's ­vulnerability and his very blankness attract the hooded eye of César , the Corsican mobster with the guards in his pocket – incomparably played by Niels Arestrup .
César needs someone to whack a fellow prisoner , who is about to incriminate his ­associates on the outside by turning state 's ­witness .
Surrounded by his thuggish courtiers , César curtly summons bewildered small - timer Malik and informs him that he must kill this switch , or be killed himself by César 's lieutenants .
He will be given ­instruction on how to do the job , and protection from César 's crew for the rest of his term .
No ­arguments : Malik is " in " , a murderer .
There is no way out .
Trembling Malik now finds himself in a terrifying , almost Greeneian dilemma .
Should he refuse ?
Should he simply ­submit to death rather than ­become a murderer ?
The plan is that Malik must kill his victim , Reyeb ( Hichem Yacoubi ) with a razor - blade concealed in the roof of his mouth .
Pretending to offer him a blowjob in his cell , he must work it out with his tongue and push it forward between his teeth while his face is invisibly at crotch - level , and then stand up and cut the man 's throat .
The scenes in which Malik must practise doing this in front of the mirror , retching and spitting blood into the sink , are the stuff of pure , scalp - prickling fear : I just can't remember ­being so tense in the cinema .
This nauseous forced deal between Malik and César appears to become the basis of a strange , unknowable spiritual bargain between Malik and God – or does it ?
Audiard makes the haunted Malik the centre of an internal crisis , part ­psychological , part ­supernatural .
The terrible unsought burden of ­assassinhood transforms him into a grotesque , parodic " prophet " and the agent of César 's downfall .
Intent on self - betterment , ­Malik takes classes , learns Corsican - dialect Italian and , to the contemptuous disgust of the Muslim prisoners , becomes the Corsicans ' Uncle Tom-ish servant boy .
But poker - faced Malik has big plans ; he is rising through the ranks – and laws from the new Sarkozy ­government about repatriating Corsican ­prisoners away from mainland French jails now leave César exposed , with no ­bodyguards .
­Malik , whom César fears and suspects more than anyone , is his Quisling ­nemesis , his only companion , and the son he never had or wanted to have .
Audiard has created a long , involved , relentlessly brutal but gripping and thrilling picture ; it has the rangy , ­anecdotal feel of something drawn from real life , but its realism somehow ­accommodates an eerie supernatural shimmer .
Malik has visions which are partly , but apparently only partly , ­explicable as trauma .
The sweat and the machismo are very familiar from the French crime genre , which was ­revived only ­recently in the 70s - era Mesrine films .
The passing of contraband , the ­defiant songs and shouts and ­burning garbage being flung from the high ­courtyard walls surely also ­summon up ­memories of Pontecorvo 's The Battle of Algiers .
But the movie has its own ­muscular originality .
Niels Arestrup is all too plausible as the jail gang - boss , coolly ­proprietorial with prisoners and guards alike , ­sporting a mask of impassive disdain through which world - weariness and fear gradually surface .
But Arestrup and ­Audiard have found something new in this classic persona .
What we see etched on César 's face is pathetic ­loneliness and the horror of dying alone in prison .
His weakness and Malik 's future strength – this is the emotional ­fulcrum on which this tremendous film is ­structured .
Arestrup was outstanding in ­Audiard 's previous film , The Beat That My Heart Skipped – also , intriguingly , in a tense , mutually resentful relationship with a younger man – but here he brings out new strains of desolation .
Rahim , too , is a tremendous casting find for Audiard .
The film returns us to what should be the biggest cliche in the book : the prison film , with its cells , its shouts , its ­corrupt guards , its boxes full of ­prisoners ' heartrendingly meagre ­personal effects .
But Audiard also revives the hidden source of our ­fascination with prisons .
They are places of violence and fear , but also of ­paradoxical freedom – freedom from the ties of outside lives .
They are places you can remake yourself , for good or ill , ­hellish furnaces in which you can smelt a new identity .

This blog post is about how the women employed for the first major international astronomy project , called the Astrographic Catalogue , saw themselves , and were seen by others .
It takes ambition and funding to build the " best datacenter in the world " .
Bi-located on the East and West coast , with multiple fat pipes , doubly - redudant power generation , armed security guards , and a Network Operations Center with giant plasma screens scrolling network statuses that are monitored by a 24/ 7 staff always looking busy , such a datacenter would serve only the highest - end clients .
It takes one more key ingredient though : timing .
Building a high - end datacenter in the middle of the deepest recession in decades is n't the recipe for success .
Only a handful of clients ever moved in , and they were moving back out when the datacenter decided to shut down operations for good .
Nearly everyone had been laid off , which left Ryan as the lone IT guy .
It was a lonely , and slightly creepy , position .
Day after day , he sat alone in an abandoned office building , with only the security guard for company .
During those weeks , his mind wandered , inventing noises where there were none , inventing strange interpretations for the noises that were there .
He kept his sanity and balanced his time between building walkthroughs , marathon Minesweeper sessions , and browsing IT humor sites to remind himself that things could be far worse than drawing a check to warm a chair .
His cellphone beeped at him .
An SMS alert proclaimed that a server had gone down .
It was n't DNS or something important , so he ignored it and continued trying to set a new record on Expert mode .
A few minutes later , his cellphone bleeped again .
And again .
DNS and something important were down .
His record attempt abandoned , the sluggishness of the past few weeks of boredom fell away .
Ryan bolted for the server room .
He threw open the door and a wave of heat flashed past him .
He expected smoke and flames .
Instead he saw overheating servers and a thermostat that registered 110 ºF .
To make matters worse , he could feel hot air blasting into the room from the vents .
The heat was on .
Obviously , the thermostat was broken , so Ryan did the logical thing and turned it off .
He waited for the HVAC system to notice and turn off the heat .
And waited .
The vents continued belching hot air into the room .
Unsure how to fix the heat , Ryan decided to solve the hottest problem first .
He fetched the never - before - used emergency air - conditioner .
Minutes later , it sat , still partially cocooned in shrink wrap , angrily battling it out with the building 's rogue HVAC system .
The temperature dropped to a more manageable 85 º .
Ryan called the security desk , which had monitors for the HVAC system .
" According to this , " the guard said , " the Server Room zone is 64 º in a zone for 68 º , and the thermostat is still active .
So , heat is still running to bring it up to 68 º .
Are you sure you turned it off ? "
Ryan double checked , just to be safe , and then for good measure , he started sanity checking the other thermostats in the building .
He walked from room to room , and it was n't until he reached the Network Operations Center that he noticed something was off .
Despite being an admin , he never spent much time in the NOC .
Like many a NOC , it had been built for form , not function , as something that the sales - guy could show off to potential clients and put in brochures .
The real work happened in the cube - farm down the hall .
After a brief tracing of cables and sensors , Ryan pieced together what happened .
Because the NOC room has been empty since the recent layoffs , the presence of human heat no longer kept the room warm .
Normally , that would n't be a problem , except for the fact that the HVAC guys behind the " world class datacenter " placed the NOC and server room in the same heating / cooling zone .
The sensor was in the NOC room , and the vents were in the server room .
Before the layoffs , the NOC was staffed 24/7 , and the presence of human heat always kept the ambient temperature above 68 º , thus keeping the A/C blowing all the time in the server room .
With no humans in the NOC , the HVAC system started pumping heat into the server room .
As a quick fix , Ryan " tweaked " the shared zone to 50 degrees , and the vents once again flooded the room with cold air .
A few weeks later , he collected his final paycheck and happily pulled the breaker to the server room , leaving the problem to whoever might buy the remains of their " world class datacenter " .

62 days have passed since the initial explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico , and the crude oil and natural gas continue to gush from the seafloor .
Re-revised estimates now place the flow rate at up to 60,000 barrels a day - a figure just shy of a worst - case estimate of 100,000 barrels a day made by BP in an internal document recently released by a congressional panel .
Louisiana 's state treasurer has estimated environmental and economic damages from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill could range from $ 40 billion to $ 100 billion .
Collected here are recent photographs from the Gulf of Mexico , and of those affected by the continued flow of oil and gas into the ocean .

32 year - old unemployed veteran Alvin Greene came out of nowhere to win the South Carolina Democratic Senate Primary .
Is he an embodiment of anti-establishment rage ?
The next Sarah Palin ?
Or literally brain damaged ?
After Greene — who lives in a " tiny ramshackle home " with his dad and is facing a felony obscenity charge — improbably beat his much more - qualified opponent last week , the media rushed to figure out what happened .
Some were shocked into conspiracy theories : Greene 's a Republican plant !
Other people thought he may have legitimately won — maybe because his name was higher on the ballot ?
It 's unclear which of these groups has less faith in Democracy .
The question now before the pundits and bloggers : What is Alvin Greene ?
Again , two dominant theories have emerged .
To some , Alvin Greene is " The Real Joe the Plumber " — the logical end product of the wave of anti-incumbent rage that is supposedly sweeping the nation .
Newsweek and the Washington Post compare his , uh , downhome rhetorical style ( unfavorably ) to Sarah Palin's .
Some contrast Greene 's humility about his military service to a career politician like Conn.
Senator Richard Blumenthal 's shameless embellishment .
To Time Alvin Greene 's election is a sign of a return to pragmatism among voters .
So , maybe Alvin Greene is a more hardcore Sarah Palin :
Where she verbally rebuffed Washington elite - style politics , Greene actually did it .
What 's less politically elite than not actually engaging in politics ?
The guy did n't even have lawn signs .
Or ! Maybe Alvin Greene is mentally impaired .
Not a metaphorical " crazy , " like Kentucky Libertarian Rand Paul .
Medically :
His brain is damaged .
South Carolina Rep. Todd Rutherford told CNN he wants Greene to undergo " some sort of mental evaluation . "
He 's worried Greene might be a real - life Lenny :
" I feel like he is being exploited , like there is a joke going and he does n't get it , " said Rutherford , who did not press Greene to drop his bid .
" It is troublesome at best .
I think his mental capacity may prohibit him from getting the joke . "
Last night , in the oddest interview with Greene yet — definitely an accomplishment !
—CNN 's Don Lemon repeatedly asked him about his mental capability .
( See above . )
And , well , when Lemon told him that lawmakers were worried about his cognitive ability , Greene called them " knuckleheads " and started giggling to himself .
Urlesque got straight to the point : " Borderline - retarded "
As his campaign showed , Alvin Greene is utterly disconnected from the normal workings of political power .
He did n't show up at a single Memorial Day parade and pretend to be interested in what voters had to tell him !
He did n't even have a half - assed website with pictures of his politically convenient marriage .
Also , he is incoherent and obviously incompetent .
But he won anyway !
The media is split between seeing this as evidence that Greene is a proto - Sarah Palin or proof that he is " borderline - retarded " .
This says something funny about both Sarah Palin and the media .
Bright red hooded sweatshirt featuring a Che Guevara style bird face .
I think it 's for a sports team from the giver 's home state or city .
Hockey or football or something .
It 's quite high quality : very heavy cotton fabric with a fuzzy synthetic lining .
I better be careful wearing this around football season here in Berkeley , as I think red is a banned color , due to Stanford .
But it 'll be damned good in the nippy winters here when I 'm motorcycling around !
When a friend or family member comes to you asking for help with a program that 's not working correctly , the first thing most of us ask is : " Did you try restarting ? "
When I 'm talking web sites , it changes to : " Did you Shift + Refresh ? "
Advertisement
Note :
For the purposes of this discussion , I 'm assuming the person with the problem still has an active internet connection and every other web site is working just fine .
And this is n't a new browser feature or shortcut by any means , but we 've never fully covered it , and it's a lifesaver .
Why Shift + Refresh ?
In order to keep running quickly and save on bandwidth costs , web sites will often tell your browser to store certain files on your hard drive rather than re-download them every time you request a new page from that server .
This process is called caching , and your browser regularly caches images , JavaScript files , stylesheets , and the like .
Advertisement
Caching is almost always a good thing , but occasionally something can go wrong in the cache .
Say , for example , your browser has n't updated the new JavaScript files for a page , but the page itself is trying to call a method that is n't defined in the cached JavaScript your browser has stored .
The web site wo n't work the way it 's supposed to .
The same sort of problems also occur with stylesheets ( ever seen a web site that looks like all the nice sparkle went away and all you can see is unstyled text ? ) and images .
Sure , you could clear your entire browser cache ( in Firefox : Tools -> Clear Recent History ) , restart your browser , or go nuts and restart your computer , but most of the time that 's overkill .
Any of those methods could be worth trying eventually , but before you try anything more drastic or time - consuming just hold your Shift key and click the Refresh button in your browser ( or press Ctrl + Shift + R [ Win ] / Ctrl+F5 [ Win ] / Cmd+ Shift+R [ Mac ] ; the keyboard shortcut does n't work on Safari ) .
While a normal page refresh ( whether you click the refresh button or use the F5 / Ctrl+R / Cmd+R shortcuts ) still uses those cached files rather than re-downloading them , the Shift +
Refresh clears the cache for the files in that page so that you 're sure to be running the latest and greatest version of what that web site 's serving .
If That Still Does n't Work ?
A cache - overriding reload is n't a fix - all , but it is the first thing I tell anyone to try ( " Hold Shift and click the Refresh button " ) when they 're having a problem with a web site .
If it does n't fix the problems you 're having with a web site , you 've still got plenty of troubleshooting paths to exhaust ( clear your entire cache , restart the browser , restart your computer , uninstall extensions , etc. ) , but it 's a good place to get started .

Have a method you swear by as your first resort when the web sites you rely on go a little wonky ?
Let 's hear it in the comments .
Press statement by SUSPECT on Judith Butler ’s refusal to accept the Civil Courage Award from Berlin Pride last night .
As Berlin Queer and Trans Activists of Colour and Allies we welcome Judith Butler ’s decision to turn down the Zivilcourage Prize awarded by Berlin Pride .
We are delighted that a renowned theorist has used her celebrity status to honour queer of colour critiques against racism , war , borders , police violence and apartheid .
We especially value her bravery in openly critiquing and scandalising the organisers ’ closeness to homonationalist organisations .
Her courageous speech is a testimony to her openness for new ideas , and her readiness to engage with our long activist and academic work , which all too often happens under conditions of isolation , precariousness , appropriation and instrumentalisation .
Sadly this is happening once again , for the people of colour organisations who according to Butler should have deserved the award more than her are not mentioned once in the press reports to date .
Butler offered the prize to GLADT ( www.gladt.de), LesMigraS ( www.lesmigras.de), SUSPECT and ReachOut ( www.reachoutberlin.de), yet the one political space mentioned in the reports is the Transgenial Christopher Street Day , a white - dominated alternative Pride event .
Instead of racism , the press focuses on a simple critique of commercialisation .
This even though Butler herself was quite clear : ‘ I must distance myself from complicity with racism , including anti-Muslim racism . ’
She notes that not just homosexuals , but also ‘ bi , trans and queer people can be used by those who want to wage war . ’
The CSD , via Renate KÃ¼nast of the Green Party ( who appeared to have difficulties pronouncing the award winner ’s name and grasping basic aspects of her writings ) introduced Butler as a determined critic .
Five minutes later , the same critical determination caused the faces of presenters to drop .
Rather than engage with the speech in any way , Jan Salloch und Ole Lehmann could think of nothing better than blanketly refuse any charge of racism and attack the ca. 50 queers of colour and allies who had come out in Butler ’s support : ‘ You can scream all you like .
You are not the majority .
That ’s enough . ’
The finale was an imperialist fantasy matched by the backdrop of the Brandenburger Tor : ‘ Pride will just continue in its programme …
No matter what …
Worldwide and here in Berlin …
This is how it ’s always been and will always be . ’
In the past years , racism has indeed been the red thread of international Pride events , from Toronto to Berlin , as well as of the wider gay landscape ( see queer of colour theorists ’
Jasbir Puar ’s and Amit Rai ’s early critique of this in their 2002 article ‘ Monster Terrorist Fag’ ) .
In 2008 , the Berlin Pride motto was ‘ Hass du was dagegen ? ’ , which might translate as ‘ You go ’ a problem or wha’ ?’.
Homophobia and Transphobia are redefined as the problems of youth of colour who apparently do n’t speak proper German , whose Germanness is always questioned , and who simply do n’t belong .
2008 is also the year that the hate crimes discourse enters more significantly into German sexual politics .
Its rapid assimilation was aided by the fact that the hatefully criminal homophobe was already known : migrants , who are already criminalised , and are incarcerated and even deported with ever growing ease .
This moral panic is made respectable by dubious media practices and so - called scientific studies :
Where every case of violence that can be connected to a gay , bi or trans person ( no matter if the apparent perpetrator is white or of Colour , and no matter if the basis is homophobia , transphobia or a traffic altercation ) is circulated as the latest proof of what we all know already — that queers , especially white men it seems , are worst off of all , and that ‘ the homophobic migrants ’ are the main cause for this .
This increasingly accepted truth is by no small measure the fruit of the work of homonationalist organizations like the Lesbian and Gay Federation Germany and the gay helpline Maneo , whose close collaboration with Pride ultimately caused Butler to reject the award .
This work largely consists in media campaigns that repeatedly represent migrants as ‘ archaic ’ , ‘ patriarchal ’ , ‘ homophobic ’ , violent , and unassimilable .
Nevertheless , one of these organizations now ironically receives public funding in order to ‘ protect ’ people of colour from racism .
The ‘ Rainbow Protection Circle against Racism and Homophobia ’ in the gaybourhood SchÃ¶neberg was spontaneously greeted by the district mayor with an increase in police patrols .
As anti-racists , we sadly know what more police ( LGBT or not ) mean in an area where many people of colour also live — especially at times of ‘ war on terror ’ and ‘ security , order and cleanliness . ’
It is this tendency of white gay politics , to replace a politics of solidarity , coalitions and radical transformation with one of criminalization , militarization and border enforcement , which Butler scandalizes , also in response to the critiques and writings of queers of colour .
Unlike most white queers , she has stuck out her own neck for this .
For us , this was a very courageous decision indeed .
Ms Deeley said she was " angry and confused " at being refused the pill A woman has been refused the contraceptive pill because it was against the religious beliefs of a pharmacist .
The female employee at Lloyds pharmacy on Duke Street in Sheffield told Janine Deeley she could not give her the prescription on religious grounds .
Ms Deeley , 38 , of Wybourn , was told she could pick up the pill the next day , when another staff member was on duty .
A Lloyds pharmacy spokeswoman said an investigation had begun .
' Very sorry '
Ms Deeley told BBC Look North : " The pharmacist beckoned me to a shielded - off area and said she was not prepared to give me the contraception because it was against her religion .
" I said it was not against my religion and I did not see why I should have to go to another chemist or come back at a later date for a different pharmacist to dispense it .
" I was angry and I was confused . "
A Lloyds spokeswoman said : " Lloyds pharmacy is very sorry that Ms Deeley was refused supply of her prescribed contraceptive pill at our Duke Street pharmacy .
" We have launched an investigation into the incident and have been in contact with her to apologise for any distress and inconvenience caused . "
The spokeswoman said she was not aware which religion the pharmacist followed .
An NHS Sheffield spokeswoman said : " We take patients ' concerns very seriously , and while we have not yet received a complaint from Ms Deeley we would be happy to investigate the matter on her behalf if she gets in touch through our normal complaints system . "

Yesterday 's fuel cells , like those seen here on Spacelab , require a hydrogen infrastructure .

Coal is dirty , and fuel cells run on hydrogen -- that 's the conventional wisdom .
But a new generation of " direct carbon " fuel cells challenges that .
Instead of relying on hard - to - produce hydrogen , these cells pull their power from an electrochemical reaction between oxygen and pulverized coal ( or some other source of carbon , like biomass ) .
The advantage : carbon - based energy production that requires no combustion , allowing it to operate at about twice the efficiency of a typical coal - fired power plant .
California - based Direct Carbon Technology expects to have a 10 - kilowatt prototype running on biomass in 2010 , while Ohio - based Contained Energy hopes soon to use the tech to power a small light bulb .
Eventually , the companies hope to build modular fuel cells that can be stacked in order to create new small - scale power plants or add clean capacity to existing plants .

For the past five years , scientists at the University of Alberta in Edmonton have been working on the Human Metabolome Project , a database of the 8000 naturally occurring metabolites ( that is , small molecules involved in chemical reactions in the body ) , as well as 1450 drugs , 1900 food additives and 2900 toxins that turn up in blood and urine tests .
With this information , researchers can analyze a patient 's metabolomic profile , allowing them to tell from a drop of blood or urine whether somebody likes chocolate -- or is likely to develop a life - threatening disease .
Today , these tests require million - dollar pieces of equipment that are mostly confined to research labs .
The Project 's database , which was first released in 2007 , is already being used in commercial applications such as drug discovery and disease diagnosis , making quick and easy tests for personalized health and medical guidance possible .

Scientists have long known about naturally occurring piezoelectric materials , which have the ability to transform electrical energy into physical stress and vice versa .
But by building the property into electronic displays , companies can now create screens that can change shape or texture .
This year , the technology is expected to make the leap into mainstream consumer products , offering the potential for mobile devices with screens that can harden protectively when turned off , and soften into a depressible touchscreen when turned on .

The ideal prosthetic limb would behave like part of the natural body .
Osseointegration allows prosthetics to fuse with a patient 's living bone -- it works by taking advantage of the fact that bone cells attach to titanium instead of rejecting it .
The technique has already been used for small - scale dental and facial implants , and researchers are now bringing it to full - scale limb prosthetics .
After a successful lower - leg implant in 2008 on a German shepherd named Cassidy , veterinary surgeons at North Carolina State University have six more leg operations on amputee dogs planned for 2010 , and are considering a case involving an ocelot at the North Carolina Zoo .
But the big challenge ahead is to implement the technology in human limbs .

Trillions of cubic feet of natural gas in the United States lie buried within layers of shale as much as 11,000 feet deep .
Much of this gas is inaccessible through ordinary wells -- the dense rock makes it flow too slowly .
The answer : wells that drill vertically down to the shale bed , then make a gradual 90 - degree horizontal turn through the shale deposit .
It 's an old idea , but higher energy prices and better technology have suddenly made it a hit .
In 2008 , Chesapeake Energy deployed 14 horizontal drilling rigs in the South 's massive Haynesville Shale deposits , and they expect to have 40 rigs up by the end of 2010 .
10 . Ultracapacitors
The biggest challenge for electric cars is energy storage : Batteries are better than ever , but they are still expensive , slow to charge and have fairly limited life spans .
The solution may be ultracapacitors , which hold less energy than batteries ( at least as the technology currently stands ) but have virtually none of their drawbacks .
That means longer life spans , no messy chemical reactions , no issues with battery memory and far greater durability .
Researchers have been trying to perfect automotive ultracapacitors for several years ( MIT is working on nanotube - based ultracaps , while Argonne National Laboratory is exploring battery - ultracap hybrids ) , but the big move could come from the secretive Texas - based company EEStor , which announced in April that its barium - titanate design had passed a crucial test .
Though the company 's claims have aroused skepticism , EEStor 's automotive partner , ZENN Motors , is hyping the release of an ultracapacitor - powered car in 2010 .

Back in February , we commented on the fact - free IPCC - related media frenzy in the UK which involved plentiful confusion , the making up of quotes and misrepresenting the facts .
Well , a number of people have pursued the newspapers concerned and Simon Lewis at least filed a complaint ( pdf ) with the relevant press oversight body .
In response , the Sunday Times ( UK ) has today retracted a story by Jonathan Leake on a supposed ‘ Amazongate ’ and published the following apology :
The article “ UN climate panel shamed by bogus rainforest claim ” ( News , Jan 31 ) stated that the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report had included an “ unsubstantiated claim ” that up to 40 % of the Amazon rainforest could be sensitive to future changes in rainfall .
The IPCC had referenced the claim to a report prepared for the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) by Andrew Rowell and Peter Moore , whom the article described as “ green campaigners ” with “ little scientific expertise . ”
The article also stated that the authors ’ research had been based on a scientific paper that dealt with the impact of human activity rather than climate change .
In fact , the IPCC ’s Amazon statement is supported by peer - reviewed scientific evidence .
In the case of the WWF report , the figure had , in error , not been referenced , but was based on research by the respected Amazon Environmental Research Institute ( IPAM ) which did relate to the impact of climate change .
We also understand and accept that Mr Rowell is an experienced environmental journalist and that Dr Moore is an expert in forest management , and apologise for any suggestion to the contrary .
The article also quoted criticism of the IPCC ’s use of the WWF report by Dr Simon Lewis , a Royal Society research fellow at the University of Leeds and leading specialist in tropical forest ecology .
We accept that , in his quoted remarks , Dr Lewis was making the general point that both the IPCC and WWF should have cited the appropriate peer - reviewed scientific research literature .
As he made clear to us at the time , including by sending us some of the research literature , Dr Lewis does not dispute the scientific basis for both the IPCC and the WWF reports ’ statements on the potential vulnerability of the Amazon rainforest to droughts caused by climate change .
In addition , the article stated that Dr Lewis ’ concern at the IPCC ’s use of reports by environmental campaign groups related to the prospect of those reports being biased in their conclusions .
We accept that Dr Lewis holds no such view – rather , he was concerned that the use of non-peer - reviewed sources risks creating the perception of bias and unnecessary controversy , which is unhelpful in advancing the public ’s understanding of the science of climate change .
A version of our article that had been checked with Dr Lewis underwent significant late editing and so did not give a fair or accurate account of his views on these points .
We apologise for this .
Adobe announced their second quarter financial results yesterday and during the accompany­ing conference call , Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen spoke about their Flash technology and how it ’s doing given the recent contro­versy with Apple .
The call transcript quotes Narayen as saying :
Enabling our customers to deliver engaging experiences across multiple devices remains a focus of the company .
Today we announced availability of Flash Player 10.1 for mobile devices , which delivers on the promise of enabling access to the full web across desktops and devices .
We expect millions of devices to ship with 10.1 in the second half of 2010 .
Flash is strategic for Adobe because it delivers great value to our customers .
Approxi­mately 3.5 million Flash designers and developers are working with Flash - based solutions today , and their ranks grew by 59 percent in 2009 .
The new release of Flash Player creates a whole new sandbox for these millions of designers and developers to create next - generation content , advertising , games , applications and experiences .
We ’ve already seen that those who have been using the new Flash Player on Android phones love it ; and as devices start to ship with Flash during the rest of the year , those that do n’t have Flash on their smartphones will wish they did .
During the subsequent Q&A session with analysts , the question came in , “ are you seeing any impact on the Creative Suite business relative to the Flash and HTML5 debate ? ”
Last month we reported here there would be “ no impact , ” and yesterday the CEO confirmed :
No , we really have not seen any impact on our Flash authoring business .
What we are finding frankly is that we ’re seeing more and more fragmented workflows as people have to author to different standards .
And the demand actually on our authoring side , to be able to deal with all these disparate workflows is actually causing more attention being paid to the Creative Suite 5 features .
In fact , for CS5 products containing Flash authoring and output , we have a 22 % increase in revenue over CS4 to date .
And I think you ’ll see probably another ten tablet - style devices that come out with different resolutions between now and holiday season , which will increase the demand for that capability within our products .
And we ’ve said this multiple times , both Flash and HTML are really going to be the solution for the web .
Both of them have benefits .
And Adobe has had a long history of supporting both existing formats ; and when the formats do n’t exist , of inventing appropriate technology to enable people to deliver the kind of experience they want .
But if you think about sporting events that are happening or when you think about television , all of that ’s also being streamed on the internet and frankly all of that ’s in Flash .
So for those who have been watching the soccer or golf , virtually all of that content is in Flash .
The press reviews of the new Flash Player 10.1 on mobile devices have been good and the demos impressive , and it ’s the # 1 free download on Android .
At today ’s Droid X launch in New York ( see video interview below with Adobe , Google , Verizon , and Motorola ) , Google ’s mobile VP Andy Rubin shared that 160,000 Android phones are now activated each day , up from a prior estimate of 100,000 / day just last month .
As more and more Android devices come to market , along with planned support for Flash Player on RIM ’s Blackberry devices , Nokia ’s Symbian and MeeGo devices , Palm ’s WebOS devices , and future versions of Windows Phone , Flash ’s future on Android looks bright .

A senior government official has said that Turkey is set to cancel military agreements with Israel following the killings of nine Turks on May 31 in an Israeli commando raid on the Mavi Marmara , part of a six - vessel convoy that set out to challenge the blockade of the Gaza Strip .
�mer �elik , deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AK Party ) , said military agreements would be cancelled with Israel for the short term .
" Regarding Turkey - Israel relations , everything will be cancelled in the short term , from military agreements to other ties , " �elik said .
On May 26 - 27 teams of commandos from the navy�s elite and secretive Flotilla 13 unit began rehearsing for the operation off Israel�s coast , according to Israeli defense officials .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak gave the final approval , and on Friday , three Israeli boats left port with the commandos on board .
Around 600 of the flotilla�s 700 passengers were aboard the Mavi Marmara .
Most were from Turkey and Arab countries , but the group also included dozens of Americans and Europeans , including lawmakers and an Arab member of Israel�s own parliament .
The Israelis ordered the flotilla to halt , but the ships pressed ahead .
The resulting Israeli raid left nine people dead , including eight Turkish citizens and one US citizen of Turkish descent .
Around 30 people were wounded in the attack .
Turkish government sources said it was Barak�s order for a raid that made the AK Party decide to sever military ties with Israel .
Barak , who has a moderate approach in the Israeli government , had come to Turkey on Jan. 17 following the diplomatic row between the Turkish and Israeli governments over a farcical drama over the Turkish ambassador�s seat , and his visit was effective in softening ties between the two countries .
However , after details emerging following the operation showed that Barak gave the order for the raid , the Turkish government changed its stance even though the defense ministers from both countries had announced following the flotilla crisis that the 16 military agreements between them would not be cancelled .
Turkey�s Defense Minister Vecdi G�n�l said Monday that the military agreements were under the responsibility of the Turkish Foreign Ministry , in response to a question on whether or not Turkey would cancel military agreements signed with Israel .
" If the issue of Turkish - Israeli military agreements comes to the Turkish government , we would have a debate on them .
We have not yet received any request from the Foreign Ministry on this issue , " G�n�l said .
Following harsh condemnation of the attack , Turkey recalled its ambassador to Israel , Oğuz �elikkol , while three planned military exercises with the nation were cancelled .
The government announced it was considering reducing its relations with Israel to a minimum .
Turkey�s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said on Monday that the future of agreements with Israel depended on Israel�s attitude .
" If Israel gives the green light to the formation of an international commission and is ready to answer the commission�s questions , Turkish - Israeli relations will continue along a different course .
Otherwise , Turkish - Israeli relations cannot be normalized , " Davutoğlu said at a press conference in İstanbul .
Davutoğlu said the Israeli attack on the aid flotilla is a problem for Israel , the international community and international law , not a problem between Turkey and Israel .
He also said UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon had proposed to set up an international commission to deal with the issue and that Turkey�s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had accepted that proposal .
" If Israel thinks it has protected its national interests and rights , it should declare that it accepts the formation of an international committee ; otherwise , it means that they are hiding some facts , " Davutoğlu said .
The Turkish foreign minister also said Turkey would never let any country hurt Turkish citizens on purpose and that everyone involved would have to face the consequences .
Defense ties between Turkey - Israel
There are 16 agreements currently in effect between Turkey and Israel regarding military issues , including the mutual training of troops and cooperation .
The rapprochement between the two nations gained momentum after the 1980 military coup d��tat .
Turkey and Israel had always sought to increase mutual relations , including in the military field , ever since the emergence of friendly ties between the two after Turkey , which was ruled at the time by coup leader Kenan Evren , abstained from a UN resolution condemning Israel�s occupation of the Golan Heights .
However , one could argue that the most concrete cooperation started in 1992 , when the two nations signed a deal envisaging a partnership to boost tourism .
A historic turning point in relations occurred when Turkish Prime Minister Tansu �iller offered the exchange of intelligence and a joint initiative against terrorism in 1994 .
The outcome was the signing of the Secret Security Agreement .
Israel and Turkey signed over 12 other military deals during Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan�s term in office .
If any of those agreements are to be cancelled soon , sources said that the first one would be the Military Education and Cooperation agreement , signed on Feb. 22 , 1996 , and the second one would be the Defense Industry Cooperation agreement , signed on Aug. 28 , 1996 .
The same sources said that Turkey has long depended on Israel for defense industry support and that this latest incident could provide the catalyst to draw back from this situation .
The total estimated value of current military contracts that Turkey has awarded to Israeli companies amounts to $ 1.8 billion .
This figure comprises a significant amount of the two nations � total annual trade volume of $ 2.6 billion .
The most recent agreement with Israel was signed during Barak�s visit to Turkey in January .
Last week , I was pruning tomato plants at the farm when I noticed a vaguely familiar plant growing amongst the tomatoes .
It had fleshy , succulent , paddle - shaped leaves and thick , reddish stems that crept along the ground .
After studying it for a moment , it came to me – purslane !
I recognized it from one of my field guides .
Purslane , it turns out , loves rich garden soils , often to farmers ’ dismay .
But this weed is also a delicious treat .
After confirming my identification with one of the farmers , I started nibbling on the purslane as I trained tomato plants .
It had a sweet - sour flavor that reminded me of a very mild green banana and a lovely chewy texture .
I liked it so much that I harvested a pound to bring home and experiment with .
Purslane leaves and stems make great additions to salads .
You can also saute them or add them to soups , stews , or other vegetable dishes , but be sure not to overcook them – they ’ll go slimy on you .
Besides being delicious , purslane has an exceptionally high concentration of alpha - linolenic acid , one of the highly sought - after Omega - 3 fatty acids .
Purslane loves hot , humid weather , making it a great vegetable to harvest when your lettuce and salad greens start to look a bit pekid .
Young leaves and tender stem tips are the most desirable .
Since purslane is a weed , you can find it popping up just about anywhere .
In addition to gardens , you can find purslane in rich bottom - lands , fields , and even in the cracks of your sidewalk !
You can also occasionally find it at farmers markets or buy it as a potted plant .
When foraging for purslane , watch out for spurge , a poisonous plant that grows in similar conditions to purslane .
Snap a stem to confirm your identification .
If there ’s white , milky sap inside the stem , you might have picked spurge – discard it .
Purslane stems are filled with water .
Purslane stems are also thick , while spurge has a wiry stem .
For recipe ideas , try this Purslane and Parsley Salad or this Grilled Zucchini Salad with Purslane and Tomato ( both of which are vegan ) .

What in heaven ’s name were her parents thinking ?
For a lot of people , that was the second thought that came to mind upon hearing that Abby Sunderland , the 16 - year - old Thousand Oaks girl attempting to sail solo around the world , was rescued by a French fishing vessel Saturday after being cast adrift in the middle of the Indian Ocean .
( The first thought , of course , was : Thank God she ’s alive . )
Now that Abby ’s OK , the inevitable storm of criticism is raining down on her parents , Laurence and Marianne , who wished their daughter bon voyage when she cast off from Marina del Rey in January .
Allowing a 16 - year - old girl to sail alone around the world — were they insane ?
Not at all .
Unusual , yes .
But hardly “ the worst parents in the world , ” as I ’ve heard them called recently .
In fact , they may be the opposite .
Like Paul Romero , the father of Jordan Romero , the 13 - year - old Big Bear Lake teenager who climbed Mt. Everest last month , the Sunderlands are practicing something bold and rare these days : brave parenting .
Raising kids today ( I have an 11 - year - old and an 8 - year - old ) is like working on a construction site with an overzealous risk manager .
Everywhere you look there are signs reminding parents that Safety Is Job One .
We ’re told to cut up hot dogs and grapes to prevent choking , to lash the kids into car seats , to never let them out of sight at the park .
A certain amount of this is progress , of course .
I ’d rather my kids not launch through the windshield like human missiles in a head - on , thank you .
But in our obsession with safety , we ’ve lost sight of the upside of risk , danger and even injury : raising bold children who are prepared for adventure and eager to embrace the unfamiliar .
The habitat of my own children is constrained .
It contains entirely too many screens and couches .
And this constraint is not unique to my family .
As Richard Louv pointed out in his groundbreaking book , “ Last Child in the Woods , ” kids are playing outside less often and for ever - shrinking periods of time .
Sandra Hofferth , a researcher at the University of Maryland , found that the amount of time kids spent outside doing things such as walking , hiking , fishing and beach play declined by 50 % between 1997 and 2003 .
Not long ago , up to half of the kids in this country walked or rode their bikes to school .
Now fewer than 1 in 5 do .
That inactivity has consequences .
In the 1960s , less than 5 % of American kids were obese .
Now it ’s pushing 20 % .
So seldom do kids wander in the woods that “ nature deficit disorder ” has become a common concern among parents of my generation .
How nutty have things gotten ?
Last month , Lenore Skenazy , who resists the bubble - wrapping of childhood at her website freerangekids.wordpress.com , declared May 22 a national holiday : Take Our Children to the Park and Leave Them There Day .
The idea was so outlandish that the New York Times and the San Francisco Chronicle deemed it worthy of ink .
Skenazy ’s radical notion was to drop off your kids at the park .
Not in Times Square or the Tenderloin .
At the park .
The Sunderlands are n’t crazy .
They ’re subversives .
They ’re undermining a dominant culture that pumps parents full of fear and finds us at fault every time our child skins a knee .
Let ’s be clear : Brave parenting is n’t synonymous with wise parenting .
I have my own reservations about a 13 - year - old like Jordan Romero climbing Everest .
The maturity of a 13 - year - old ca n’t compare with a 16 - year - old .
It ’s why we allow teenagers to drive at 16 and not 13 .
( “ I ’m not sure a 13 - year - old can be fully cognizant of the lethality of that environment , ” one veteran Everest climber told me .
“ I do n’t know if they ’re old enough to understand . ” )
Last year , Dutch authorities were so alarmed by 13 - year - old Laura Dekker ’s plan to sail alone around the world that they did n’t just stop her from setting sail ; they punished her father by revoking partial custody .
Nanny state , thou doth appear ridiculous in thy judgments and thy wooden clogs .
Are stage parents pushing their kids into these adventures ?
I have yet to run across one .
The money and fame are too small .
Sponsorships in the adventure world usually consist of a couple of free tents and a few hundred dollars , to offset costs that can run to $ 100,000 .
We are n’t talking Nike shoe contract money here .
There are murmurings this week about the Sunderlands signing a reality TV deal .
To be honest , that makes me a little nervous .
But consider that Abby ’s older brother , Zac , did the around - the - world gig last year with no reality TV deal .
Kate Gosselin - size fame does n’t seem to be the motivating factor .
To me , the bright line in these situations is the age of 16 .
It ’s taken us a century of trial and error to settle on that boundary in terms of driving ( a.k.a. , the ability to deal death to oneself and others ) , and it seems an apt guideline for these sorts of adventures as well .
Word to the Dutch : That ’s guideline , not law .
And while I question the wisdom of a 13 - year - old going up a Himalayan peak or sailing solo , I ca n’t fault the impulse behind it .
I applaud it .
I ’m not about to rope up with my 11 - year - old daughter on K2 , or even Mt. Rainier .
That ’s not who she is .
And if it were , she ’d still be too young .
But the brave parenting of the Sunderlands and the Romeros forces me to reconsider the constraints I put on my kids .
It helps me lead my son and daughter to the edge of the woods and tell them , go farther now .
On your own .

Muslim scholar Maulana Naveed Ashrafi expressed concern over the product A Coventry farmer has insisted he is reacting to demand from traders in trying to give Muslims a taste of pork by producing bacon - style rashers from halal - slaughtered turkeys .
Rod Adlington 's attempts to imitate the meat , which Muslims cannot eat because of their religion , has seen a Muslim scholar voice concerns that it could lead to people eating real bacon from pork .
The turkey farmer told BBC Asian Network he was reacting to requests from convenience stores he supplies to and said they wanted a " really good turkey bacon " .
" We kept being asked for it and so we decided to produce it , " he added .
It could well lead towards going towards the real thing
Muslim scholar Maulana Naveed Ashrafi
" There 's a want for the product for the halal market , for the pork - free market and for the slimming market . "
Muslims can eat other types of meat apart from pork as long as it is halal , which means it is blessed as it is killed .
Maulana Naveed Ashrafi , a Muslim scholar from Blackburn , said he was concerned as to where eating the turkey bacon rashers could lead to for other Muslims .
" It can ultimately lead to people who only eat halal food ending up eating the real bacon - bacon from pork , " he said .
" The Islamic opinion on this subject would be to avoid eating such foods which have a remote resemblance ( to pork ) because it could well lead towards eating the real thing . "
However , Dr Haifaa Jawed lectures in Islamic Studies at the University of Birmingham , said she did not believe there was a problem in eating bacon - style turkey rashers .
" The aim of the prohibition in Islam is not to eat non-halal meat or bacon , " she said .
" If there is no bacon in that form of food or , if the meat is Islamically slaughtered , it should be ok . "

If we replaced Facebook with a decentralized collection of cooperating services that provide a similar collection of features , obvious candidates for some of these services are FOAF files , twitter , and flickr , but what would coordinate those services ?
Some have APIs and can store information that lets you make connections between the different services , so I wrote something to make one of those connections .
Twitter and related services such as identi.ca do an excellent job of replacing Facebook 's status updates .
FOAF files were supposed to be the RDF geek 's ideal way to track friend networks , and while FOAF is probably the most popular vocabulary outside of Dublin Core , actual FOAF files have been used for little more than demos .
If we could integrate them into this Facebook - like collection of services that I 've been thinking about , they could become more practically useful , so I came up with a way to find someone 's FOAF file based on their twitter ID .
Looking up a FOAF file using a twitter ID Twitter lets you specify a home page address as part of your profile , and twitter 's API can easily find out someone 's home page URL .
A little RDFa in your home page can point to your FOAF file , and then a short script can take someone 's twitter ID , find out their home page URL , and then find out the FOAF file URL from the RDFa in that home page .
I wrote a service that takes a twitter ID and returns the FOAF file URL , which you can try yourself with the URL http://www.rdfdata.org/cgi/twitterName2FOAFFilename.cgi?twitterID=bobdc.
Step one is adding the following RDFa to the body your home page , substituting your own home page and FOAF file URLs : < div xmlns : foaf = " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " typeof = " foaf : Person " > < span rel= " foaf : homepage " href = " http://www.snee.com/bob "></span> < span rel= " foaf : page " href = " http://www.snee.com/bob/foaf.rdf " ></span> </div>
It basically says " the Person with the following home page ( which should be the same one named as your home page in your twitter profile ) has the following FOAF file " .
There 's nothing twitter - specific here , so the small number of triples that this embeds in your home page could serve many other uses , and of course you can add other information about the home page owner being described .

For conservatives in general and maybe some tea party paranoids , it was a “ gotcha ” moment : news that 47 percent of American households paid no federal income tax .
At last !
Confirmation that the poor and lower middle - class were ripping off the rest of us taxpaying patriots .
Let 's be clear : Exposing tax cheats and those who do n't pay their fair share to support an equitable and democratic society is a good thing .
But hold the champagne .
The now - infamous 47 percent figure is grossly misused and misunderstood , according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center which first published the number .
What ’s more important , focus on the 47 percent figure allows the self - appointed tax - cheat police to overlook the real villains in the great American “ beat - the - tax man ” game .
It ’s our American corporations .
From 1998 to 2005 , two out of every three of the 1.3 million U.S. corporations paid no federal income tax , according to the General Accountability Office .
In some cases , the corporations involved , especially smaller ones , reported they were unprofitable .
Seems hard to swallow considering how good times were from 1998 to 2005 , but you never know .
Larger corporations , like Exxon Mobil , were able to duck taxes legally by using subsidiaries in the Cayman Island , Bermuda and the Bahamas to shelter cash from overseas operations .
A recent Forbes Magazine article reported that Exxon Mobil , with a record $ 45 billion profit last year , paid $ 15 million in income taxes — but all overseas , nothing to Uncle Sam .
Likewise , General Electric pulled in $ 10.3 billion in pre-tax income but owed nothing in U.S. income taxes , Forbes reported .
What stands out here is how skewed is our notion of welfare .
In the Clinton years , you ’ll recall , we largely did away with federal welfare for individuals and families .
But it ’s alive and well today for corporate America , which naturally does not call it welfare .
The CATO Institute , home of organized libertarianism ( an oxymoron ? ) , contends there are more than 100 corporate subsidy programs — welfare by another name — on the books , including vast sums for the agribusiness giants , the sugar industry and other business biggies , especially global firms .
These take the form of research grants , subsidized insurance and loans , even payments to foreigners who buy from U.S. corporations .
( Some might call that bribery ) .
The justification for this kind of outlay — CATO calculated the cost at $ 75 billion a year , Time magazine had it even higher — is that it creates more U.S. jobs .
Maybe ; these claims are hard to track .
The record of corporations receiving government subsidies is not a good one .
During the 1990s , Time found the five top corporate recipients of subsidies from the U.S. Export - Import Bank actually cut their work forces by a third .
Why ?
To take advantage of globalization and cheaper labor abroad .
Hard to fault the corporations .
Their manipulation of the tax code and grasping pursuit of federal subsidies may not be very patriotic , but it ’s legal .
Lay the blame where it belongs : on a Congress that allows K Street corporate lobbyists to write the tax code in return for campaign contributions .
And on a public that sees red over low - income families who pay no income tax , but seems indifferent to welfare for wealthy corporations .
Now , about that 47 percent who pay no income tax .
Who are they ?
Overwhelmingly , they ’re individuals and families with little income or retirees and widows living on Social Security .
( Try living in New Jersey on even $ 50,000 a year with a family of four . )
They may pay no federal income tax , but they are liable for Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and , of course , and for state and local taxes .
Botton line : the real percentage that pays no taxes at all — income or payroll — is n’t 47 percent but just 13.4 percent , according to the Tax Policy Center .
But 47 percent makes for a better story , does n’t it ?
And for more outrage .
The classic Italian series finally gets an English translation .
So my Arbitrary day santa guy dude found out I had a romantic interest in ketchup .
So he got me this wonderful , sexy bottle ANDDDD a custom Leeroy Jenkins Reddit Mousepad !!
Thank you !
P.S. - excuse the too small t- shirt , it has sentimental value .
' A Pandora 's Box ' Arrest of Suspected Mossad Agent Strains German - Israeli Relations
The recent arrest of an alleged Mossad agent in Warsaw could adversely affect German - Israeli relations .
Officials in Berlin say the Israeli secret service went too far in obtaining a German passport for alleged use in the murder of a Hamas official in Dubai -- especially as they apparently used a fake story of Nazi persecution to get it .
Its doom was sealed six years ago .
In 2004 , UC Berkeley researchers say , this comet was tugged by Jupiter 's gravity into a path bound for destruction in the cauldron of the sun .
And when its end finally came this March , astronomers captured the comet plunging deep into the sun on video ( see below ) , watching it go farther into the light than any suicide comet seen before .
Seeing comets and other small objects approach the sun is difficult because the objects are overwhelmed by the sun ’s brightness .
Scientists were able to track this one closer to the sun than ever , before it it burned up in the sun ’s lower atmosphere [ Wired.com ] .
The team watched the comet with NASA's STEREO
( Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory ) , launched in 2006 and using satellites on opposites sides of the planet to survey the sun in 3D .
The comet plunged through the corona and was tough enough to survive until it crossed into the chromosphere
and met its final end .
Based on the comet 's relatively short tail , about 1.9 million miles long , the researchers believe that the comet contained heavier elements that do not evaporate readily .
This would also explain how it penetrated so deeply into the chromosphere , surviving the strong solar wind as well as the extreme temperatures , before evaporating [ Daily Mail ] .
The astronomers think this now - deceased comet was a Kreutz sungrazer
.
This is a group of comets that are the remnants of a single large comet that broke up , and periodically they graze too close for comfort and make death dives into the sun .
The teams presented the findings yesterday at the American Astronomical Meeting in Miami
.

Jail vs Prison
What is the difference between jail and prison ?
The words ‘ jail ’ and ‘ prison ’ are sometimes used interchangeably between English speakers , for example you might hear : “ Harry was just released from prison last week .
I had no idea he was in jail ! ”
However , there is a difference in the usage of the words ‘ jail ’ and ‘ prison ’ and to be better understood it is important to use them correctly .
The key to knowing which word to use is short - term versus long - term .
Jails are most often run by local authorities , such as a sheriff of a town or county government .
The purpose of a jail is to hold someone for a short period of time while they await their trial date or transportation to a prison once they are convicted .
‘ Convicted ’ means found guilty of a crime , and the time set by the court that a convicted person is to spend in jail or prison is a ‘ sentence ’ .
A prison is run by a state , as in the U.S.A. , or the main federal government .
The word ‘ penitentiary ’ also can be used to refer to a federal prison .
A person is sent to prison for their sentence of time after appearing in a court of law and being convicted of a serious crime .
A serious crime might be something like stealing or murder .
A person in prison is called a ‘ prisoner ’ , but the word ‘ inmate ’ also may be used for a person in either a jail or prison .
There are some exceptions to convicted criminals being sent to a prison , such as for a short sentence .
For example , in the state of Florida , U.S.A. , a convicted person will serve their sentence in a jail if it is 364 days or less .
In countries other than the U.S.A. , the system may be different .
For example in the U.K. , jails are not normally used at all and in Canada , the jail system is run by the provincial governments .
Prisons and jails may also operate programs such as boot camps , substance abuse counseling and work release programs designed to help rehabilitate inmates .
The goal is to prevent management difficulties while serving a sentence and address problems that may have contributed to the inmate committing a crime in the first place .
Many times a person goes into these programs once they are near the end of their sentence to better prepare them to re-enter society .
A prison inmate also may be put on parole , or given permission to leave prison before their sentence is over because they behaved well while in prison .
This early release comes with conditions , such as staying in a certain area or checking in with a police officer frequently to be sure good behavior continues .
So in using the words , ‘ jail ’ or ‘ prison ’ be sure to understand the situation of the inmate .
It is correct to say : “ The police took the robber to jail and he will stay there until he is convicted of the crime . ”
And “ The robber is now in prison serving his sentence of 10 years , but he may get out early on parole after 8 years . ”
The gulf of Mexico oil spill may be many times larger than realised , with vast amounts of oil spilling out in deep undersea " plumes " which cannot be seen from the surface , scientists suggested yesterday , in a development which put yet more pressure on Britain 's oil giant BP to cap the leaking well as soon as possible .
But in a first glimmer of positive news since the accident , BP reported last night that it had began successfully to extract both oil and gas to a ship via a more than mile - long tube inserted into the mouth of the leak on the seabed .
An earlier attempt on Saturday to bring oil to the surface had to be suspended after the pipe became snagged .
Kent Wells , a BP vice president in Houston , refused to say exactly how much oil was being captured by the tube or put any kind of figure on the proportion of the leak that was being tamed .
He said that measurements were being taken and enginners will know in the next day or two .
But he added : " It will take a little time .
We will look to capture as much oil as we can . "
But as BP struggled to cap the well .
the company 's troubles increased with the news that the flow rate from the ruptured Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which the US government calculated from satellite imagery to be about 5,000 barrels of oil a day , and which BP has gone along with , may actually be between 25,000 and 80,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , American researchers now believe ( one tonne of crude equals 7.33 barrels , or 308 gallons .
The oil escaping from the rig , which BP had leased from the Swiss - based drilling company Transocean and which blew out on 20 April , in an explosion which killed 11 people , is already threatening an environmental and economic catastrophe along the Gulf coast .
But it could be much worse than so far anticipated .
If the oil were flowing at the 80,000 bpd top rate now envisaged , unseen beneath the giant oil slick on the surface , the amount which has escaped since the accident would be more than two million barrels in total , which would make it the fourth worst marine oil - spill in history .
If the well cannot be capped from above and the leak can be stopped only by drilling a relief well , which has already begun but will take three months , the amount of oil leaked might amount to more than five million barrels .
In June 1979 , 3.5 million barrels escaped from the Mexican Ixtoc 1 well , also in the Gulf , after a blowout .
Ixtoc 1 took nine months to cap .
The biggest oil - spill was deliberate , when valves at the Sea Island oil terminal in Kuwait were opened by Iraqi forces at the end of the Gulf War in January 1991 , which is thought to have released more than 10 million barrels of oil into the Persian Gulf .
The new leakage rate assessment from Deepwater Horizon has come from scientists from several universities on board the US research vessel Pelican , on one of the first missions to gather scientific data about what is really happening in the Gulf , which has been backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administation ( NOAA ) , the US agency which looks after the health of the seas .
Their key finding has been that there are enormous plumes of oil hanging in the deep water , one of which is 10 miles long , three miles wide and up to 300 ft thick .
" There 's a shocking amount of oil in the deep water , relative to what you see in the surface water , " said Dr Mandy Joye , of the Department of Marine Science at the University of Georgia , who is co-ordinating the mission from her laboratory in Athens , Georgia .
" There 's a tremendous amount of oil in multiple layers , three or four or five layers deep in the water column . "
The shallowest oil plume the group detected was at 2,300ft and the deepest was near the sea - floor at 4,200 ft .
The scientists are alarmed that the underwater plumes are depleting the dissolved oxygen in the seawater .
The oxygen had already dropped by 30 per cent near some of the plumes , said Dr Joye .
" If you keep those kinds of rates up , you could draw the oxygen down to very low levels that are dangerous to animals in a couple of months .
It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas .
We 've never seen anything like this before .
It 's impossible to fathom the impact . "
BP , the largest oil and gas producer in the US , which under US law is responsible for tackling the disaster and the subsequent clean - up , is coming under ever - increasing pressure over the length of time it is taking to stop the oil flowing , now nearly a month .
Debian Lessons
Project management lessons from the Debian project .
5 September 2004
This text lists the important things I think the Debian development community has learned about project management in the course of developing the Debian GNU / Linux system .
These are my personal opinions , not those of the project or other developers .
I hope this list will be useful to Debian , other Linux distributions , and other free software projects .
This is the second version of this text .
The first one was written in the year 2000 .
Thanks to the people on Debian 's IRC channel for feedback since the first private drafts .
Thanks to Mark Brown for pointing out IRC versus mailing list for communication between developers .
Make sure things scale up .
Problems are always simpler when the project is small .
When the number of developers and packages grows a lot , small problems become big problems .
Make things distributed so that things can be worked on in parallel .
Make sure the foundation is good .
Debian has a pretty good package management system ( even though it has lots of minor flaws and warts ) .
This makes it much easier to build the system , when one can concentrate on making packages better , instead of having to fight the base system .
Document important things .
When people need to work together , they need to know how to take each other into consideration .
Rules are needed for how packages are laid out so that they do n't interfere with each other .
If these rules are n't written down , they will have to be remembered by the community memory and word of mouth , both of which are unreliable .
The Debian Policy documents are a fine example of this .
Debian could n't live without it .
( Note that when documenting things it 's important to document the reasons behind the decisions as well .
Debian documents do n't always do this well . )
Automate repetitive tasks when possible .
Repetitive tasks should be automated , especially if they are tricky or critical .
This reduces the number of human errors , and also frees up developers for more important tasks .
Debian examples include dinstall ( moves uploaded packages into the ftp server ) , lintian ( checks for many errors that are easy to make ) , and the automatic compilation for porting efforts .
They 're all absolutely necessary for Debian to maintain high levels of quality .
Avoid single points of failure , especially for volunteers .
Volunteers will always lack time at the critical point .
For critical jobs , have several people share the workload and make sure there are mechanisms for checking that things are going smoothly .
Do not worry about time tables ; keep goals realistic .
In big volunteer projects , time tables will always slip .
That is not a catastrophe , and it must be tolerated , but there should still be some effort in keeping them .
Goals must be kept realistic .
Make it easy to work independently .
The more interdependencies things have , the more communication is needed ( read : less time spent on productive hacking ) and the bigger the chance that a single developer or package will cause big problems .
For example , if many packages must manipulate the configuration of a server ( say , Apache ) , it is better if they can just drop a file in a directory of configuration files , rather than having to attempt to automatically edit a single configuration file .
Some things must be decided or handled centrally .
Security issues are one such example .
These must not be de-centralized or trouble will happen .
Do not overload developers .
Developers are volunteers with too little free time .
Make as few requirements on their time as possible .
For example , do not require that they follow high - volume mailing lists .
Overloaded developers have a tendency to disappear , or at least their packages will be of lower quality or less up - to - date than they might be .
Also do not let developers overload themselves by trying to do too much , and make it easy ( culturally and technically ) to give up packages , when the workload gets too high .
Be open and keep things public .
If you 're popular , your users will want to know what is going on .
Do not decide things behind closed doors .
Allow everyone to read the discussions leading to decisions and , preferably , allow everyone to participate in them , even if they are n't developers .
Developers may need a private forum as well , but it should be used as little as possible .
By doing things in private , you are hiding your motives and other people will be assuming the worst and react accordingly .
This applies within the project and between developers or groups of developers as well .
When things are decided that affect more developers than those involved in a particular discussion , the discussion must be held in a forum that all developers can participate it .
For example , IRC is not good enough , since not everyone will be present at any given time .
It 's OK to start a discussion on IRC , but before any decisions are made , it should be taken to , say , a mailing list .
Make it easy to contribute .
There are never too many developers , so make it natural and easy for people to join in and help with what they can , even if it is just reporting bugs .
Debian has recruited a thousand developers this way , and manages to have well over ten thousand packages .
Many developers only have one package , but it tends to be one they need themselves , so they 're motivated to keep it working .
Some barrier to entry may be necessary for quality and security .
The Debian New Maintainer process screens and trains prospective new Debian developers .
Note that this is a process with two different tasks .
On the one hand , it is necessary to make sure the people who become official developers are well - intentioned and have the right attitude : an official developer effectively has root privileges on a large number of machines and so they must be trustworthy .
On the other hand , many of the skills required of a Debian developer can be learned during the NM process .
The process also helps them become part of the Debian development community .
Have leadership .
There must be some way to solve conflicts and arguments , if a natural consensus does n't occur .
Different projects may need different kinds of leadership , but there has to be some way , formal or informal .
Conflicts are natural , but must n't get out of hand .
Developers are often opinionated , strong - minded , and bullheaded .
You can't avoid that .
They must be allowed to scream at each other every now and then , but fights must not be allowed to escalate .
Everyone in the project will have to be responsible for mediating between disagreeing parties , if they can't come to a consensus by themselves .
Unfinished fights will easily haunt the project .
Developers do not have to like each other , but they do have to get along , at least to the extent that they do n't prevent each other from working on the project .
If two people despise each other , they must learn to ignore each other , and especially to learn to ignore insults the other party may throw .
Use a bug tracking system .
An open bug tracking system makes it harder for bugs to be forgotten when developers are too busy , or leave the project , or lose their disks .
It also lets people see whether they want to use a package before installing it , and to find solutions or workarounds for bugs that are already known but not yet fixed .
Real world politics matter .
As the free software movement has grown , and Debian with it , people outside the programmer communities on the Internet have started to take notice .
Inevitably , this brings in matters of real world politics .
As a result , people within Debian need to mind such political issues as different developers voting for opposite parties or living in countries almost literally at war with each other .
Debian developers occasionally need to step very carefully to avoid upsetting each other .
One cannot assume Debian developers have anything in common except the desire to work together on a free operating system .
The social contract binds us together , pretty much nothing else does .
Controversial issues will result in a flame war and often will never really end .
Almost all discussions within Debian take part on mailing lists .
This is good in many ways , but has some drawbacks .
One such drawback is that the natural limitations on aggressiveness that are present in a face - to - face discussions are missing .
This means that controversial issues easily result in flame wars .
Another drawback is that there is no natural deadline to a mailing list discussion : in a face - to - face meeting , sooner or later the participants will want to go away and that ends the discussion .
On a mailing list , things can easily go on for weeks , and can easily re-surface at the drop of a hat .
These facts also mean that finding a consensus and making a decision as a group is hard .
Compensation helps keep people motivated .
Doing much work without any reward does not work in the long run .
The best form of compensation depends on the person .
For some , the compensation of having a Debian package of something they use themselves is enough .
For others , getting thank you notes is what makes them happiest .
What rarely works for anyone is getting flamed at for doing their best , even if is in reaction to an error they made .
Never , ever , write a program to mail Debian developers automatically .
Always make automatic mails opt-in .
Most Debian developers get and process huge amounts of e-mail each day .
They develop wildly different e-mail reading habits that are best suited for their different temperaments .
They tend to take their e-mail personally , and react strongly to any e-mail they did n't want to get .
Thus , sending them automatically generated e-mail ( say , to inform them that there is a new upstream version ) is a good way of annoying them .
Do n't make assumptions about people 's background .
Do n't assume anything about their ethnic , religious and cultural backgrounds , their political opinions , their linguistic ability , their technical training , their geographical location , their lifestyle , or their knowledge about issues not directly related to their packages .
For example , do n't assume they know what time zone you mean unless you are explicit about it ( and giving times of day in UTC is better than assuming that people know what " EST " is ) .
Do n't assume they know English well .
The fewer assumptions you make , the easier it is to communicate successfully .
