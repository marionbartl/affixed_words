Angel Di María has completed his move to Real Madrid after passing a medical at the Benabéu this morning .
Real announced they had reached an agreement with Benfica to sign Di María at the end of last month in a deal reportedly worth ¤ 25 m ( £ 21 m ) , but they were forced to wait until the Argentina midfielder had returned from the World Cup to complete the deal .
And , following his national side 's exit at the hands of Germany in the quarter - finals , the 22 - year - old has now signed a six - year contract .
" The player is in perfect condition to make himself available to José Mourinho , " said the club 's head of medical services , Carlos Díez .
" He is a very lean and complete player .
He is in perfect health and readily available for the coach .
Every exam came back normal , which is a great sign .
He now needs some time to rest having played in the World Cup and at a later date he will join the team for pre-season training . "
Di María joined Benfica from the Argentinian side Rosario Central in 2007 and won the Portuguese league and cup double at Estádio da Luz last season .
Android : Google previewed over - the - air app installing at its I / O conference , but you can get that functionality in your Android phone right now .
Install AppBrain and its Fast Web Installer , and clicking " Install " on the web will instantly install apps on your phone .

Here 's a one - minute explanation and demonstration of that process :
Of course , you might be wondering how secure it is to provide AppBrain instantaneous access to install whatever it thinks you want on your phone .
AppBrain 's apps connect you through your Google credentials without ever actually seeing your password .
AppBrain could stand to have a bit more information on their privacy page about app installing security , but they seem to be on the up - and - up about what they 're collecting and why .
It 's up to you whether the instant - install convenience is worth trusting the developers — they have 25 utility - type apps in the Market already , though , so it does n't quite seem like a fly - by - night scam .
One more hitch : AppBrain 's instant installer only works for free applications , as you 'll have to verify your payment credentials for paid apps .
Beyond that , it 's worked with every app we 've tried out this morning .
AppBrain and the Fast Web Installer are free downloads from the Android Market .
You can find QR codes to install both applications at the Androinica link .

Building your own PC is as rewarding as ever .
Fortunately , it still makes plenty of sense , too .
It 's true that you can't beat the convenience of today 's retail PCs .
As consumer interest shifts to laptops and cell phones , desktop PC sales still carve out a substantial niche in the market .
On paper , they look pretty good .
These days , they 're fully specified with quad - core CPUs , 6GB of DDR3 RAM , and large hard drives .
Many of the lower - end models come with free PCIe slots , at least the ones in regular tower cases .
In theory , a gamer could go with a $ 600 Gateway , Dell , or HP configuration , and then add a better video card .
That would be a perfectly fine PC for most folks .
Even for gaming , it would work for a while , providing you kept the extra video card to a shorter , lower - end model that fits inside the case , and that is n't too demanding on the PSU .
But there are also pitfalls to this approach .
In years past , PC enthusiasts decried retail PCs , saying that a custom - built model is significantly cheaper and performs better .
The first point is no longer true ; economies of scale have made it difficult to save money when building a PC on your own .
But the latter still holds .
There will always be a place for boutique PC builders that can put together killer , high - end gaming PCs .
And laptop buyers have no other choice anyway .
But in mid-2010 , there are lots of reasons why it 's still best to build your own PC .
What follows are eight of ours .
Have more of your own ?
Leave them in the comments , or tell us on Twitter at @extremetech .
1. Flexible case designs .
Retail PCs come with desktop cases that are more alluring than ever , thanks to sculpted lines , shorter heights , and built - in conveniences like memory card readers and HDMI ports .
Few PC users need eight drive bays and six PCI slots today anyway , except for niche applications .
But these cases have precious little room to fit an extra video card ; you can skip those 10.5 - inch - long , dual - height GPUs .
That 's to say nothing of poor airflow , and — in a few cases — no free drive bays at all .
Go with a proper Antec , Cooler Master , or other respected vendor , and you 'll never have a problem .
2. Stronger power supplies .
Forget overclocking ; some of the 250 - and 300 - watt PSUs that come with box store PCs can't even power a regular video card , unless it 's a super low - end model like AMD's ATI Radeon HD 5570 .
Even if the wattage is there , an extra six - pin PCIe connector might not be .
A low - end card would certainly help , but with the prices of 23 - inch LCD monitors now below $ 200 , you 'll want to play games in higher resolutions — which you 'll have no problem doing with an aftermarket power supply and the right video card .
3. Proper versions of retail motherboards .
It 's usually tough to figure out what motherboard is inside a retail PC before you buy it .
But even if the board is from a respected vendor like MSI or Asus , there 's a good chance it's a special , low - end version made specifically for the box - store PC vendor .
That makes it a royal pain to find additional drivers and support for it down the road — and makes you dependent on the PC vendor .
Go with a retail motherboard that 's designed to stand alone , and you 'll avoid these problems entirely .
4. Quality parts you choose yourself .
A retail PC may carry a storied brand logo on the front panel .
And if you bought an Intel or AMD PC , you can probably count on that actual CPU being inside .
But who makes the parts in the rest of the machine ?
Often , the vendor 's support team wo n't know , either .
That 's because from week to week , a manufacturer may switch OEM suppliers for the memory chips , hard drive , optical drive , and other components — all to get the best deal for that batch of machines .
Choose your own parts — with our help , of course — and you 'll always know what you 're getting .
5 . No bloatware .
Everybody knows about this one already .
But we 'll emphasize it here for a more subtle reason :
It also pollutes the OS install discs that come with retail machines .
Assuming you get any discs with your system , that is — which is increasingly rare .
Sometimes the OS install files come conveniently preloaded on a separate hard drive partition , but if the hard drive goes , you 're toast .
Even if you get the discs , that means whenever you want to refresh the machine and reinstall the OS , you 'll have to uninstall all that awful crapware all over again — or face miserable performance on what should have been a perfectly clean , fast Windows 7 install .
It 's a shame that retail PC vendors think your brand new computer is a vehicle to display dozens of ads for its " channel partners , " but we 'll leave that aside for now .
Install Windows 7 from an OEM disc , and you 're assured of a clean , fast install every time
6. Coherent support policies .
Buying a retail PC means you 're stuck with whatever support system the vendor has in place .
That was fine 15 years ago , when Micron and Dell PCs averaged $ 3,000 and came with luxurious phone support .
That 's no longer the case today .
Do you like two - hour phone calls where you 're asked to reseat the power cable for the fifth time ?
Have no problem being told that blowing away the hard drive and reinstalling from the CDs will fix the memory card reader ?
We suppose it 's nice to have one central support destination for the entire PC , if you enjoy feeling like a puppet on strings .
If you build your own PC and you know something broke , you can replace it yourself — with whatever part you want , and whenever you want .
And in some cases , trying to figure out what the retail PC manufacturer intends for you to do to fix a problem , with all that crapware and weird install discs and special partitions , takes longer than learning how to do it the right way ( if you do n't already know how ) .
7. Upgrade whenever you want .
This is a corollary to the previous reason .
If you add something to a retail machine , like a new video card or even extra RAM , from a different source other than the PC vendor , the company could choose not to honor the warranty when something breaks — even if it involves a different part of the PC .
By buying a retail PC and then modifying it later , you 're setting yourself up for a possible dispute with tech support down the road .
Build your own PC , and you can add a new video card or more RAM whenever your budget allows for it .
8. Building a PC is just cooler .
Okay , we 'll be totally vain with the last one .
But it 's true ; we 'd wager that plenty of frustration with Windows machines involves the bloatware and cheap parts that make up most retail PCs — especially now that Microsoft is finally selling an excellent version of its OS .
By building your own PC , you can select quality parts — itself a fun and enjoyable process .
And within a few hours , you 'll know more about how to fix it down the road than you would have ever learned otherwise .
And did we mention all those awesome games you can play ?
Using computers to teach children with no teachers By Jonathan Fildes
Technology reporter , BBC News , Oxford Published duration 16 July 2010

The original experiment let children interact with a PC via a hole in a wall
A 10 - year experiment that started with Indian slum children being given access to computers has produced a new concept for education , a conference has heard .
Professor Sugata Mitra first introduced children in a Delhi slum to computers in 1999 .
He has watched the children teach themselves - and others - how to use the machines and gather information .
Follow up experiments suggest children around the world can learn complex tasks quickly with little supervision .
" I think we have stumbled across a self - organising system with learning as an emergent behaviour , " he told the TED Global ( Technology , Entertainment and Design ) conference .
Learning curve
Professor Mitra 's work began when he was working for a software company and decided to embed a computer in the wall of his office in Delhi that was facing a slum .
" The children barely went to school , they did n't know any English , they had never seen a computer before and they did n't know what the internet was . "
To his surprise , the children quickly figured out how to use the computers and access the internet .
" I repeated the experiment across India and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do . "
image caption
The experiment has been repeated in many more places with very similar results
He saw children teaching each other how to use the computer and picking up new skills .
One group in Rajasthan , he said , learnt how to record and play music on the computer within four hours of it arriving in their village .
" At the end of it we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers on their own irrespective of who or where they are , " he said .
His experiments then become more ambitious and more global .
In Cambodia , for example , he left a simple maths game for children to play with .
" No child would play with it inside the classroom .
If you leave it on the pavement and all the adults go away then they will show off to one another about what they can do , " said Prof Mitra , who now works at Newcastle University in the UK .
He has continued his work in India .
Stress test
" I wanted to test the limits of this system , " he said .
" I set myself an impossible target : can Tamil speaking 12 - year - olds in south India teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own ? "
The researcher gathered 26 children and gave them computers preloaded with information in English .
" I told them : ' there is some very difficult stuff on this computer , I wo n't be surprised if you do n't understand anything ' . "
Two months later , he returned .
image caption
Many initiatives aim to put computers in the hands of children
Initially the children said they had not learnt anything , despite the fact that they used the computers everyday .
" Then a 12 - year - old girl raised her hand and said ' apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA contributes to genetic disease - we 've understood nothing else ' . "
Further experiment showed that having a person - known as " the granny figure " - stand behind the children and encourage them raised standards even higher .
Returning to the UK , he fine - tuned his method even further .
He gave groups of four children a computer each and set them a series of GCSE questions .
The groups were allowed to exchange information and swap members .
" The best group solved everything in 20 minutes , the worst in 45 minutes . "
To prove that the children were learning , and not just skimming information off the web , he returned two months later and set the same questions .
Crucially , this time the children had to answer them on their own with no computer aids .
" The average score when I did it with computers was 76 % .
When I did it without computers , the average score was 76 % - they had near photographic recall . "
Professor Mitra has now formalised the lessons from his experiments and has come up with a new concept for schools called SOLE ( Self Organised Learning Environments ) .
These spaces consist of a computer with a bench big enough to let four children sit around the screen .
" It does n't work if you give them each a computer individually , " he said .
For his experiments he has also created a " granny cloud " - 200 volunteer grandmothers who can be called upon to video chat with the kids and provide encouragement .
He has tested the spaces in the UK and Italy , with similar results , and now believes it should be tested more widely .
" We could change everything , " he said .
TED Global runs form the 13 to the 16 July in Oxford , UK .
In recent days , the over - two - centuries - old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in Germany .
Dr. Karl Lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution .
According to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo .
Homeopathy was first proposed by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two - thirds of public health insurance in Germany .
In an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel , Lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University in the United States , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice .
" So health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine .
Homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the United Kingdom , where the British Medical Association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the National Health Service should fund its use .
Hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in Meissen , Saxony
Scarce scientific evidence for practice
Nearly all medical officials agree with Lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment .
" If everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said Dr. Kay Brune , a professor in the Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology at Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - Nuernberg , in southern Germany .
Brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the German psyche .
" Homeopathy has a very long tradition in Germany , " he added in an interview with Deutsche Welle .
" The founder , Hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
But at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
In 200 years , the pseudo - science has not taken any steps forward . "
He also added that under the Third Reich , Nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-Jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it .
Other German politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including Rainer Hess of the Federal Joint Committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . "
Despite the evidence , many Germans still engage in homeopathic practices
Homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket
Brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis .
" My estimate is 100 million euros [ are spent on homeopathy annually ] , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in Germany , " he said .
According to Germany 's Pharmaceutical Industry Federation ( BPI ) , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros German public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually .
In the end though , Brune added that because so many Germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it .
According to a recent study by the Allensbach Institute , a public opinion research firm in southern Germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
In 1970 , only one in four West Germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent .
" I think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " Brune said .
" They will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
It satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . "

Made to look like a hack , Thought Police Block Mega - Viral Anti-Establishment Documentary After More than a Year of Dominating Viewcounts , Ranking # 1 in Search Engines and Waking Up Millions to the False Left - Right Paradigm Perpetuated by Obama
Aaron Dykes
Prisonplanet.com
July 19 , 2010
Alex Jones is on high - alert after someone managed to compromise the “ ChangeDaChannel ”
You Tube account and criminally remove the most - viewed version of “ The Obama Deception ” available online , which had more than 6.5 million views and whose URL link ranked among the top of all “ Obama ” related searches .
The channel ’s owner was tipped - off about the breach , and was subsequently able to change the password and prevent further deletions of Alex Jones and other patriot documentaries .
Both he and members of the Infowars staff believe the video could have only been pulled from behind the scenes at Google or by a government - level cybersecurity admin with access to YouTube records , as the passwords were carefully guarded and unlikely to be guessed at .
The film , which has been attacked before , was censored at a critical time .
Just one day before on Friday ’s broadcast , Alex challenged activists to drive “ Obama Deception ” up in the search engines .
Only a few hours later , Google trends rankings revealed that it was the # 1 search term , above Lindsay Lohan , the BP Oil Spill or the death of George Steinbrenner .
What ’s more , the viewcount grew by nearly 100,000 in that same single day , demonstrating the accelerated attention the film has been receiving .
Further , as a result of topping the online trends charts , dozens of fresh reviews in online papers and blogs were published , including Blue Star Chronicles , Mahoo News and Live Street Journal .
“ This was a criminal act , and You Tube needs to investigate , track the IP and find out who did it , ” Alex Jones said .
“ The Obama Deception was getting more and more popular , and the establishment does n’t like the fact that it exposes the Left - Right paradigm and identifies Obama as a puppet , ” he added .
Fighting back against the censorship of The Obama Deception and other patriot works is in your hands .
Already , your hard work to promote and propagate this information has resulted in tremendous success .
You are equally capable of responding to this negative act with a positive outpouring of numbers in the way of spreading the video , searching for the term and a million other ways of promoting the truth out there .
Once again , it is up to you .
The Obama Deception has drawn fierce attacks since its release in March 2009 – not only strong words attempting to discredit the powerful information the film puts forward , but in attempts to limit and block the film online .
Nevertheless , an estimated 25 million have seen the film worldwide , thanks to hundreds of online versions and DVDs handed out by dedicated activists .
Even so , Google merchant and other shopping carts have blocked its sale after labeling the film as “ anti , ” “ hate ” or otherwise “ inappropriate . ”
Before the film was even released , FBI officials asked suspiciously about the film during a visit to Alex ’s office , where they attempted to gather information about the documentary , office employees and other information .
Earlier in the film ’s release , YouTube was caught fudging the viewcount and other statistics for the film .
This past week , Alex Jones ’ Facebook was blocked for displaying a “ Gadsden flag ” – a key icon of the Revolutionary War–which drew ire .
The Obama Deception was taken down only a few months ago after a false copyright complaint blocked it for several weeks , but was later restored .
Even a “ Christian ” version of YouTube has censored an upload of the film .
Images of President Obama as “ the Joker ” created a stir last year as well – and it was clear from interference that free speech did not apply to those holding signs with the image at rallies or putting up posters around town or on social networking sites .
21ST CENTURY THOUGHT POLICE : INTERNET CENSORSHIP
ALERT
A cadre of White House Intelligensia as well as a new breed of “ Cyber Security ” at the Pentagon have taken it upon themselves to regulate the Internet , conform “ free speech ” to their gated - and - streamlined Internet 2 model and “ offensively ” take on offending web entities .
This action has been boldly led by the likes of Senator Jay Rockefeller , who in support of cyber security bill , stated that it might have been “ better if we ’d never invented the Internet . ”
More dramatically , Joe Lieberman and others have called for Chinese - style censorship and enabling a “ kill switch ” at the behest of President Obama or his successors .
Further , a literal information war has been declared in the online space , a veritable frontier battleground for freedom in the 21st Century virtual world .
CENTCOM announced its intention to “ engage bloggers ” and counter errors or “ disinformation . ”
The Air Force has a similar operation , as does the Pentagon .
Likewise , Obama ’s Information “ Czar ” Cass Sunstein outlined a report for the Journal of Political Philosophy recommending engagement on the part of the government to infiltrate conspiracy groups in order to undermine them via postings on chat rooms and social networks sites .
Even more outrageously , he has envisioned a scheme to censor conspiracy theories or tax those who disseminate them .
Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan has also advocated regulating political speech and even banning books .
The [ email protected ] program even asked supporters to identify “ fishy ” blogs or websites that might be promoting “ disinformation ” about health care or other aspects of the White House agenda .
The same concept took place during the 2008 campaign where Missouri ran an add threatening to arrest critics who “ told a lie ” about Obama or promoted ‘ disinformation ’ such as claims that Obama was born in Kenya .
The web has become the most important public space for political discussion in the 21st Century , as has been very “ democratic ” in its access to blogs , alternative news , individual and even unpopular opinions , the promotion of ideas and candidates ( regardless of budgets or notoriety ) , audio- visual and printed archives and other vital material that should be protected under Constitutional and democratic principles , but are instead being bullied .
Blocking information is not new , but will only accelerate in the realm of the 21st Century Internet .
Opponents of freedom would like to silence widespread online dissent , and will only find justification for moving forward to shut it down and censor its content .
The Constitution and Bill of Rights put in place strong protection for expression and personal belief , and a high - tolerance for free speech for a reason– especially when criticizing or questioning high officials and leaders .
OBAMA’S “ CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE ” IS ELECTION DILEMMA FOR DEMOCRATS
Cadres of angry Obama supporters have been attacking The Obama Deception since its released less than 2 months after Barack Obama ’s inauguration .
Despite attempts to label the film as “ racist ” or “ anti- government , ” The Obama Deception has reached many people , and unnerved the establishment so much , that Alex Jones reportedly made the supposedly leaked White House enemies list , proving that the film has undermined Obama ’s effectiveness .
Instead of being able to easily ram - through legislation with the aid of Democratic majorities in BOTH houses , Obama has been forced to fight for issues that are simultaneously gaining in their unpopularity with the public daily .
Carbon taxes , the bailout for bankers , health care legislation , amnesty for illegal aliens– alongside the collapsing ecomony– have driven massive fury .
All these issues and more have been covered in Alex Jones ’ controversial documentary since the dawn of the Obama Administration .
The Fall of the Republic further expands that analyze and goes even deeper .
Top news pundits are now saying that the Democrats may likely lose control of not only the House , but the Senate as well in the November 2010 elections .
Rahm Emanuel is fleeing his Chief of Staff position ; former Clinton Aides are speculating that only a terror attack like 9/11 or the Oklahoma City bombing save the Obama Administration , and bolster a political rescue from the angry uprising that has been unseating incumbents , supporters of Health Care and other unpopular legislation , but especially the Congressional Democrats .
With the upcoming midterm elections , the Obama White House is more desperate than ever to regain their credibility , silence those calling the Emperor “ naked ” and reign in the destruction of America to fit the schedule of his social - engineering masters .
SOLUTIONS : FIGHTING BACK FOR FREE SPEECH AND ON - LINE LIBERTY — A CALL TO ACTION !
As Paul Joseph Watson has recently observed , the lights are going out for free speech on the Internet .
But the best defense against such strong attempts to censor and control the web , is to fight back with a full offensive .
The same activists who ’ve made The Obama Deception one of the most viewed online films of all time , and who ’ve driven its name into the top of search trends can once again demonstrate to the powers to be that we are a force of significant numbers .
Make it clear that we will never stop fighting and that we will see that this powerful film– and so many other activist tools– are n’t shut down , and instead are spread everywhere into the physical and virtual world .
Fight back against criminal sabotage and outright censorship :
– by spending 5 minutes or so every time you go online to send “ The Obama Deception ” or “ Police State 4 ″ or “ Endgame ” into the top of Google , Yahoo , Bing and StartPage ’s search engines .
– break apart marketing for mindless celebrities or government “ propaganda placement ” and use the hype to bring attention to real issues of the day or powerful documentaries that tell the truth – by spreading other links to The Obama Deception to your friends , family , coworkers and everyone else you know .
Spreading these links will , in turn , make them more dominant in search engine results , and help drive the trend as well – by sending out the new upload of The Obama Deception on Change Da Channel , featuring a warning by Alex Jones about how dire the need is to spread the film and stop the Internet policing – using Facebook , Twitter , MySpace and other social networking sites to virally share “ The Obama Deception ” as well as key news articles - pass out DVDs , pamphlets and flyers in the physical world to people you encounter , and keeping physical and offline archives of vital information that can survive outside of the increasingly - regulated Internet - wherever it seems relevant , let your Congressman , city representatives , etc know that you support a free Internet ; urge them to vote against a “ kill switch ” and to carefully guard against “ cyber security ” that is really surveillance and censorship .

Comment on this article
In an interview with Amalia Rosenblum , Avshalom Kor claimed that the Arabs inherited " place names as they heard them from Jews " ( Haaretz Hebrew Edition , April 19 ) .
His statement implies that the Arabs did not put their stamp on place names in Israel .
To prove this , Kor makes unwarranted generalizations and ignores the traditions that have drawn this land 's historical map .
I contend that all the names used by Arabs for places where people live in this country have their source in the Arabic language .
In my research I have found that some of the place names in Arabic also indicate a combination with Hebrew elements ; sometimes names that seem to have no meaning in Arabic are explained by a Hebrew origin .
However , those cases of adoption from Hebrew do not come close to Kor 's wide - ranging claims .
Had he abided by the rules of scientific discourse , he would have explained that Arabic 's imprint is also obvious in place names .
His claims make it clear that he aims not to investigate scientific truth but to use his knowledge as a lever for ideological claims .
By denying Arab ethnolinguistic markers he is trying to prove that this country 's past is exclusively Jewish .
The Bible and other historical sources contradict this position .
According to the Book of Joshua ( 3:10 ) , for example , before Joshua 's conquest , seven peoples were living in this land .
Is it possible to prove today that all the names in the Bible are Hebrew , and not the continuation of linguistic traditions of the peoples who lived in this land before it was conquered ?
This country 's past is rich in ethnolinguistic and religious traditions .
It is possible to identify influences of the Canaanites , Hebrews , Byzantines , Arabs and others .
Place names have superimposed themselves in differing versions in accordance with the period of settlement at a site , just as levels accumulate in a tel - the hill covering the remains of an ancient settlement .
The human mosaic this country has known has made its mark on the landscape of its names ; this landscape provides textual testimony to the waves of peoples that came through its gates and its multifaceted identity .
Is it possible the Muslims who marched here to make war and the Arab inhabitants of the land who have been living here for hundreds of years did not give names to its places ?
One could fill a book with examples of names the Arabs gave to human settlements and natural sites .
I will confine myself to a few :
The name of the village Kawkab al - Hija perpetuates the memory of Abu al - Hija , the commander of Saladin 's army .
Al A'asem is named for the members of the tribe who live there ; Hudj al - Arus ( " the bride 's canopy " ) is the name of the place where processions from Reina and Saffuriya ( now Tzippori ) would exchange brides .
It is impossible to claim that these names are Hebrew , and it is impossible to make the existence of the society that created them disappear with the stroke of a false scientific claim .
As if this were not enough , Kor has submitted a plan to the Jerusalem municipality for giving names to the stations of the light railway , which is nothing but the uprooting of Arabic names and supplying Hebrew names in their place .
Kor 's ideological greed seeks to erase from consciousness the place 's Arab past and thereby prove to the entire world that it is under Jewish ownership , and that the Arabs of Jerusalem have no linguistic and spatial identity connecting them to " terrestrial Jerusalem " and the city where they have been living for generations .
Kor would have done well to propose to the municipality a plan for preserving the Arabic names .
In that way he would have shown that there remains language coexistence in the torn city and the country as a whole .
The writer researches the link between place names in this country and the identity of places in stories , autobiographical materials and historical memoirs .
For Golden
Week we have a week long special on the goldest game ( in terms of color palette ) from Square Enix .
Jonathan Jacques Belletete , Art Director on Deus Ex : Human Revolution , had a candid chat with Siliconera about Deus Ex : Human Revolution , the third game , which is actually a prequel to Deus Ex .
Do you think we ’ll see any characters from Deus Ex 1 ?
Jonathan Jacques Belletete , Art Director : I ’d like to , that would be great .
If we are going to see characters , chronologically speaking , it ’s possible …
Yeah were in 2027 .
The first one was in 2052 .
So , if you want pick out your favorite characters , deduct the amount of years and then if they ’re in there you ’ll know the age they ’ll be !
[ Laughs . ]
Then you can imagine what they look like !
But , that could trick fans !
Cybernetics could make them live longer .
Yeah , I think we did a big part of our homework by reading what transhumanist technologies are today and where they are gonna go .
They say that our generation might live easily beyond a hundred years like that .
Where medicine is going , nanotechnology , replacing organs , and all of that kind of stuff .
Maybe they look way older than they look like in the first one to begin with .
Maybe they ’re in the third one and already in their 80s and we do n’t know it .
You mentioned cybernetics , but nanotechnology was one of the key elements in Deus Ex 1 .
Does it exist in this world or is that technology on the cusp ?
In Human Revolution , nanotechnology is there , but not implemented in the human body .
They have n’t figured that out yet .
We talk about it in the game .
We talk about the science behind it , you talk to scientists , you read e-mails , newspapers , get TV news .
For example , in terms of weaponry and technology , the way the disc - plate technology in the game are it ’s all based on nanotechnology , which the way today ’s stuff is starting to doing some of that .
But , since it ’s a prequel it ’s all cybernetetic stuff , mechanical augmentations because they have n’t figured out the nano - thing .
Also , in the first one [ Deus Ex ] , the nano - thing is just JC and Paul .
They are the first ones .
Even in ’ 52 it ’s just starting .
That ’s why when you Gunther and Anna they are mechanically augmented they are from the old school .
We ’ve talked a lot about Deux Ex 1 , but was there anything you felt from Invisible War [ Deus Ex 2 ] you took inspiration from for Human Revolution ?
Do you want me to be honest ?
Please .
Nah , nothing .
It ’s very true .
Visually speaking it ’s too much purple .
[ Laughs ]
I mean it it ’s a consensus really .
People just did not really like it .
The first one was for strong .
I remember I jumped on the second one when it came out .
I bought for PC and I bought it for my Xbox .
I do n’t know why I bought both versions .
But , I was so stoked it was a new game in that universe and I just could n’t get into it .
It just did n’t have that soul anymore .
That ’s my personal opinion , but I ’m sure it ’s really spread out .
If you go on a forum , if you go on other forums , if you go anywhere , any gaming sites where people can say what they think , everything you get is , do n’t do it like the second one .
That ’s not from me I just seeing – do n’t f— this up , do n’t do it like the second one , please do n’t do it like the second one .
It ’s really what 98 % of the fans think .
If you missed it we talked about the the soul of Deus Ex 1 yesterday .
Tomorrow we ’re going to touch on themes in Deus Ex : Human Revolution .
Until then , see ya !
This story is part of an ongoing collaboration between ProPublica and FRONTLINE ( PBS ) .
TEXAS CITY , TEXAS --
Two weeks before the blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , the huge , trouble - plagued BP refinery in this coastal town spewed tens of thousands of pounds of toxic chemicals into the skies .
The release from the BP facility here began April 6 and lasted 40 days .
It stemmed from the company 's decision to keep producing and selling gasoline while it attempted repairs on a key piece of equipment , according to BP officials and Texas regulators .
BP says it failed to detect the extent of the emissions for several weeks .
It discovered the scope of the problem only after analyzing data from a monitor that measures emissions from a flare 300 feet above the ground that was supposed to incinerate the toxic chemicals .
The company now estimates that 538,000 pounds of chemicals escaped from the refinery while it was replacing the equipment .
These included 17,000 pounds of benzene , a known carcinogen ; 37,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides , which contribute to respiratory problems ; and 186,000 pounds of carbon monoxide .
It is unclear whether the pollutants harmed the health of Texas City residents , but the amount of chemicals far exceeds the limits set by Texas and other states .
For years , the BP refinery in this town of 44,000 has been among the company 's most dangerous and pollution - prone operations .
A 2005 explosion killed 15 workers ; four more workers have died in accidents since then .
Last year , the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $ 87 million for failing to address safety problems that caused the 2005 blast .
In the weeks since the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in the Gulf , BP has insisted that the incident , the nation 's worst environmental disaster , was a disastrous but unusual misstep for a company that has done much in recent years to change its ways .
But a look at BP 's record in running the Texas City refinery adds to the mounting evidence that the company 's corporate culture favors production and profit margins over safety and the environment .
The 40 - day release echoes in several notable ways the runaway spill in the Gulf .
BP officials initially underestimated the problem and took steps in the days leading up to the incident to reduce costs and keep the refinery online .
Former workers and industry experts say BP 's handling of the recent release of chemicals was typical of the plant 's and company 's operating practices .
The 40 - day emissions were initially reported by the Daily News of Galveston , Texas , but received little national attention .
The unit was never completely shut down , and if it would have been , the event probably would have received more attention .
Any reduction in production for even as little as 24 hours is considered sufficiently important to be reported in the financial press to investors and others .
Michael Marr , a BP spokesman , said the company had invested more than $ 1 billion since 2005 to improve the refinery .
Marr said BP initially monitored the emissions using a method approved by Texas regulators .
It did not show any release in " excess of regulatory exposure limits to workers or the community during anytime . "
Using what Marr described as a method that " enables us to better understand the unit 's emissions , " BP found the much higher rate of release and notified Texas regulators on June 4 .
Environmental experts say the amount of chemicals released was one of the largest in recent Texas history .
" This was a giant release over that 40 - day period , " said Neil Carman , who worked for the regulators for 12 years before joining the Sierra Club .
" Even 50,000 pounds is big . "
Carman said a study he performed showed the BP Texas City Refinery was already releasing more benzene into the atmosphere than any other place in the U.S. from 1997 to 2007 .
BP spokesman Marr says the refinery 's 2009 emissions dropped 20 percent from 2008 , including a 50 percent drop in benzene emissions .
BP had also invested in onsite chemical treatment to reduce emissions , Marr said .
" I would already argue that there 's too much benzene in the air in Texas City , " Carman said , " and then you add this release over 40 days , and it 's just unconscionable that BP would do this . "
Officials in Texas City , who were not informed of the scale of the release until after it was over , have asked BP to explain how this could have occurred .
Marr said the company is now reviewing its procedures .
" I 'm like , ' Oh goodness , ' " Bruce Clawson , Texas City 's coordinator for emergency management , recalls thinking when BP notified him about the release .
" I had a lot of questions and they did n't have a lot of answers at that time . "
Clawson said he is not yet satisfied .
" Obviously , we do not like anything to be released , " he said .
" We expect better from them . "
Marr said the incident began on April 6 when a component of the refinery 's ultracracker went offline .
The ultracracker , an integral part of the plant 's processing of crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products , processes 65,000 barrels of oil per day .
A financial analyst who follows the industry said that each barrel should earn BP $ 5 to $ 10 in profits .
The part that malfunctioned , a hydrogen compressor , traps noxious chemicals , which can then be reused for fuel in the plant and other purposes .
When the compressor stopped working , BP decided to send the gases to a 300 - foot high flare , whose high temperatures turn the dangerous material into carbon dioxide .
The company knew that the burning process was incomplete and that at least trace amounts would escape .
Marr said BP believed the plant 's existing monitors , which are placed just a few feet above the ground level and approved by Texas regulators , would detect any excess emissions .
According to Marr , BP immediately also received measurements from a separate monitor that took readings from the flare .
It was not until June 4 , he said , that the company understood that the emissions were far higher than was permitted .
Despite repeated requests for clarification , Marr declined to say how long the company spent analyzing the data from the flare .
Industry experts say BP had reason to believe from the outset that emissions from the flare would be substantial .
Widely circulated industry guidelines assume that at least 2 percent of what is sent to a flare goes unburned and passes into the atmosphere .
Because such large quantities of gas move through a refinery , this can amount to tens of thousands of pounds .
Carman of the Sierra Club says that flares also may be substantially less efficient than the industry believes .
He said studies have shown that as much as 20 percent of what is sent to flares is released into the atmosphere .
" A 20 percent release from the flare would equal 5 million pounds and the benzene would have been 170,000 pounds , " said Carman .
California regulators said that could n't happen there .
In Contra Costa County , home to several refineries , flares are to be used to handle chemical releases only in emergency situations , not regular operations .
" Refineries are n't allowed to do that in the Bay Area , " said Randy Sawyer , the director of the hazardous materials programs in Contra Costa County .
" If you have an upset and you need to get rid of gases in a hurry , you can send it to a flare .
But if you continue to operate and dump a lot of stuff to a flare , that 's not what they were designed for and it adds to pollution . "
California requires refineries to keep backup hydrogen compressors on hand and it stations regulators at the plants who are alert for any unscheduled flaring .
Last year , the Texas Attorney General filed a civil lawsuit against BP for “ poor operating and maintenance practices ’’ that caused an “ egregious amount of emissions . ”
That case cited 53 separate incidents that , taken together , are roughly equal to the 538,000 pounds BP calculates it released over the 40 days this year .
If BP had shut down the ultracracker , it would have lacked a key component needed to create gasoline suitable for its customers , said Mark Demark , the department chair of process technology at Alvin Community College .
" It 's a big deal to shut the ultracracker down , " he said .
" It 's operating at two to three thousand pounds of pressure , 700 degrees Farenheit ; so it would take you a week just to cool that place down . "
Demark , who worked for Shell for 33 years , said if he had been faced with that choice , he would probably have halted operations .
" Just from a public relations standpoint , for 40 days to have a flare going , you have to be really inconsiderate to your community , " he said .
Did South Carolina Use Second - Hand E-Voting Machines That Louisiana Decertified ?
from the conspiracy - theories dept
Third is the well - documented unreliability and unverifiability of the voting machines used in South Carolina .
It is worth noting that these machines were purchased surplus from Louisiana after that state outlawed them .
South Carolina 's election commission begs to differ about the provenance of the voting machines .
Spokesman Chris Whitmire says the state 's 12,000 iVotronic voting machines were bought brand - spanking - new from Election Systems and Software , an Omaha - based behemoth that boasts of operations in 39 states .
" That was what the word around the state was -- heard it from several people . "

The election situation in South Carolina keeps getting stranger .
Last week , we noted how the controversial election of Alvin Greene , a broke , out of work guy currently facing felony obscenity charges , who did no campaigning and no advertising of his campaign , had people looking at the e-voting machines in the election as one possible culprit .
The ES&S iVotronic machines used in the election have no paper or audit trail , so there 's really no way to go back and check , but the differences in voting patterns between the e-votes and absentee ballots certainly raised some eyebrows , as did a test of randomness in voting results using Benford 's law ( a useful tool for suggesting data was faked ) .
Now , reader Pickle Monger alerts us to the news that the previously expected winner of the campaign , Vic Rawls , is claiming that the ES&S e-voting machines used in the campaign were bought secondhand from Louisiana after Louisiana outlawed their usage :
In response , the state is insisting there is no truth to this claim at all Rawls ' campaigns ' response is hardly reassuring :
In other words , total hearsay .
I 'm all for pointing out the problems of e-voting systems , and ES&S certainly does have an exceptionally long history of having problematic machines that have been decertified in certain states , but claiming that such machines were used in South Carolina without any evidence other than " heard it from several people , " seems pretty silly .
Of course , South Carolina 's election commission has its own credibility problems .
Apparently , its been telling local news media that the iVotronic systems do have an auditable paper trail .
They do n't .
They have a paper tally , but that 's not the same thing .
Either way , if you 've been following the whole e-voting mess for many years , this sort of situation wasto happen .
Even if it turns out that e-voting machines were not the problem , the very lack of a voter verifiable paper trail , combined with massive security problems and ridiculous levels of secrecy from the e-voting companies has created a world in which no one actually trusts those machines .
Even if the results were accurate , the voting machine companies ' own actions have created so much doubt in people 's minds , that they do n't trust the results at all .

When working in eCommerce , having the right packing supplies is essential , but the wrong ones can ultimately affect your ability to ship out and help others with your products .
The right materials , of course , make all the difference .
Some people skimp out on the packing supplies , and not having enough of this will damage your goods .
This is how items get ruined , and here , we ’ll highlight the must - have packaging supplies that you need to have , why they matter , and some of the important information about these packaging supplies that you should always consider .
Bubble Wrap
For any type of packing , whether it be to move , or to ship out items , you need bubble wrap .
You can get these in rolls , and you can get t in varying bubble sizes .
Some of them are so easy , you simply tear it off and you can pack pretty much any fragile or delicate item with this .
If you have a lot of breakable , s such as snowglobes to teapots or other small things , always have this .
Always remember to wrap the bubble wrap items with the bubbles inwards for the most protection .
The small bubble wrap is also better for smaller items since it helps prevent breaking .
You should always stack your dishes on the edges , and not flat , and you can use bigger bubbles for the heavier objects such as electronics , vases , and sculptures for the best results .
Packing Paper
This is literally just clean , ink - free newspapers that you can use for packing dishes , delicate items , and glassware that ’s there .
You can use this as a filler to help protect your boxes a lot better if you ’re not able to fully fill them .
They are clean , so you can put your dishes in them , and they wo n’t get smudged up , and you can unpack these quite easily too .
They ’re also the least expensive option out their , e and they take up less space than bubble wrap does , and you can wrap and cushion anything that you ’re moving with this .
Boxes
Speaking of moving , why not have moving boxes ?
This is the most obvious solution , and you put everything in there from books to tools , to even silverware and canned goods .
You can put pillows , bedding , lampshades , and the like in there too .
You should use both small , medium , and larger boxes in order to help keep your boxes niece and organized , and never try to overfill these either .
Their ’s no point in packing large boxes that require a whole crew to move these , right ?
Well , remember that when you ’re packing these items .
Always make sure that they ’re packed heavy enough that it ’s worth using , but also in a way that ’s light enough that you ’re not struggling to lug the contents around .
You should also pack the heavier items in the larger boxes on the bottom , and the lighter items on the top .
You should n’t ’ leave spaces in these either , so if you do n’t have anything to throw in there such as clothes or towels , throw some packing paper in there too .
It ’ll be easier to move , and they will stack better too .
Moving blankets
While you do need these , I do n’t think you should purchase these .
The movers will use them , and they ’ll help you out .
Rent them from a moving company .
If you ’re moving , and you hire a U - haul to help with this , you can get some moving blankets from them to rent out , or even just use comforters , large beach towels , and other blankets .
If you have a lot of them , you will definitely have a much easier time moving everything .
You probably will be hesitant to buy these simply cause of the cost of them , and the idea of renting blankets could be a little gross , considering where they might ’ve been .
If you have blankets that you can wash or older blankets that are good for moving , you can always just get those .
They are ideal for items that are likely to get scratched and can prevent that from happening as well .
Padded wrapping Paper
This is an alternative to blankets , and it essentially looks just like a brown paper bag , but with the cushioning in it that you can wrap larger pieces such as furniture around it to help prevent scratches and nicks as well .
This is good for harder furniture such as a table , desk , or even a dresser too .
Stretch Wrap
Close - up Of Two Young Delivery Men Carrying Cardboard Box In Front Of Truck
This is literally like saran wrap , but you can use it for so many things .
For example , you literally can use this to keep your dresser drawers from falling out if you do n’t want to take them all off .
Sometimes , you can even just leave everything in there if you just choose to stretch wrap your whole dresser .
It also will prevent it from getting dinged up super easy too .
They are also good for cutlery and utensil trays , and even trays of makeup .
You literally wrap those around and then just unwrap and put it back in the drawer a the new place .
Plastic stretch wrap is used for soft furniture such as chairs and couches , and that ’s done by taking the roll and wrapping it around the furniture pieces too .
If you do wrap the whole sofa , it ’s very difficult to get wet or dirty , and it can be used to hold the skirts down too .
There ’s a lot that you can do with this type of wrapping , and it ’s something that anyone who is moving should have on hand before they begin .
Packign Tape
This is n’t duct tape , but rather , it ’s a sticky , clear packaging tape .
Do n’t buy the cheap little 99 cents packing tape .
It wo n’t be stickiest , but you will need to be generous with this .
You should always tape down the middle , but along with that , a couple of strips along the box side for support .
A tape gun will help you save some time as well .
You should invest in a tape that ’s a great quality , and it will stick to the box .
You should go down about halfway from the top of this box when sealing the seal because if you only go an inch down , it will then move up , and not secure it .
Crisscrossing the box is also good if you need that extra security .
Marking Pens
If you have a lot of stuff , you probably will want a sharpie or a pen .
Magic markers are also good too since it can be good to label stuff as fragile , and it also is good for you to designate what room it goes into .
This is something that can help make the job even easier for you .
Trashbags and Ziploc Bags
Both of these items are good for liquids such as liquor , shampoos , and other items that you spill .
This is also good for small items such as underwear , socks , or any small clothes within the closet .
The gallon - sized bags are good for those tiny items , such as screws , batteries , and brackets
Hopefully , this list of packing items helps you with your next move and makes the process of moving a little bit easier not just for you , but for everyone .
The Australian Medical Association ( AMA ) says the Jayant Patel legal case has the potential to undermine confidence in doctors and surgeons around the country and cause a backlash against those trained overseas .
Doctors working in rural areas say the case will also make it harder to attract much - needed overseas - trained doctors to remote regions .
Patel has been sentenced to seven years in jail for the manslaughter of three patients at Bundaberg 's Base Hospital in southern Queensland between 2003 and 2005 and the grievous bodily harm of a fourth man .
Whether it has set a legal precedent or simply injected a sense of fear , the case has unsettled doctors working in hospitals around the country .
Steve Hambleton , federal vice president of the AMA and former president of the Queensland AMA between 2005 and 2006 , says Patel 's conviction shows health systems should " look after our doctors better " .
" [ It 's ] very tragic that a medical practitioner should come before the courts and be charged with criminal offences and then sentenced - that of itself throws a cloud over the system that allowed this to happen , " he said .
" There are multiple levels that should have detected problems in this case and did n't and so it 's really a system failure as well as an individual failure . "
But Dr Hambleton does not think the Patel case means doctors will now second guess the advice they give patients .
" This case has been so far out of left field that it 's not part of the routine practice that we see in this country , " he said .
" This has only happened once in 100 years and if 100 years go before it happens again , we would say that most doctors who are well trained , who are making decisions , weighing up the pros and cons on behalf of their patients , and making decisions on behalf of their patients do n't need to change their practice .
" They 're well trained and they should trust their decisions , keep their patients fully informed and refer to other doctors when appropriate . "
Foreign doctor ' backlash '
President of the Australian Doctors Trained Overseas Association , Dr Viney Joshi , fears a renewed backlash against foreign - trained doctors who make up about half of all doctors in rural and remote hospitals .
" [ The Patel case ] is not a pleasant thing - it brings back painful memories for people and I mean there is a possibility that some people may behave differently , " he said .
" I hope that there is no backlash but last time there was a reaction , there were quite a few overseas - trained doctors who were sort of openly abused in certain places .
" A lot of overseas - trained doctors in Bundaberg who were practising in the Bundaberg area copped a fair bit of flak and for no fault of theirs . "
But Dr Joshi says patients in rural and remote areas are generally tolerant .
" The rural and remote communities are a lot more ... friendlier , fairer and grateful for the services that are provided to them , " he said .
Rural Doctors Association of Queensland president Dan Halliday says more stringent checks on foreign - trained doctors also make it harder to recruit and retain doctors and specialists .
" We 've actually seen some doctors who have been lined up to come and work in areas of shortage in rural Queensland actively turned away from practising due to the lengthy time frame associated with the registration and vetting process which is now in place , " he said .
" Admittedly , processes had to improve and those processes that were in place by Queensland Health at the time were systemic and obviously inadequate and we hope that those are improving .
" However , we do see that there are quite a number of processes in place which may delay the registration of overseas - trained doctors who want to work in rural areas . "
Dr Halliday says time will tell whether the checks in place are the right ones .
The new graphics API comes with new buzzwords .
We 'll tell you what they mean and how they matter to your gaming experience .

Just when you think you 've grasped all the jargon surrounding 3D graphics , new terms and technologies flood onto the market .
AMD has been aggressively shipping DirectX 11 GPUs in almost every price category , while cards based on Nvidia 's new GTX 470 and GTX 480 DX11 parts are finally becoming available .
Meanwhile , Windows 7 's sales ramp has been extraordinary - the fastest - selling Microsoft OS in history .
Given that Windows 7 is what Vista should have been , it 's also arguable that DirectX 11 is what DX10 should have been .

When DirectX 10 games hit the streets , the new API gave users marginal improvements in image quality alongside huge performance decreases .
The tiny gain in visual fidelity did n't really make up for the performance hit .
On the other hand , DirectX 11 brings users some very cool potential eye - candy improvements , but also promises better performance - even if you do n't have a DirectX 11 GPU .
Along with new graphics , APIs come with new buzzwords : tessellation , SSAO , HDAO , and postprocessing .
That last buzzword being a catchphrase for many small but cool effects made possible with today 's programmable graphics chips .
We 'll take a closer look at these buzzwords to dissect what they actually deliver , plus discuss the performance impact of using high - end AMD and Nvidia GPUs .
Tessellation
Tessellation essentially creates something from nothing - or more properly , more from less .
Hardware tessellation , which is required by DirectX 11 , means that the GPU can generate more triangles from existing geometry using the hardware tessellation engine that 's part of the graphics chip .
Now , generating more triangles for a flat surface is pointless - after all , a flat square looks like a flat square , whether it's two triangles or 2,000 .
What 's more interesting is generating more triangles for an actual 3D model .
Let 's look at a simple example , the cobblestone surface from Microsoft 's DirectX developer 's kit .

The tessellation engine in DX11 hardware is capable of generating many more triangles from existing geometry , as seen in the screen on the lower left , to provide objects that are actually 3D .
In the top - right screen , we have a flat surface that looks somewhat more realistic by the application of a bump map .
Bump maps fake you into thinking a flat polygon has depth by modeling the way light falls on a bumpy object ( such as cobblestones . )
However , if you were to bring the camera level with the pavement surface , you 'd realize it was actually a flat surface .
If geometry is tessellated , the cobblestones are actually 3D , as seen in the lower - right screen .

The tessellation in the cobblestone image is handled by a technique known as displacement mapping .
A displacement map is just a special grayscale texture map in which different shades of gray define how much the geometry is displaced .
Cobblestones are nice , but will we ever see differences in real games ?
Let 's look at the recently released Metro 2033 ( below ) .
The left image is the game with tessellation disabled ; tessellation is enabled in the right image .
Note how the object is more rounded in the second shot .
The effect is somewhat subtle here , but the point stands :
This is the beginning of the end of polygonal heads .
Tessellation means that character heads will someday all be rounder .

In this sceen from Metro 2033 , you can see how tessellation makes it possible to create curved edges .
Yet another example of tessellation , from the DirectX SDK , shows a technique known as subdivision surfaces ( below ) .
The key idea in this technique is to start with a basic set of polygons , then divide them in ways that make sense for the object at hand .
In this character model , we overlay the textures on top of the visible wireframe .
You can see the additional geometry added in the right - side screen , as well as the more naturalistic , rounded features .

Other Uses for Tessellation
Tessellation is great for creating rounder heads and more realistic cobblestones .
But it has other uses , too .
Take water , for example .
Instead of using pixel shaders to build better - looking water , just add more triangles … a lot more triangles , as in the case of the Nvidia Island demo .

Tessellation makes water appear more real in Nvidia 's Island demo .
In the new racing game Dirt 2 , cars driving through water will throw up waves in the DirectX 11 version of the game , using hardware tessellation to generate hundreds of triangles to form the effect .
In DX9 mode , you see some spray , but no waves , and the water puddle itself can be as few as two triangles .

Tessellation adds waves and ripples to a scene in Dirt 2 .
Tessellation Going Forward
Tessellation offers the promise of better , more realistic - looking 3D objects , but it 's no panacea .
As with any new technique , developers will have to be smart about its implementing .
It 's easy to use tessellation to create objects that look wrong .
On top of that , there 's the performance issue .
While modern DirectX 11 GPUs have hardware tessellation engines , resources are n't infinite .
Turn up tessellation too much , and you 'll see a severe performance hit .
Game developers will likely use the technology as part of sophisticated LoD ( level of detail ) schemes where close - up , important objects ( characters ) are tessellated , while distant or unimportant objects are tessellated less - or not at all .

Transparency Antialiasing Not So Special Anymore
Better - quality antialiasing with transparent textures was heavily touted by both Nvidia and AMD just a couple of years ago .
Nvidia called this transparency antialiasing while AMD 's term was adaptive antialiasing .
This is a classic case of a feature that improves image quality at the time , but is n't really considered bleeding - edge these days .
Advertisement
The problem lies with the way transparency is handled in many games .
Transparent objects are polygons with texture maps applied where some of the texture is transparent .
Examples of this are chain - link fences , bare tree limbs , and overhead wires .
Adaptive antialiasing essentially smooths out the edges bordering on the transparent areas within those textures .
Think of it as AA inside the polygon .

Transparency , or adaptive , antialiasing works well when a game supports it ( as seen in the screen above ) , but tessellation could provide a universal substitute .
For transparent AA to work , the game must test for alpha ( the transparent part ) , but also disable alpha blend ( where the transparent texture is combined with a background color to create a new color .
This is sometimes used to create translucent ( partially transparent ) objects .
Advertisement
Valve 's
Source game engine does this , so if you enable adaptive antialiasing ( AMD ) or transparent antialiasing ( Nvidia ) in the graphics control panel , you 'll see the effect , as in the Left 4 Dead screenshot here .
However , alpha blending and other techniques are used that prevent these techniques from working .
For example , enabling the feature has no effect at all in most games that use the Unreal game engine .
Also , technologies like tessellation may eventually make transparency AA obsolete .
If those bare tree limbs can be built with polygons representing the limbs themselves , those polygons can be antialiased with standard multisampling AA , and you do n't need to mess around with adaptive AA .

Ambient Occlusion
Achieving great realism through light and shadows
It 's all about light .
Without light , you can't see .
In 3D games , all lighting is created using mathematical cheats - approximations of how real - world lighting behaves .
Some of the most interesting lighting effects lie in the absence of light : darkness and shadows .
Advertisement
Shadows have evolved from simplistic shadow maps - where the shadows all looked the same from any angle - to the more sophisticated techniques used in today 's games .
Variations on ambient occlusion are becoming increasingly more popular .
Ambient occlusion takes into account how light falls on objects to create shadows , and that the properties of light and shadows change over distance .
Crysis was one of the first games to attempt a form of ambient occlusion , known as screen space ambient occlusion ( SSAO ) .
SSAO techniques try to determine where a point in the scene exists relative to other points , and the effect that light falling onto that point has on other parts of the scene .
Objects have reflective properties , and may in turn bounce light to other parts of the scene - even those blocked from the direct light source .
Advertisement
Real - world objects tend to have crevices , wrinkles , and depressions , which may not be directly lit by a light source ( the sun , for example ) .
But they are n't dark , either - they pick up light being bounced off other parts of the environment or even a nearby surface of the same object that is in direct light .
Previous games often ignored this , so crevices and depressions were either completely dark or looked as brightly lit as the other parts of the object .
Other types of ambient occlusion found in newer games include high - definition ambient occlusion ( HDAO ) and horizon - based ambient occlusion ( HBAO ) .
These are still variations on the same idea - that where a pixel exists relative to other pixels determines how light falls on it , how it bounces that light , and what type of light it is ( direct or reflected . )

The circled areas in this DirectX 11 SDK example show how high - definition ambient occlusion ( HDAO ) produces more realistic details .
Notice the increased depth , sharper lines , and greater shadowing .
Above is an HDAO sample from the DirectX SDK .
Note the internal shadowing made possible in the lower screen by using this ambient occlusion technique .
It is relatively subtle , but the overall scene seems more realistic when you 're running the application in full - screen mode .
In the top shot , HDAO is disabled ; the bottom one has HDAO enabled .
Advertisement
With DirectX 11 , a new technique is emerging called contact hardening .
If you think about how real - world shadows behave , you 'll realize that a shadow does n't look the same along its full length .
Close to the object - say , at the base of a lamp post or tree - the line between shadow and light is sharply delineated ( the " hard " in contact hardening . )
The farther away from the object , the shadow is more diffuse .
That 's because farther away , light seeps into the shadow area from the surrounding environment .
Contact hardening shadows using Direct 11 graphics emulate this look .
Right now , the only game using contact hardening shadows is STALKER : Call of Pripyat ( below ) .
Advertisement
In this DirectX 11 SDK sample , shadows have harder edges near the object and softer edges farther away , as in real life .
Postprocessing Effects
Making graphical magic after the image is rendered
Postprocessing is where effects are applied to the 3D image after the frame is rendered .
The term postprocessing comes from the film industry , where effects are added to movies after the movie is actually shot .
Advertisement
Postprocessing is really a catch - all for special effects that are generated , typically with shader programs , and are n't necessarily part of an existing graphics API .
Of course , the GPU itself needs to be programmable .
Adding effects to rendered frames first began to show up with DX9 games .
We 've seen increasing use of postprocessing effects in DX10 and now , DX11 titles .
A wide variety of postprocessing effects are possible ; examples include depth of field , heat distortion , wet distortion , bokeh , dynamic blur , and film grain .
Advertisement
Some of these effects can be used to add realism to a scene .
Heat distortion above a fire or hot desert sand is a good example of that .
Other effects actually make the game less realistic , but more cinematic .
Examples of these include depth of field , film grain , and bokeh effects .
( Bokeh is the blurriness you see in out - of - focus areas of a photograph .
The quality of the bokeh is one of the parameters used to rate the quality of a camera lens . )
Without Bokeh

With Bokeh
Advertisement
In Just Cause 2 , you 'll see bokeh effects when you use an Nvidia graphics card .
We 've all seen these effects in movies and television , but rarely experience them in real life .
Game developers add these effects to make their games seem more like big - screen movies .
This makes sense in some games , like the over - the - top action of the recently released Just Cause 2 , which emulate big - budget action movies in their overall feel .
If you have an Nvidia - based graphics card running with the PC version of Just Cause 2 , you 'll see bokeh effects in action .
Advertisement
The use of bokeh helps to focus the player 's attention on whatever is nearby .
Clever shader - program writing can give developers granular control over the effect , as we see in the AMD Ladybug depth - of - field demo ( downloadable from the AMD developer website . )
This demo gives the user control over aperture settings , as if they were shooting with a camera .
Stopping the camera down results in a soft blurry background behind the sharply focused image .
Opening up the aperture brings the background into better focus .
Advertisement
In AMD 's ladybug demo , you can control aperture settings to change the background 's focus .
Advertisement
The game Borderlands ( below ) uses depth of field to focus your attention on whatever you 're aiming at with your weapon .
Programmable shaders took a big step forward with DirectX 11 .
Previously , if a programmer wanted to add multiple effects to a scene , the shader program became large and unwieldy .
Now they can call in shader routines as needed , allowing for more efficient writing of shader programs and more efficient use of effects .
Advertisement

Borderlands uses depth of field to focus your eye on an object you 're aiming at .
In the screen on top , everything is in focus , but when the player takes aim , only the target in the foreground is in focus , as seen in the screen on the bottom .
The Performance Impact
How does all this graphics goodness affect frame rates ?
If we set the wayback machine to a couple of years ago , we 'd relive the disappointment we all experienced with the first DirectX 10 games .
Visual effects added only marginally to image quality , but the performance hit was huge .
What 's the impact of these spiffy new DirectX 11 features ?
Also , what 's the impact of postprocessing effects ?
Obviously , adding more shader programs can impact performance , but how much ?
Advertisement
We tested performance with hardware tessellation using the Unigine Heaven 2.0 synthetic benchmark ( which uses a real game engine ) and STALKER : Call of Pripyat .
Call of Pripyat was also used to test performance with SSAO , HBAO , and HDAO .
The performance of Nvidia 's GTX 480's tessellation engine looks pretty awesome relative to AMD 's part in a benchmark like Heaven , but as we can see from Call of Pripyat , the impact of tessellation on real games is less clear .
There just are n't enough titles yet that make heavy use of hardware tessellation to determine which GPU is superior .
Subjective experiences differ ; Metro 2033 's performance , for example , seems to give the edge to Nvidia , though we do n't have hard numbers to back this up .
On the other hand , Aliens vs. Predator is a smooth experience on both AMD and Nvidia 's latest cards .
Advertisement
Just Cause 2 supports two interesting GPU postprocessing features if you 're running an Nvidia - based card : bokeh and water simulation .
Thus , we tested the GTX 480's performance with and without those features using the game 's Concrete Jungle built - in benchmark .
As you can see , enabling these features incurs a performance cost .
But that cost is a few percentage points , rather than the 75 – 80 percent decrease we saw moving from DX9 to DX10 .
Advertisement
Final Thoughts
In the past , comparisons regarding performance versus visual features revolved around antialiasing and anisotropic filtering .
DirectX 10 added some new tricks to the game developer 's arsenal , but came with a severe performance penalty .
DirectX 11's new features can affect performance , but the new generation of graphics cards enables you to run with much better visual fidelity while maintaining reasonable performance .
Advertisement
It takes time for developers to take advantage of new features .
The good news is that the uptake on DirectX 11 – capable GPUs has been one of the most rapid in recent history .
We are starting to see increasing use of capabilities that first began showing up with DirectX 9 - finally .
For example , it 's hard to find a current - generation game that does n't take advantage of the postprocessing effects made possible with programmable shaders .
Developers continue to experiment with postprocessing effects , as we 've seen with the bokeh setting in Just Cause 2 .
And features like film grain and depth of field are commonplace .
Newer titles bring new effects , such as emulating color filters seen in big - budget movies and TV shows .
Good tools will be the key to seeing new features take hold .
One reason postprocessing has become so common is that graphics programmers have developed tools similar in concept to Photoshop filters , which allows artists to easily implement them in the art pipeline .
It will be some time before similar tools are readily available for newer , DX11 - capable hardware .
Advertisement
Then there 's the multiplatform question .
Larger game publishers are leery of pushing high - end , PC - exclusive features if they 're shipping big - budget titles across multiple platforms , including game consoles that may not support tessellation or other features .
While the PC has made something of a comeback in the gaming arena , putting additional developer resources into PC - exclusive abilities is still something of an afterthought .
Still , we are seeing new games emerge that take full advantage of new graphics possibilities .
Eastern Europe seems to be an emerging haven for bleeding - edge development of PC games , if the STALKER series , Cryostasis , and Metro 2033 are any indication .
And even console - oriented titles , like Dirt 2 , can be architected to take advantage of new APIs on PCs .

So if you have one of the new generation of DirectX 11 cards , turn up the eye candy and experiment .
Your games can look better than ever .

Ford often gets a lot of undue credit for surviving the financial econo - storm without needing government aid -- most forget that Ford actually ran out of cash before General Motors and Chrysler , but was able to get private financing because it happened before the lending landscape self - destructed .
Returning to profit , however -- and $ 2.6 billion of it , at that -- does deserve some kudos .
So how did Ford manage to turn what was a $ 424 million loss in the second quarter of 2009 into an expected $ 2.6 billion reported today ?
The North American market did exceptionally well , with Ford North America posting a second quarter pre-tax operating profit of $ 1.9 billion , a $ 2.8 billion improvement from the second quarter of 2009 .
Ford ’s second quarter revenue , meanwhile , was $ 31.3 billion , up $ 4.5 billion from the same period a year ago .
The company also ended the second quarter with debt from its automotive unit totaling $ 27.3 billion , down $ 7 billion in the quarter .
The reduction included a $ 3.8 billion payment by Ford to the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust , and a $ 3 billion repayment of Ford ’s revolving credit facility .
Ford attributes its strong results to increased sales , which rose by 20 percent compared to the same period one year ago .
With more sales of expensive cars , in particular , comes larger profit margins .
The bargain - basement deals on economy cars leave little room to pad the bottom line , but more luxurious vehicles offer the chance to turn options packages , extra equipment , and higher base prices into measurable profits .
Additionally , building cars in the most common combinations of options and trim specifications means Ford is being more efficient .
A full 80 percent of Ford 's sales are generated on just 20 percent of the possible model combinations ; focusing on building the most popular combos means vehicles do n't sit on lots , eventually being sold for a steep discount -- which works its way back to higher sticker prices and better bottom lines .
The question now will be whether Ford and the market in general can continue to sustain this growth -- and whether we 'll see similar profit figures from Chrysler and GM .
With the all - new 2011 Ford Explorer to be launched on Monday and the pricing punch of the new 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid , it certainly looks like Ford is on the right track .

The well has temporarily stopped leaking oil , but beach clean - up efforts continue
BP says there are no signs of leakage from its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , a day after the flow was stopped for the first time since April .
No oil has escaped from the new cap sealing the well and there was no sign of any breach under the sea floor , BP executive Kent Wells said .
However , more pressure testing is being done to check there are no ruptures .
Earlier , the US official overseeing the spill response , Adm Thad Allen , said the latest tests were inconclusive .
Adm Allen said the pressure test of the well would continue for several more hours .
Speaking in Washington on Friday , US President Barack Obama cautioned against over - optimism and said much work remained to be done .
" It is important we do n't get ahead of ourselves , " he said .
" One of the problems with having this camera down there is , is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done - and we 're not . "
A new cap was used on Thursday to stop the flow for the first time since 20 April , as part of a 48 - hour test of the well 's integrity .
Eleven workers were killed in the Deepwater Horizon explosion , and the oil spill has caused an environmental catastrophe , killing wildlife and coating fragile coastal marshlands with thick , brown crude .
Spilled oil has affected hundreds of miles of Gulf coastline since April , with serious economic damage to the region as tourists have avoided Gulf Coast beaches and fishing grounds have remained closed .
BP has already paid out more than $ 200 m ( £ 130 m ) to 32,000 claimants .
The company is evaluating a further 17,000 for payment and is seeking more information on 61,000 other claims .
High pressure
On the sea floor , robotic cameras and monitoring instruments currently show no evidence of the well rupturing .
The flow of oil was shut off at 1425 local time ( 1925 GMT ) on Thursday , as part of a test of well 's integrity .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL
In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface .
However , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL
When engineers removed the LMRP cap on 10 July , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more .
However , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer ( BOP ) .
This allowed them to conduct a series of tests to see if the flow of oil could be stopped using the newly installed equipment .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL During the test the three ram capping stack has been closed and all sub - sea containment systems collecting the oil temporarily suspended , effectively blocking the flow of oil from the well .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL
Once the tests have been successfully completed , BP will resume collecting oil .
The Helix Producer ship was recently connected to the BOP to provide another collection route in addition to the Q4000 rig .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
If the pressure within the new cap on the well stays high , it could mean there are no other leaks or ruptures within the well bore .
If it drops , that could suggest problems .
BP scientists have detected " no negative evidence of any breaching " of the sea floor , Mr Wells said .
The company will soon run another seismic survey to check for any evidence of ruptures .
BP and government experts are reviewing results every six hours .
If the test is successful , it is not clear what will happen next .
BP has suggested it might be possible to keep the well shut , with oil collection vessels left on standby .
Adm Allen has suggested the most likely outcome is the resumption of collection of the oil with four vessels and the capacity to collect 80,000 barrels - all or virtually all of the oil - each day .
BP is also resuming work on a relief well that has 30ft left to drill before it hits the original leaking well .
Once the wells intersect , mud and cement will be used to permanently deal with the leak .

Google ’s cosy relationship with the U.S. spy network has once again been thrust into the spotlight as the company is reported to have jointly invested with the CIA in an Internet monitoring project that scours Twitter accounts , blogs and websites for all sorts of information , and can also “ predict the future ” .
Google Ventures , the investment arm of Google , has injected a sum of up to $ 10 million , as has In - Q - Tel – which handles investments for the CIA and the wider intelligence network – into a company called Recorded Future .
The company describes its analytics as “ the ultimate tool for open - source intelligence ” .
Wired ’s defence analyst , Noah Schachtman , has a detailed report on the joint venture :
“ … it scours tens of thousands of websites , blogs and Twitter accounts to find the relationships between people , organizations , actions and incidents — both present and still - to - come .
In a white paper , the company says its temporal analytics engine “ goes beyond search ” by “ looking at the ‘ invisible links ’ between documents that talk about the same , or related , entities and events . ”
The idea is to figure out for each incident who was involved , where it happened and when it might go down .
Recorded Future then plots that chatter , showing online “ momentum ” for any given event . ”
Recorded Future “ continually scans thousands of news publications , blogs , niche sources , trade publications , government web sites , financial databases and more , ” according to it ’s portfolio .
It sifts through millions of posts and conversations taking place on blogs , YouTube , Twitter and Amazon to “ assemble actual real - time dossiers on people . ”
It is also being integrated with Google Earth , which , as Schachtman points out in his piece , was seeded with In - Q - Tel / CIA investment .
This integration will allow real time tracking of the locations of persons or groups as part of the overall intelligence dossier .
A promotional video shows the company ’s real time browser - operated data mining engine at work :
Of course , Recorded Future is sold as “ terrorism analysis ” , however the information scouring engine clearly extends beyond that to include crime , indictments and civil court cases etc .
In this context , the ability to predict “ future curves ” is one small step away from Minority Report policing technology .
Indeed , analytics are already being used by the Memphis Police Department , whose Operation Blue CRUSH uses predictive analytics by IBM .
Recorded Future takes in vast amounts of personal information such as employment changes , personal education and family relations .
The video also shows categories covering pretty much everything else , including entertainment , music and movie releases , as well as other innocuous things like patent filings and product recalls .
The news comes at the same time as revelations that the government is proposing to grant the FBI powers to force firms such as ISPs to hand over an individual ’s data .
We have previously reported on Google ’s intimate and long standing connections to government spy networks .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
There is also no doubt that Google is one of the corporations at the forefront of the government ’s drive to use cybersecurity as a pretext for restricting the openness of the Internet , having previously worked with the NSA and the CIA .
The recent scandal involving the company ’s street view roaming vehicles accessing the wi-fi details of internet users and mapping their online activities has also raised serious questions over intelligence links .
This latest development will only enhance those concerns .
Recorded Future also smacks of past military and intelligence projects such as Total Information Awareness and MATRIX , LifeLog and the Brain Machine Interfaces enterprise .
all designed to target American citizens .

KABUL , Afghanistan  NATO pilots mistakenly attacked Afghan soldiers who had laid a trap for Taliban militants and killed at least five of the soldiers on Wednesday , a devastating case of friendly fire in a conflict still troubled by miscommunication among allied forces , Afghan officials said .
The attack in the Andar district of Ghazni Province , about 100 miles southwest of Kabul , suggested a serious lack of coordination between NATO troops and Afghan forces battling militants who hold sway in part of the district known as Rahim Khiel .
The Afghan soldiers “ had made an ambush for the enemy ” when they were attacked early Wednesday morning , said Gen. Zahir Azimi , the spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense .
He said the “ air force ” had “ bombarded ” the Afghan soldiers ; a NATO official later said a helicopter had fired a single rocket into the formation of Afghan troops .
“ We condemn this incident , ” General Azimi said .
“ Unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened , but we hope this would be the last one . ”
tmux is similar to screen as it lets you run numerous TTY ’s in the same terminal window .
It supports some very cool and intuitive features natively as well as a much more readable configuration syntax ( ever looked at a .screenrc file ? ) .
Why TMUX over Screen ?
Well according to the FAQ for tmux it has the following advantages over screen :
A clearly defined cilent / server model ( windows are their own clients which allows flexibility on how you handle windows .
You can attach and detach different windows in different sessions without any issues )
Consistent , well - documented command interface .
( You can use the same commands interactively as in the .tmux.conf file , more on that later )
Easily scriptable
Multiple paste buffers
Vi & Emacs keybindings
A more usable status line syntax ( which also allows you to embed the output of a shell command , handy indeed .
Default keybindings & Functionality
The default keybindings for tmux are actually pretty intuitive , though if you ’re used to screen you ’ll likely get a little peeved with the default action binding of C-b , though this is easily changed to mimic screens behavior :
* NOTE *
If you ’re like me the Ctrl - b binding is n’t horribly intuitive especially if you ’re used to screen .
You can rebind this by putting the following in ~/.tmux.conf :
set -g prefix Ctrl-a
Ctrl -b c Create new window
Create new window Ctrl - b d Detach current client
Detach current client Ctrl-b l Move to previously selected window
Move to previously selected window Ctrl -b n Move to the next window
Move to the next window Ctrl - b p Move to the previous window
Move to the previous window Ctrl- b & Kill the current window
Kill the current window Ctrl-b , Rename the current window
Rename the current window Ctrl-b % Split the current window into two panes
Split the current window into two panes Ctrl - b q Show pane numbers ( used to switch between panes )
Show pane numbers ( used to switch between panes ) Ctrl -b o Switch to the next pane
Switch to the next pane Ctrl-b ?
List all keybindings
Now these are pretty self explanatory – the real magic ( for me ) of tmux is the ease of modifying the default behavior to do what you want , but first things first : let ’s explore the default behavior of tmux .
Basic Window Handling
Start up tmux with the tmux command and you should be greeted with a simplistic terminal window that resembles screen – the only difference is it has a default status bar which is nice ( easily added to screen as well ) .
Now let ’s create a couple of windows and go through them ( we ’ll be using the default bindings ) .
Hit Ctrl - b c a few times to create a few windows , you should notice that there are more tabs in the status bar .
Now if you ’re like me you like to have descriptive names of which each window is for , so let ’s rename them by hitting Ctrl - b , .
It should prompt you to rename the current window – type anything you want and hit enter .
Now the current window is renamed to what you specified .
Now going forward I ’m going to have two windows open respectively named “ window1 ” and “ window2 ” .
Once you rename your windows lets switch back and forth .
We have several different ways of switching windows , so I ’ll go over the ones I personally use :
Ctrl -b n ( Move to the next window )
( Move to the next window ) Ctrl -b p ( Move to the previous window )
( Move to the previous window ) Ctrl -b l ( Move to the previously selected window )
( Move to the previously selected window ) Ctrl - b w ( List all windows / window numbers )
( List all windows / window numbers ) Ctrl - b < window number >
( Move to the specified window number , the default bindings are from 0 – 9 )
Now these ones fairly self explanatory however they do n’t really cater to a lot of different windows .
What if you have 10 + windows open ?
It becomes quite tedious to find the window you want – but do n’t fret !
Tmux has a find - window option & keybinding .
Type Ctrl - b f and type in the window name you want ( it actually searches for the window so you can type in only part of the name of the window you ’re looking for ) .
You can also get a list of the windows in the current session by executing the list - windows command .
To execute commands interactively you type Ctrl- b : which will bring up a text prompt .
From there you can execute any command tmux supports interactively ( tab completion is supported ) .
Basic Pane Handling
One of the most powerful features tmux offers is the ability to split up your current window into “ panes ” .
Anyone whose familiar with tiling windows managers will feel quite at home .
It ’s a bit difficult to explain this in words so a simple screenshot will suffice :
Now here are some basic key bindings and commands to split the terminal window ( vertically and horizontally ) and to switch between them
Ctrl-b % ( Split the window vertically )
( Split the window vertically ) Ctrl- b : “ split - window ” ( Split window horizontally )
( Split window horizontally ) Ctrl -b o ( Goto next pane )
( Goto next pane ) Ctrl - b q ( Show pane numbers , when the numbers show up type the key to goto that pane )
( Show pane numbers , when the numbers show up type the key to goto that pane ) Ctrl- b { ( Move the current pane left )
( Move the current pane left ) Ctrl -b } ( Move the current pane right )
Now some obviously the default bindings do n’t encompass some of features , such as splitting horizontally .
I personally rebind the keys so “ | ” splits the current window vertically , and “ - ” splits it horizontally .
Not the easiest things to type , though easy to remember .
You can achieve this by putting the following in ~/.tmux.conf or by typing it in the interactive prompt ( Ctrl - b : ) .
Keep in mind if you do the latter it will only be in effect for that session :
unbind %
bind | split - window -h
bind – split - window -v
Advanced Window Handling
Now that we went over the basics lets dive a little deeper into some “ advanced ” features of tmux .
This includes moving windows around , linking windows together , switching windows from different sessions and much more .
By default tmux does n’t have key bindings for these features , so we ’ll be entering them in the interactive dialog ( accessed by typing Ctrl - b :) – keep in mind tmux is very scriptable and you can easily create your own key bindings for all of these .
Moving Windows
Now if you want to move a window you can use the move - window command .
The command to do this :
move - window [ −d ] [ −s src- window ] [ −t dst- window ] swap - window [ - d ] [ -s src-window ] [ -t dst- window ]
Similar to the above command except both windows have to exist – if they both do the window with the ID source and destination windows will be swapped .
Advanced Pane Handling
When you split up a window into multiple smaller windows they ’re referred to as panes .
Tmux also offers “ layouts ” for the panes , or the default positioning and behavior when you create a new window .
You can switch through the panes by using the key binding Ctrl - b < space > which will toggle through the different layouts .
Each one has different behaviors such as main - vertical which means the current active pane will take up more space in the current window , or even-vertical which will split the panes equally .
Since this is difficult to describe in text I believe a few screen shots are in order :
Now that you ’ve seen the different layouts let ’s see what we can do with these panes .
As mentioned above in the “ Pane Handling ” section you can switch through panes by issuing the Ctrl - b o key combination ( which is using the down - pane command ) or by typing Ctrl - b q which will list the pane ID ’s and you select the one you want .
Make your pane into its own window
If you want to take a pane and make it into its own window you do the following :
Ctrl-b : “ break - pane ”
Simple enough , you should now have the pane in its brand new window .
If you do n’t want it to automatically make the pane you just broke out as the active window issue the “ - d ” switch which will simply break the pane to a new window but keep you in the current window .
Resizing Panes
You can also resize panes if you do n’t like the layout defaults .
I personally rarely need to do this , though it ’s handy to know how .
Here is the basic syntax to resize panes :
Ctrl - b : resize - pane ( By default it resizes the current pane down )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane - U ( Resizes the current pane upward )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane - L ( Resizes the current pane left )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane - R ( Resizes the current pane right )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane 20 ( Resizes the current pane down by 20 cells )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane - U 20 ( Resizes the current pane upward by 20 cells )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane - L 20 ( Resizes the current pane left by 20 cells )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane -R 20 ( Resizes the current pane right by 20 cells )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane -t 2 20 ( Resizes the pane with the id of 2 down by 20 cells )
Ctrl - b : resize - pane -t - L 20 ( Resizes the pane with the id of 2 left by 20 cells )
… etc
Hopefully you get the jist – do n’t get confused !
Simply load up a tmux session and split the window a couple of times and issue the above commands .
It should become fairly evident how it behaves after fiddling with it for a bit .
Utilizing the client / server model
I ’ve avoided mentioning that a lot of these commands can actually be applied to numerous tmux sessions which allows quite a bit of flexibility – the reason for avoiding it is it ’s too much information all at once !
An example of using this functionality is if you have two sessions open you can “ link ” or “ move ” windows across different sessions – unfortunately the actual “ how - to ” will be in Part 2 .
Conclusion
Tmux may be a bit confusing however it ’s worth putting in a few minutes to check it out and see what it has to offer – quick easy and intuitive .
Upcoming in Part 2
I ’ll be going over several tips and tricks for tmux including :

TESTIMONIAL
What a tone monster !
You know , instead of trying to imitate Hank 's sound for " On The Beach " , " I'm the Lonely One " etc. , I found myself quickly working out and playing " Go To Pieces " that wonderful Peter & Gordon recording of the beautiful Del Shannon composition .
This guitar inspires a more orchestral or ballad approach  a totally unexpected reaction from me .
It should also help open up new vistas as I get back into composing songs after a huge gap .
For sheer breadth of tone , I 'm so glad I persisted in getting the baritone version of the AD6 .
I congratulate Barry Gibson on a wonderful musical instrument .
I love it !

" An awesome volume and depth , but clarity of sound too .
It does all that your promotion said it would do .
Well done for keeping a piece of British musical prowess and legitimate pride going . "
Peter Connor
" I believe this is a better guitar than any other twelve string I 've ever played .
It just Sings !
The tones available are beautiful !
That brilliant " Rezo - Tube " bridge makes all Burns guitars just ring and ring !
Jim Burns got these guitars so right , and Barry Gibson has excelled in the building of these new instruments !
Everything just works ! "
Lee
" The Apache Double Six is terrific .
I think this is one of the best guitars I have ever played .
It has an amazing low fast action , which makes it as easy to play as a six string , and what a fantastic tone at performance volume .
With the tremolo putting in the expression , it growls on the low notes , and sings on the high's .
This Guitar has a sound all of its own that really stands out . "

A Sydney man who was attacked by four intruders armed with a machete and an axe has died , police say .
The 25 - year - old died in Liverpool Hospital on Friday night after suffering major blood loss from wounds to much of his body including his wrists , legs and ankles .
He had been in a critical condition since the assault on Thursday , when the men barged into his Lurnea home , in Sydney 's southwest , just before midnight .
The man was injured while trying to help his mother , 47 , who sustained a wound to the hand when one of the attackers lashed out at her .
He was then slashed with the machete , police say .
Re-reading texts from years past would surely increase the numbers ; better still , what about finishing those tomes that have been abandoned half - read ?

Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg
The Letters
Edited by Bill Morgan and David Stanford
Viking : 528 pp. , $ 35

“ Howl ” ( 1956 ) and “ On the Road ” ( 1957 ) , two works that helped define a time , sprang from two wildly fired , independent imaginations .
Few would have put Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac together when they met at Columbia University in 1944 .
But they became profound friends , inspired in part by the muse of the elusive , multi-vocal Neal Cassady and joined by the brilliantly perverse , professorial elder William Burroughs .
Beaten and beatitude — beat , the Beats .
There has been as much interest in the style , lives and scenes as there has been in the thinking and the writing .
Ginsberg lived his life increasingly with dramatic flair , if not self - promotion .
Kerouac appeared to drift soon after the 1950s into drink and solitude .
The depth of their development as friends but especially as writers has never been shown more clearly than in this stunning new collection , “ Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg : The Letters . ”
Consisting of about 200 letters , the book is large and comes with few notes .
The letters are sometimes long but almost infallibly interesting .
Ginsberg biographer Bill Morgan and David Stanford , a longtime editor at Viking , provide readers with a volume as illuminating as it is indispensable for understanding these writers and their work .
Ginsberg and Kerouac divulge here what really seems to matter most — their souls and their writing .
There is literary gossip about their compatriots , including , of course , Cassady , Burroughs , Gregory Corso , Herbert Huncke and others .
The letters , though , are more often about what each thinks about something vital .
It ’s fascinating , for example , to hear Kerouac talk about what Cassady had to say after attending a lecture given by Thomas Mann .
And if there is a widely held view that Kerouac became a curmudgeon only later in his life , readers might be surprised to find him writing in 1949 : “ I want to read books , I want to write books , I ’ll write books in the woods .
Thoreau was right ; Jesus was right .
It ’s all wrong and I denounce it and it can all go to hell .
I do n’t believe in this society but I believe in man , like Mann .
So roll your own bones , I say . ”
Kerouac was responding , in part , to Ginsberg ’s struggle with being committed to a psychiatric institute .
Kerouac tends to maintain a laconic , sad assurance in his letters .
Ginsberg ’s missives on his shapeshifting self tend to meander and seem a bit more self - consciously literary .
As Ginsberg comes to reject the notion that he ’s crazy , Kerouac encourages him as a great young poet .
We see Ginsberg entranced by Blake ’s visions and by the purity of Bach .
And Ginsberg inspires and confirms Kerouac ’s yearning for a mythic West meeting a dharmic East .
In reading these letters , you feel both writers moving each other toward greater energies of transcendence .

The amount of power generated by new wind turbines in the European Union this year will be about the same as the amount from new gas plants , according to the European Wind Energy Association , an industry group .
Bloomberg News
“ It is too early to say whether , for a third year running , there will be more wind energy capacity installed than any other electricity generating technology , but it is clear that wind energy will be competing for the top spot with new gas power plants , ” Christian Kjaer , the chief executive of the wind association , said on Monday .
Gas installations far outpaced wind installations four years ago in Europe , with nearly 20 gigawatts of new capacity compared with 9 gigawatts of wind , according to figures from the association .
But the gap narrowed sharply the following year and , by 2008 , wind had overtaken gas for the first time .
Last year there were 10 gigawatts of new wind capacity compared with 7 for new gas .
On Monday , the association forecast that the union would install another 10 gigawatts of new wind power capacity this year .
That would take total wind capacity in the European Union to 85 gigawatts from 75 last year .
Roughly one gigawatt of new wind capacity this year will come from offshore sources , compared with about 580 megawatts last year , it predicted .
Germany will install the most new wind capacity , followed by Britain , the association said .
A decline in new capacity in Spain would “ be more than compensated for ” by a doubling of installations in newer member states of the Union like Bulgaria and Romania , the association said .
Gas still is in the lead in the European Union in terms of overall generating capacity .
Gas plants produced 119 gigawatts in 2007 , according to the latest figures available from Eurelectric , an industry group representing European utility companies .
That figure was up from 112 gigawatts in 2006 .
Even so , the gas industry has complained to leaders about European Union policies promoting renewable energy .
In March , Domenico Dispenza , the president of Eurogas , an industry group , warned in a letter to the European Union ’s president , Herman Van Rompuy , that the union was failing to recognize the relative benefits of natural gas .
The 66 - year - old politician has also been accused of placing almost 300 fellow party members as well as his own children in state - owned companies , while the largest Greek daily paper To Vima said in 2008 he created a new state company which was subordinate to his ministry with 80 of its 110 workers coming from his constituency .

A class of insecticide that is applied to seeds and taken up into plant tissue may be responsible for much of the widespread decline in honeybee populations , increasing numbers of researchers and environmentalists are suggesting .
Starting in 2005 , beekeepers in the United States first reported large numbers of bees mysteriously disappearing , and since then the problem has spread to different parts of the world .
No one cause of the collapse has been identified , although front - running theories include parasites , viruses , stress from long - distance transport of hives for pollination , and pesticides .
"
We do feel like pesticides are playing a role in pollinator decline , " said researcher Maryann Frazier of Penn State University .
" We know that the pesticides are there .
We do n't know yet exactly what role they 're playing .
" The recent documentary " Nicotine Bees " makes the case that a new class of pesticides , introduced in 2005 , may be the primary cause of what has come to be known as Colony Collapse Disorder .
The chemicals , known as neonicotinoids , are synthetic form of nicotine that is applied to seeds and taken up by the plant into its tissue as it grows .
Insects that eat any part of the plant are then killed .
Because neonicotinoids were introduced worldwide at around the same time as the first cases of colony collapse , and because they have been directly linked in some cases to massive bee die offs , they have emerged as a primary suspect in the disorder .
The California Department of Pesticide Regulation has launched an investigation into some neonicotinoids , and the Sierra Club has asked the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to ban them all until they can be proven safe .
" What we 're asking the EPA is to go with precautions , " said the group 's Laurel Hopwood .
" Let 's go ahead and suspend them until we get all of the research completed .
" Neonicotinoid use has already been restricted in France , Germany , Italy and Slovenia .
" Some of us think we 've got enough chemicals out there killing bees , " said beekeeper John Talbert .
" Which begs the question : What is it doing to people ?

Image caption Depression can be a symptom of the male menopause
The male menopause does exist - but it is rare , researchers have concluded .
Just days after it was dismissed as a myth , the European team said the male menopause did exist - but that it affects only 2 % of middle - aged men .
Over 3,300 men from across Europe were assessed for the New England of Journal study .
A men's health expert said testosterone therapy could be beneficial , but doctors had to be cautious about its use .
We need to be very cautious about the prescribing of testosterone therapy Dr Ian Banks , President , Men's Health Forum
Scientists led by a team from the University of Manchester looked at the testosterone levels of 3,369 men aged 40 to 79 from eight European centres .
The men were also asked about their sexual , physical and mental health .
Three sexual symptoms - poor morning erection , low levels of sexual desire and erectile dysfunction were linked to low testosterone levels .
Depression , fatigue and an inability to perform sexual activity were also linked .
But some symptoms commonly cited as being indications men are going through a " menopause " including changes in sleeping patterns , poor concentration , feeling worthless , and anxiety were found to have no link to low testosterone levels .
The condition , also called late - onset hypogonadism , was also found to be linked to poor health and obesity .
Hypogonadism is a condition where the testes fail to work properly , affecting hormone levels .
' Excessive diagnosis ' warning
Professor Fred
Wu , from the University of Manchester 's school of biomedicine , who led the study , said unlike classical hypogonadism where similar symptoms were accompanied by an diagnosable condition , that was not the case for late - onset hypogonadism .
" This well - practised diagnostic approach is frequently found wanting when dealing with the age - related decline of testosterone in elderly men who are prone to have a significant background of non-hormone - related complaints . "
He added : " Our findings have for the first time identified the key symptoms of late - onset hypogonadism and suggest that testosterone treatment may only be useful in a relatively small number of cases . "
Professor
Wu said sexual symptoms were relatively common even in men with normal testosterone levels .
" It is therefore important to specify the presence of all three sexual symptoms of the nine testosterone - related symptoms we identified , together with low testosterone , in order to increase the probability of correctly diagnosing late - onset hypogonadism .
" The application of these new criteria should guard against the excessive diagnosis of hypogonadism and curb the unwise use of testosterone therapy in older men . "
Earlier this month , an editorial in Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin said many men who report symptoms have normal hormone levels and warned giving synthetic testosterone as it could increase the risk of prostate cancer .
Dr Ian Banks , president of the Men's Health Forum , said : " We need to be very cautious about the prescribing of testosterone therapy , and doctors need to balance the benefits against the risks .
" This research acknowledges it 's a complex issue , and that caution is needed . "

Some updates on the incident I reported on last week , in which an off - duty Louisiana sheriff ’s deputy working for BP ’s private security detail harassed an environmental activist who was neither on BP ’s property nor breaking any laws .
( Watch the video at the end of this post . )
First , some gratifying news :
The ACLU has put Louisiana law enforcement on notice .
In a letter ( PDF ) released yesterday , Marjorie Esman , executive director of the group ’s Louisiana chapter , reminded the sheriffs of the coastal parishes that “ members of the public have the right under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to film , record , photograph , and document anything they observe in a public place .
No one — neither law enforcement nor a private corporation — has the legal right to interfere with public access to public places or the recording of activities that occur there .
Nor may law enforcement officials cooperate with private companies in denying such access to the public . ”
Esman told me that the ACLU had discussed the matter due in large part to Mother Jones ‘ reporting .
She says it would consider filing a lawsuit if appropriate .
Louisiana police do n’t have any right to tell you you ca n’t walk onto a public beach ( even to , as Esman puts it , “ roll around in sticky gunky tar that I ’ll never be able to get off — if I want to , that ’s my right ” ) .
However , they do have the right to mislead you about who they ’re really working for .
In Louisiana , as in many places , it ’s legal for police officers to wear their uniforms regardless of whether they ’re acting in an official capacity or working for a private corporation .
Which is why Andrew Wheelan , the environmentalist mentioned above , was unaware that the cop who pressured him to stop filming a BP building and later pulled him over so that a BP official could question him was n’t on duty at the time .
The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff ’s Office told me that the deputy who pulled Wheelan over is just one of 40 in the parish who are working for BP on their own time .
And the BP - police collusion goes beyond uniformed deputies moonlighting .
In nearby Lafourche Parish , for example , the sheriff ’s office is filling 57 security positions a week for BP ; the shifts are on the clock , and BP reimburses the sheriff ’s office for them .
There ’s been a lot of to - do about the federal government being officially in charge of all things oil - spill related , and Mother Jones ruffled some feathers by quoting a BP rep who said the company had a lot of sway over local sheriff ’s departments .
But there you have it , plain as day : Down here , many cops do literally work for BP .
Seem like a conflict of interest , or even sort of scary ?
Perhaps .
But , as Esman points out , it ’s perfectly legal .
“ BP does n’t have the right to just decide they ’re going to take over a public street , ” she says .
“ They do not have the authority to tell people they ca n’t document what they see .
But they do have the right to hire these deputies .
There ’s nothing we can do about that . ”
The other Badger is on his way to Broadway , too .
Multiple sources have told The Post that Wisconsin senior defenseman Ryan McDonagh will enter into contract negotiations with the Rangers this week , thus paving the way for him to join the club — and college teammate Derek Stepan — when training camp commences in September .
McDonagh , selected seventh overall by the Canadiens in 2007 before his rights were dealt to the Blueshirts last summer in the Scott Gomez trade , will sign a three - year Entry Level contract for a base ( and base cap hit ) of $ 875,000 as per the CBA .
Negotiations over a bonus package are expected to conclude swiftly .
The 21 - year - old Minnesotan , who played with Stepan as well as Rangers draft picks Chris Kreider and Ryan Bourque on this year ’s gold - medal - winning USA World Junior team , is regarded by Blueshirts management and the coaching staff as an NHL - ready throwback , stay - at - home defender .
The Post has been told that McDonagh , who had been undecided between turning pro and returning to Madison for his senior season , was won over by the environment at last week ’s Rangers ’ prospect camp during which he mixed with fellow hopefuls and the team ’s front - office personnel , notably general manager Glen Sather , coach John Tortorella and special assistants Mark Messier and Adam Graves .
Presuming the Blueshirts retain restricted free agents Marc Staal and Dan Girardi , the 6 - 1 , 212 - pound , left - hand shooting McDonagh would join a defense corps featuring the 23 - year - old Staal , 26 - year - old Girardi , 20 - year - old Michael Del Zotto , 33 - year - old Michal Rozsival , 26 - year - old Matt Gilroy and 33 - year - old Wade Redden .
Sather is in the market for a veteran free - agent defenseman who would serve as the team ’s sixth or seventh , depending upon training camp evaluations and roster moves .
With gold prices at record highs amid fears that the EU ’s rescue package will drive inflation higher , the ATM monitors the daily price of gold and offers small gold bars that weigh up to 10 grams with customized designs .
This could be just what those who stay in one of the world ’s most expensive hotels will need as they watch the euro , yen and dollar jump around in volatile trade .
The hotel boasts 302 Grand Rooms , 40 splendid Khaleej & Khaleej Deluxe suites , four Royal Khaleej suites and sixteen three - bedroom Palace Suites divisible into a total of 48 one - bedroom individual suites .
Thomas Giessler , the German entrepreneur behind the idea , chose Abu Dhabi because of its high - rolling atmosphere .
Geissler said he hopes his Gold to Go machine will tie in nicely with the region 's traditional ties in gold commerce .
Giessler ’s timing is very good given gold is currently at a record high .
Given the price action at the moment your 10 grams could be worth considerably more by the time you check out and could help you pick up the tab at the luxury resort .
One night in a three - bedroom suite that could set you back more than $ 10,000 a night .

A dystopian vision of a nation with technology stuck in an Orwellian time warp ?
Not at all .
These are aspects of contemporary , low - tech Japan that most visitors miss as they look around the hi-tech nation that its government , electronics industry and tourism board are keen to promote .
Tech - savvy internationalised companies such as Panasonic characterise that familiar but smaller segment of Japan Inc .
The second much larger , and often subsidised economy , comprises overstaffed family - run firms that are decidedly low - tech and high - priced .
Digital divide
When the business and tech - focused Fast Company magazine released its list of most innovative companies in 2010 only one Japanese company made the selection , and that was a retailer .
So what could account for Japan 's lack of international clout tech - wise ?
Some blame its focus on the domestic market , a low - quality , inefficient workforce and poor working conditions .
There is also the digital divide .
Despite the country 's showy internet speeds and some of the cheapest broadband around many Japanese are happier doing things the old way .
Figures for internet users in Japan remain around 70 % compared to neighbouring South Korea 's 82 % .
And even among those online there is a divide between those who are dependent on the internet and those who could live without it .
One government poll shows that although 44 % of Japanese use the internet at least once or twice a month , the rest responded that they use it " hardly at all " or " not at all " .
Considering Japan 's top heavy society of over 50s , many of whom have not got to grips with the internet , and who make up 30 % of the population and that figure begins to make sense .
New paradigm
Image caption
Not everyone wants to spend their whole time online
Many of Japan 's older men - who are those most likely to run a business - have a marked preference to stay offline even in the office , says Tokyo - based entrepreneur Terrie Lloyd .
" There is a clear cut - off for Japanese bosses who know how to use PCs and mobile web - capable devices and those who do n't , " he said .
" The easiest way to tell is whether they have an e-mail address on the all - important name card .
If they 're over 50 and do n't have an e-mail address , it 's a dead giveaway that you either use the phone or forget about contacting them . "
Some say this technophobic demographic helps explain why many of Japan 's industries do not benefit from IT .
" The world shifted into an entirely new paradigm , not only of wealth creation ( which moved away from manufacturing hard goods to software and intellectual property ) , but also of culture , " says Alex Kerr , author of an in - depth analysis of Japan 's contemporary ills , Dogs and Demons .
" Oblivious to all this , Japan 's government ministries , colleges , and big industry went on doing everything the old time - tested Japanese way . "
Digital publishing
This backward approach surprises many people .
Talking in Tokyo at a symposium organised by Wired magazine 15 years ago , Nicholas Negroponte director of the Media Lab at MIT warned Japan against becoming one of the " digital homeless . "
The country 's refusal to shift to digital economies in some areas means this prophecy , to an extent , has come alarmingly true .
Japan 's publishing industry is just one example .
For years it has resisted change and only recently moved to accommodate a perceived shift to digitisation and the rise of the e-book .
" It goes without saying that eventually Japan will have to find a way to make peace with digital publishing , " says tech analyst Steven Nagata .
" But the majors of the publishing industry have made it clear that it will not happen until they have no other choice , "
Elsewhere in Japan the forces of reaction are only now starting to go along with the pivotal changes offered by hi-tech and globalisation .
Efforts have been slow .
Japan 's mighty mobile phone companies sneered at the iPhone , then denied it would impact on Japan , and only now after its success there are they considering their options .
According to Seed Planning of Tokyo 1.7 m iPhones were sold in Japan in 2009 , giving it a market share of 15 % .
In 2008 its share stood at 10 % .
Finger pointing
Some critics have accused the country 's mandarins of restricting innovation .
" The good days walked out the door and no - one noticed , because we were never told of the danger ; rather , missed a golden opportunity to carry the innovation fire and spread it forever , " says blogger Hideki Onda .
" Political issues and bureaucracy caused our profit from the 70's to 90's to be spent on a regional and sociopolitical food chain , " he said .
" And now , for example , Japan cannot make a sensible decision on the likes of spectrum use freed up by TV going digital .
It 's a big mess . "
Although some ministries were visionary , in implementing projects to deliver the world 's first cheap , mass market fibre - optic broadband service for example , many others are seen as antediluvian in their attitudes .
Peep into the offices in Tokyo's administration district and you find out why .
Here PCs are rare and work carries on in the slow lane .
" Japanese banks , post offices , government offices , all are staffed with three to five times the employees because they must do every process once on paper and then again on computer , " says Taro Hitachi a technical editor and patent reader at Hitachi .
" Do you see the pattern here ?
Japanese are n't all that happy about spiteful machines and distrust automation . "

Is Japan burying its head in the sand when it comes to new tech ?
This technological divide goes hand in hand with Japan 's much touted " Galapagos " status .
Like the plants and creatures on those islands Japan 's tech standards and business practices have developed a unique character incompatible with anything beyond its borders .
Mr Onda thinks this Galapagos approach was an error perpetuated by the civil servants .
" Anything as foreign and revolutionary as Apple 's WYSIWYG GUI operating system will never be accepted , even if it was the best .
You see Apple had not paid respects to the Japanese bureaucrats , " he said .
To illustrate this , Mr Onda relates a story from 1996 when Apple was keen to puts its computers into Japanese schools .
The answer from the Japanese education minister at the time was a curt " No thank - you " .
A puzzled Michael Spindler ( then Apple 's CEO ) asked his Japanese colleague when they might return to try again .
In response , his colleague said : " When the 60 's - era floor indicator above the ministry 's elevator door goes digital . "
After Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 , Israel  with Egypt ’s help  imposed a blockade on many goods and most people going into and out of the territory .
The goal was to quickly turn residents against their new government .
Three years later , Hamas is still in charge  and the blockade has become an excuse for any and all of the government ’s failures .
The situation in Gaza is grim .
Eight out of 10 people depend on international aid agencies to survive .
Basic foodstuffs are available , but medical supplies and construction materials are severely lacking .
The desperation could be seen on Tuesday when Egypt lifted the blockade and several thousand Gazans rushed the border but were later sent home after police officers said they did not know when the crossing would be opened .
On Tuesday , President Obama expressed his “ deep regret ” over the flotilla incident .
He is doing Israel no favors with such a tepid response .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown time and again that he prefers bullying and confrontation over diplomacy .
Washington needs to make clear to him just how dangerous and counterproductive that approach is .
Mr. Obama needs to state clearly that the Israeli attack was unacceptable and back an impartial international investigation .
The United States should also join the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  Britain , France , Russia and China  in urging Israel to permanently lift the blockade .
That would lessen the suffering of the people in Gaza .
And it would give the United States more credibility as it presses both Israelis and the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , to negotiate a peace deal .
If the firing of Shirley Sherrod was the first time they had done this , then all of the criticism they have received might be a bit much .
But as we have learned from this incident ( which the rest of us already knew , with the apparent exception of Fox News and Andrew Breitbart ) , context matters .
We 've seen the rest of the tape on the Obama administration and it is n't pretty .
Van Jones , ACORN , Dawn Johnsen , Shirley Sherrod .
First sign of trouble , throw someone overboard .
When they fired Van Jones , I said they were only encouraging Fox .
But that was n't some genius prediction ; it was only the most obvious thing in the world .
Do you think the bully wo n't take your lunch money tomorrow if you give it to him today ?
Since this seems so obvious , why can't the supposedly brilliant guys in the Obama administration figure it out ?
Why can't they see it 's such a bad idea to keep giving in to Fox and bowing their heads ?
It 's so bad now , they 're bragging about their efficiency in genuflecting .
Jim Messina , Deputy Chief of Staff , congratulated everyone the day after Sherrod was fired about the speed and agility with which they serviced Fox News .
So , what 's the strategy behind what appears to be pathetic cowardice to the rest of us ?
The idea is that Fox News is more important than any progressive leader or commentator ( or even the majority opinion of progressives throughout the country , as evidenced by polls ) because liberals have nowhere to go .
So , that 's why you can abuse them , ignore them and even treat them with disdain -- and they 'll still vote for you .
What are they going to do -- vote for Republicans ?
That 's why Rahm Emanuel can call them " fucking retarded " and derisively dismiss them on almost every issue .
They think there 's no price to pay .
Whereas , if they cross Fox , all of Washington will be talking about it .
And they 're obsessed with the Washington chatter .
And they are under the grossly mistaken impression that the country gives a shit about what Fox says .
In Washington , Fox News is very important and you get judged by how quickly you handle the media maelstroms they create .
That 's viewed as a barometer of how well you handle " bad news cycles . "
So , the rest of the Washington press corps judges you by how quickly you drop to your knees to end the " bad news cycle . "
Congratulations Obama administration , you 're now professionals !
But even more importantly , there is this insane belief that Fox News can swing centrists , which are the critical voters who decide elections .
There is not a shred of evidence to that .
In fact , the evidence shows that there is no audience in the country that is more deeply conservative and politically immovable .
Plus , the average age of Bill O'Reilly 's audience is 71 years old .
The guy is doing a show out of a senior citizen 's center and Obama thinks he rules the world .
The only real damage that Fox can do is if they spread their poison to other news stations .
That is why it 's so imperative to label them what they are -- a conservative propaganda station ( not that there 's anything wrong with that ) .
They 're just not news .
And they could n't have proved it any better than they did in this case .
And what did the Obama administration do with this golden opportunity ?
They turned it into a massive loss .
Who is fucking retarded now ?
But the more important miscalculation is that liberals have nowhere to go .
They do have somewhere to go -- home .
They can sit on their couch on election day , which according to the polling is exactly what they 're going to do .
When a Bloomberg poll ( pdf , Page 7 ) asked all voters which party they favored , it was a tie .
When they asked likely voters , Republicans were up by eight points .
Who 's fucking retarded now ?
It 's high time that we stop giving the Obama administration credit for being some sort of genius tacticians .
Maybe it was all David Plouffe .
But one thing is for sure , they seem to have no idea what they 're doing politically and Fox News is handing them their ass on a daily basis .
Glenn Beck came on after the Sherrod story became fully known and said that Obama should n't have fired her .
Do n't you get it , you feckless clowns , they 're going to criticize you no matter what you do ?
You can not appease them .
You must isolate and delegitimize them .
I understand the Obama team is playing the old Washington games and think they 're very clever at it .
But those games do n't work anymore .
Bad news cycles are not created by genuine mistakes anymore , they 're artificially created by Fox News channel .
You can't make them go away by giving into them .
You 're just feeding the beast .
And more importantly , you 're starving your own side .
It is n't about fighting Fox News to make yourself feel better .
It 's about ignoring their silly attacks so you can actually bring us the progressive change you promised .
Otherwise , we would be retarded to come and vote for you again .

Sta te of th e Ma rket : Credit vs. Commodities & Jobs

The frail state of the markets is now becoming more obvious and as such the audience for our call to cash is growing .
The difficulty in getting our message out is that in its raw form ( how we normally write ) , the argument is quite technical :
o
Client
: Why go to cash ?
o
Quant / Technical
: Look at the euro - dollar basis swap pricing !
o
Client
: Say what ??

Now , however , the market is showing signs that everyone can easily recognize as indicative of economic weakness :
o
job growth has stagnated , and
o

These new signs are not new information on why things are bad .
Rather , they are symptoms , or outward displays of how weak the credit market has become .
o
Weakening credit conditions are the cause .
o
Economic fallout is the effect .
Our Job : How Do We O perate ?
What Do We Know ?
What Do n’t We Know ?

You will notice that the vast majority of our work includes charts .
Charts are factual observations that convey the current and historical state of the market .

In these charts , we detail the evidence of how the markets behave , or , more importantly , how they are priced .
This is what we care about ; how the market prices , and how this may change day by day , hour by hour , and tick by tick .

We observe markets as a scientist observes an experiment .
In this case , it is a social experiment , entitled “ capital markets . ”

What we find intriguing is seeing relationships change .
When markets start to price things differently , our hunt is on for why pricing is changing , what it means , and where it might take markets .
o
What we find now in the market pricing is disturbing , which is why you are reading this .

The nature of our work stems from observation of the markets , as opposed to the collection of economic data .
Western European Sovereign Debt Crisis = Asian Growth Problem

We observed that the sovereign default risk of Europe was very well connected to the sovereign default risk of Asia .
o

By observation , we know there is a link and now we have part of the economic rationale for what we are seeing .

We have what we need for our call for extreme caution :
o
The funding of Asian growth is closely tied to the health of the European financial system .
o
.
o
went off
.

The close ties between European and Asian credit are showing up in the tick charts only in times of stress , which is why we started picking up the relationship quite recently .

THERE are clear harms entailed in the practice of putting lots of unenforceable or unenforced laws on the books and consigning a significant swathe of your population to the category of lawbreakers .
On the one hand , this promotes contempt for the law .
On the other hand , it allows police and government to lock up many people at will , since most people are always violating some law or another , and that 's a discretionary power that governments tend to abuse for repressive political purposes .
The government also derives extortionary power from its ability to lock people up at will , which leads to corruption .
In autocratic countries across a wide spectrum of development , from Guinea to Russia , you tend to find all of these things occurring together : a broad range of normal economic and political behaviour is criminalised , the citizens treat the law as an arbitrary set of irritating technicalities to be evaded , government uses police powers to repress political opposition , and police and government officials make their living by shaking people down .
Parts of this syndrome ( criminalising normal behaviour , contempt for the law , shaking people down ) also describe the way drug laws function in much of America .
So the question arises of whether we should legalise pot .
Two days ago Sarah Palin said we should n't , but that marijuana use is n't much of a problem , and should be a low priority for law enforcement .
Ryan McNeely responded that this courts the problems of criminalisation and non-enforcement .
[ W ] hat I think what we 're seeing here is the wrong - headed notion that an appropriate way to express disapproval of a behavior is to simply make it illegal but then wink and nod on enforcement , as if this is some sort of middle ground ( this is also the Obama administration position on federal marijuana law ) ...
If you do n't think a law should be enforced , you should support repeal of the law .
All this “ compromise ” accomplishes is granting police almost unfettered discretion .
If smoking pot is still technically illegal , police can enforce the law when they choose , targeting certain people for arrest while turning a blind eye to others engaging in the exact same activity .
I used to feel this way too .
America should , I thought , follow the lead of progressive foreign governments and decriminalise drug use .
But I 've now lived in some of those foreign countries that are famously tolerant of drug use , and it turns out that " tolerant " is the operative word .
In the Netherlands , marijuana possession for personal use remains illegal .
It 's just never prosecuted .
And indeed this seems to be the case for all the European countries with relatively permissive marijuana policies .
The Dutch policy differs in that there are specific guidelines stating that possession for personal use is not to be prosecuted , and courts have taken these guidelines as reason to reject the few attempts prosecutors have made to bring cases .
And it differs in terms of administrative policy in that the Netherlands has established an actual category of business , the coffee shops , where marijuana use is tolerated by policy , in order to concentrate the practice and limit the perceived harms to the non-pot - friendly portion of the public .
Conservative Dutch have registered increasing hostility to the coffee shops in recent years , leading to policies intended to shrink the shops ' footprints and to restrict them to selling pot to locals , rather than wholesale - level sales or sales to foreign tourists .
And while there are periodic calls in the Netherlands to move to complete legalisation of soft drugs , that initiative never seems to get anywhere .
But neither do calls for actual prosecution of marijuana possession and use .
So apparently , the Netherlands , Denmark , and so forth are among the countries that court public contempt for the law and repressive police practices by keeping marijuana use illegal but unpunished in practice .
And yet these countries have failed to turn into Russia .
I think what we 're seeing here is the importance of national political culture and the impact of all the other institutions countries have that shape their practices of governance .
It would be nice if we could arrive at an ethically and logically consistent legal stance on drug use , but it may be that in practice that 's very hard to do , and not actually very important .
Basically , while Sarah Palin 's position on this issue , as on many others , is semi- deliberately incoherent , it is in this case a semi- deliberate incoherence that has proven to be effective policy in many countries , and I 'm not even sure it 's the wrong stance on the issue .

Image caption Gen Ganzer used anti-drug operations to set up his own smuggling ring
An Italian military police general , Giampaolo Ganzer , has been jailed for 14 years for drug smuggling and organising fake anti-drug operations .
Gen Ganzer was found guilty of using his work to import and sell drugs between 1991 and 1997 , the newspaper Corriere della Serra reported .
Under the leadership of the General , officers had formed their own drug trafficking ring , the prosecutors said .
Gen Ganzer was among 14 people convicted in the case .
Italian media quoted prosecutors as saying that the General , who headed the Carabinieri 's investigative division in Milan , had set up the smuggling ring to enrich himself and obtain " visibility and success " .
Gen Ganzer was also ordered to pay a fine of 65,000 euro ( $ 82,000 ; £ 55,000 ) .
The Population Reference Bureau predicts that France 's population , in contrast , will increase at half the rate , adding 7 million to its 63 million .
While Germany will actually see its population fall sharply from 81.6 million to 71.5 million because of a lack of immigration , and a far lower birth rate than that in Britain .
It already has the second oldest population in the world after Japan , with one in five of all Germans over the age of 65 .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have found two antibodies that can stop more than 90 % of the known virus strains that cause AIDS , the National Institutes of Health said Thursday .
" The discovery of these exceptionally broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV and the structural analysis that explains how they work are exciting advances that will accelerate our efforts to find a preventive HIV vaccine for global use , " said NIAID director Anthony Fauci in a statement .
The naturally occurring antibodies , called VRC01 and VRC02 , neutralize more HIV strains than any other known antibodies , the NIH said .
It 's coming up to the end of the group stage at the FIFA World Cup , so we 've done the hard part and broken down what each team has to do to advance to the knockout stage .

It was my first bridal gown consultation and I was very nervous , thinking it would be a very stressful process and I would n’t be able to find anything that suited me .
It turned out to be a delight .
Lauren and the seamstress were extremely helpful and pleasant .
Lauren in particular is an expert in bridal gowns and she gave me a lot of great advice , and she answered any questions I had thoroughly .
They made it a super fun and exciting experience not only for me but also for my friends who accompanied me .
I would strongly recommend Always & Forever Bridal .

The boutique had an impeccable variety of dresses on offer and completely exceeded my expectations .
Thank you to Marisa and the other ladies for delivering such a beautiful experience and for helping me to find my dream gown !!
Jessica Fearn
My consultant was very helpful and patient .
She was kind and gave good advice .
The wedding dresses were beautiful with a good variety .
Would definitely recommend the Always and Forever to others !
Jia Lin Lee
After going to another bridal boutique I felt deflated and feeling like I ’ll never find a dress because I was n’t a size 8 .
The person at this boutique was trying to pressure me into buying a dress that did not flatter me in any way and told me that the dresses I liked would n’t look good on someone my size , I had a baby 3 months ago and still getting used to my new body so my confidence was shattered .
This was until I met Cecelia .
She made me feel more confident .
She picked me up off the ground ( figuratively ) and made me feel like I could be a beautiful bride .
I went in with minimal direction from me and even with that she found me THE dress and most importantly made me feel beautiful .
I can not thank her enough for her help and making me feel like a human and not a sale .
Jamie Horn
Thank you for a great experience .
I did n’t feel rushed .
My consultant made me feel very comfortable .
I had put on weight and trying on wedding dresses has not been enjoyable experience but my consultant was very helpful and understanding and I had fun trying on the dresses with her .
Mary Ann Dobran
Thank you Always and Forever Bridal in helping me to find my perfect gown !!!
Firstly , all of the staff at your store are absolutely amazing and go out of there way to make you feel welcome .
My consultant was CC and she truly went above and beyond to help make shopping for my wedding dress a special experience .
CC was supportive , kind and had a great sense of humor which made the whole dress shopping experience relaxing and fun .
CC listened to what I had to say and helped to translate my wedding vision into a dress ( even taking the time to construct a mock bouquet in my wedding colours ! ) .
I am a larger girl and CC took so much care to help me look beautiful in every gown I tried on , putting in the effort to ensure the fit of each dress was “ just right ” ( having been to three other store before Always and Forever , I know that not all consultants or stores do this ) .
CC took the time to make me ( and my family ) feel special and I cant express how my grateful I am for the help she has given me .
Secondly , I was very impressed by the variety of gowns the store stocks .
I loved that all the dresses were layed out by silhouette , it helped to make it easy to find the style you were looking for .
All in all , I would rate and recommend Always and Forever Bridal – amazing from start to finish !

Summary Author : James Van Gundy
Pumice is a glassy volcanic rock that 's so full of bubbles that most examples will float on water .
Reticulite is an extreme form of pumice in which the bubbles have coalesced , leaving only a tenuous reticular network of glassy lava behind in the interstitial spaces between the bubbles .
While pumice is more characteristic of the ejecta from the silica - rich magmas of stratovolcanoes such as Mount St. Helens , it may also be formed from the more silica - poor basaltic magmas of shield volcanoes such as those of Iceland and the Hawaiian Islands .
Reticulite is formed only by very high fountains of basaltic lava that contain dissolved gasses such as water vapor and carbon dioxide .
To form much reticulite , a lava fountain must be at least 1000 feet ( 300 m ) high .
Molten lava is shot into the air at such high velocity that gasses dissolved within it suddenly exsolve as the surrounding atmospheric pressure abruptly drops .
The specimen of reticulite shown here was photographed near the Pu'u Loa petroglyphs in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on April 3 , 2007 .
It was probably formed by lava fountaining at Kilauea Volcano 's Pu'u O'o vent sometime during the early to mid-1980s .
Reticulite is so light that it 's frequently transported many miles downwind of an eruption site .
The Pu'u O'o vent lies roughly 7 miles ( 11 km ) to the north of the Pu'u Loa site .
Embedded in the far right - hand side of this specimen are several strands of " Pele 's Hair " , a fibrous form of basaltic glass that 's also formed in lava fountains .
Pele is the Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes .

What do you do when you hand over all your money before a promised Doomsday , but Doomsday never comes ?
You go find the next best thing : a lawyer .
That is the situation in Australia where a court has frozen the assets of Pastor Rocco Leo and his associates at Agape Ministries after followers demanded their money back .
While there appears to have been no written contract , this appears a novel inverse of a force majeure claim : the act of God never came .
Former church member , Martin Penney , and another plaintiff are suing to get back more than $ 400,000 and $ 1 million they gave respectively to the church based on promises of a Doomsday .
It appears that Judgment Day will be relocated to a more mundane forum at the Adelaide District Court .
Of course , the pastor still has time to make good on the Doomsday promise .

A flawed but still enjoyable game .
Ship combat is as good as ever , and improves aiming from the previous games .
The voice dialog is really A flawed but still enjoyable game .
Ship combat is as good as ever , and improves aiming from the previous games .
The voice dialog is really strong , arguably better than Star Control 2 .
The storylines for the individual aliens are pretty interesting .
There 's some characters who you 'll wish got more screen time , but at least the characters are there .
The Arilou , the Spathi , the Pkunk ...
You always wish there was another sequel to Star Control 2 , one that was made by the actual creators of the series , but you can tell that the authors of this third game were genuine fans of the original content .
They consulted with the original creators , properly licensed the content with their permission , and were done by some veterans of Infocom and Legend Entertainment .
( Two great studios of yesteryear . )
Some obvious criticisms .
It 's just really hard to compete with Star Control 2 in terms of story .
The gameplay has n't aged that well .
But then , neither has SC2's , and you have to remember that 2D top - down ship combat was on its last legs in the early 90s .
The colony management system is a little opaque , but it 's at least far less tedious compared to planet landing , and you can mostly ignore it and focus on the story .
The story is really enjoyable , with truly distinct characters .
The humor is maybe a little off , and the ending has some eye - rolling corniness .
It can't help but feel like fan - fiction .
But the most complete fan fiction we have , until a real sequel comes out .

It is startling enough to have black - masked commandos hijack your boat on the high seas , but when the orders and the threat that any who resist will be shot are barked in Australian accents on the far side of the world , it becomes surreal .
In the early hours of Monday , a Herald news team was aboard the Challenger I , the smallest but fastest of six ships in the Free Gaza Flotilla , which came into lethal conflict with the Israeli Navy while sailing in international waters about 110 kilometres north - west of the Gaza Strip and well off the Israeli coast .
As the killing started on the big Turkish ferry , the Mavi Marmara , and it seemed just a matter of time before the other slow boats in the flotilla would be commandeered by the Israelis , the Challenger I 's English skipper , Dennis Healey , pushed the 25 - metre cruiser to top speed , about 18 knots .
Initially , four Israeli Zodiac - like assault boats were tailing us , but they were unable to get close because of the powerful wake Healey was ploughing across the water .
But then the Israelis gave Healey pause for thought .
With previous boat runs to Gaza under his belt , he knew what it was like to have his vessel rammed by an Israeli boat , so he cut the motors , allowing the craft to slow to a drift .
Other veterans of earlier runs - the Palestinian lawyer and head of the Free Gaza Movement , Huwaida Arraf , and the deceptively demur Scottish postal worker Teresa McDermott - yelled to all on the fly bridge to brace for a collision as the powerful spotlight on the bigger Israeli boat bored into all on deck while the vessel positioned its bow to Challenger I 's starboard side .
These skewed assessments , in turn , helped the financial system take on far more risk than it could safely handle .
Paul McCulley of Pimco , the bond investor ( who coined the term “ shadow banks ” for the unregulated institutions at the heart of the crisis ) , recently described it this way : “ explosive growth of shadow banking was about the invisible hand having a party , a non-regulated drinking party , with rating agencies handing out fake IDs . ”
So what can be done to keep it from happening again ?
The bill now before the Senate tries to do something about the rating agencies , but all in all it ’s pretty weak on the subject .
The only provision that might have teeth is one that would make it easier to sue rating agencies if they engaged in “ knowing or reckless failure ” to do the right thing .
But that surely is n’t enough , given the money at stake  and the fact that Wall Street can afford to hire very , very good lawyers .
What we really need is a fundamental change in the raters ’ incentives .
We ca n’t go back to the days when rating agencies made their money by selling big books of statistics ; information flows too freely in the Internet age , so nobody would buy the books .
Yet something must be done to end the fundamentally corrupt nature of the the issuer - pays system .
An example of what might work is a proposal by Matthew Richardson and Lawrence White of New York University .
They suggest a system in which firms issuing bonds continue paying rating agencies to assess those bonds  but in which the Securities and Exchange Commission , not the issuing firm , determines which rating agency gets the business .
I ’m not wedded to that particular proposal .
But doing nothing is n’t an option .
It ’s comforting to pretend that the financial crisis was caused by nothing more than honest errors .
But it was n’t ; it was , in large part , the result of a corrupt system .
And the rating agencies were a big part of that corruption .
I knew I would leave India with a new perspective of life – but the upturning of my worldview has happened in a far different way than I expected .
I thought I would arrive home more passionate about social justice , more inspired to make a difference to the lives of “ poor ” people .
Instead I am leaving India with a hardened heart , more humility , and an increased concern for the future of humanity as a whole .
Why ?
Because the population problem , the elephant in the room , is far too big a problem to ignore .
And I simply cannot see a solution to this problem .
Before I went to India , as those of you who have read older blog entries would know , I quite idealistically analysed the global inequalities and blamed war and poverty on western greed .
I looked at these graphs of population growth by economy and region , and blamed the population growth on western development .
Why does the population of poor and developing countries suddenly increase in 1940s , and high income countries only increase a little ?
What is going on in Asia ???
In my mind , the population had increased so much since WW2 simply because of the design of the global capitalist system .
Post - development scholars criticise the global system for being miperialistically geared to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor , with the raw materials bought for nothing and sold for billions and so making the rich richer and the poor poorer .
I went a step further .
It made sense to me that a larger population in developing countries equates to cheap labour , which means cheaper computers , phones , TVs , clothes , cars , chocolate etc .
For a government subject at uni I analysed the power - distribution of the system , observing that it is the rich and powerful capitalists who pull the strings behind governments , the World Trade Organisation , the IMF , and other peak bodies .
The rich and powerful capitalists I equated to anyone whose lives are not run by debt – those who have shares in companies , money in the bank , superannuation funds , own property without mortgages , own their own business etc .
In particular it was the wealthiest of the wealthy – the people who own the banks themselves .
I thought education was the solution .
Not education of the poor people , but education of the rich .
I thought that if each of us understood the connection between our shopping habits and the mass workers , the connection between our consumption and our future environment , and that the roots of these to problems lay in the capitalist dream : to accumulate more money , then we would begin to move toward a more socially just and environmentally sustainable system .
I thought that the motivation to change our systems would come from a “ new dream ” that started with rediscovering the connection with our planet , so that we each come to prioritise the whole ecosystem that we are a part of , over and above our individual selfish desires .
I thought that this would come from an understanding of Big History , coming to identify ourselves as part of the process of our Universe expanding and increasing in complexity ( or what many , including myself , personify as “ God ” ) .
Now , well , now I realize that the answers to the world ’s problems are not that simple .
There are far deeper roots to this systematic problem than western greed .
It seems to me , in this moment in time , that the global system is NOT a simple cause and effect situation with western greed causing global poverty .
For one , inequality is not just a problem in today ’s global system , it has always been a problem .
Secondly , inequality ’s root problem – greed – is not a western problem but is a human problem , a life problem .
Thirdly , poverty has cultural , religious and historical roots that have nothing to do with the global system .
The caste system existed in India before the British arrived .
The caste system is thousands of years old and while Gandhi may have officially abolished it , culture is stronger than law .
In India this caste system keeps poor poor and the rich rich , and this has nothing whatsoever to do with global capitalism .
Capitalists may benefit from the fact that China and India are over - populated , and hence human labour is cheap , but capitalists are not standing over these people telling them to have more babies .
Sure there ’s the tiny motivational factor of more children equals more money , but talking to Indians at different income levels it seemed to be the cultural aspects ( tradition , the values placed on family , lack of entertainment etc ) that are behind the population explosion over and above their desire to make money from them .
If women get married at 10 and have babies the rest of their life , for cultural reasons over and above any monetary motivation , how can poverty ever be addressed ?
It is their own actions which perpetuate their poverty and cause the inequalities of the global system to continue .
Should capitalists stop benefiting from cheap labour ?
That would only mean these people have less job opportunities … that ’s not going to help .
What if they pay them a little extra , that is , change to a “ fair trade ” system ?
This may help a few lives but when people are willing to work for less , because working for less is better than working for nothing , how can such a “ fair ” system be sustained ?
How is it “ fair ” if some people have jobs paying fair wages , while the rest of the billions have no job at all ?
Fair trade or free trade , escaping poverty is a choice that people in the situation will collectively have to make for themselves .
And unfortunately eradicating poverty requires doing something about that frickin big elephant staring everyone in the face .
What ?
I have NO IDEA .
Could this be why so many yogis and religious leaders advise to withdraw from the world and look for peace inside ?
And so my worldview crisis …
As a result of the fear that comes from this lack of solutions , the altruistic side that used to dominate my mind is becoming more self - centered : what future do I want for the future generations that spring from the people I love ?
My previous almost disdain for wealth , thinking all money was intrinsically connected to a corrupt system , is turning into an appreciation of it .
Work hard , work smart , then share and enjoy your earnings with your family and friends … what ’s so bad about that ?
Let ’s face it , animal , plant , or human ; black , white or in between ; this is ultimately life ’s instinctive purpose : to live as long as we can , and create offspring to continue our work when we die .
That ’s why we choose the partners we choose to mate with .
That ’s why we fight the wars we fight .
That ’s why we work so hard to buy a house and establish systems of governance , education and business .
SELF - PRESERVATION and PROCREATION .
India has given me a new appreciation for the work my ancestors – for their efforts to create a world so good for us , their children .
Maybe their methods were n’t so peaceful , with inquisitions , colonialism and imperialism , but let ’s face it : it ’s not only our ancestors who have done this and if it was n’t them , it would have been someone else .
Before the British invaded India , it was the Moghuls , and before that it was other nations from Central Asia .
The British were far from the first , and it is highly unlikely they will be the last .
My experiences in India have left me thinking that if the wealthy of the world did suddenly decide to spread their wealth , to educate the billions in poverty and create a socially - just system ; the peace it would create would probably be short - lived and soon all the densely populated places like India would spread to populate the rest of the world .
My favourite city would become just like my least favourite , and so would every other city in the world .
I realise my perspective is becoming incredibly selfish , but I do not want people sleeping and dying on our streets ; I do not want people trying to rip me off on street corners ; I do not want to be living in a dirty , polluted , noisy , over - populated place .
In short , I do not want to see Sydney turn into Mumbai .
According to http://www.overpopulation.org/
if we continue at our present rates , our population will be over 11 billion by 2035 !!!
And what then , will Australia still be sitting there with it ’s 21 million people ?
I do n’t think so .
With Australia ’s rivers drying up there just ai n’t enough water for everyone .
Nor infrastructure , or systems for food , housing , anything …
And so I worry , might my passionate pursuits to make a more socially just world bring the extinction of my own culture , my country ’s wealth and the life style , and all the opportunities our ancestors dedicated their lives to deliver ?
While our own culture is no where near perfect , with its insatiable desires and materialistic emptiness , western culture has A LOT to offer : freedom ; the scientific quest for knowledge ; the creativity that comes from competition ; the opportunities for individualistic pursuits .
It would be a big shame to lose it in place of an overpopulated communistic uncreative mess .
Think about it , if income was distributed evenly , will the 2 billion women of child - bearing age suddenly decide not to have babies ?
And , if the wealthy were to even out the income , my new lack - of - faith - in - humanity makes it seem realistic to assume that another group of people would rise up and the same cycles of violence would begin just with a new group of rich and powerful .
And , even if this did n’t happen , how long would it take before we would run out of resources ( seeing as ecological economists say 10 planets would be required for all people of the world to live an American lifestyle ) ?
Does this mean , simply in attempt to better the lives of people with less money today , all of humanity will die out ?
I ’m sorry , but I do n’t think this would be good for anyone involved .
Okay , okay , calm down Juliet , calm down .
As you can see there is a lot going through my head .
Out of fear I ’m becoming defensive .
I ’m guess I ’m still culture - shocked , and struggling to comprehend the reality of our global situation .
It ’s one thing to see population in a graph but it ’s a different kettle of fish to see it with your own eyes .
When one ’s mind connects such a mess to projections of possible futures for earth and humanity it ’s really quite a confusing and scary topic .
Damned if you do , damned if you do n’t :
If you consider population control then what about human rights ?
If you do n’t control the population then what do you do about the billions living in poverty ?
If you bring people out of poverty then you destroy the planet for everyone .
Now I understand why overpopulation has been the elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about .
My conclusion : “ Elephant ?
What elephant ???
I do n’t see it either ! ”
…
Follow up thoughts six years later …
February 2016
I received a comment that drew my attention back to this post and I thought I should revisit the “ elephant in the room ” in light of some things that I have learned since 2010 , and some things that have changed in the world during this time .
I deleted a paragraph that a commenter interpreted as bordering on racism .
It ’s difficult : one ’s views can be taken out of context and considered unchanging , so what if someone looks at that and starts thinking I ’m racist ?
That being said I think everyone is “ a little bit racist ” , in some ways , and we go overboard trying to be politically correct – sometimes at the cost of honesty , and being able to speak one ’s mind .
I value difference – I value different cultures and peoples , and I think it is important to avoid imperialism , and other forces , taking away from our beautiful diversity – unless in the opportunity for self - determination people choose to change and evolve in ways they want to change , integrating parts of other cultures .
It is just as dangerous to romanticise a culture and group of people , and want them to stay the same , as it is to attempt to interfere and change them .
A people should be able to choose for themselves how their culture evolves .
Australia has and is committing devastating human rights abuses against people seeking help from and refuge in our country , and I do not in any way condone this .
Hence my deleting a paragraph that may have been interpreted as supporting Australia ’s immigration policies .
I do n’t .
I think the White Australia Policy was shocking , as has been every
In the context of someone in their twenties having a rant it was not racist , but as something that might be attributed to me later in life , not so good .
In my mind at that time , battling with the confronting nature of my own experiences in the chaotic suburbs of Mumbai in contrast to the affluent bubble of Sydney , I saw some of the need for a strict immigration policy .
My current opinion is that it is important to have a smart and humane immigration policy – one that sees the value in each person ’s life , and works creatively to find space for them in the many parts of our country that are crying out for higher populations .
And one that is linked ot foreign aid and international relations policies , helping to remedy past and current wrongs of Western civilisation that are at root of many wars and problems in the countries people have fled .
There are three messages that I want to add on to this blog entry :
With regard to insights into India ’s population – I learned a great deal on this from Vandana Shiva on her visit to Sydney in 2014 .
It had continued to puzzle me why India ’s population increased so dramatically when it did .
Dr Shiva attributes this to colonialism and the removing of peasants from land , which created uncertainty and instability , which led to people having more children .
Furthermore Dr Shiva taught me that the caste system was not in the same negative form that one might interpret it today – Dr Shiva believes this has been reinterpreted by the West in a negative light , where it used to be more about division of roles and labour than hierarchy .
It was a structure for society that worked , made sense .
Possibilities for stabilising global population , lifting everyone out of poverty and living in harmony with our planet do exist , and all three must go together .
We , especially those with the money and positions to do so , need to invest and support investment by our governments into çradle - to - cradle design and renewable energy technologies that offer ways in which humanity can live without destroying the planet .
We also need to build support for various structural changes and restrictions e.g. on how much corporations can pollute , who pays for pollution and wastes , etc .
If we can learn to live in ways that do not destroy the earth , then perhaps a large human population is n’t such a problem .
I ’d like to add a final note about the changing nature of opinions .
My views are constantly changing , and I hope that anything read on this blog can be understood in context that it was written by a person growing up , learning , and wanting to discuss different views and perspectives – all which I see as constantly changing through such a dialogical process .
I see the world in a very different way to what I did six years ago , particularly at this point in time where I ’d found India so confronting .
I leave this blog entry up here as I believe the process of changing our views , of thinking through the hard questions , of having a rant about contending ideas , is a valuable part of conversations necessary for addressing such problems and moving toward more ecological and peaceful futures .
So please do not judge me by the post above , but please use it as food for thought , for better understanding your own positions , which are too also likely to be developing and changing through time as the context for your ideas and expanding sphere of learning and influence also changes .
Thank you !

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
“ Irresponsible ” refers to Congress and the Obama administration - and here ’s why .
For thousands of years , businesses , organizations , governments and even individuals have relied on a basic tool to make sure they do not spend or borrow more than they can service - it is called a budget .
Yet , for the first time since 1974 , when the current rules were put into effect , the U.S. House of Representatives does not intend to pass a budget resolution .
The main purpose of the budget resolution is to set discretionary spending caps for the coming fiscal year .
Without a budget resolution , members of Congress are , in essence , able to spend as much money as they wish , subject only to the limitation of getting half plus one of the other members to go along with the spending proposal .
The budget procedure was put in place to make sure members of Congress would not spend money as irresponsibly as many teenagers might if they were given unlimited credit cards .
If teenagers were in charge of the federal budget , we might end up with a $ 1.5 trillion deficit this year .
Ah , but we are going to have a $ 1.5 trillion deficit this year - and who ’s in charge ?
In the face of the unprecedented congressional spending binge , President Obama has been asking Congress to spend even more .
Not content with actively promoting the eventual bankruptcy of the United States , Mr. Obama is urging foreign leaders also to increase their government spending - which is truly bizarre .
Look at the facts .
All of the major European countries have been increasing government spending and deficits at unsustainable rates .
The talk for the past couple of months has been about which countries would follow Greece in going over the financial cliff .
Responsible economists , financial leaders and , most important , the markets have been telling European leaders they must cut government spending .
Over the past couple of weeks , a number of those leaders have responsibly and courageously come forth with real spending - reduction programs .
Britain ’s new government , despite being a coalition government , has proposed a 25 percent cut in most government departments .
Can you imagine the howls from Congress and the U.S. news media if a U.S. president proposed even a 5 percent cut , though a far larger one is needed ?
Mr. Obama increasingly appears to be living in a fiscal fantasyland .
In his letter to the Group of 20 on June 18 , the president wrote : “ My administration will cut the budget deficit we inherited in half by FY 2013 and work to reduce our fiscal deficit to 3 percent of [ gross domestic product ] by FY 2015 …. ”
The president already has put forward two budgets , including projections for the next decade , but they contain no specifics for reaching such a goal .
Without laying out which programs he proposes to reduce , the words are nothing more than hollow rhetoric .
( Please see accompanying graph . )
The president still seems to believe in the imaginary world of spending multipliers - whereby each dollar of additional spending results in something in the order of $ 1.40 in additional output .
Proponents of such ideas normally refer to themselves as Keynesians ( followers of the ideas of John Maynard Keynes , 1883 - 1946 ) .
A careful reading of Keynes will show that his prescriptive “ spending stimulus ” ideas were much more limited than what many of his followers now advocate .
The Keynesians and socialists have run hundreds of experiments around the world for the past 70 years , inducing governments to try to spend themselves into prosperity .
It does n’t work .
In the 1970s , Keynesian prescriptions led to “ stagflation ” in the U.S. and many other countries .
It was only when Ronald Reagan , Margaret Thatcher and eventually many other leaders ( using the ideas of F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman ) reversed course by cutting tax rates and curtailing spending growth that their economies began to grow rapidly without inflation .
Mr. Obama seems to have never learned these lessons , and some of his advisers , who once understood what works and what does n’t , seem to have forgotten .
By nature , people like to spend other people ’s money , and too many in Congress loved what was billed as Keynesian economic theory because it gave them a rationale to be irresponsible spenders .
If you are confused about whom to believe , just think for a minute .
If increasing government spending really could lead to increased prosperity , why limit government spending at all ?
From your own observations , do governments spend your money as wisely as you do ?
And do government workers on average work harder , and are they more productive than workers you observe in the private sector ?
Finally , where does government get all of that extra money to spend ?
If it ’s from taxes , does that not mean taxpayers will have less incentive to work , save and invest ?
If it is from borrowing more money , does that not mean everyone will have to pay more taxes in the future and hence will be worse off ?
And , if the government just prints the additional money , wo n’t it be worth less , and wo n’t workers and savers be worse off ?
Responsible people , whether they are national leaders or average citizens , understand that both in their personal and public lives they cannot spend themselves into prosperity .

" It would seem to be quite legitimate for the public to be told who it was who was choosing to make , in some instances , quite serious criticisms of police activities and , if it be the case , that frequent infringements of police discipline regulations were taking place , " the judge added .
David discusses why tackling climate change is always presented to us as something ' cool ' and ' fun ' , when actually it 's just something we have to do , because of facts
The scientists whose leaked emails sparked a heated debate and speculation over the quality of research into climate change have been cleared by an independent inquiry in Britain .
The six - month inquiry cleared the climate scientists of accusations that they manipulated their data , but criticised them for being too secretive and defensive about their research .
It was alleged the researchers abused their positions to cover up flaws and distort the process that determines which scientific studies are published in journals and subsequently enter the official records .
But the inquiry panel said it had not found any evidence of behaviour that might undermine the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
It is the third inquiry into the email affair , dubbed ' Climategate ' , and clears the head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia and his colleagues of the most serious charges .
The panel did criticise the scientists for not being open in how they responded to requests for information from outside the scientific community .
When 13 years of emails from scientists at the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit were hacked into and released online last year , the ripples spread around the world .
Climate change sceptics seized on the emails to argue the scientists were manipulating and suppressing their data to support predetermined theories on man-made climate change .
Professor Edward Acton , from the University of East Anglia , says the findings " show there was ... absolutely nothing to hide . "
The inquiry concludes the scientists ' rigour and honesty are not in doubt and they did not subvert the peer review process to censor criticism .
But Sir Russell Muir , who led the investigation , says their work could have been more transparent .
" The question that arises was openness in relation to how that science was then being challenged , being discussed , and the commerce that there was between them and critics and critics and challengers right round the world , " he said .
Also criticised was a graph prepared for the World Meteorological Organisation , showing temperatures from 1850 ticking up sharply at the end of the 20th century .
The inquiry found the graph was misleading , but not intentionally so .
The findings have not quelled the mistrust of climate change sceptics like Lord Nigel Lawson , from the Global Warming Policy Foundation .
" For scientists to be misleading the public and misleading the politicians on an issue where huge decisions , huge expensive decisions are going to be based on this , that is very disreputable , " said the former British chancellor .
" The lack of openness is disreputable - the failure to acceed to freedom of information requests is disreputable . "
' Attitudes have changed '
Douglas Keenan , an independent campaigner for accountability in science , argues the inquiry was not thorough .
But he says openness in the scientific community has improved in the wake of Climategate .
" There 's no question that attitudes have changed and not just at the University of East Anglia , " he said .
" I have also had requests based on the UK Freedom of Information Act ... for example Queens University Belfast , and I have noticed a marked change in their attitude and manner since all of this has happened . "
Bob Ward , from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics , says Climategate might make it harder to recruit researchers .
" To be put under that kind of scrutiny is very difficult and I think some researchers will think long and hard about the extent to which they are willing to be identified as public individuals , " he said .
" Some of these people get abusive emails - they 're attacked publicly .
" It is not the kind of thing that I think anybody would relish . "
The inquiry might be over but the debate about global warming continues with researchers ' methods firmly under the microscope .
Many more corporate - funded attacks to come , however ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/16/2010 , 11:06 am PT
Good for Sinclair Broadcasting , in this case , pulling an inaccurate commercial off the air that was being run by the despicable corporate money - launderers of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , attacking Democratic U.S. Senatorial candidate Joe Sestak in Pennsylvania .
Of course , the ad was run on television before it was pulled .
The fact - checking was not done in advance , so lies such as health insurance reform being " a government takeover of healthcare " were allowed to be aired as if they were legitimate claims .
Naturally , the campaign of Sestak 's Republican opponent , Pat Toomey , backed up the Chamber 's ads , even as they are not supposed to be coordinating with such groups , according to the law .
But what do quaint old notions like " the rule of law " really mean anymore in these United States anyway ?
What is underscored again here , is that corporate lobbyists and criminals like those at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are now free to wield millions --- even billions --- of dollars for or against candidates they do n't like , or who may not meet with their corporate approval for any reason .
That 's what the U.S. Supreme Court has recently deemed " free speech " .
And you , dear private citizen of the United States of America , can do nothing about it --- unless you happen to have a few hundred million extra dollars sitting around the house and want to exercise your " free speech " in producing and airing TV commercials in opposition .
Good luck with that .

UPDATE 4:04 pm : Looks like the Rightwing corporate bosses at Sinclair may have come down on the local stations .
AP is now reporting the Chamber says the ads are being restored :
Two Pittsburgh - area TV stations are reversing a decision to pull a commercial attacking Democratic policies and the voting record of U.S. Senate candidate Joe Sestak .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Friday that the stations are restoring the ad that the business advocacy group sponsored .
An official for sister stations WPGH and WPMY declined to comment .

The horns that have blared at World Cup matches in South Africa make an unholy racket - according to a religious edict in the United Arab Emirates .
A fatwa by the UAE's General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments declares that the now - famous blast from the plastic vuvuzela is not permitted in the Gulf country if it exceeds 100 decibels - about the sound of a passing train .
It says the typical vuvuzela blast is up to 127 decibels .

The National newspaper in Abu Dhabi reported on Friday that the ruling came after thousands of vuvuzelas were imported to the UAE for World Cup fans .
The horns could later appear at local soccer matches .
The fatwa is based on the judgment that the din can damage fans ' hearing .
Nick Lee ’s Handy
Light app , which looks like any other flashlight app that uses the iPhone ’s screen to provide illumination , actually camouflages a tethering feature using the SOCKS proxy , à la Nullriver ’s Software ’s NetShare app that was available for a short time nearly two years ago .
The app just hit the App Store a little while ago and costs a mere $ .99 .
For those unfamiliar with tethering , it allows you to use your iPhone ’s cellular data connection on your computer or other devices via Wi -Fi .
In the U.S. , AT&T requires an additional $ 20 per month for this feature , and you must be on the most expensive data plan that costs $ 25 per month ( unless you were grandfathered into the unlimited $ 30 data plan offered previously ) .
We ’ve tested the app and it works as advertised , bringing unofficial tethering to any iPhone running iOS 4 .
Lee has posted a YouTube video demonstrating how the app works :
In case you do n’t want to watch the video , the instructions are as follows :
Set up an ad hoc Wi -Fi network on your computer ( network name and password requirement are not important ) .
Connect to the Wi-Fi network you just created on your iPhone through the Settings / Wi -Fi menu .
Tap on the blue arrow to the right of the selected Wi -Fi network , click Static in the IP Address menu and enter the following IP address and chuckle at its geek quotient : 13.37.13.37 Next , enter 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask field .
Back out of the Settings menu to ensure these settings are saved ( though hitting the Home button right away should n’t change them ) .
Go to your Mac or PC and change the network settings to use the SOCKS Proxy and enter 13.37.13.37 as the Socks Proxy Server address and 1337 as the port .
On our Mac laptop , this is what the resulting screen looks like :
Be sure to apply / save these settings .
Go back to your iPhone and open the Handy Light app and tap the flashlight colors at the bottom in the following sequence : blue , yellow , red .
Then tap the top right corner of the screen and the color should change to purple .
Your iPhone is now capable of sharing its internet connection with the computer you set up .
Leave the app open and go to your computer and start browsing .
As the video describes , we found that it took a few seconds for the connection to kick in but then it worked like a charm .
Though many variables affect network speed tests , a quick test using Speedtest .
net yielded 3.92 Mb/s down and 0.38 Mb/s up while tethered to our iPhone 4 through Handy Light .
Of course , while we felt it was important to get this news out to you , it ’s almost guaranteed Apple will remove this app from the App Store once the company learns of this hidden feature .
Hopefully , this wo n’t happen too soon and everyone can enjoy the tethering feature this app offers for a mere $.99 ( comparatively , NetShare cost $ 9.99 when it was available ) .
Now , what are you waiting for ?
Go buy Handy Light and get your tethering on !
Those of you on metered data plans should be careful tethering with this app , however , since this can quickly eat up your data allotment .
Also , since you need to keep the app open for it to keep working and the 3G radio in your iPhone takes a lot of power to run , this will likely drain your battery pretty quickly so be prepared and make sure your iPhone ’s AC charger is close at hand .
UPDATE : It looks like Apple has removed Handy Light from the App Store so it is no longer available for purchase .
UPDATE 2 : There have been a few impostor apps in the App Store with similar names but these DO NOT offer tethering ability , hidden or otherwise .
We strongly urge our readers to not buy any of these impostor apps since these developers seem to be trying to take advantage of the original Handy Light ’s fame while not providing the same hidden functionality .
If you did n’t buy Handy Light when it was in the App Store on July 20 , 2010 , you ’re out of luck , unfortunately .
In “ Babylon Revisited , ” F. Scott Fitzgerald ’s 1931 short story about the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street crash , Fitzgerald makes the point that such collapses are slips in morality as much as financial failures .
Charlie Wales , the story ’s emotionally fragile hero , returns to Paris in a desperate effort to regain custody of his nine - year - old daughter .
“ I heard that you lost a lot in the crash , ” says the Ritz bartender .
Implying his moral lapses , Charlie replies that yes , he did , “ but I lost everything I wanted in the boom . ”
In fact , upper - middle - class people like Charlie hesitated during the first months of the market ’s run-up — until early in 1928 .
That was when they joined the gambling frenzy , and that was when , as John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in The Great Crash , 1929 , the “ mass escape into make - believe , so much a part of the true speculative orgy , started in earnest . ”
Eight decades later , stock - market investors like Charlie had no role in bringing on or profiting from the 2008 financial crisis .
This time they stood on the sideline as major financial institutions engaged in a speculative orgy .
Guided by no moral compass , the most sophisticated financial players in the world were betting big with one another about interest rates , commodity prices , and whether companies or governments would default .
Until the 1990s , investment banks — the institutions that help corporations and governments raise capital by underwriting and issuing securities — were organized as partnerships .
Under that setup , the general partners risked their personal net worth on the solvency of their firms and regulated the bank ’s activities with the knowledge that they were liable for any losses .
When almost all the partnerships reorganized into corporations , investment banks became , in effect , liability casinos operated by croupiers unbridled by long - term financial responsibilities .
The sole object was to maximize day - to - day profits .
Bankers bought and sold something few Americans had heard of before : derivatives .
These instruments were hard to define , we were told , yet they were heralded as financial “ innovations ” designed to minimize risk and were reassuringly referred to as “ insurance , ” “ protection , ” or “ hedging . ”
Other strange terms — “ tranches , ” “ mezzanine , ” “ regulatory arbitrage , ” and “ repos ” — surfaced at the same time .
What are derivatives ?
They are financial contracts whose value is derived from a security such as a stock or bond , an asset such as a commodity ( crude oil , sugar , copper , etc. ) , or a market index .
Derivative is used to cover contracts of many different kinds , some dating back hundreds of years ; others , until the 1990s , were unknown to man .
Midwestern grain farmers , in the early 19th century , sometimes sold their crops while they were still growing .
That is a futures contract , a kind of derivative , the likes of which have been traded on the Chicago exchanges since Civil War times .
They are helpful to all parties .
Southwest Airlines , for an­other instance , can assure itself the price of jet fuel in the future by entering into a contract — a derivative .
A synthetic collateralized debt obligation ( CDO ) , the subject of the Security and Exchange Commission ’s lawsuit against Goldman Sachs this April , is also a derivative .
But before you can have a “ synthetic ” CDO , you have to have an actual CDO .
What ’s that ?
Say that a person who is a poor credit risk takes out a mortgage he can’t afford .
Thousands of such mortgages are collected into a security — a mortgage - backed bond .
Then a number of those bonds are collected into another security .
This is a CDO that is sold to investors .
A “ synthetic ” CDO refers to an actual CDO with no underlying asset , meaning , in this case , no mortgages .
It is essentially a wager , and , like any bet , it requires two sides : a “ long , ” who is betting that housing prices will go up , and a “ short , ” who is betting that housing prices will decline .
The short bettor , by means of a credit default swap ( CDS ) , agrees to pay the interest owed to the long bettor .
In return , the long bettor agrees to pay the principal of the CDO if it defaults .
Goldman was the bookie who put the bets together ; Rube Goldberg would have blanched at such a grotesque contraption .
The problems with derivatives are abundant and far - reaching :
There are no caps on the numbers , which generally are immense — big enough to bring down world markets .
The derivatives market is $ 600 –800 trillion — about 10 times the $ 70 - trillion output of the world economy .
The terms are so complex that they are only dimly understood by the parties entering into them as well as by the regulators who are supposed to police them ; in fact , no one knows how to regulate them .
By putting the economies of U.S. allies in jeopardy , they can too easily undermine American national interests .
September 2008 was when we learned that the big banks were earning most of their profits from dealing in derivatives and , by the way , that the financial statements they were issuing were worthless because derivatives were extensively used to evade accounting , legal , and regulatory requirements .
The air of mystery and impenetrable lingo were no help when the banks went bust and put the real economy at so dangerous a risk that the U.S. government committed $ 23.7 trillion in cash and commitments to bail them out .
The bailout was outrageous on its face , even before details about what the banks were doing were made public .
Then we learned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department , which are charged with regulating U.S. currency , and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , whose mission is to protect investors and maintain fair , orderly , and efficient markets , had n’t adequately scrutinized the banks or their derivatives .
That September the Treasury also put $ 85 billion into AIG , the world ’s largest private insurance company , supposedly to save it from bankruptcy .
Five months later , the administration disclosed under intense congressional pressure that $ 13 billion had gone to pay 100 cents on the dollar on some of Goldman Sachs ’s derivative bets , a payout that Neil M. Barofsky , the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) called a “ back door bailout ” for Goldman .
There was more to come .
Last December the public learned that the Goldman Sachs bet that the Treasury had bailed out was one Gold­man made against a mortgage - backed security it had created and sold to custo­mers .
“ The simultaneous selling of securities to customers and shorting them because they believed they were going to default is the most cynical use of credit information I have ever seen , ” Sylvain R. Ranes , an authority on structured finance , told The New York Times .
“ The woeful performance of some CDOs issued by Goldman made them ideal for betting against , ” the Times reported .
Why were the Goldman Sachs CDOs performing so badly ?
The SEC alleged that Goldman ’s motivation was to defraud .
The bank , according to the civil complaint , had colluded with a hedge - fund operator who wanted to short the housing market .
The hedge fund purchased CDSs that would pay off if the mortgage - backed securities failed .
The investors were unaware that the hedge fund , with economic interests directly adverse to the investors , then played a significant role in the selection process .
The hedge fund had an incentive to choose the worst of the mortgage - backed securities to include in the portfolio .
The SEC said that Goldman made more than $ 15 million from the CDOs .
European banks , including the German state bank , bought the securities from Goldman , which neglected to tell the Europeans that the mortgages were selected on the basis of probable failure , according to the SEC .
Within nine months of their creation , 99 percent of the CDOs were downgraded .
The European banks lost $ 1 billion , the hedge - fund operator made $ 1 billion , and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called Goldman morally bankrupt .
Derivatives had created a culture in which morality was unimportant .
From the time of the investment - bank conversions in the 1990s until the 2008 crash , Wall Street depended on short - term financing to an extent previously unknown in the world .
The customary vehicle for borrowing was the repurchase agreement or “ repo . ”
Repos are contracts for the sale and future repurchase of a financial asset , and overnight is the most common duration of a repo agreement .
Similar to an overnight secured loan , the buyer receives the securities as collateral against default and the seller raises capital .
William Cohan writes in House of Cards that Bear Stearns employees manning the repo desk would for a couple of hours each morning phone overnight lenders in order to raise perhaps $ 75 billion daily .
In turn , the overnight lenders would secure their loans with Bear Stearns ’s U.S. Treasury securities .
“ It ’s of course insane , ” former Bear Stearns executive Paul Friedman admitted to Cohan .
“ In the normal world it would be insane , and in this world it ’s really insane . ”
It also was a business model that no general partnership would ever consider .
The daily funding drama collapsed after Lehman ’s bankruptcy in September 2008 , because the overnight lenders stopped lending and the banks were left holding their toxic — worthless — assets .
Lehman failed when it no longer could balance its books .
Bear Stearns ’s last president , Alan Schwartz , testified this May to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that Bear had U.S. Treasuries to secure the overnight repos but the lenders would not take them because of doubts about the solvency of Bear .
” You have to understand the overnight lender makes a very small profit , ” Schwartz said , “ so while he is fully protected legally — he can sell the Treasuries , pay himself , and send any surplus to Bear — you might decide you do n’t want to . ”
Like contagious diseases , derivatives travel freely across national borders .
After bringing down our system , they are now undermining the euro , the currency of the world ’s second largest economy .
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou equated them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor ’s house .
Greece , in 2001 , sought to enter the euro zone but learned that it had too little revenue and too much debt to meet the European central bank ’s standards .
The Greek government turned to Goldman Sachs , paying the firm $ 300 million to fix the books .
Goldman provided cash up front in return for mortgaging Greece ’s airport fees and lottery proceeds until 2019 ; the loans were called sales , a classification that camouflaged the debt .
Based on Goldman ’s cooked books , Greece was admitted to the euro zone , and then Goldman began betting against its own client and the euro .
“ By enabling politicians to mask additional borrowing , ” Michael Fallon , a member of the British Parliament , admonished the managing director of Goldman Sachs during hearings this year : “ Banks like yours have , in fact , accentuated the sovereign risk of these countries which the markets are now focusing on . ”
Edward Gerald Corrigan of Goldman replied , “ With the benefit of hindsight . . . the standards of transparency could have been and probably should have been higher . ”
Based on Greece ’s status as a euro - zone member presumed to be adhering to euro - zone standards , European banks bought lots of Greek debt .
Now Europe can’t easily let Greece go , given the present global sovereign ( meaning government - backed ) debt crisis .
“ The fear that began in Athens , raced through Europe , and finally shook the stock market in the United States is now affecting the broader global economy , ” the Times reported .
In May , the European Finance Ministers announced a $ 1 trillion rescue plan to set up a special - purpose facility , funded with taxpayer money from the International Monetary Fund and the European governments , to buy euro bonds from the banks .
The result , much like America ’s TARP , is to shift the loss from the banks to the taxpayers .
German voters , unwilling to bail out Greece , took away Prime Minister Angela Merkel ’s legislative majority .
Once again , Goldman had designed something to fail and positioned itself to profit from the failure .
Like the irresponsible millionaires Tom and Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby , Goldman left a mess in its wake .
As Fitzgerald wrote , “ They were careless people , Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness , or whatever it was that kept them together , and let other people clean up the mess they had made . ”
Greece was not American banks ’ first foray into foreign - policy territory .
The bankers also sold complex derivatives to Italian cities like Milan as well as to smaller municipalities such as the Umbrian hilltop town of Baschi , population 2,713 .
As detailed in the Financial Times , the Italian central bank reports that between 2001 and 2008 , 525 local Italian authorities entered into 1,000 interest - rate swaps with an aggregate value of $ 50 billion — one - third of all local Italian debt .
Baschi thought it could get a lower interest rate if it entered into a swap , and the bankers offered $ 40,000 in cash to entice the town into the deal .
Baschi exchanged its fixed - rate lending on $ 4 million for a variable rate with the bankers .
The small print of the contract was so unfavorable to the town that it lost both ways .
Interest rates rose and the village lost ; interest rates fell and the village still lost .
The town ’s treasurer , Antonietta Dominici , says derivatives should be banned .
Meanwhile , Americans would do well to question whether American banks should be destabilizing Italian cities and hilltop villages .
Credit default swaps “ grow like mushrooms in the dark , ” Grigori Marchenko , governor of Kazakhstan ’s central bank , told the Financial Times .
He is concerned about CDSs because they are dragging down the country ’s two major banks .
Between 2004 and 2007 , Western banks rushed to provide financing to Kazakh banks to fund Kazakhstan ’s building boom .
Some , including Morgan Stanley , purchased CDSs to protect themselves against potential losses on the outstanding Kazakh loans .
And some , again including Morgan Stanley , may have bought more swaps than they had loans outstanding — meaning they would benefit if the Kazakh banks defaulted .
Kazakh­stan is now trying desperately to restructure its banking system but suspects that the Western banks may be betting against them .
“ I do n’t think anyone was prepared for what has happened here , ” says Marchenko .
“ There is a new class of financial institutions now who are speculating that BTA [ the largest Kazakh bank ] will go into a default . . . rather than in keeping the bank as a going concern . ”
Goldman Sachs was an adviser to the Kazakhstan government but resigned for reasons the Financial Times calls unclear .
Americans , meanwhile , would do well to wonder if U.S. - chartered banks should be undermining the banks of a strategic U.S. ally .
Dollar Diplomacy , as designed 100 years ago by Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft , used American business to achieve national policy objectives , primarily to stabilize Latin America and discourage European meddling in our back yard — such as Vladimir Putin ’s recent visit to Hugo Chávez ’s Venezuela .
The new Goldman Sachs version of Dollar Diplomacy is , of course , not intended to advance the national interest but to profit the company .
Profit opportunities are advanced by volatility not stability .
Governments large and small normally issue fixed - rate debt rather than variable - rate debt because they need to know their future liability .
Los Angeles , in 2006 , issued $ 317 million in variable - interest bonds to build sewers and then swapped them with Goldman Sachs and other banks for the city ’s promise to pay a fixed - interest rate .
The city made money in the first few years , but now variable - interest rates have dropped to near zero and the city ’s fixed - interest obligation far exceeds the rate it is receiving .
Call provisions in fixed - rate bonds allow cities to avoid such losses from large interest - rate shifts if interest rates drop .
Municipalities can pay off the outstanding bonds and issue new low - interest bonds .
But L.A. , by entering into the swaps agreement , gave up its right to call its bonds , and the swaps do n’t expire until 2028 .
The banks will let the city out of the contracts for $ 26 million .
It ’s irrational to assume that you will win a bet with Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley , and the village of Baschi and the city of Los Angeles should have known better .
But it is also immoral to take advantage of people who may not be as clever as you .
Whether those deals are legal remains to be seen .
The president of Harvard University is no doubt better advised than the treasurer of an Italian hill town , but the university ’s experience with derivatives is even worse .
In 2006 , Lawrence Summers , shortly after a five - year term as Harvard president , told The New York Times : “ There is a temptation to go for what is comfortable , but this would be a mistake .
The universities have matchless resources that demand that they seize the moment . ”
As recounted in a Vanity Fair article last August , Summers sought “ to lead ( or force ) the university into a glorious renaissance . ”
And so , in 2005 , Harvard entered into a deal involving $ 3.7 billion of interest - rate swaps to hedge against rising interest cost .
But interest rates plunged , and the losses piled up — $ 1.8 billion and still counting .
The university ’s financial report for fiscal year 2009 notes that the “ unprecedented ” fall in interest rates caused Harvard ’s swap agreements “ to incur sudden and precipitous declines in value which in turn led to significant increases in associated collateral pledged to counterparties , creating liquidity pressures on the University . ”
Summers told a former colleague , “ I held out the hope that Boston would be to this century what Florence was to the 15th century . ”
When the crisis struck , the toxic assets made it appear as if most or all of our big banks were bust .
No one knew who owed what to whom .
“ In a just world , ” financial journalist Michael Lewis told television host Charlie Rose this past March , “ all . . . the failed firms would have failed . ”
Instead , Lewis said , for the last year and a half “ the government has subsidized the banks , gifting them out of their problems . ”
Liquidity is not the problem , according to Anna Schwartz , co-author with Milton Friedman of A Monetary History of the United States , 1867 to 1960 .
The problem is insolvency and the fear of insolvency , aggravated by the secrecy of the over - the - counter derivatives market .
“ The real problem was that because of the mysterious new instruments that investors had acquired , no one knew which firms were solvent or what their assets were worth , ” Schwartz wrote in the Times .
In May , the former Treasury secretary and Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson put his spin on derivatives .
“ They did n’t create the crisis , but they magnified it .
They exacerbated it , ” he testified at a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearing .
Indeed , at this writing , 19 months after the bailouts , the banks still hold the toxic assets and we still do n’t know what they are worth .
But the solution , if Schwartz is right , did n’t require money ; it only required transparency .
What if the five big banks — JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Citi­group , Wells Fargo , and Goldman Sachs — were collectively invited to the Fed or the Treasury and asked to disclose their derivative liabilities to one another ?
Some deals could be canceled .
At least investors , and other banks , could see what bets had been made and which banks were solvent .
The failed banks could be shut .
( A similar approach was taken by the New York Federal Reserve Bank in 1998 to pressure the creditor banks to keep Long Term Capital Management from bankruptcy .
LTCM was the hedge fund exposed on $ 1.25 trillion of interest - rate and foreign - exchange derivatives that it could not pay .
The intervention prevented bankruptcy without any taxpayer dollars . )
The troubling point , according to Michael Lewis , is that the federal government never considered alternative solutions to subsidizing the banks .
The government told the public that the bank bailout was necessary and that the bailout dollars would be multiplied as the banks made business loans .
But the plan did n’t succeed because it was based on an outdated analysis of what the banks were doing .
The Banking Act of 1933 , commonly called the Glass - Steagall Act , separated commercial banks from investment banks and gave us a stable financial environment .
But half a century later the traditional banking system , although it raised and allocated capital efficiently , proved insufficiently flush to fund the huge salaries that became common on Wall Street .
Commercial banks reorganized into investment banks to escape Glass - Steagall and become derivatives dealers — for their own and their customers ’ accounts .
The comptroller of the currency reports that banks , for 2009 , reported record derivatives - trading revenues of $ 22.6 billion .
The five big banks hold 97 percent of all derivatives .
Of course , advising customers at the same time you are buying for your own book is a conflict of interest .
“ People who know the industry and know Goldman Sachs know that it is a giant hedge fund , but it ’s wrapped in an investment banking wrapper , ” says Professor Samuel Hayes of Harvard Business School .
He believes , as do others , that the public “ would be horrified to think that their tax dollars [ in the bailout ] were going to a hedge fund . ”
In 2009 , Goldman Sachs made more than $ 100 million a day on 131 out of a total of 263 trading days .
In December 2009 Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman ’s CEO , maintained in The Sunday Times of London that Goldman “ was doing God ’s work . ”
Consistent daily returns of $ 100 million did seem miraculous .
Gambling is a zero-sum game ; each day that Goldman won $ 100 million , the other bettors lost .
The problem is that the banks , while discarding their socially useful functions , retained taxpayer subsidies designed to support those functions .
They held on to federal deposit insurance and benefited from an implied taxpayer guarantee under the “ Too Big to Fail ” doctrine and practice .
They could borrow at lower rates because of the implied taxpayer guarantee .
But the way the banks work now , no valid theory entitles them to any taxpayer subsidy .
The taxpayer , under the rules , can only lose .
Before the banks could turn into casinos , they had to repeal Glass - Steagall , the laws already in place to prevent the banks from becoming hedge funds .
Congress did so in a bipartisan effort , and President Bill Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 .
Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , knew the bill would pass but nonetheless spoke against it :
Does anybody here think this makes any sense , that we have banks involved in derivatives , trading on their own proprietary accounts ?
Does anybody think it makes any sense to have hedge funds out there with trillions of dollars of derivatives , losing billions of dollars and then being bailed out by a Federal Reserve–led bailout because their failure would be so catastrophic to the rest of the market that we cannot allow them to fail ?
Senator Phil Gramm ( R - TX ) spoke for the repeal in glowing terms of Republican orthodoxy : “ We are here today to repeal Glass - Steagall because we have learned that government is not the answer .
We have learned that freedom and competition are the answers . ”
Democratic President Clinton said , “ It is true that the Glass - Steagall law is no longer appropriate for the economy in which we live .
It worked pretty well for the industrial economy , which was highly localized , much more centralized , and much more nationalized than the one in which we operate today .
But the world is very different . ”
He congratulated Congress :
So I think you should all be exceedingly proud of yourselves , including being proud of your differences and how you tried to reconcile them .
Over the past seven years , we have tried to modernize the economy .
And today what we ’re doing is modernizing the financial services industry , tearing down these antiquated laws , and granting banks significant new authority .
Were the barriers “ antiquated ” ?
The country had no serious commercial bank failures while they were in place , and no financial crisis infected the real economy .
Bucket shops were once operated in many large American cities .
Outfitted with a New York Stock Exchange ticker , each shop would post quotations as they came in .
Customers , rather than buy stocks , would bet on the tape — for example , 20 shares of sugar at $ 100 — and the shop would take a commission .
If the stock went down , the customer lost .
Customers could also short a stock .
Edwin Lefèvre ’s 1923 book , Reminiscences of a Stock Operator , vividly describes the turn - of - the - century bucket shop .
They were partially blamed for the Panic of 1907 , and states outlawed them soon after that .
The New York Stock Exchange , where customers bought the underlying assets , continued to be legal .
The “ synthetic ” collateralized debt obligation is a revival , 100 years later , of the bucket shop .
Could anyone defend the return of gambling shops ?
Well , yes , President Obama ’s principal economic adviser , Lawrence Summers , did .
In July 1998 , as deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration , he explained to Congress that the derivative market “ in just a few short years ” had become “ highly lucrative ” and a “ magnet for derivative business from around the world . ”
The market , Summers continued , is developed “ on the basis of complex and fragile legal and legislative understandings . ”
It was true , he said , that “ questions have been raised as to whether the derivatives market could exacerbate a large , sudden market decline . ”
But he did n’t think so , noting that the derivatives supported “ higher investment and growth in living standards in the United States and around the world . ”
There was no reason for concern , he said , since :
the parties to these kinds of contracts are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies and most of which are already subject to basic safety and soundness regulation under existing banking and securities laws .
Summers explained that the market was based on an “ implicit consensus that the OTC [ over the counter ] derivatives market should be allowed to grow and evolve without deciding ” the legal issues — i.e. , whether derivatives violated laws prohibiting bucket shops , gambling , and trading in unregistered securities , not to mention doing so outside the regulated options exchanges , such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
“ At the heart of that consensus has been a recognition that ‘ swap ’ transactions should not be regulated . . . whether or not a plausible legal argument could be made ” that the contracts are “ illegal and unenforceable , ” Summers said .
The Commodity Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 , 262 pages in length , passed both houses of Congress without debate the day after it was introduced .
The President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets , led by Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , wrote to Congress that it “ strongly supports ” the bill , which would maintain the U.S. “ competitive position in the over - the - counter derivative markets by providing legal certainty and promoting innovation , transparency and efficiency in our financial markets . ”
Section 117 of the bill stated : “ This Act shall supersede and preempt the application of any State or local law that prohibits or regulates gaming or the operation of bucket shops . ”
The U.S. economy prospered without derivatives and has not prospered since they were legalized in 2000 .
Paul Volcker , who preceded Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve , recently said :
I have found very little evidence that vast amounts of innovation in financial markets in recent years have had a visible effect on the productivity of the economy .
Maybe you can show me that I am wrong .
All I know is that the economy was rising very nicely in the 1950s and 1960s without all of these innovations .
Indeed , it was quite good in the 1980s without credit - default swaps and without securitization and without CDOs .
I do not know if something happened that suddenly made these innovations essential for growth .
In fact , we had greater speed of growth and particularly did not put the whole economy at risk of collapse .
That is the main concern that I think we all need to have .
Any reasonable reform of our financial system has to start with the repeal of the 1999 and 2000 acts that provide legal immunity to derivatives dealers .
Restoration of Glass - Steagall would return our banks to taking deposits and making loans , thus reducing their size and getting them into safer activities .
Derivatives , without their federal immunity , can be tested against state gambling and anti–bucket shop laws .
The synthetic collateralized debt obligation , which is a pure bet , would fall .
Volcker proposed a ban on proprietary trading by a bank .
The so - called Volcker rule almost amounts to a return of Glass - Steagall , but it is doubtful that Congress will include it in the current reform bill .
The real issue is Too Big to Fail .
There are two parts to the practice : the “ Too Big ” part and the “ to Fail ” part .
The “ Too Big ” part holds the most promise .
If we can limit financial institutions to a size we are willing to let fail without a blink , the problem is solved .
But Congress has been unwilling to do so .
Volcker recently asked , “ Can we reasonably continue with a financial system that , implicitly or explicitly , relies on a firmly held expectation that major financial institutions will be protected from failure in the face of financial crisis ? ”
The banks generally threaten to move most of their operations overseas if Congress passes laws unfavorable to their interests .
But the European countries , since the Greek affair , have probably also had enough of the new bankers .
They would very likely agree to treaties with the United States that would regulate financial institutions .
The courts , too , may be helpful .
Legal processes are slow but relentless .
Judges do , after a fashion , reflect popular opinion .
In Baschi , town treasurer Dominici has filed a lawsuit against the banks .
In Milan , four banks face criminal charges for aggravated fraud in connection with a 2005 $ 2.3 - billion bond and swap deal .
Dario Loiacono , an Italian lawyer connected with the case , said , “ It is clear that the municipalities did not understand the risks and costs they were taking on .
This case will clarify who has responsibility for that . ”
The mayor of Milan , Letizia Moratti , on the eve of the criminal trial , said the bankers must change their behavior .
She singled out Goldman Sachs , although it is not one of the defendant banks .
Milan , she said , was not lacking in financial sophistication but was duped : “ It is because we had a false letter from the banks stating that the derivatives were economically positive for us when they were n’t .
It is not that we did n’t understand English . ”
These days Americans may feel a bit like Charlie Wales as Fitzgerald described him in the conclusion of “ Babylon Revisited ” : “ He was n’t young any more , with a lot of nice thoughts and dreams to have by himself . ”
But we also can take solace in the glimmer of hope that Fitzgerald held out for Charlie : “ He would come back some day ; they could n’t make him pay forever . ”
An Update , September 8 , 2010 :
The Compromised Response by Congress
“ Because of this law , the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street ’s mistakes .
There will be no more taxpayer funded bailouts .
Period . ” President Obama made this assertion July 21 when he signed the Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , Congress ’s response to the 2008 stock market crash .
But derivatives , the unregulated financial contracts that set off the crash and that have cost U.S. taxpayers $ 3.7 trillion so far , have been largely undisturbed by the new law .
The derivatives business is concentrated in the big banks –90 percent is conducted by the 10 biggest banks–and they produce $ 60 billion a year .
Because of them , no one knew who owed what to whom , and they are the reason banks stopped dealing with one other .
What should Congress have done with derivatives , considering the fact that no one knows how to regulate them ?
The synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations and other exotic inventions that are collectively known as derivatives simply should have been banned .
Congress , however , did not seriously consider that , although it did try to bring them out of the shadow world of unregulated trading .
Drafts of the bill proposed that derivatives be traded on exchanges so the public and regulators would at least know they exist and their pricing .
But the bankers ’ lobbyists beat back that modest effort at reform in the last days before the law passed .
Meanwhile , derivatives continue as the favorite betting vehicle in the casino called Wall Street .
Less than a month after the new law was signed , bankers were taking huge bets on deflation :
For $ 15,000 , the bankers will cover any drop in the consumer price index up to $ 1 million for the next 10 years .
One bettor has put down $ 174 million in hopes of winning $ 9 billion , a 20 to 1 return , The Wall Street Journal reported in late August .
Does anyone think whether or not we are going into another Depression is predictable enough to bet on ?
Would you bet the farm on it ?
Do you like bankers betting your farm on it ?
The banks say they have hedged their bets by buying derivatives from other banks .
The hedges will be as good as long as the other banks are solvent –the same disastrous cycle we went through with AIG in 2008 .
Is this what banks are supposed to be doing ?
“ Never again ” could be next week .
• Can we really depend on the oil supply that everyone has told us is here ?
It seems to me with the BP Horizon Blowout , we may be hitting a turning point in belief systems , in more than one way :
Because of the large number of comments , this thread is being closed .
Please see thread http://campfire.theoildrum.com/node/6598 .
1 . Can businesses really be expected to regulate themselves , with minimal oversight ?
Once upon a time , back in the pre-Reagan era , capitalism and profits did n't seem to have quite the emphasis they have today in the the way the country functioned .
In 1961 , President John F. Kennedy said , " Ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , " and people took him seriously .
Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1963 to 1969 period was responsible for designing the " Great Society " legislation that included laws that upheld civil rights , Public Broadcasting , Medicare , Medicaid , environmental protection , aid to education , and his " War on Poverty . "
But by 1980 , the country had been through a lot of hard times , with the decline in US oil supply starting in 1970 , Nixon canceling the convertibility of dollar to gold in 1971 , real wages starting to decline in 1973 , and the oil price shock of 1973 - 1974 .
Ronald Reagan was elected as US president in 1980 .
He was known policies that much more oriented toward laisse faire capitalism , including trickle down economics , reduced taxes , getting tough on labor unions , and deregulation of businesses .
The BP Deepwater Horizon blowout and what appears to be questionable internal decisions , makes one wonder about whether this deregulation really makes sense .
There were hints that deregulation might be a problem before -- with Enron 's manipulation of energy markets and creative accounting , discovered in 2001 , followed by all of the bank bailouts in 2008 and 2009 .
Now , when one hears all the detailed allegations made in the BP incident , one wonders whether our faith in deregulation might be misplaced .
One wonders too , what other problems lurk around the corner , in other deregulated industries .
We recently experienced a major coal mine explosion .
Might there be other problems , lurking in , say , the electrical industry , or the unconventional natural gas industry ?
2 . Can technology solve our all our problems ?
Many individuals and groups , from Scientific American magazine , to school systems , to Energy Secretary Chu would seem to be telling us that technology can solve all of our problems .
And we have seen an endless array of new fancy gadgets over the years , starting with calculators , then computers , electric copying machines , the Internet , portable phones , and all kinds of devices to play music and send messages .
These all seem to suggest that technology can do marvelous things .
Now , we are confronted with what should be not too difficult a problem -- cutting off the oil flow from a well -- and we find it is difficult to do .
Perhaps the Deepwater Horizon blowout is an event that should get us to rethink our assumptions a bit .
3 . If there are technological solutions , can they be expected immediately ?
As we sit an wait for months for relief wells to be drilled , and weeks for additional ships to be brought in , the idea that even when we do have solutions , they take time sets in .
Earlier this week , Nate posted an article by Dr. Cutler Cleveland about energy transitions .
It included this graph :
Composition of U.S. energy use .
( Source : Cutler Cleveland )
While wood represented over 90 % of energy use in 1800 , it took over 100 years to get down to 10 % of energy use .
Coal was the chief fuel for a fairly short period of time , but took 50 years ( from about 1920 to 1970 ) to drop from its high point to its low point , as oil started substituting for its use .
Now we are in an era of oil , gas , and " electricity " .
One can talk about going to electric cars , but if governments are too poor to subsidize the costs on a mass basis , and other cars have little trade in value , how many of us are going to be able to afford them ?
How long can such an energy transition realistically be expected to take ?
Is a transition to different energy sources really going to need to take 50 years or more ?
4 . Can we really depend on the oil supply that everyone has told us is available ?
I think this question is one that not just Oil Drum readers , but the general public , is beginning to think about .
Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico seemed like a fairly secure source , and suddenly we have been disillusioned .
The reserves of oil companies and of the USGS depend on resources like this .
But now those resources do n't seem so secure .
What if we with the additional costs of the new safety systems , the wells are really too expensive to drill ?
Or maybe they already were borderline too expensive , and this just makes the problem more clear .
Besides deep water in the Gulf of Mexico , there are other deep water oil supplies that looked to be next in line for drilling in the next few years .
Brazil has made a number of claims regarding deep water discoveries , and last October , at the Association for Peak Oil USA conference , Dr. Marcio Mello made a claim that possibly a half a trillion barrels of oil could be extracted from sub - salt area , from areas around the world ( not just Brazil ) that are not currently included in reserves .
Another area that seems to be in line next is the arctic , but we hear that Norway has cut off new deep water drilling , until the investigation by the US into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon blowout is complete .
We are running short of places to drill .
If the areas that seemed to be promising no longer look quite as promising , then where does that leave us ?
Questions
1 . How have the recent events affected your beliefs ?
2 . Are there ways we can gradually shift beliefs toward some more helpful belief systems ?
For example , if there is going to be less , an attitude of sharing what we have might be helpful .
Income Inequality in the US is very high .
Is there a way we can even out this inequality , so that the resources we have could be shared better ?
3 . What opportunities do you see from the recent events ?

Taxpayers may have to bail out BP if Gulf crisis sinks oil firm
Taxpayers could end up bailing out BP in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster .
The Government is understood to be working on contingency plans in case the firm collapses .
In extreme circumstances , this could involve rescuing the business in a similar way to the bail - out of RBS during the credit crunch .
Ministers are concerned about the effect of a BP collapse on British pensioners , whose retirement income relies on the value of the company 's shares .
Gulf disaster : The Deepwater Horizon explosion and the ensuing oil spill at the Gulf of Mexico
BP accounts for £ 1 out of every £ 7 paid out in dividends to British pension pots - but since the accident on April 20 , its value has halved .
There are growing fears the company could be broken up or taken over , with unknown consequences for pensioners .
It is understood talks are being led by officials at the Treasury and the Department for Business about what to do if BP , which has liabilities of £ 46 billion , falls apart .
On Sunday , BP announced it was going to sell £ 6 billion in shares to raise capital following the oil spill .
It was also reported Libya could be interested in buying some of the shares .
Neither the Business Department nor the Treasury would comment .

Suddenly , DON CHEADLE and SAM ROCKWELL enter .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Oh look , my friend Don Cheadle that I 've been friends with for years and is in no way a replacement for another actor !
And Sam Rockwell , who seems to be taking his character 's name " Hammer " extremely literally .
SAM ROCKWELL
Hey everyone , I 'm a total jerkhole like Robert , but I did n't build a giant robot suit so that makes me suck balls .
Excuse me while I push my glasses up , snort .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Look , the fact of the matter is that I 'm totally super cool , illustrated by me using my iPhone to hack into a television that nobody can seem to turn off .
Thus , I should get to keep the suit .
Bye .
EXT .
GRAND PRIX - MONACO
ROBERT goes to the GRAND PRIX .
Characters all talk over each other , which passes for CLEVER DIALOGUE .
ROBERT hops into a RACECAR and drives around but suddenly MICKEY ROURKE shows up with LIGHTSABER WHIPS and slices a bunch of cars in half .
MICKEY ROURKE
I am here to be adversary , Robert !
I am serious Oscar - vinning actor now , so I actually vent to Russian prison to research role !
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Where you discovered Russian prisoners have Russian accents and tattoos .
Now that 's living the craft .
JON FAVREAU and GWYNETH PALTROW show up and ram MICKEY into a wall with their car .
They throw ROBERT an IRON MAN SUITCASE which allows ROBERT to sell a slightly different ACTION FIGURE .
GWYNETH PALTROW
How the hell does that thing not weigh like a billion pounds ?
JON FAVREAU
Oh no , Mickey Rourke has survived being slammed into a wall with a car !
Four times !
Geeze , what moron directed this ?
IRON ROBERT and MICKEY ROURKE fight for a bit .
MICKEY ROURKE
Vodka communism ice hockey !
How do vhips slice right through cars but just mildly annoy iron suit ?
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
That 's almost as good a question as why your face does n't completely explode when I punch you in it with my big iron man fist .
( punch )
MICKEY is beaten and taken to JAIL , but he escapes and meets with SAM ROCKWELL .
SAM ROCKWELL
Hi Mickey , I like the way that you dislike Robert , so I think we could work together even though doing so makes me a full - fledged criminal .
MICKEY ROURKE
I can help you .
As you can see , I 'm very muscular .
SAM ROCKWELL
Yeah , I can see that , so we ...
MICKEY ROURKE
And a physicist .
SAM ROCKWELL
Ha ha , well that 's pretty unbeliev --
MICKEY ROURKE
And a computer hacker .
SAM ROCKWELL
Dude , what ?
SAM allows insane , vengeful MICKEY ROURKE to completely take over the design and control of his ARMY OF KILLER ROBOTS .
SAM ROCKWELL
I do n't see how this could possibly go wrong .
Meanwhile ...

ROBERT DOWNEY JR'S MANSION
ROBERT DOWNEY JR is boxing with JON FAVREAU .
SCARLETT JOHANSSON enters .
GWYNETH PALTROW
Robert , since you made me CEO of your company , I need you to sign some paperwork .
Scarlett Johansson is here from the legal department .
Also , she has boobs , now presented in IMAX .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
We should pull up some pictures from her stint as a lingerie model .
This is pathetic pandering , but the drooling nerds in the audience wo n't notice .
SCARLETT briefly boxes with JON FAVREAU and KICKS HIS ASS SUPER - SEXYLIKE !
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Holy shit , nice moves !
It 's almost like you 're a secret undercover agent , but if that were true it would be fucking idiotic of you to blow your cover just to avoid getting your pride hurt by my limo driver , so I guess not !
SCARLETT JOHNANSSON
Listen , I have to be in a YouTube commenter 's masturbation fantasy in about 5 minutes so if we could hurry this along ...
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Fair enough .
Hypothetically speaking , if it was your birthday and you were wearing a metal robot suit that was slowly poisioning you , what would you do ?
SCARLETT JOHNANSSEN
I suppose I 'd do whatever I wanted .
Like maybe getting piss - drunk while wearing the most dangerous weapon in the world and still managing to be likeable somehow .
He DOES .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Welcome to the most terrifying birthday party ever imagined , everyone !
Now I 'm going to blow up some big glass bottles , showering all of you with deadly broken glass !
ASPIRING ACTRESSES
WOO , SPRING BREAK !
DON CHEADLE shows up .
Seeing ROBERT drunk , he goes downstairs and becomes LESS COLORFUL IRON MAN .
DON CHEADLE
That 's enough , Robert !
I 've somehow already figured out how to work the suit , so I 'm ready to fight you , even if our fight would have special effects astonishingly inferior to the first film's !
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
How the hell do you plan on getting out of that thing ?
I have a bunch of giant robot arms help me .
DON and ROBERT , wearing suits that make them invincible , FIGHT .
Eventually DON leaves and gets SAM ROCKWELL to attach a bunch of EXTRA PHALLIC SYMBOLS to his BIG METAL DICK .
SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING
JACKSON approaches ROBERT .
SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING
JACKSON
Nice to see you again , Robert .
This time I 'm an essential character and a major part of what is barely passing for a storyline .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
What about the people who did n't stay past the credits for the last movie ?
For them , this is just suddenly introducing a black pirate out of nowhere .
SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING
JACKSON
Then I 'll point you in the direction of the film 's climax and leave .
You see , Mickey Rourke hates you because his dad used to work with your dad .
But while your dad had noble goals of progress , Rourke 's dad wanted to make a profit .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Well progress is nice , but it's hard to fault an inventor for wanting to make money off his work .
SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING
JACKSON
So naturally your dad fired the guy , used their invention to become a multi-millionaire himself , and had him deported back to Russia where he died in poverty .
Now his son wants revenge .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
I see .
And we 're sure he 's the bad guy and not me , right ?
SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING
JACKSON
Of course .
He has a Russian accent , whereas you make sarcastic quips .
In any case , I know your suit is killing you .
Your dad hid a secret message inside of a train model that could help .
Your dad hated safe deposit boxes .
Called them " devil Jew boxes . "
Maybe I should stop telling you stuff about your dad .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Thanks ,
I 'll go get that model from Gwyneth Paltrow 's office after talking to her in front of an executive desk toy that generates continuity errors .
SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING
JACKSON
Good luck .
And remember , I 've got my eye on you .
( pause )
Eh ?
Eh ?
( pause )
Because of the eyepatch .
ROBERT retreats to his GENIUS BASEMENT to invent his way out of the movie 's central problem .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Alright , I 'm going to just move my arms randomly while walking around this room and you guys can animate a whole bunch of crap happening as if I was making it do that .
( wild gesticulation )
Eureka !
My dad discovered an element with more electrons than other elements , which means it 's a new element !
That 's how chemistry works , and now that I 'm aware of it I can start using it right away !

DON CHEADLE
Hey , I do n't have control of my suit !

The DEADLY , WEAPONIZED ROBOTS go HAYWIRE .
SAM ROCKWELL
Fuck , why the hell did I give them live ammunition for a trade show ?
ROBERT DOWNEY JR . shows up and FIGHTS SOME ROBOTS .
Meanwhile , SCARLETT JOHNANSSON hurries to save the city from MICKEY ROURKE but first takes some time to change into a SEXY BLACK CATSUIT .
SCARLETT JOHANSSON ( O.C . )
Robert , I tracked down the computer Mickey was using to control his robot army .
He 's gone .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
I suppose that without an operator , these robots will have to stop fighting me , right ?
SCARLETT JOHANSSON ( O.C . )
Somehow , nope !
Good luck , Robert , I need to go fight a bunch of guys while being painfully self - aware of the fact that I 'm in a comic book movie .
I 'll do a sexy pose after every punch , which would be embarrassing if not for the fact that the internet loves me and forgives even my worst performances .
DON CHEADLE
I have control of my suit now , Robert !
Let 's take these robots out while utterly failing to give the audience even the slightest sense that we are in danger !
They fight ROBOTS together , discussing strategy and engaging in CAMARADERIE .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Oh wait , let me just use this thing that instantly kills all of the bad guys .

MICKEY ROURKE shows up in ANOTHER IRON MAN SUIT .
MICKEY ROURKE
Snow potatoes Red Square fur coats !

What a surprise , the bad guy has decided to confront me while wearing a giant robot suit .
If there 's one thing the audience is hungry for after two movies , it 's more scenes of me fighting an endless stream of metal guys .
DON shoots a SUPER SPECIAL BULLET at MICKEY , which FAILS .
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
Sam Rockwell
Tech , eh ?
DON CHEADLE
Yeah , it was .
And so are the fifty guns I 've got attached to my suit that are working fine and helped us fight an army of robots ten seconds ago .
Pompous ass .

Why ca n't we just bite the bullet and introduce Mandarin ?
ROBERT DOWNEY JR .
The guy with the magical rings ?
No way , Jon Favreau wants to keep these movies grounded in reality .
DON CHEADLE
The same Jon Favreau whose movie features a scene after the credits in which an eyepatch - wearing superspy in charge of a secret government organization of superheroes discovers the magical hammer of the thunder god of Norse mythology , right ?

Spoiler alert .
DON CHEADLE
Sorry .

END
BERLIN – Ars Electronica , the venerable digital arts festival held each September in Linz , Austria , always makes a splash .
And this year is no exception .
Take sperm- racing , for example , which fits perfectly with this year 's theme : sex .
" NEXT SEX : Sex in the Age of Its Procreative Superfluousness , " which begins Saturday , picks up pretty much where last year 's ground - breaking " Life Sciences " festival left off .
" Sperm- racing " may sound like a mere gag , but the Ars Electronica folks are serious about their fun , and have fun in their seriousness .
So , yes sirree , the little critters will be a - wrigglin ' and a - racin ' .
And anyone who shows up in the main square in Linz next week will be able to make his own , uh , contribution to the event .
" There is a big container in the main square of the city , in a public space where everyone can go , " said Gerfried Stocker , the festival 's director .
" It 's called the CASA , Computer Assisted Sperm Analyzer , and with this thing you can measure or determine the quality of sperm , the density , the mobility , the speed , the pH value , and this kind of thing . "
See , we told you they were serious .
" We measure the speed , and make your ranking with all the people .
The women can bet on their favorites , " Stocker said in a telephone interview .
" You fill out a form along with your donation .
Muscles ?
Education ?
What car you drive ? "
If fast cars substitute for sexual performance , the automobile information is , in fact , an important piece of information for the contest , Stocker said .
" It 's meant rather as a funny and ironic project , of course , " he said .
" By looking at these questionnaires , the women can say who they think is the sexually most powerful male , who has the fastest sperm , and every evening we have the sperm race .
" The person who wins can stay anonymous , or maybe reveal himself and become the big darling of everyone here . "
Sure makes 200 - meter dash seem pathetic by comparison , now does n't it ?
But Stocker insists there is a serious aspect to the Sperm Olympics .
" It 's really about the whole discussion about how the quality of sperm in the Western world is constantly reducing , " Stocker said .
" This is very often used as an argument by very right - wing and racist people .
If you 're strong and do a lot of sports , it does n't mean you have the better sperm .
There is also no correlation with race or nationality .
Still , there is this very stereotypical picture of all this . "
And of course , there are souvenirs .
Not the magazines and videos available in a booth set up for potential sample - producers .
No , those stay .
The souvenirs are photographs .
" You can get nice photos of your sperm racing , blown up a thousand times , " Stocker said .
Last year 's focus on life sciences generated a lively debate , including detailed treatment of such topics as designer babies .
This year 's festival will take that inquiry further , and while next year 's theme is not yet decided , chances are it will continue to build on the topic of sex .
" The idea of Ars Electronica is always to deal with areas where new technologies are starting to have an impact on culture and society , " Stocker said .
" This is definitely starting to be true for genetic engineering and life sciences , which has a stronger impact now than information technology , because information technology has kind of ( become ) saturated in its ability to create new social and cultural paradigms . "
Those who cannot attend can follow from afar .
Chicago artist Eduardo Kac , for example , was one of the hits of last year 's festival with his transgenic " Genesis " project and his plans for an art project involving a dog genetically engineered to have a fluorescent green coat .
The project has moved ahead , using a bunny instead of a dog .
" Ars Electronica has emerged as the leading festival examining the relationship between art , science , technology , and culture , " said Kac , who will be unable to attend this year .
" After 20 years , it has shown great vision and courage under the leadership of Gerfried Stocker , as it changed its primary focus from electronic media to biotechnology .
Reproductive technologies are one of the driving forces of this new area , with many promises and problems . "
Some of the higher - profile projects at the festival will be Marta de Menezes ' butterfly exhibit , in which the artist makes up her own wing patterns by " targeted interventions into the development process " ; and Tissue Culture and Art by Australians Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr , and Guy Ben - Ary of Israel .
The latter project uses actual tissue cultures as a medium for art .
Stocker said that these kinds of projects " address the moral and ethical questions , like , is it OK for artists to do this ?
We say it 's OK for scientists to do this , but what about artists ?
" I think it 's very important that artists do this , because it 's more or less the only way to create some free space in this type of research , " he said .
" If you limit this work only to science and technology , only mainstream values will be followed .
Artists create in a different way and have different values .
Artists participating in this research guarantees free space for ideas that go against mainstream values . "
Like sperm racing .
But Ms. Kosmas argued that commercial rockets should be a complement to a NASA - led program , not a replacement .
Debate on the future of NASA ’s human spaceflight program will continue through the summer as the administration and Congress try to arrive at a compromise .
In recent weeks , SpaceX has tried to play down the significance of the first Falcon 9 launching .
“ I hope people do n’t put too much emphasis on our success , ” Mr. Musk said Thursday at a news conference , “ because it ’s simply not correct to have the fate of commercial launch depend on what happens in the next few days .
But it certainly does add to the pressure .
There ’s more weight on our shoulders because of that .
I wish there were n’t . ”
After the flight , Mr. Musk said it was “ to a significant degree a vindication of what the president has proposed . ”
SpaceX is aiming to launch a second Falcon 9 this summer to demonstrate its capabilities for NASA before it gets the go - ahead to take cargo and supplies to the International Space Station .
That flight will include an operational version of the Dragon capsule , which will hold cargo and , eventually , astronauts .
That capsule would not go to the space station but would demonstrate orbital maneuvers and return to Earth .
The third Falcon 9 flight has been pushed back about five months to March 2011 at the earliest .
However , Mr. Musk said he would like to expand its objectives so that the Dragon capsule could go all the way to the space station , perhaps even carrying cargo .
That objective had been scheduled for the fourth flight .
SpaceX won a $ 278 million contract from NASA in 2006 for the demonstration flights , and , if successful , it would move on to a $ 1.6 billion contract for 12 flights to take supplies to the space station .
Mullan attributed the delay to the year or more the state spent negotiating with the community and investigating alternative locations for a 24 - hour , 11 - acre service yard for Green Line trains that the state wanted to put squarely amid the Inner Belt , a little - utilized industrial area .
That seemed like a suitable location to the state because it ’s something of a no man ’s land and because part of the property was publicly owned .
Locals objected for the same reasons — arguing that if the Green Line is to fulfill goals of getting people out of cars and encouraging new development around transit , then the Inner Belt should instead be readied for new housing , businesses , and amenities .
“ This is , if not our top priority , one of our top priorities in the transportation world , ’’ he said .
“ It is a good project , it is a worthy project , and it ’s one that we ’re committed to . ’’
Jeffrey B. Mullan , the state ’s transportation secretary and CEO , said supporters should not see this as a lack of commitment to the Green Line or a sign of financial woes .
Missing that deadline will make the project more expensive , because the state will need to come up with an air - quality - improving short - term alternative to the Green Line or face legal and community pressure .
The project delay was acknowledged in an annual status report that the state Department of Transportation must file with the Department of Environmental Protection to update its progress on the Green Line and other Big Dig mitigation efforts , a list known as the State Implementation Plan .
The 2010 report was filed Friday , and transportation officials began calling local leaders and stakeholders to alert them to the delay before the report landed at DEP .
But this delay means more than disappointing residents in an urban corridor bracketed by elevated highways and suburban - bound commuter rail tracks but served only by buses and cars .
The state is legally bound to finishing the Green Line by the end of 2014 , because it is part of a list of nonautomobile improvements it pledged to offset environmental impacts of the Big Dig , comply with the federal Clean Air Act , and avoid a lawsuit from the Conservation Law Foundation .
Expensive , complex projects get delayed all the time , and this one will run through the state ’s most densely populated city ( Somerville ) and cost an estimated $ 954 million , 50 percent more than the state predicted just a few years ago .
Somerville and Medford residents waiting to swipe their CharlieCards and ride the Green Line must now wait even longer .
State officials disclosed Friday that completion of the project — discussed for decades , put off by a succession of administrations , and planned in earnest for the past five years — will be delayed again , until at least October 2015 .
The state ultimately agreed in May to relocate the yard , pushing it to the east edge of the Inner Belt , next to an existing 30 - acre maintenance yard that serves MBTA commuter rail trains , though the plan would be more expensive and require some eminent domain takings .
Officials said previously the maintenance yard debate would not delay the project , but when they prepared their annual report they realized they were wrong , Mullan said .
“ I think it ’s time well spent , because I think we ’ve got a better project than we had , ’’ Mullan said .
He said the state would work with the community on a short - term environmental alternative , like retrofitting local MBTA buses to use less fuel and release fewer emissions .
“ It ’s disappointing , because you want the Green Line to happen as soon as possible , ’’ said Rafael Mares , a Conservation Law Foundation staff attorney for transportation and environmental - justice projects .
“ What I think is important is if there ’s no way to avoid the delay that at least there ’s appropriate mitigation and the community has a say in that . ’’
Ellin Reisner is president of the Somerville Transportation Equity Partnership , which has spent years engaging the community and trying to hold the state ’s feet to the fire .
“ On some level I ’m not surprised , but I ’m disappointed , ’’ she said .
“ As someone who works as an advocate for this , you have to constantly be paying attention to the process to make sure it does n’t get railroaded . ’’
The state does not have the money in hand to build the project but is working on an application for the Federal Transit Administration ’s New Starts program , to win half the funds .
Governor Deval Patrick has said the state will make good on its commitment even if that application does not succeed .
Mullan said that is still the case , and the state is especially optimistic about winning federal money with changes looming for the scoring process .
US Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has said New Starts will be redesigned to value “ livability , ’’ including economic development potential and sustainability ; under the Bush administration , projects won or lost largely on a riders - per - dollar formula .
But advocates of greener transportation worry that the state has not moved fast enough to balance transit and bike projects with highway construction , and that it remains hampered by the massive debt burden from the Big Dig and political wariness over new taxes for transportation .
Now the company is having to move on to even more difficult operations , where the likelihood of making things worse increases even as the chances of success fall .
Its next ploy is to try to cut the broken pipe through which the oil is being emitted , and to lower a dome to capture most of the black sticky liquid and siphon it off .
But this is likely to increase the flow by a fifth , at least in the short term , and even if it works , will not shut it off completely .
Editor ’s note :
This is a guest post from Cath Duncan from Creative Grief Studio and Remembering For Good .
Motivation is central to creativity , productivity , and happiness .
Motivation is what causes us to act , and when we act , we create movement , growth , and change ; we feel involved , masterful , and significant ; we feel powerful through experiencing how we can change the world ; and we create more of what we love in our lives .
And all of this gives our lives purpose and happiness .
Demotivation Is Like Snow
It ’s said that Inuit have multiple words for snow because snow is so familiar to them that they can appreciate the subtle differences between different types of snow .
These additional distinctions enable Inuit to respond differently to different types of snow , depending on the challenges and opportunities that each particular type of snow is presenting them with .
Most of us have just one conception of demotivation , which means that whenever you ’re unmotivated , you ’re likely to assume that you ’re struggling with the same problem , when in fact demotivation is a category of problems , containing many variations .
When you have just one kind of demotivation , you ’ll apply the same old strategies whenever you feel unmotivated ; for many people , those strategies look like this : set goals , push harder , create accountability checks that will push you , and run your life using GTD methods and to - do lists .
These strategies are ineffective with most types of demotivation , and in some instances they can even make you more unmotivated .
At its essence , demotivation is about your not being fully committed to act , and there are many reasons why you might be in that position .
Having more ways to categorize your demotivation will help you to identify the real reasons for your unwillingness to commit to action , so that you can pick the right tools and strategies to get motivated again .
We get it : you had a lot of big plans for the year .
But when COVID - 19 hit , those long - term plans likely got thrown right out the window .
Motivation is low these days for all of us , and planning much beyond the next day or week is more difficult than ever .
Our Momentum Planner Cards have just enough structure for you to stay on task , with the flexibility you need to adapt to these changing times .
Click here to learn more about the Momentum Planner Cards .
Here are 10 types of demotivation and the strategies that will help you to get motivated again .
1 ) You ’re demotivated by fear
When you ’re afraid , even if you ’re entering territory that you ’ve chosen to move into , a part of you is determined to avoid going forward .
Fear slows you down and makes you hesitant and careful , which can be beneficial to you , but sometimes your fears are based on your imagination rather than on an accurate assessment of the risks in your reality .
If your fear is big enough , even if you ’re also excited to go forward , the part of you that wants to keep you safe can successfully prevent you from going forward into territory that ’s both desirable and safe .
How to get motivated again :
To get motivated , you need to deal with your fear .
Start by naming your fears so that they ’re out in the open .
Remember to say a gentle “ thank you ” to your fears – they ’re trying to protect you , after all .
Then question your fears : “ Why am I afraid of that happening ? ” “ What are the chances that would really happen ? ”
Some of your fears will slip away now .
Look at the fears that are left .
What are they telling you about the research you need to do , the gaps you need to fill , and the risk management strategies you need to put in place ?
Honor that wisdom by building it into your plan .
Finally , consider breaking down the changes you ’re wanting to make into smaller steps and focusing on just the next few small steps – this will calm your fears .
2 ) You ’re demotivated by setting the wrong goals
Martha Beck has a great model for understanding motivation .
She explains that we have an Essential Self and a Social Self .
Your Essential Self is the part of you that ’s spontaneous and creative and playful , the part that knows what ’s most important to you .
Your Social Self is the part of you that has been developing since the day you were born , learning the rules of the tribe and working hard to make sure that you ’re safe by making you follow the rules of the tribe .
We ’re all surrounded by so many messages that feed into our Social Selves and we ’re keen to impress our tribes .
When you feel unmotivated , it ’s because you ’re setting goals based purely on what your Social Self wants and this is pulling you away from the direction your Essential Self wants you to take .
Your Essential Self uses demotivation to slow you down and to detach you from the toxic goals you ’ve set .
How to get motivated again :
Take some time to review your goals .
Because your Essential Self is non-verbal , you can easily access your Essential Self through your body .
Notice how your body responds as you think of each of the goals you ’re trying to work on .
When your body ( and particularly your breathing ) shows signs of tightness and constriction , that ’s a pretty good indication that you ’re trying to follow toxic goals .
If you get a constricted reaction , scrap your current goals and question all your stories about what you “ should ” do with your life .
Notice what makes you smile spontaneously or lose track of time , and set goals related to that stuff instead .
3 ) You ’re demotivated by lack of clarity about what you want
When you have n’t consciously and clearly articulated what you want , your picture of your future will be vague .
We like what ’s familiar , so we resist what ’s unfamiliar and vague and we stay with and re-create what ’s familiar to us .
If you ’re not clear about what you want to create , then it makes sense that you ’ll lack motivation to act because you ’d rather stay with your current familiar reality .
How to get motivated again :
If you want to create something different from what you ’ve been experiencing , it ’s not enough to just know what you do n’t want .
You need to know what you do want , and you need to articulate a clear and specific vision of what you want to create so that you can become familiar with that new outcome and feel comfortable moving toward it .
Take some time to articulate what you want and why you want it .
4 ) You ’re demotivated by a values conflict
Your values are what ’s important to you in life .
If you have a values conflict , it means that there are two or more values that are important to you but you believe that you ca n’t satisfy all of those values in a particular situation .
This situation causes you to feel conflicted and pulled in different directions as you try to find ways to get what ’s important to you .
You might have brief spurts of motivation to work on something and then lose motivation and start working on something else , or your motivation might dry up altogether because the effort of dealing with internal conflict quickly tires you out and saps your energy .
How to get motivated again :
You need to unpack your values conflict and play mediator to get the parts of you that are advocating for different values to play on the same team again .
Start with acknowledging the internal conflict .
Grab a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle so that you have two columns .
Write about the two different directions you feel pulled in , one in each column , and summarize it with a statement of what each part wants .
Now pick one column and chunk it up : “ Why does this part want that ?
What does it hope to get as a result of having that ? ”
Keep asking the questions and writing your answers until you feel that you ’ve hit on the result that this part of you ultimately wants .
Now do the same for the other part , and notice when you get to the level where the answers in the two columns are the same .
Ultimately , all of the parts of you always want the same thing , because they ’re all you .
Now that you know what you really want , you can evaluate the strategies that each part had been advocating for and decide which strategy would work best .
Often , once you ’re clear on what you really want , you spot new strategies for getting it that you had n’t noticed before .
Sometimes by doing this exercise you ’ll find ways to satisfy all of your values , but sometimes that ’s not possible .
If you ’ve taken time to think through your values and you ’ve consciously chosen to prioritize a particular value over your other values for a while , this clarity will ease the internal conflict and your motivation will return .
5 ) You ’re demotivated by lack of autonomy
We thrive on autonomy .
We all have a decision - making center in our brains and this part of us needs to be exercised .
Studies have found that this decision - making center in the brain is under - developed in people who have depression and that if you practice using this part of the brain and making decisions , depression often clears .
In his book Drive , Daniel Pink writes about the research that shows that when it comes to doing creative work , having some autonomy to decide what we do , when we do it , how we do it , and whom we do it with is core to igniting and sustaining motivation , creativity , and productivity .
How to get motivated again : Consider how much autonomy you have in relation to the goals you ’ve been trying to pursue .
Are there areas where you feel constricted and controlled ?
Consider how you could gradually introduce more autonomy in your task , time , technique , location , and team , and then , if you ’re employed , have a discussion with your manager and ask for greater autonomy in a few specific areas of your work .
6 ) You ’re demotivated by lack of challenge
Challenge is another crucial ingredient for motivation that authors like Daniel Pink and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , author of Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience , highlight .
When it comes to dealing with challenges , there ’s a sweet spot .
Too great a challenge , and the fear becomes too great and saps our motivation ( see point 1 ) , and if the challenge is too small , we quickly get bored and struggle to stay motivated .
We ’re designed to be living , growing creatures and we need constant challenges and opportunities to master new skills .
Without challenges , our Essential Self steps in and demotivates us as a way of telling us that we ’ve departed from the path that ’s right for us .
How to get motivated again : Review your goals and the projects you ’re working on .
Are they challenging you ?
Are they going to require you to grow in order to achieve them , or are you treading water in your comfort zone , doing only the things you know you can do ?
Try tweaking your goals to make them a bit more challenging , take on projects that will require you to grow , and find a new thing or two to learn to stimulate yourself .
PRODUCTIVE FLOURISHING
7 ) You ’re demotivated by grief
At the beginning of any change , we go through a phase of wondering if we should or could hang on to the way things were and grieving what we ’ll be losing if we make significant changes .
Confusion , self - doubt , mistrust of the world around us , and feeling lost are common symptoms , and the bigger the change , the more powerful these symptoms .
Sometimes we even go through a bit of depression and social withdrawal .
Martha
Beck calls this phase the “ Death and Rebirth ” phase of change in her book Finding Your Own North Star .
With all the grieving and fearing and feeling lost that go on in this phase , it ’s normal for your motivation to dry up .
How to get motivated again :
If you ’ve just experienced a trauma or loss , or you ’re going through a major change and finding that there are days where you ’re hit hard with Death and Rebirth symptoms , do n’t try to make yourself motivated and proactive .
You ca n’t rush grieving or the undoing of your old life and ways of thinking , and you ca n’t skip the Death and Rebirth phase and go straight into Dreaming and Scheming .
You need to give yourself a lot of space for nurturing and reflection .
Look after your body with good food , rest , and exercise .
Express your grief , confusion , and fears with people who can listen lovingly .
Spend time in nature and with calm , loving people to center yourself .
Accept every feeling and thought you have – they ’re all normal and safe .
Take one day at a time and go easy on yourself .
Confusion , forgetfulness , and clumsiness are all normal in this stage .
The grieving will end when it ’s ready , and if you relax into it and express your grief , it ’ll be sooner rather than later .
8 ) You ’re demotivated by loneliness
This is an especially important one for those of us who work alone from home .
You know those days when you feel a bit cabin - feverish , you just do n’t feel like working , and you ’d rather be out having a drink with a friend or playing a game of soccer ?
Well , perhaps it ’s because we ’re designed to be social creatures and sometimes your Essential Self is just longing for some connection with other people , and so it steps in and hijacks your work motivation so that you ’ll take a break from work and go spend some time with other people and give your Essential Self what it needs .
How to get motivated again :
Take a break and go spend some time with someone you enjoy .
You may be surprised at the motivating impact this has and find yourself much more clear and productive when you return to your work .
And then look for ways that you can begin to build more networking and joint venturing into your work .
9 ) You ’re demotivated by burnout
I attract overachieving Type A’s , and as a recovering Type A myself , I know that sometimes we ’re banging on about wanting to get more done even after we ’ve exceeded the limit on what ’s sustainable .
If you ’re feeling tired all the time , you ’ve lost your energy for socializing , and the idea of taking a snooze sounds more compelling than the stuff you ’re usually interested in , then you ’ve probably pushed yourself too long and hard and you may be burned out .
Your Essential Self will always work to motivate you to move toward what you most need and away from goals , projects , and ways of working that take you away from what your Essential Self craves .
So if you ’re burned out and needing sleep , your Essential Self may even sap the motivation from the things that you ’re usually really ignited about – just to get you to meet your core needs again .
How to get motivated again : Sleep .
And then when you ’re done sleeping and the quality of your thinking has been restored , check back in with your Essential Self about what ’s most important to you , hang out here on Charlie ’s blog , and start building sustainable ways to do more of what ’s important to you .
10 ) You ’re demotivated by not knowing what to do next
Your end - goal might be nice and clear , but if you have n’t taken time to chunk it down into smaller goals , you ’ll get stuck , confused , and unmotivated when it ’s time to take action .
Some projects are small and familiar enough that they do n’t need a plan , but if you ’re often worrying that you do n’t know what to do next and you do n’t have a clear plan , then this might be the source of your demotivation .
How to get motivated again :
If you want to keep your motivation flowing steadily through all stages of your projects , take time to create clear project plans and to schedule your plans into your calendar .
Use your fears to point you to the potential risks you need to manage in your plan .
Write down all of your “ I - do n’t - know - how - to ” concerns and turn these into research questions .
The first part of any planning stage is research , and you ’ll find new research questions along the way , so realize that conducting research should be part of your action plan at every stage of your project .
Finally , ask yourself what smaller goals need to be achieved for you to achieve your end - goal , and schedule deadlines for yourself .
Goal - setting and pushing are rarely the answer
Goal - setting , planning , organizing , and accountability structures are often touted as the big solution to demotivation and the silver bullet that will get you creative and productive again , but notice that it ’s a useful strategy for dealing with only some types of demotivation .
With many other types of demotivation , goal - setting , planning , organizing , and accountability structures will only make your demotivation problem worse .
Over to you …
Have you been able to pinpoint the types of demotivation that you tend to struggle with most ?
Are you stuck in demotivation right now ?
What do you need , and which motivation strategy is going to give you what you need right now ?
Still needing some more “ umph ” ?

Aset Magomadova leaves the Calgary courthouse last week at the end of the first day of her sentencing hearing in connection with the killing of her 14 - year - old daughter , Aminat , whom she strangled with a scarf .

CALGARY — A Calgary mother wo n’t spend a day in jail for killing her teenage daughter with a head scarf — a decision that has prompted outrage .
A national victims ’ group , based in Toronto , is stunned by the suspended sentence given to Aset Magomadova by Court of Queen ’s Bench Justice Sal LoVecchio on Thursday .
“ I really strongly disagree .
It sends a massively huge message to the rest of the country and the world that her daughter ’s life was valueless , ” said Joe Wamback , co-founder and chairman of the Canadian Crime Victims Foundation .
“ Even though this girl may have been a handful and trouble , that ’s not the issue .
The issue is human life .
Sentencing is not just about the criminal , but has to speak for the victim and to denunciation . ”
In October , LoVecchio acquitted Magomadova , 40 , of second - degree murder and found her guilty of manslaughter in the death of Aminat , 14 .
He placed her on probation for three years with several conditions , including taking counselling for grief , depression and anger management .
The judge rejected an argument by Crown prosecutors Mac Vomberg and Sarah Bhola for a 12 - year prison term , instead accepting the position of defence lawyer Alain Hepner , saying a suspended sentence can still meet the demands of justice .
“ At first blush ( a suspended sentence ) may sound like a get - out - of - jail - free card .
It is not , ” said LoVecchio .
“ The court has said the act in question does not merit a period of incarceration .
What the court has done is reserved or , to use the word of the statute , suspended judgment on that point for a period of time on conditions .
If the conditions are satisfied , then the individual will not be sentenced .
If they are breached , the individual will be brought back to the court to be dealt with further . ”
Magomadova was charged after the deadly incident at their home the morning of Feb. 26 , 2007 , after Aminat refused to go to court to be sentenced for assaulting a female teacher at her school .
The devout Muslim mother claimed Aminat came at her with a knife in her sewing room , where she prayed several times a day .
She said she reacted by wrapping the scarf around her daughter ’s neck and twice told the girl to put the knife down before the teen lost consciousness .
A knife was found in the room , but the daughter ’s fingerprints were not on it .
LoVecchio , who rejected a defence of self - defence , deemed the woman did not intend to kill the teen , even though medical examiner Dr. Sam Andrews testified that death as a result of such an act would have taken at least 2 1/2 minutes .
Jennifer Koshan , an associate professor at the University of Calgary ’s faculty of law who researches family violence , said the vast majority of fatal family violence cases involve husbands killing their wives .
“ It ’s relatively unusual to see a mother killing a child , especially an older child , ” said Koshan .
“ So it ’s rare for the court to be faced with this situation .
Maybe that influenced the judge in his decision . ”
This is just disgusting .
There should be a criminal investigation of these two officers .
2 officers out of jobs in wake of repeated Tasering of woman :
Smith resigned as a result of the incident .
The other officer involved , Tim Murphy of Richland PD , was fired for using pepper spray while trying to arrest Wells .
The officer in question is Ryan Smith of the Lumpkin Police Department .
Smith was called to back up an officer from the Richland Police Department because the sheriff 's office in the county , Stewart , had no deputies to send .
" All of it 's just unreal to me .
I was scared to death , " Wells said in an interview with the AJC .
" He kept tasing me and tasing me .
My fingernails are still burned .
My leg , back and my butt had a long scar on it for days . "
The third - grade teacher had phoned for help .
But within minutes of an officer coming to her backdoor , she was screaming in pain and begging not to be shocked again with a Taser .
With each scream and cry , the officer threatened her with more shocks .
Janice Wells called the Richland Police Department when she feared a prowler was outside her clapboard house in the rural west Georgia town .
Their headline does n't mention that one of them already found a new job .
Smith resigned just as Ogle started the process to fire him , the chief said .
Smith now works for the Chattahoochee County Sheriff 's office .
" I could n’t believe it , ” Ogle said .
“ You do n’t use it [ a Taser ] for punitive reasons , to prod someone .
It was evident it was an improper use of force .
He was an excellent officer other than that incident . "
Yet his former boss , Lumpkin Police Chief Steven Ogle , was shocked when he saw the video .
Yeah , I 'm sure he was just a wonderful officer , other than this one incident where he decided to torture this woman .
Digby had more .

SANCHEZ : AS Jon Stewart will tell you , I have a little bit of experience with tasers .
I used to be a cop beat reporter about their effectiveness , how they work , how they do n't work , when they should be used .
So when someone brought this videotape to me today , I thought it disturbing .
Let me tell you what we 're talking about .
Janice Wells is a 57 - year - old school teacher in Georgia , all right ?
A couple of months ago she calls 911 .
She 's calling the police because she wants the police to come and help her because she says there may be an intruder in her house .
The officer shows up and he sees Janice with a man next to her .
he assumes that man is the bad guy .
So they start demanding that Janice tell them all this information about this man .
Janice says I do n't need to tell you any information about this man .
He has nothing to do with why I called .
Suddenly police turn on her .
They chase her around the yard and then finally catch her and they start to arrest her for obstructing justice in her own house .
During the arrest , they start pepper spraying her and call for backup .
When the next officer shows up , that 's when it gets weird .
They start tasing her repeatedly .
I 'm going to take you through this .
But first , let 's just watch it together , and then I 'll bring in Andy Hill , one of my favorite police officer experts on the other side of this .
Ready ?
Dan , let 's watch it .

I ain't did anything nothing .

You 're going to get it again .

Go ahead and get in the car and we 'll talk .

Go ahead and get in the car .

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I did n't do nothing .

We 'll talk about it when we get up to the station .

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I just called him because I wanted him -- ask John to leave .
Larry , help me .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
Where is he now ?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I asked her a question and she said I do n't want to tell you nothing .
I said you can go to jail then .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SANCHEZ : So you saw what the police did when they arrived on the scene .
I want to bring in Andy Hill now , the retired police officer with the Phoenix police department .
Andy , first of all , let me share with you some new information .
One of those officers has been suspended and the other has been fired .
I think you would agree they should probably have been suspended and fired , if not both fired at this point , right ?
ANDY HILL , RETIRED POLICE OFFICER , PHOENIX POLICE DEPARTMENT :
Not only that , but I 'm sure depending upon what the internal investigations could show , there might be cause to look into some criminal charges if she was restrained already when she was tased .
That 's a tough one .
SANCHEZ : I can't understand why it is -- and look , I know I love you guys and my brother is a police officer .
You and I have had a long relationship talking about things like this on the air .
I have other police officer friends .
But I do n't understand why it 's so hard for police department in the United States to teach their officers that these tasers are not toys .
They 're not going to be used like flashlights , that they have an effect .
And that they 're supposed to be used for compliance , to warn people that you 'll use if they stop doing something or if they do n't do something , not to start tasing someone and then start making demands of them .
That just does n't make any sense , Andy .
HILL : That 's almost like retribution .
What 's inside that taser tells you how long the duration the trigger is pulled , how many times .
It 's very helpful in investigations .
SANCHEZ : Hold on , I want to show you something .
I watched this thing with my staff a couple of times .
Watch at the beginning where the officer shows up and he starts making demands , and he 's asking her to do stuff while he 's tasing her .
And he continues doing it for , I counted eight seconds which I learned at the police academy when I spent some time there is about four seconds more than you 're supposed to do .
Let 's watch it together .
Here it is .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : No , no .
Oh !
Oh !
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SANCHEZ : You hear that .
You hear that ?
That 's the tase .
And it was going all throughout at the beginning .
And now he starts again .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
You 're going to get it again .
You 're going to get it again .
All right .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SANCHEZ : And there he goes .
HILL : If I can make a couple of comments here .
SANCHEZ : I 'm sorry , go ahead .
HILL : Number one , the first officer who was alone , he was obviously in a fight because when that second officer gets there , that first officer is holding his back .
He 's obviously tired .
He 's had some kind of thing happen .
The second officer comes out of the car with that taser in his hand ready to go .
He does n't even know the situation .
All he heard when I read what was in the paper was he could tell by the officer 's voice that he was tired , maybe had a fight .
But he came out with a taser in hand .
He was ready to use it in his hand .
And he goes over behind the car .
I do n't even know if he knew what that person looked like before he got there .
And then the way it was deployed , absolutely wrong .
SANCHEZ : The point to be made , because there 's a lot of good police officers out there and sometimes it 's not all their fault .
I hate to say this , but there are some police departments out there who are n't training these guys properly on this .
And sometimes they go out there confused not knowing how to use this for compliance .
So do us a favor , tell us what this officer did wrong , and if you could take a few moments just to explain how you 're supposed to do this .
HILL : Absolutely .
First of all , the company taser makes it clear how that 's supposed to be used .
What you cannot do is allow your people to go out there and use it other than the way they 're supposed to .
And let 's also clarify .
I do n't know if there was an internal investigation or if there was ever demonstrated that a law was broken .
Even if there had been some law in Georgia that this woman had broken , and I do n't even --
SANCHEZ : She called police !
HILL : And plus , there was something in that officer 's report that he tried to indicate there was might be a domestic violence situation .
He did n't worry about the guy , because he said he could go arrest him , but when the woman would n't tell him who he was , he arrested her .
It does n't make sense .
The Kings finally signed a player , inking former Maple Leaf and Penguin Alexei Ponikarovsky to a one - year , $ 3 million dollar deal .
The signing comes a week after the Kings missed out on dynamic forward Ilya Kovalchuk and just hours after the Kings failed to re-sign the mercurial Alexander Frolov .
The signing replaces Frolov 's production from last season , although perhaps not his talent , and provides the Kings with the mid-line playmaker they sorely needed .
â† µ
Ponikarovsky is a big boy , standing at 6 - foot - 4 , but he does not use his body like you 'd expect .
Ponikarovsky took a little longer to develop , as most larger players do , but he 's tallied at least 20 goals 4 times in the last 5 seasons * and is a solid playmaker from the corners .
Ponikarovsky is actually quite similar to Frolov ; they both use their bodies to make plays and they both have been accused of not going to the front of the net as much as they should .
Still , Ponikarovsky is probably a little more consistent and is known to be a good man to have in the locker room .
He should provide stability to one of the Kings ' middle lines .
â† µ
* In 2007 - 08 Ponikarovsky scored only 18 goals in an injury - shortened season where he played only 66 games .
â† µ
The Kings now have another veteran left winger beside Ryan Smyth , although Ponikarovsky was probably their 3rd choice .
The Kings still need a top - line winger to give Anze Kopitar some help against the other top players in the league , and it remains to be seen what Kings GM Dean Lombardi plans to do .
Ponikarovsky is a good signing in a vaccuum ; a probably 50 - point producer for $ 3 million is obviously a pretty good deal .
If it 's the only move the Kings make to improve their forward core , however , then the Kings might be in trouble come October .

Quick 'n Dirty Line Forward Projection :

Smyth - Kopitar - Williams

Ponikarovsky - Stoll - Brown

Last year , we wrote about Will Phillips , a 10 year old boy in Arkansas who was refusing to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance until gays can get married and achieve full equality .
Phillips has been tapped to serve as Grand Marshall of the Northwest Arkansas Pride Parade in Fayetteville on Saturday and the American Family Association is freaking out , sending out an action alert targeting the mayor and calling it a “ form of child abuse ” :
I am shocked to learn that the city of Fayetteville is issuing a proclamation in support of the homosexual activist group , Northwest Arkansas Pride .
It ’s offensive enough to sensibilities that they are going to parade their deviant lifestyle on the streets of the city .
It ’s even more abhorrent that the city is supporting it , knowing very well that the organizers of this event are exploiting children to push their radical sexualizing event .
I implore you to withdraw the proclamation and focus on issues that promote a healthy and safe lifestyle , rather than one that is risky and dangerous .
… AFA President Tim Wildmon says , “ It ’s shameful that adults would abuse a brain - washed child in this way .
He ’s obviously just parroting the nonsense he ’s been told by manipulative adults .
For gay activists to trot out this child and make him the poster child for promoting unnatural sexual expression is a form of child abuse . ”
So of course Fox News picked up the story and just take one guess who they quoted :
“ We believe that it goes beyond the pale for adults to exploit a 10 - year - old child for dark political purposes , ” said Bryan Fischer , the director of issue analysis at AFA .
“ He is too young to understand .
There is nothing about homosexual conduct to be proud of and much to be ashamed of . ”
The AFA , according to Fischer , has sent an “ action alert ” to its members in Arkansas , and he says they have deluged the mayor ’s and city council ’s office with e-mails “ asking him to stop this charade . ”
Though there are no plans to actively protest at the parade , Fischer said , “ as of noon Thursday our records show that the mayor and city council had received 12,300 e-mails asking them to stop the parade . ”
I ’ve often wondered what media outlet would be the first to quote Fischer in a story like this and if they ’d even bother to mention his long history of viciously anti-gay and all around crazy statements .
I guess it should come as no surprise that the answers were : Fox News , and No .
But in good news , Fayetteville ’s Mayor is refusing to bow to the AFA ’s pressure and Saturday ’s parade will go on as scheduled .

Fox loves the Islamic world so much that the TV news company is planning a 24 - hour Arabic - language news channel .
Fox is partnering with Al - Waleed bin Talal , a mid-ranking prince in the sprawling Saudi royal family and an international businessman so successful that Time nicknamed him an " Arabian Warren Buffett . "
The new channel will compete with the existing Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera networks for access to the world 's 300 million native Arabic speakers .
The United Arab Emirates National 's Ben Flanagan reports :
Prince Alwaleed had previously said his news channel would not be produced through Kingdom Holding or his media company Rotana Holding , but would instead follow the business model of [ Rupert ] Murdoch ’s Fox and Sky News channels .
The move further cements business ties between Prince Alwaleed and Mr Murdoch ’s News Corp empire , which owns Fox .
Prince Alwaleed has a 7 per cent stake in News , and in February News agreed to pay US $ 70 million ( Dh257.1 m ) for a 9.09 per cent stake in Rotana .
The latter deal , the largest Middle East investment by Mr Murdoch , included an option to increase its stake to 18.18 per cent in the 18 months after completion .
He expressed his interest in the Middle East media at the inaugural Abu Dhabi Media Summit last March .
Mr Murdoch said the creative industries in the Arab world had great potential but growth depended on governments applying a “ light hand ” to matters such as protectionism and censorship .
The media mavens at Fox News may need some time to prepare for their new Arabic - speaking audience .
Here 's an example of Fox 's past coverage of the region , which Iraqi viewers may object to :

Water found in
Apollo samples
BY EMILY BALDWIN
ASTRONOMY NOW
Posted : 22 July 2010
Traces of water have been found locked up in minerals in the rocks returned from the Moon by Apollo astronauts forty years ago .
Over the last year our view of the Moon has changed considerably – a dry and barren world has turned into a satellite rich in water , largely thanks to missions including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Chandrayaan - 1 .
While not flowing rivers or vast oceans that define the Earth , much of the Moon 's modest water reservoir is locked up in minerals in the form of hydroxyl , chemically known as OH .
Heating up lunar rocks such as apatite will release the water component , a technique that will be vital to sustain any future human base on the Moon .
Image : NASA .
In the latest study , conducted by geologists at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee , water 's signature was found in a calcium phosphate mineral called apatite .
“ Hydroxide is a close chemical relative of water , ” says George Rossman .
“ If you heat up the apatite , the hydroxyl ions will ‘ decompose ’ and come out as water . ”
The scientists used a sensitive piece of equipment called an ion microprobe to analyse mineral grains that are many times smaller than the width of a human hair , in an Apollo 14 rock sample that was collected in 1971 .
The instrument works by firing a focused beam of high energy ions at the sample that sputters away some of the atoms , which are collected and analysed in a mass spectrometer .
Looking for water in lunar apatite is not a new idea .
“ Charles B. Sclar and Jon F. Bauer , geoscientists at Lehigh University , first noted that something was missing from the results of chemical analyses of apatite in 1975 , ” says Jeremy Boyce .
“ Now , 35 years later , we have quantitative measurements – and it turns out , they were right .
The missing piece was OH .
The fact that we were able to quantitatively measure significant amounts of water in a lunar mineral is truly surprising . ”
The rock studied by Caltech and University of Tennessee geologists was collected during the Apollo 14 mission .
Image : NASA .
Furthermore , the results showed that in terms of its hydrogen , sulphur and chlorine contents , the lunar apatite in this particular rock is indistinguishable from apatites produced by Earth 's volcanic activity .
Carbon dioxide and sulphur gases are generally thought to have dominated many of the Moon 's volcanic eruptions , but the discovery of hydroxyl in the Moon 's volcanic rocks adds support to the idea that water has also played a role in fueling the eruptions .
Just how much water is still an open question , though .
The amount of water found in the study sample is just 0.16 percent by weight , and apatite is not abundant , forming under circumstances that tend to concentrate hydrogen to much higher levels than are present in its host rocks or the Moon as a whole .
The results are still significant though , filling in vital information about the Moon 's evolutionary history .
“ These findings tell us that the geological processes on the Moon are capable of creating at least one hydrous mineral , ” says John Eiler , also of Caltech .
“ Recent spectroscopic observations of the Moon showed that hydrogen is present on its surface , maybe even as water ice .
But that could be a thin veneer , possibly hydrogen brought to the Moon ’s surface by comets or solar wind .
Our findings show that hydrogen is also part of the rock record of the Moon , and has been since early in its history . ”

OVER - THE -TOP WEDDING
SARAH JESSICA PARKER , KRISTIN DAVIS , CYNTHIA NIXON , and KIM CATTRALL attend the wedding of WILLIE GARSON and MARIO CANTONE .
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
Wow , this wedding could only be gayer if the groomsmen were all fisting each other .
I will ruminate on this introspectively and eventually use it to comment on how difficult it is to find a partner in New York .
KRISTIN DAVIS
Well I think it 's nice !

CYNTHIA NIXON
I 'M TOO BUSY LAWYERING TO ENJOY THIS WEDDING !
LAWYERING THE LAW IS A LOT OF WORK !

KIM CATTRALL
If I do n't gargle some balls in the next ten seconds I 'm going to shove this wine bottle in my ass .
Suddenly , LIZA MINNELLI appears !
KIM CATTRALL
Holy shit , Liza Minnelli !
What 's she doing here , besides confusing the audience members who have no idea who she is ?
CYNTHIA NIXON
When a wedding is this gay , Liza Minnelli just materializes , ha ha !
KRISTIN DAVIS
I know you delivered that line sarcastically , but that appears to be the actual explanation .
LIZA MINNELLI
Someone told me that a show that 's been off the air for over 4 years was being made into a movie , so I showed up .
I 'm guessing that the total lack of funny jokes means that this is n't the Arrested Development movie after all ?
LIZA officiates the wedding , blissfully ending the scene but unfortunately bringing on the next one .
LIZA MINNELLI
Alright , do you take the broom ?
Broom ?
Is that a combination of bride and groom ?
Seriously , this shit passes for jokes over here ?
WILLIE GARSON
No , the joke is that critically acclaimed singer and actress Liza Minnelli is going to sing " All the Single Ladies " for four dignity - shredding minutes .
KANYE WEST

My husband likes watching TV in our home , which makes it difficult for me to go out clubbing and pretend I 'm not forty - five years old .
CYNTHIA NIXON

SARAH JESSICA PARKER'S HOME
CHRIS NOTH comes home and sits on his couch to watch shows that are vastly superior to SEX AND THE CITY .
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
I 'm super pissed that you bought me a high - definition television and installed it in our bedroom .
We should n't need TV because it should be enough for us to have delightful conversations like this one .
MR. NOTH
Are you seriously complaining that I bought you an expensive TV ?
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
Furthermore , I noticed you have brought home dinner .
This offends me because I want to eat the same meal , but outside of our home and wearing a new dress that I bought .
Also , get your feet off the couch .
I do n't even want you sitting on it , let alone relaxing on it .
MR. NOTH
Are you really supposed to be the sympathetic protagonist ?
The kind of decadence that defines your character may have been tolerable in the late nineties , but we 're in a recession now !

KRISTIN DAVIS
I have to get out of this house !
I somehow managed to just ruin a vintage , one - of - a - kind designer dress I was wearing while making cupcakes in the kitchen with my baby while my toddler was finger - painting .
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
Oh , you poor thing !
That 's right , nobody in this movie is going to tell you what a fuckup you are .
Pretty sure it 's because the writers do n't know .
Sounds like we should go with Kim to Abu Dhabi !
SARAH returns home to talk to CHRIS .
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
Boy was I glad to be away from you for two days .
So much for " can't - live - without - each - other love , " eh ?
MR. NOTH
Hey , I was thinking , what if I spend two days a week at your old apartment ?
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
( incensed )
What ?
Is this because I 'm a nag ?!
MR. NOTH
Your equine resemblance has nothing to do with this !
I just figured you could use a couple days a week wearing ridiculous - looking outfits with your girlfriends !
SARAH JESSICA PARKER
Listen , I know I just spent two days away , but I was planning on doing that every couple months or so !
You 're talking about increasing the frequency slightly !
That 's insane !
We 're married , I do n't want to do things without you any more !
( pause )
By the way , I 'm going to Abu Dhabi for a week .
Without you .

Welcome to Abi Dhabi !
Your rooms are upstairs , you will find they include a complementary small gray kitten .
Our country has been getting one in the mail about every week for 32 years .
KRISTIN DAVIS
Oh , this is so lovely , but I 'm still obsessing over my husband oogling the nanny 's tits so I can't even enjoy it !

Obama administration warns that the most environmentally disastrous spill in US history may continue until August
An uncontrollable fountain of oil could gush into the Gulf of Mexico until August , the Obama administration warned today , as BP conceded it was moving to a containment strategy after failing to plug the well at the centre of the most environmentally disastrous spill in US history .
As anger and despair grew in the coastal communities of Louisiana , BP began preparations to cut a leaking drill pipe on the ocean floor and attach a containment cap intended to capture at least some of the 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of crude spewing from its Macondo well every day .
The oil company , which has come under withering attack for its handling of the crisis , acknowledged there was " no certainty " of success in the effort , which will take four to seven days and which some experts say could make the leak worse .
A White House adviser said the US government was " prepared for the worst " after efforts to halt the leak by pumping mud , golf balls , tyres and other debris into the well were halted without success yesterday .
Carol Browner , the administration 's energy czar , said there may be no solution until two relief wells being drilled into the oilfield by BP are complete later in summer .
" There could be oil coming up till August when the relief wells are done , " she said .
" This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country . "
At the weekend , as the failure of BP 's latest attempt became clear , President Barack Obama vented his frustration at the situation .
" It is as enraging as it is heartbreaking , and we will not relent until this leak is contained , until the waters and shores are cleaned up , and until the people unjustly victimised by this manmade disaster are made whole , " Obama said in a statement .
Another two months of leakage from the site of BP 's sunken Deepwater Horizon oil rig would mean that the spill , which already eclipses the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , would cause even more damage to marshland wildlife habitats and to the livelihood of shrimpers , fishermen and tourism workers in southern states .
Oil already stretches over a distance of 130 miles by 70 miles .
Browner said : " We are prepared for the worst .
We have been prepared from the beginning . "
As the crisis moved to its fifth week , both BP and Obama faced attacks for failing to come up with a solution .
Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines parish , Louisiana , called for immediate funding to build a network of sand barriers to protect the coastline .
" It 's time for BP to step up to the plate – do n't wait for the president , " said Nungesser .
" Every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh , a piece of Louisiana is gone forever . "
Oil has been leaking from a broken drilling pipe on the ocean floor since the rig caught fire and sank on 20 April , killing 11 offshore workers .
At the weekend , BP abandoned a " top kill " operation to fix the leak after engineers were unable to stem the pressure of oil with thousands of tonnes of drilling mud .
" We 're disappointed that oil is going to flow for a while and we 're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches , " BP 's managing director , Bob Dudley , told CNN .
" We 're moving to a containment operation . "
BP 's new plan involves using underwater robots and a diamond wire - cutter to create a clean cut through the leaking pipe , then attach a " riser " allowing oil to be pumped to the ocean surface and collected by a ship .
Experts say it will be difficult to create a watertight seal on a high - pressure gushing pipe at a depth of 1,500 metres ( 5,000ft ) .
Former US secretary of state Colin Powell joined calls for the military to take command of the operation from BP .
Powell said the problem was beyond the capacity of BP to solve and the government should bring in " decisive force " .
He said : " The military brings organisation , it brings control , it brings assets . "
The olm , a foot - long salamander nicknamed " the human fish " because of its fleshy skin and tubular shape , is certainly a strange - looking animal .
But beneath the surface , they 're even weirder :
Olms can live for 100 years , far longer than any other amphibian .
Scientists have no idea why .
" This species raises questions regarding aging processes , " write researchers led by biologist Yann Voituron of France 's Université Claude Bernard in a July 21 Biology Letters study .
The olms studied by Voituron 's team are part of a population established 48 years ago to help conserve the rare amphibian , which is found in caves in Croatia and Slovenia .
When the project began , the olms were about 10 years old , making them nearly 60 now .
Yet they " do not show any time of senescence , " write the researchers , who estimate the olm 's average lifespan to be 69 years , with an upper limit at the century mark .
Living in a stable environment without predators has made it possible for olms to have long lives , but the mechanisms underlying their longevity are unknown .
In general , long life correlates with a large body size , but the half - pound salamanders are pipsqueaks compared to the next - longest - lived amphibian , the 50 - pound Japanese salamander , which clocks in with a 55 - year lifespan .
Voituron 's team thought olms might have extremely slow metabolisms , but they proved metabolically similar to other amphibians , including African bullfrogs and European toads that live for about 40 years .
The researchers also wondered if olms might have special tricks for cleaning up oxygen - free radicals , the DNA - damaging molecules produced when cellular mitochondria turn nutrients into energy .
Free-radical accumulation is linked to aging , but the olm 's antioxidant activity is nothing special .
" The olm presents a paradox , " wrote the researchers .
" Neither its basal metabolic rate nor its antioxidant activity , the two most cited mechanisms that should be involved in enhancing lifespan , differ from species with a more reduced lifespan . "
Voituron is now testing whether the olm might have extra-efficient mitochondria that emit fewer free radicals to begin with .
" If you manage to produce more energy with less free - radical production , then you can avoid aging and increase lifespan , " he said .

The debt relief comes just days after Congo marked its independence
A debt relief programme worth $ 12.3 bn ( £ 8.1bn ) has been agreed for the Democratic Republic of Congo , it has been announced .
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said the country had made good efforts to reform its economy and governance in recent years .
The news comes in the same week as the country marks the 50th anniversary of its independence .
DR Congo currently pays around $ 300 m ( £ 198 m ) every year in debt repayments .
The African country has been hard hit by violence and bad governance .
An estimated 5 m people died in what was dubbed " Africa 's world war " between 1998 and 2003 , and areas of the country remain in conflict .
Despite having a multitude of valuable minerals , most of its citizens are poor .
Meanwhile , the United Nations mission in the country has marked the beginning of its fresh mandate by officially changing its name .
The Secretary General of the UN , Ban Ki-moon , said the main focus of the UN Stabilisation Mission in the DRC , Monusco , would be to consolidate peace .
The mission , so far known as Monuc , has been in the country since 1999 .
Its new mandate expires at the end of June next year .
Concerns remain
The country itself is among the group known by the IMF and World Bank as the Highly Indebted Poor Countries .
The debt relief plan comes under their initiative to help these countries escape their debts in return for economic and government reforms .
The new debt relief could see as much as 90 % of DR Congo 's external debt erased , the BBC's Thomas Fessy reports from Kinshasa .
But the deal was opposed by representatives from Canada and Switzerland , who voiced concerns about governance reform .
Canada had blocked the debt relief package earlier in the week amid a dispute between a Canadian mining firm and the government of President Joseph Kabila .
The government closed down a cobalt mining project run by the company First Quantum in September .
But on Thursday the international finance organisations voted the measures through , with Canada and Switzerland abstaining .

Obama Lauds Jobs Created By Census
President Obama on fifth consecutive month of job growth : " This report is a sign our economy is getting stronger by the day . "
Of the 431,000 jobs created in May , 411,000 were census workers .
The Pentagon 's been trying to get ahead of the curve on neuroscience for years , toying with ideas like mind - reading whether people are lying and performance - degrading drugs for enemy combatants .
Now , it 's launching a major effort to harness neuroscience in a way that might better prepare soldiers for the mental rigors of modern warfare .
In a series of small business solicitations released last week , the Office of the Secretary of Defense outlined plans for a new " Cognitive Readiness Technology " program with the aim of " making our warfighters as cognitively strong as they are physically strong . "
Neuroscience is at the locus of the program .
Before they can super - charge cognition , Pentagon scientists need to understand exactly how it works .
So they 're launching " Neuromorphic Models of Human Social Cultural Behavior " ( HSCB ) to accurately model human cognition , including how we perceive , learn and retain information .
HSCB models already exist , and are used by troops and decision - makers to predict the outcome of a choices during a mission .
But the models " are only as good as the fidelity of the human behavior representations ( HBR ) that form them . "
Right now , those representations are based entirely on empirical observation , which the military wants to swap out for a model that can tap into " the functions of the brain that give rise to actual human cognition . "
It 's not the first time the Pentagon has tried to map the human mind .
Last year , research agency Darpa requested proposals for systems that would synchronize neural brain waves to optimize the mind 's storage capacity and memory recall .
The agency has also tried to create synthetic versions of living brains , complete with " neuroscience - inspired architecture . "
The military wants cognitive mapping to help assess troop readiness in a war - zone .
Their small - business solicitations include a request for embeddable body sensors that could automatically determine mental preparedness , which can be influenced by factors like fatigue , cognitive overload or stress , based on physiological and neural data .
The sensors would do more than just analyze the cognitive status of their wearer – they'd be combined with the data from other team members , to instantly identify just how performance - ready a given unit actually is .
But no matter how cognitively capable troops become , they 'll still rely on computers to handle much of their workload .
Humans , the solicitation notes , " are quick to arrive at initial decisions , " but computers can more quickly calculate pros and cons of different tactics .
That 's why the military also wants neuroscience to " bridge the human - machine systems gap " and turn troops and computers into collaborative units .
Their " neuro - cognitive control of human machine systems , " would tap into the neural signals that indicate desired actions , then transmit them to a computer to determine the optimal approach and carry it out .
And a training program that emphasizes brawny brains over bodies reflects a trend across Pentagon departments :
Just last month , the Army announced a redesign of their physical - fitness program to accommodate troops spending more time behind computer screens than they do on their feet .

Israel defends murderous assault on Gaza aid flotilla
By Jean Shaoul
4 June 2010
The bodies of the eight Turkish citizens and one US citizen of Turkish origin killed in the Israeli attack on a Gaza aid ship were returned to Istanbul Thursday , provoking tens of thousands to pour into the street behind their coffins in an angry and emotional demonstration .
The Israeli government remains belligerent in the face of worldwide outrage at its acts of piracy and murder of at least nine unarmed passengers aboard the international flotilla taking much needed aid to Gaza .
The identification of one of the victims as Furkan Dogan , a 19 - year - old high school student born in the United States , has failed to shift Washington ’s defence of Israel ’s actions .
Reports have indicated that Dogan died after being shot in the head four times , and once in the chest .
The government of Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has threatened a fresh confrontation with the Irish - registered vessel , the Rachel Corrie , due to dock in Gaza at the weekend .
On board are some 11 people , including Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire , Denis Halliday , an Irish former senior United Nations diplomat , and seven civilians from Ireland and Malaysia .
The ship is carrying medical equipment , wheelchairs , school supplies and cement , a material Israel refuses to allow into Gaza .
A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Force threatened ominously , “ We will also be ready for the Rachel Corrie ” .
In a televised address on Wednesday night , Netanyahu defended Monday ’s murderous assault on the Mavi Marmara , claiming — without a shred of evidence — that it was smuggling arms for Hamas and Iran .
He insisted that the aim of the flotilla was to break the blockade of Gaza , not to bring aid , and that if the blockade ended , ships would bring in thousands of missiles from Iran to be aimed at Israel and beyond , creating an Iranian port on the Mediterranean .
He added , “ Israel will continue to maintain its right to defend itself .
Therefore , we will stand firm on our policy of a naval blockade and of inspecting incoming ships ” .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak also defended the commando assault , repeating the lie that that it was an act of self - defence .
“ We need to always remember that we are n’t North America or Western Europe ; we live in the Middle East , in a place where there is no mercy for the weak ” , he said .
Israel ’s statements have been endlessly parroted in the media .
Yet not one of these claims about the flotilla can be substantiated .
Not a single weapon was found on board the ships , which had been checked by the authorities in Greece and Turkey .
Indeed , the Israeli authorities have agreed to pass on the aid cargo — with the substantial exception of cement and metal products — to Gaza .
Numerous activists aboard the Mavi Marmara have testified that Israeli commandos opened fire before boarding the ship .
British activist Sarah Colbourne told the BBC , “ I could n’t even count the amount of ships that were in the water .
It was literally bristling with ships , helicopters and gunfire .
It was horrific , absolutely horrific ” .
According to Haneen Zoubi , an Israeli Arab legislator and passenger on board the Mavi Marmara , Israeli naval vessels had surrounded the ship and fired on it a few minutes before commandos abseiled from a helicopter , forcing passengers off the deck .
She said there had been no provocations or resistance by the passengers , who were all unarmed , and that two of the passengers had gunshot wounds to the head , which suggested executions .
Al - Jazeera producer Jamal Eshayyal said that Israeli commandos began by firing rubber - coated metal bullets , teargas and sound grenades at the passengers , but within five minutes opened up with live ammunition .
“ There was definitely live fire from the air and from the sea as well ” , he said .
Eshayyal added the troops refused passengers ’ pleas that they take away the wounded , and as a result they bled to death on the deck .
Tel Aviv has rejected calls to lift the blockade that has subjected Gaza ’s inhabitants to wretched poverty .
Instead there is evidence that it is stepping up its repression , with reports of Israeli air strikes on the tiny strip of territory on Tuesday , killing at least three people .
Washington had been in touch with Israel over the flotilla prior to Monday ’s raid , the Washington Post reported Thursday .
It quoted State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley as saying that the administration had “ communicated with Israel through multiple channels many times regarding the flotilla ” .
Crowley said that “ We emphasized caution and restraint given the anticipated presence of civilians , including American citizens ” .
Nonetheless , with the Israeli government having acted with unrestrained violence and an American citizen dead , US President Barack Obama has refused to condemn Israel ’s actions or even acknowledge that they constituted an act of piracy and a war crime .
Having succeeded in stripping a UN Security Council resolution of any criticism of Israel , Washington is insisting that it is up to the Israeli state to conduct its own supposed “ inquiry ” into Monday ’s raid , perhaps with a US observer to assist in the whitewash .
The Washington Post reported that “ Israeli ambassador Michael Oren and National Security Adviser Uzi Arad spent four hours in meetings at the White House on Tuesday , focused on how to contain the diplomatic fallout from the raid , which has endangered America ’s push for sanctions against Iran and peace efforts in the Middle East ” .
This tying of the attack on the Mavi Marmara to the US strategy against Iran and in the region generally suggests that there are deeper motives behind this violent episode than merely a brutal and arrogant government having seemingly lost its head in the face of what clearly represented no threat to Israeli security .
It suggests that Tel Aviv deliberately staged the wanton killings last Monday to advance unstated geostrategic aims .
These may include the issuance of a warning to Turkey that it is not immune to the military aggression that Israel has visited upon every other neighbouring country .
Under conditions in which the Turkish government is playing an increasingly assertive role in the region , including with the recent Turkish - Brazilian effort at brokering a nuclear power deal with Iran , Israel has definite reasons to provoke a confrontation aimed at radicalizing the situation in Turkey and destabilizing the alliance between Ankara and Washington .
Whatever the precise calculations of the strategists of the Zionist state , this is clearly a reckless policy that holds the threat of drawing the entire region into a catastrophic war .
Within Israel , when the news broke about the military attack on the flotilla , several thousand people protested in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem .
Their banners read , “ End the siege on Gaza ” , “ Security is not built on the bodies of demonstrators ” , “ War criminals to trial ” and “ Stop the army , not the flotilla ” .
Students , including Arab Student Unions , in Haifa , Jerusalem , Beer Sheva and Tel Aviv , demonstrated .
Some activists attempted unsuccessfully to enter the port of Ashdod where the flotilla boats and captive passengers had been taken .
A protest vigil has been called for Friday evening in Jerusalem .
Angry demonstrations broke out in numerous Arab towns and villages inside Israel .
The Arab High Monitoring Committee called a general strike and demonstrations and rallies of Israeli Arabs in protest at the massacre and to appeal against the detention of its representatives on the aid convoy .
Why bring god into this , even in a superficial manner ?
Why can't the beauty and majesty of nature be appreciated without relating it to superstitious beliefs ?
The fact that physics allow for such an amazing event is mind - blowing and awe - inspiring , and the beauty and truth of such an epic natural phenomenon should n't be sullied by mystical , nonsensical headlines .
Image caption Shirley Williams with the skeleton of the Neolithic woman nicknamed Blodwen
The skeleton of a woman who lived 5,500 years ago has gone on display in her home town , more than a century after she was discovered .
Blodwen is the nickname given to a Neolithic skeleton found on Little Orme in Llandudno , Conwy county , in 1891 .
Until now , the remains have been housed at a museum in Bacup , Lancashire .
The exhibition forms part of a three - month tomb builders ' display at Llandudno Museum .
It also celebrates the Council for British Archaeology 's national festival in the last two weeks of July .
The skeleton was discovered in a fissure by an engineer excavating quarry works , who then donated her to the museum in his home town of Bacup .
Carbon dating tests carried out at Oxford University have revealed that Blodwen died around 3510 BC , aged somewhere between her late fifties and early sixties .
Image caption
The skeleton was found in a deep fissure on the Little Orme , Llandudno
Orthopaedic examinations show that she was about 5 ft ( 1.52 m ) , powerfully built , and her bone structure suggests she was accustomed to carrying heavy loads , both on her head and in her arms .
There are signs , however , that this lifestyle took its toll on Blodwen , with clear evidence of severe arthritis in her neck and knees .
At the time of her death she was also suffering from secondary cancer , although it is not obvious whether it was this which killed her .
Pig bones dating from the same period found close to Blodwen 's skeleton would seem to suggest that she came from a farming background .
' Pastoral life '
Shirley Williams , Museum Education Officer for Llandudno Museum , organised the exhibition to form part of the Festival of British Archaeology , including getting the Bacup Natural History Society to agree to the loan of Blodwen .
She , said : " She was found in a deep fissure on the Little Orme , and way down below her were the bones of ancient animals - hyena , rhinoceros , bear .
Image caption " Blodwen " was discovered on the Little Orme in 1891 At 60 or so , she would almost certainly have been an elder of her community , and someone who would have been looked up to a great deal Adele Thackray , Cadw
" She was found midway and above her there was a bronze age spear head but the radio carbon testing found she was actually older than the spear head . "
Ms Williams said it would be " great " if she could stay in Llandudno , but said Bacup was very interested in keeping Blodwen .
Adele Thackray , the field monument warden for north west Wales for Cadw , the Welsh heritage body , said : " During the Neolithic period we start to see a cross - over from a semi-nomadic hunter - gathering society to a more settled , pastoral way of life .
" The pig bones found with Blodwen seem to suggest that she was part of this new farming society , and that impression is backed up by isotope tests on her bones which show that she ate more meat and cultivated crops than fish and wild plants . "
She added that the manner of Blodwen 's burial pointed towards " a more settled society , fixed around a locality " .
" Her extraordinary age for the time could also have a lot to do with her memorial - at 60 or so , she would almost certainly have been an elder of her community , and someone who would have been looked up to a great deal . "
She also has a presence on both Facebook and Twitter , as Blodwen Chardon , named after the Chardon Trust , which runs the museum .

On the art front , this comic makes use of a few techniques I 've been wanting to play with .
One , is I colored the line art .
The lines that make up the figures are n't black like normal ... they 're a darker shade of the color that they encompass .
It 's kind of that Disney look .
Another is I wanted to start making the " A Zombie 's Survival Guide " comics look more like they 're printed than the other comics .
So , I 've used the texture above the art instead of just the background and I added a halftone pattern to simulate the old comic look .
The dotting of the halftone is okay , but it 's something I want to work on further in later comics .
“ Many more people are living paycheck to paycheck compared to last year , " says Richard Castellini , chief marketing officer at CareerBuilder.com .
" What you ’re seeing is that the problem is moving into higher income levels . ”
Thirty percent of workers with salaries of $ 100,000 or more said they are living paycheck to paycheck , up from 21 percent last year , according to the survey of 4,400 workers nationwide .
Overall , 61 percent said they always or usually live paycheck to paycheck , up from 49 percent in 2008 and 43 percent in 2007 .
“ Companies have reduced salaries , and people are used to creating a lifestyle with what they were making a year ago or so , " says Castellini .
To cope , Americans have been cutting back on how much they save .
Some 21 percent of all respondents said they have reduced their 401 ( k ) contributions or personal savings in the last six months in order to get by , while 23 percent of the $ 100,000 - and - over group said they had done so .
While some Americans have cut back on what they set aside , others have stopped saving all together .
Thirty - six percent said they do n't contribute anything to retirement savings , like a 401 ( k ) or a IRA .
As for short - term savings , 33 percent of those surveyed reported that they do n’t put any money aside each month , up from 25 percent in 2008 .

Editor 's Note :
The Chinese horn , or vuvuzela , buzzed throughout the World Cup , which ended a week ago , bringing resounding success to Chinese manufacturers and showing the overwhelming ' Made in China ' power to the world .
For the past decade and more , China has been the manufacturing workshop of the world .
But rising labor costs may cast a shadow on the future of the ' Made in China ' strategy .

Foreign investors considering relocating production
Strikes at Honda have also aroused concerns among foreign investors about labor unrest in China .
Two large US companies , Ann Taylor Stores , the women 's clothing retailer , and Coach , the luxury handbag maker , are poised to relocate production to countries , where labor rates are cheaper .
Mike Devine , chief financial officer of New York - headquartered Coach , which makes luxury hand bags , said at a conference recently a move was in the pipeline .
" We are looking to move production into lower - cost geographies , most notably Vietnam and India , " he said .
Michael Nicholson , chief financial officer of Anne Taylor Stores , also told the Wall Street Journal recently the company was assessing the quality of production sites in other countries .
A recent survey by EEF , Britain 's leading manufacturing association , said one in seven of its members were looking at shifting production back to the UK , fed up with problems in countries such as China .
" Getting goods of the right quality , issues such as time to market and rising fuel costs have been driving this trend , " said Lee Hopley , EEF 's chief economist .

Rising labor costs trigger industrial relocation
China has seen more and more manufacturing companies moving their plants to or setting new plants in the country 's interior from coastal provinces as factory owners try to cut costs .
Higher labor and realty prices made China 's traditional manufacturing bases , like the mainland 's top exporting province of Guangdong , less advantaged than before .
However , inland provinces and cities that offered improved transportation capacities and preferential policies shine as new investment destinations .
As this changes , a new chapter is being written in the inspiring story of economic development in Asia .
Starting with Japan , country after country grew rich by following the same playbook : step on to the lowest and most labor - intensive rung of industrialization and gradually move up the value chain as you build up skills and capital , letting poorer countries take on the tasks you shed .
This is how the " Asian tigers " copied Japan , and how successive generations – including China itself – followed .
The current relocations are no less momentous for happening within a single country .

Counting the cost of rising wages in Chinese industry
Labor cost rises as economy develops
No one can deny that increasing wage rates in China is not a significant issue .
The average annual manufacturing wage in Guangdong , China 's industrial heartland , increased by 144.2 percent from 1998 to 2008 , according to EIU figures .
The rises were even greater in the bordering autonomous region of Guangxi Zhuang , and Hunan and Guizhou provinces , all within the Pearl River Delta basin .
Manufacturing wages in Hunan increased by 263.2 percent , while the rises in Guizhou at 258.8 percent and Guangxi at 244.2 percent were not far behind .
The picture in the rest of the country is very little different .
Wage rates have soared in the Yangtze River Delta too .
The annual manufacturing wage in Shanghai in 2008 was the highest in the country at 42,311 yuan , increasing by 226.8 percent over the 10 - year period .
There was a similar story in the neighboring Yangtze provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu , where wages rates rose by 186.2 percent and 247.2 percent , respectively .
Those companies hoping to get a cheaper deal on labor costs in the more western provinces such as Sichuan would also find it difficult .
The average annual manufacturing labor rate there of 22,046 yuan is only slightly lower than in Guangdong itself .

Suicides and strikes force pay hikes
Foxconn , which makes iPhones and iPads for Apple at its factory in Shenzhen , increased labor rates by 70 percent recently after a spate of suicides among workers .
Strikes at Honda have also aroused concerns among foreign investors about labor unrest in China .
Manufacturing wages across China have increased by 14 per cent over the past year ( see inside cover story ) , making the prospect of producing goods in nearby Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam or in Bangladesh , Sri Lanka and even Africa seem a viable alternative .

Workers rest during a strike at a Atsumitec Co plant in Foshan , southern China 's Guangdong province July 16 , 2010 .
A strike has broken out on Monday in the city of Foshan at Atsumitec Co , which supplies parts for Japan 's Honda Motor , the latest in a string of stoppages by Chinese workers demanding a bigger piece of the country 's economic wealth .
New generation of workers has higher aspirations
" Strikes happen all the time .
The current generation of workers have higher aspirations than perhaps their parents had , " he said .
Thun also believes current labor cost pressures could be a catalyst for change in China .
" One of the problems that China historically has faced is that it has never been pushed into innovation - based activities because of this excess supply of labor , " he said .
" Pushing manufacturing into high value - added activity is very much what the government wants .
This kind of cost pressure stimulates upgrading . "

China reaches so - called " Lewis Turning Point "
China had reached the so - called " Lewis Turning Point " ( named after the British economist Arthur Lewis ) at which an economy reaches a point in its development when it exhausts its supply of rural migrant workers , thus putting pressure on wages .
" Another explanation is that we are seeing the effects of the stimulus package which has created jobs in infrastructure development in western and central China , reducing the pool of labor for manufacturing .
It is not likely to be one or the other but a combination of both , " he said .

Analysts : Manufacturing in China 'has a future '
Alexander van Kemenade , an analyst with the China Regional Forecasting Service for the Economist Intelligence Unit .
No dramatic mass exodus of production to cheaper countries predicted
Manufacturing will remain a major part of the Chinese economy for at least the next 100 years despite strikes and increased labor costs , according to a leading economics research body .
Manufacturing currently makes up around 47 percent of China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) , compared with 23 percent in the United States .
Alexander van Kemenade , an analyst with the China Regional Forecasting Service for the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) , said speculation of a mass exodus of manufacturers to cheaper locations such as Vietnam and Bangladesh was alarmist .
" I would say it was very overblown .
I would give it 100 years maybe before China has the same level of manufacturing as the United States , " he said .
Van Kemenade said China still had a lot of strengths as a manufacturing heartland and any move away to other countries in Southeast Asia would happen only gradually .

China 's manufacturing sector more resilient
Jim Pinto , an expert in automation based in San Diego , California , who predicts future trends in manufacturing , said China 's manufacturing sector was likely to prove more resilient than many realize .
" Labor is not the big element to manufacturing costs many people think .
A lot of manufacturing is relatively automated .
What distinguishes China is the low margins its companies can survive on , " he said .
" China can make an iPhone for $ 200 and sell it to Apple for $ 220 , whereas a European maker , for example , would sell it for $ 360 .
The availability of cheap loans and tax holidays means it can survive on these lower margins . "
Pinto , the manufacturing futurologist , said China was not about to lose its crown as the world 's workshop overnight .
" China has really learnt how to ramp up manufacturing .
It can provide quantity and quality at speed and this gives it real advantages over many other countries .
It is not going to lose that any time soon , " he said .

China 's manufacturers at crossroads
Dr Stefan Halper , a senior research fellow at Magdalene College , Cambridge , and author of the recent book ' Beijing Consensus ' about China 's future economic outlook , said recent events put China 's manufacturers at some form of crossroads .
" China is desperately trying to hang on to its export market .
It really does n't want to give up its advantages which it has carved out of granite , " he said .
He said attempts to cling on to its manufacturing prowess by making some of its goods offshore in Southeast Asia and then re-exporting them from China carried risks .
" They are going to find themselves in the same situation as American manufacturers , which will add a new interesting dimension to the globalization process .
They will not win friends in the countries they site their new factories if they also export the worst conditions of China factories , " he added .

Companies : China remains favorite manufacturing destination
Big wheels get ready for the fast lane despite labor bumps
China will retain its competitive edge and remain a favorite manufacturing destination for global automakers , but the recent labor unrests may increase costs for companies , industry sources and analysts said on Tuesday .
Kevin Wale , president and chief executive of General Motors China told China Daily that the recent labor disputes will not impact the company 's investment appetite in China .
" It 's common .
Labor issues occur everywhere , but China 's huge market potential is more important , " said Wale .
Foreign carmakers ' success in China have been the vital cogs for their strong global performance , and hence no company can avoid its presence here , said Xu Changming , research director of the China State Information Center .

Scandal - hit Foxconn sets sights inland
Inland cities are in fierce competition to be part of Foxconn Technology Group 's huge repositioning plans , which were announced shortly after a series of suicides at the company 's South China plants .
Zhengzhou in Henan province , Wuhan in Hubei , Chengdu in Sichuan and Langfang in Hebei are all listed as possible locations by the world 's largest contract electronics maker , whose operations are currently centered in Shenzhen , an industrial hub in Guangdong province .
Although a final agreement is yet to be reached between the Zhengzhou government and Foxconn , recruitment has already started in this populous province in Central China .
A company document acquired by China Daily shows that the Taiwan - headquartered firm , whose clients include Apple and Sony , will hire 100,000 workers from 18 cities by Sept 20 .
As of June , about 38,000 people had already joined .
Cheap labor and large - scale production orders are key to ensuring huge revenue for factories , meaning that any change in wage levels , no matter how slight , will have a major impact on Foxconn 's balance sheets .

Coastal regions manufacture excellence , low - tech manufacturing moves inland
What the Chinese government would like to happen over the medium term would be for the coastal regions to become centers of manufacturing excellence while low - tech manufacturing moves inland .
If some Chinese or foreign companies decide to switch manufacturing to Southeast Asian countries , the economic damage need not be that great .
During this process , however , China still needs to retain a sizeable labor - intensive manufacturing sector because its unusually large population is always hungry for jobs .
Thun added China could not get into a game of chasing ever lower labor costs because this would be ultimately self - defeating .
" The only way labor costs are going to be kept low is if development does n't succeed .
Development inevitably is going to raise your costs , " said Alistair Thornton , an analyst with IHS Global Insight .
" It is nonetheless a dilemma for the government .
From an employment perspective they still need low - end manufacturing but , on the other hand , the fact that labor costs are rising is to some extent a sign of success . "

The most controversial elements of Arizona 's immigration law have been blocked by a federal judge .
Major provisions , such as one requiring authorities to check the immigration status of individuals while enforcing other laws , will not go into effect .
U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton also barred the state from requiring immigrants to carry their papers at all times .
While this is n't the last say on the Arizona law , it 's a major victory for the bill 's opponents .
Here 's what observers are looking at now and anticipating for the future :
Show 's the Government 's Case Is Strong , says attorney David W. Leopold , who has previously argued against the Arizona law : " I think it is also important to point out that this is a preliminary injunction .
Judges rarely do that .
It shows the strength of the government 's case .
It will definitely effect the next steps that Arizona will take .
This is major . "
What Do We Know About the Judge Who Made the Decision ?
Fox News legal analyst Peter Johnson explains : " This judge , appointed by President Bill Clinton , prior to that a state court , formerly a registered Democrat , then became an Independent ... has a reputation for independence , a reputation for getting to the issues quickly and an unpredictability as well . "
This Is Likely Headed for the Supreme Court , forecasts Jeffrey Toobin , a CNN legal analyst and New Yorker staff writer : " I think this is a case very much destined for United States Supreme Court .
It is the kind of big issue relating to the responsibilities of state versus federal government on a very important matter , so it 's likely , given how much attention this law received that other states will be passing similar laws .
I think the Supreme Court will get involved probably next year .
The issue that 's up in the air is will the law be in effect while the appeals process goes forward ?
At the moment the answer is no – at least this one provision .
But certainly an appeals process will begin .
If not immediately , then soon . "
Will This Change Voters ' Minds ?
Doug Mataconis at Outside the Beltway muses : " Politically , it ’s going to be interesting to see what impact this decision has across the country .
Polls have shown repeatedly that a large majority of Americans support Arizona ’s law and a new polls shows that similar majorities oppose the Justice Department ’s decision to sue the State of Arizona .
One can imagine that these voters are going to react negatively to this decision , although , of course , there ’s not really much they can do about it since the matter is in the hands of the Court .
Will it have an impact on the November elections , though ?
That is what will be interesting to watch . "
Get Comfortable , People Mark Krikorian at National Review writes : " Everyone understood this would take several years and reach the Supreme Court .
It ’s a stupid way to make policy , but with ACLU lawyers ( both those inside and those outside the government ) fanatically committed to open borders , there ’s no alternative . "

Roy Oswalt officially has accepted his proposed trade to the Philadelphia Phillies .
After considering his options and speaking with friends familiar with the Phillies ' situation , including former teammate Brad Lidge , the Houston Astros ' staff ace waived his no -trade clause Thursday in order to be dealt for left - handed starter J.A. Happ and two prospects , outfielder Anthony Gose and shortstop Jonathan Villar .
" I 'm glad it worked out for both of us .
I wanted to go to a contender , and Houston gets some good prospects in return who will hopefully allow them to build a winning team , " Oswalt told ESPN.com 's Amy K. Nelson .
" The hardest part about it is cleaning out my locker .
I 've been in the same place for 10 years and having to say goodbye and clean out the locker is the toughest part , " he said .
Astros general manager Ed Wade saluted Oswalt for his time in Houston .
" We salute what Roy did for the organization and the contributions that he made here over the course of his career in an Astros uniform and his profile here is significant , " Wade said .
" At the end of the day , we have to do what 's best for the Houston Astros .
You can't make a deal like this as a favor to a player .
In this case I think we served everybody 's purposes with what we did . "
Oswalt , who was previously scheduled to start Friday against the Brewers , said he will fly to Washington on Thursday night and start for the Phillies Friday against the Nationals .
Coincidentally , Happ was scheduled to start Friday for the Phillies .
The Phillies , who had won seven straight and were 3½ games behind the NL East - leading Atlanta Braves entering Thursday 's games , get one of baseball 's best right - handers and a pitcher with playoff experience .
" We 're trying to do what we can to get back to the World Series and win it , " Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said .
" To have Roy Oswalt , Roy Halladay and additionally Cole Hamels , Joe Blanton and Kyle Kendrick , we stack ourselves up as one of the best rotations in baseball . "
Keith Olbermann talked to Rep. Ed Markey about his attempts to get BP to release their data on the Deepwater Horizon well spill .
Markey To BP : Stop Stonewalling On Well Data :
Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) demanded Wednesday that BP release information on the integrity of the wellbore and sea floor leaks , after efforts to carry out pressure tests on the new containment cap system for BP 's Macondo well were delayed due to a lack of seismic data .
" Everyone is hoping for a successful outcome for this capping system , and for the relief wells , " said Rep.
Markey in a statement Wednesday .
" But given BP 's bad track record on all of its efforts thus far , all information about the risks of these tactics must be provided to Congress and to the public . "
Markey first requested the information in a letter sent to BP on June 23 .
He still has received no response as to how BP plans to close off the well using the new cap system .
How do you combine Western fashion with a Muslim dress code ?
Fashion is a form of self - expression .
It 's all about experimenting with looks and , in many cases , attracting attention .
The Islamic headscarf , or hijab , is exactly the opposite .
It 's about modesty and attracting as little attention as possible .
However , a growing number of Muslim women are successfully blending the two .
My label is a celebration of Islamic culture and art and it's not apologetic Sarah Elenany , Fashion designer
They get inspiration from the catwalk , the high street and fashion magazines , and they give it a hijab - friendly twist - making sure that everything except the face and hands are covered .
They are known as Hijabistas .
Jana Kossiabati is editor of the blog Hijab Style , which gets as many as 2,300 visits a day from across the world , including Africa , Middle East and the United States .
" I started two - and - a - half years ago , " says Jana , who is British of Lebanese origin .
" I 'd seen so many fashion blogs and so many Muslim blogs but had n't seen anything specifically dedicated to the way Muslim women dress .
" I started my own site to bring together elements of what Muslim women are looking for and to make mainstream fashion wearable and relevant to them . "
Image caption Sarah 's range is sporty and features Islamic art
Fitting in
Jana says one of the reasons why so many young Muslim women are reading hijab fashion blogs is that the Muslim fashion industry is lacking inspiration .
" I get comments on my blog from people saying that the clothes offered to Muslim women are too Islamic looking - they look very ethnic , very foreign , " says Jana .
" Young Muslims are increasingly looking for fashion that does n't set them apart from the rest of society . "
According to Jana , events such as 9/11 and 7/7 also had an effect on fashion - conscious Muslim women .
" Our generation became more aware of their identity when were thrust into the limelight after 9/11 and 7/7 and other events of the past decade or so .
We were forced to deal with people questioning our faith , our identity and the way we look . "
This may have prompted some women to choose to wear the hijab - but it also increased the urge among many young hijab - wearing women to fit in .
Experimentation
Hana Tajima Simpson is a fashion designer who converted to Islam five years ago .
In the beginning , she found it very hard to find her own style while following hijab rules .
" I lost a lot of my personality through wearing the hijab at first .
I wanted to stick to one mould and look a certain way , " says Hana , who comes from a British and Japanese background .
We were forced to deal with people questioning our faith , our identity and the way we look Jana Kossiabati , Editor , Hijab Style
" There was a certain idea I had in my head about how a Muslim woman should look which is the black Abaya ( baggy dress and scarf ) , but I realised that this is not true and that I could experiment with my looks , while being modest .
" It took a lot of trial and error to a find a style and a look I 'm happy with . "
Hana regularly blogs about her designs at Style Covered .
While all her clothes are suitable for women who wear the hijab , she says she does n't design with a specific group of people in mind .
" Frankly I design for myself .
" I think about what I 'd like to wear and design it .
I have many non-Muslim customers as well , so my designs are not targeted at Muslims alone . "
Celebration
Designer Sarah Elenany 's clothes are quite different from Hana's - more urban and sporty .
Image caption Hana believes hijab can be colourful
Islamic prints feature heavily on almost all of her outfits , including images of minarets and hands being extended to the heavens in prayer .
They are religious , but far from traditional .
" My label is a celebration of Islamic culture and art and it's not apologetic .
It says ' this is it , this is us .
I wanted to design prints and clothes that Muslims could look at and instantly identify with , " says Sarah .
But does n't the showy nature of fashion contradict the essence of Hijab ?
Sarah disagrees .
Fashion is about expression " and this is a legitimate part of Islam , " she says .
Jana adds , " Islam does n't prescribe rigid rules of colour or style it just says these are the areas you need to cover , the rest is really up to you . "
The U.S. District Court in San Jose , CA , has thrown out the indictment of four animal rights activists who were charged with violating the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act , because the government did not clearly explain what , exactly , the protesters did .
When Joseph Buddenberg , Maryam Khajavi , Nathan Pope and Adriana Stumpo were arrested in 2009 , prosecutors said little other than that the group allegedly chalked slogans on the sidewalk , distributed fliers and attended protests .
Later , when they were officially indicted , the government was still tight - lipped about how their non-violent , above - ground protests amounted to “ terrorism . ”
In response , the Center for Constitutional Rights and attorney Matthew Strugar led an effort to have the indictments dismissed .
In short , they argued that the charges should be dropped because they seem to involve only protected First Amendment speech , but that in order to make that argument the defendants ’ speech must be clearly identified .
A court hearing scheduled for July 19th has been cancelled .
However , the case is not over .
The government can still re-indict the defendants with an amended bill of particulars that clearly outlines their alleged actions .

An association of German Jews planning to send a boat with humanitarian aid to break the Gaza blockade is searching for a second vessel , given the high number of requests to travel with the group .
The group , Jewish Voices for a Just Peace , had originally planned to send one small vessel from an unnamed Mediterranean port in mid-July , with the intention of getting aid past the Israeli - imposed blockade of Gaza .

However , spokeswoman Edith Lutz told dpa that " our preparations have been held back somewhat because we have been inundated with requests to travel . "

The alert John Dizard of the Financial Times has taken notice of a development that has passed most commentators by , namely , that Greece is starting to restructure state debts .
This has n’t yet gotten the attention it merits because it ’s bonds issued by particular government bodies ( in this case , the Greek state hospital system ) and the investors are n’t big Eurobanks but suppliers .
Old outstanding coupon bonds are being replaced with zero coupon bonds .
The relevant ministries contend this amounts to a 19 % haircut ; Dizard thinks the discount rate is too low ( hence the proper discount is even greater ) and an expert who deals in particularly exotic debt thinks this paper will trade down a lot further .
Oh , and the haircut assumed by the ECB on sovereign debt in its stress tests ?
A mere 3 % .
And you have to love this tidbit from the joint press release by Greece ’s ministries of Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the Ministry of Finance :
It is certain that the banks co-operating with the suppliers will show interest in prepaying these bonds , transforming the corporate risk undertaken on behalf of their customers – hospital suppliers – in credit risk against the Greek state , in the form of a bond which can be financed through ECB .
More from Dizard :
… here is the Greek state telling you their old paper is n’t worth what it was when they incurred the obligation .
Even before the new bonds are issued , some of the hospital debts are already said to be trading around Athens , supposedly at much lower prices than the release suggests would be appropriate .
And while the release says the debts “ will be settled ” , major suppliers have not yet agreed to the hospital debt bloodletting .
According to a London dealer in edgier emerging market paper , some of the suppliers have already been around to get a bid .
Unsuccessfully , sad to say , even though the suppliers ’ banks have that promise of “ ECB ” repo availability .
He sniffs : “ You wo n’t get a bid at 50 [ per cent of face ] .
My guessing is that it is more like 30 .
We were appalled at the very low quality of the documentation . ” ….
Since the hospital debts do not yet have the artificial support of ECB market operations , perhaps any indicated bid side for this paper should be considered as a useful data point .
That is , the price people would pay for what will soon be Greek state bonds , if they were investing their own money .
Yves here .
Funny , that estimate that the debt will be worth 30 % to 50 % of par is exactly what S&P said recoveries on a Greece default would be .

There were reports that the the British - born writer , who was a heavy smoker until giving up several years ago , had been diagnosed with cancer .
In a statement issued by his US publisher , Twelve , the 61 - year - old said : " I have been advised by my physician that I must undergo a course of chemotherapy on my oesophagus .
This advice seems persuasive to me .
I regret having had to cancel so many engagements at such short notice . "
The firm gave no further details other than asking for his privacy to be respected .
Hitchens launched a high profile book tour last month to promote his memoir Hitch - 22 , which tackles subjects ranging from the Middle East and Zimbabwe to his friendships with prominent writers including Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis .
The volume has already entered the bestseller lists .
Hitchens has in the past described himself as " an essayist and a contrarian " .
As a journalist , critic and war correspondent , he has carved out a reputation for barbed repartee , scathing critiques of public figures and a fierce intelligence .
In his 2008 book " God Is Not Great " , Hitchens put himself on a collision course with major religions through his advocacy of atheism .
He lives in Washington DC and became an American citizen in 2007 , although also retains British citizenship .
Hitchens appeared at the Guardian Hay Festival this summer .
How refreshing to see an effort to actually hold Republicans accountable for their nasty , selfish attitudes toward fellow citizens .
The Democrats have an answer to the Republicans ' effort to craft a new " Contract With America " .
Behold , the Republican Tea Party Contract ON America , where Democrats are prepared to remind the country of what Republicans have been up to this year .
Contract high points include :
Repeal the Affordable Care Act ( Health Insurance Reform )
Put insurance companies back in charge , repeal tax credits for small businesses , allow insurance companies to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions and to drop coverage when a person gets too sick and make prescription drugs for seniors less affordable .
Privatize Social Security or phase it out altogether
Turn the guaranteed retirement benefits of America 's seniors over to Wall Street CEOs by putting Social Security at risk in the stock market or , as some Republicans have called for , phase out Social Security altogether and end a program millions of American seniors rely on for their survival .
End Medicare as it presently exists
Phase out and end Medicare as it presently exists for future generations of seniors -- ending Medicare 's guaranteed healthcare benefits for more than 40 million American seniors -- and replace it with a voucher system which will result in higher premiums and fewer services for seniors .
Extend the Bush tax breaks for the wealthy and big oil
At a cost of nearly $ 700 billion , extend the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and big oil , which are set to expire and which have and will continue to explode the federal budget deficit .
Repeal Wall Street Reform
Roll back the toughest consumer protections ever enacted , allow banks to continue to grow too big to fail , and ensure that predatory lenders continue to utilize their most abusive practices .
Protect those responsible for the oil spill and future environmental catastrophes
Cap liabilities for those responsible for environmental disasters like the Gulf oil spill and let companies like BP decide which victims deserve compensation for the disaster and what the timeline for relief should be .
Abolish the Department of Education
Put the big banks back in charge of student loans and put an end to federal assistance for public schools .
Abolish the Department of Energy End America 's investments in a clean - energy future and disband the organization responsible for oversight of nuclear materials .
Abolish the Environmental Protection Agency Gut the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act -- which together protect our kids from air pollution and keep drinking water safe -- and disband the watchdog that holds polluters accountable .
Repeal the 17th Amendment
Take away your right to pick your U.S. Senator
That 's what they 've promised .
Not just a walk back to the Bush years , a walk back to another century .
Perhaps they could repeal the Emancipation Proclamation , too .
Record - high water levels at China 's massive Three Gorges Dam have called into question Beijing 's claims that the world 's largest hydroelectric project has capacity to withstand a massive flood .
On Friday , the water level reached 159 metres , only 16 metres away from the reservoir 's maximum capacity of 175 metres , the official Xinhua News Agency said , citing reservoir engineers .
Given the continued flooding , the levels could easily rise higher .
Minister of Water Resources Chen Lei urged those responsible to continue to inspect and protect dams and reservoirs as well as prepare for heavy rainfalls .
Work teams have been dispatched to areas including Sichuan , Shaanxi and Gansu to co-ordinate flood - fighting efforts , Xinhua said .
China has for years promoted the Three Gorges Dam as the best way to end centuries of floods along the Yangtze River basin and dismissed complaints about the enormous environmental impact of the $ 24 - billion reservoir that has displaced more than 1.4 million people .
Seven years ago , Chinese officials boasted that the Three Gorges Dam could withstand floods so severe they come only once every 10,000 years .
But as the current flooding shows no sign of waning , officials warn that its capacity is limited .
Zhao Yunfa , deputy director of the China Three Gorges Corporation 's dispatch centre , said this week that the dam 's capacity can only withstand floods that reach up to 85,000 cubic metres per second — only about 18 per cent more than the dam 's record water flow on Tuesday , the China Daily newspaper reported .
" The dam 's flood control capacity is not unlimited , " Zhao told the newspaper .
Since the completion of the Three Gorges Dam in 2006 , confidence in its flood capacity has diminished as officials have backpedalled on their claims each year .
In 2007 , officials said the dam could withstand the worst flood in 1,000 years .
Then on Tuesday , the Three Gorges Corporation 's chairman , Cao Guangjing , told China Daily he can " absolutely guarantee " the dam can withstand the worst flood in 100 years .
The Three Gorges Dam is located in central Hubei province , impounding China 's largest river , the Yangtze , with 18,200 megawatts of generating capacity .
New research finds no evidence that popular slimming supplements facilitate weight loss
Stockholm , Sweden :
New research evaluating the effectiveness of a broad selection of popular slimming supplements sold in pharmacies and health food shops has found no evidence that any of them facilitate weight loss beyond the placebo effect .
Two studies presented today ( Monday ) at the International Congress on Obesity in Stockholm , Sweden , have found they were no more effective than the fake supplements they were compared with .
" There are scores of slimming supplements out there claiming weight - loss effects through all sorts of mechanisms of action .
We have so - called fat magnets , mobilizers and dissolvers , as well as appetite tamers , metabolism boosters , carb blockers and so on .
The market for these is huge , but unlike for regulated drugs , effectiveness does not have to be proven for these to be sold , " said Dr. Thomas Ellrott , head of the Institute for Nutrition and Psychology at the University of Göttingen Medical School , Germany , who lead one of the studies .
" Few of these supplements have been submitted to clinical trials and the landscape of products is always changing , so we need to put them through rigorous scientific evaluation to determine whether they have any benefit . "
Ellrott 's group tested nine popular supplements against placebo pills in a randomized controlled trial .
The supplements tested included L - Carnitine , polyglucosamine , cabbage powder , guarana seed powder , bean extract , Konjac extract , fibre pills , sodium alginate formulations and selected plant extracts .
The researchers bought the supplements from German pharmacies , changed the packaging and product names to make them look neutral and rewrote the information leaflet inserts to eliminate the product name from the text .
They then gave 189 obese or overweight middle - aged consumers packages of either fake pills or of one of the nine supplements , each week for eight weeks , in doses recommended by the manufacturers .
Some of the products came with dietary advice , while others did n't , so the researchers provided exactly the same advice as that written in the relevant product leaflets .
Average weight loss was between 1 kg and 2 kg across seven of the products , depending on the supplement , and was 1.2 kg in the group getting the placebo pills .
No statistically significant difference in weight loss was found for any of those products when compared with the placebo .
" Most previous studies have examined only one product .
This is the first to include nine supplements with different proposed mechanisms of action and we found that not a single product was any more effective than placebo pills in producing weight loss over the two months of the study , regardless of how it claims to work , " Ellrott said , adding that if there is an indication for the use of weight - loss drugs , consumers should opt for regulated obesity drugs with proven effects ( prescription or over - the - counter ) instead .
In a second study presented at the congress , Dr. Igho Onakpoya of Peninsula Medical School at the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth , UK , conducted the first systematic review of all existing systematic reviews of clinical trials on weight loss supplements .
The analysis summarizes the state of evidence from reviews of studies involving nine popular slimming supplements , including chromium picolinate , Ephedra , bitter orange , conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) , calcium , guar gum , glucomannan , chitosan and green tea .
" We found no evidence that any of these food supplements studied is an adequate treatment for reducing body weight , " Onakpoya said .
" Annual global sales of dietary supplements are well over $ 13 billion .
In Western Europe , sales of weight - loss products , excluding prescription medications , topped £ 900 million ( $ 1.4 billion ) in 2009 .
The weight - loss industry in North America is worth over $ 50 billion and Americans spend over $ 1.6 billion a year on weight - loss supplements .
People think these supplements are a short cut to weight loss and may spend huge sums of money on them , but they may end up disappointed , frustrated and depressed if their weight expectations are not met in the long term . "
Onakpoya said some of the supplements included the study were reported to cause some adverse effects .
However , more rigorous research is needed , he said , as only very few trials have been of long duration and the number of patients in most of the trials has been small - factors which together limit the conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of such supplements .
Ellrott 's study was funded by a German consumer issues magazine , while the study by Onakpoya and colleagues had no particular funding , but Onakpoya 's position is funded by an unrestricted grant from GlaxoSmithkline , which makes the obesity drug orlistat .

Becoming a champion at small talk has its benefits .
You ’ll have more friends , more fun , more confidence , and more to talk to about .
Mastering the art of small talk requires practice at first , but becomes a natural act after a while .
To use this guide effectively , you must put into practice all of the steps outlined because they are interrelated .
1 . Be knowledgeable : Knowledge is key to being good at small talk .
What are you going to talk about if you do n’t know anything ?
Now I ’m not saying you have to be an expert in every single category but basic knowledge is necessary .
Learn a little about everything .
Read books on cooking , browse through magazines about celebrities , or watch videos on dancing .
This way no matter what the person is interested in , you ’ll have something to relate to them with .
2. Find common grounds :
When you find something that you and the other person can both relate to , it builds instant rapport .
People are attracted to others who share similar interests , experiences , or knowledge .
How do you find common ground ?
Well , you can use three methods to do this : through compliments , asking questions , or using the surrounding environment to your advantage .
Let me explain each one more clearly .
Compliments :
When you give someone a compliment , you acknowledge them .
Recognition makes people feel good .
You can give a compliment about anything .
The most success I ’ve had with this technique is when I compliment what they wear .
Say something like , “ I love those shoes , they look so good on you . ” 
Most likely , the other person will respond with a genuine smile and say something like , “ Thanks ”  or “ Thanks , I just got them . ” 
How can you develop the conversation from that point ?
You ask questions .

How can you develop the conversation from that point ?
You ask questions .
Ask Questions : Asking questions is very important in any conversation you have .
It gives you the opportunity to learn about others and relate to them with the knowledge you already have .
Let ’s continue with our example .
After the other person says thanks to you , you simply ask a question related to whatever you complimented them on .
“ Where did you get them from ? ”  is a good simple example .
Or if the shoes are heels you can say , “ Do you wear heels a lot ” ?
Any question that ’s related to what you asked about will be effective in developing the conversation .
If they answer back and tell you the store they got it from , you can continue the conversation by asking more questions like , “ Oh I love that store , do you go there a lot ? ”  or if you ’re knowledgeable about the store you can say , “ I saw that they ’re having a huge sale going on right now , do you shop there often ? ” 
When you ask questions , you ’ll discover who they are and find out how you can relate to them .

When you ask questions , you ’ll discover who they are and find out how you can relate to them .
Use the environment : Using the environment for small talk involves talking about something that ’s going on right now that the other person can relate to .
Typically , this technique is used to start the conversation and develop it into something else .
One common example is using the weather .
You can say something like , “ Wow , we ’re getting some great weather , are n’t we ? ” 
They will respond by agreeing with you because it ’s true .
Then you use your knowledge and say , “ I heard this weekend ’s going to have even better weather , you have any plans made ? ” 
See the transition there ?
It starts with weather and then develops into plans for the weekend .
Once you get their answer , you can use more questions to continue the conversation .
Now how can you become great at utilizing these methods ?
3. Practice , practice , practice : Practice makes perfect .
You can practice role - playing in your mind or in front of a mirror .
This experience makes you confident .
When you ’re ready , start practicing with real people .
Give a compliment to someone or talk about the environment .
From there , use questions to develop the conversation .
Start practicing and watch your small talk skills grow .

Could Joseph Smith have written the Book of Mormon ?
The question of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon is the basis for any discussion on the truthfulness of the LDS church .
Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed , so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon .
The enemies of the Church understand this clearly .
This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon , for if it can be discredited , the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it . [ 1 ]
The Church maintains that the Book of Mormon is of divine origins , and that Joseph Smith , or any other person , was uncapable of inventing a document of such length and complexity .
Overview of LDS position
During his tenure at BYU , Hugh Nibley , a Mormon apologist , issued a challenge to see if any student could compose a history similar to the Book of Mormon ( BOM ) within the space of a semester , [ 2 ] just as Joseph Smith " translated the gold plates in less than three months . " [ 3 ]
Not only that , but the history should never contradict itself , observe appropriate literary conventions , and be lavish with cultural and technical details .
( It is reported that no student ever succeeded in his challenge . )
The LDS church asserts that for a poorly educated farm boy , this task would be entirely impossible without the power of God .
Overview of Critics ' position
The most important point the critics make concerning the writing of the Book of Mormon deals with the possible , the plausible and the probable which can be summarized by this question :
What is more probable , that Joseph Smith wrote the book or that a divine being showed a treasure - hunting Joseph of 14 the location of golden plates and then through supernatural use of a scrying with rock in a hat those plates revealed a completely unknown civilization ( traces of which still cannot be found ) ?
Critics believe that Occam 's razor be used to rule out option 2 .
However , this page addresses some additional concerns .
First , translation of the Book of Mormon did not take place in less than three months ; it spanned a time period of over a year and Joseph may have been working on the text for years before the date reported as when he started .
[ 4 ]
Second , the " most correct of any book on earth " has undergone more than 3,000 textual and grammatical corrections .
[ 5 ]
Some of these corrections included significant changes in doctrine .
Third , a large portion of the Book of Mormon simply quotes the Bible , including translation errors unique to the King James Version .
Fourth , stories in the Book of Mormon directly parallel stories from Joseph 's life , such as his father 's dream of the tree of life when Joseph was five years old .
[ 6 ]
Fifth , the Book of Mormon is no more complicated than other works of fiction , such as Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings and related works .
Finally , the ideas in the Book of Mormon bear strong parallels to ideas popular in New England at the time and several other books .
Sixth , Joseph may have had help .

Member beliefs
Members of the LDS Church who have an intellectual testimony of the Church often say they believe in the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon ( and therefore the LDS Church ) because of the assertion that Joseph Smith could not possibly have written the Book of Mormon .
" How could a young farm boy with limited education have written a fairly long , complex , flawless religious text like the Book of Mormon ?
If Joseph could not have written the book on his own , his story of the golden plates and the angel must be true , " they say .
( For example , in the Video Guide , Chapter 2 , 1 Nephi 9 , teachers are instructed to bear their testimony of the Book of Mormon and , " You could also indicate that a book this complex could not have been written by an uneducated young man like Joseph Smith . " )
Could someone have written the Book of Mormon without divine help ?
Before trying to answer the question of whether or not Joseph could have written the Book of Mormon , let 's examine whether anyone in the 19th century could have written such a book .
Some LDS assert that no man or woman could have written the Book of Mormon without divine intervention .
Our first response was made in the " Overview of Critics ' Position " in the Introduction above :
The most important point the critics make concerning the writing of the Book of Mormon deals with the possible , the plausible and the probable which can be summarized by this question :
What is more probable , that Joseph Smith wrote the book or that a divine being showed a treasure - hunting Joseph of 14 the location of golden plates and then through supernatural use of a scrying with rock in a hat those plates revealed a completely unknown civilization ( traces of which still cannot be found ) ?
Critics believe that Occam 's razor be used to rule out option 2 .
The first edition of the Book of Mormon
When the Book of Mormon was first published in 1830 , it looked very different than today .
The text was all in paragraph form .
The original Book of Mormon had the appearance of an average ' non- religious ' book .
The modern Book of Mormon used in the Church looks much more ' biblical ' as everything has been put into numbered chapters and verses , cross referenced with footnotes , etc .
The first edition of the Book of Mormon was riddled with grammatical errors .
This alone questions whether the text was written by man or translated divinely .
There were also several more significant errors in the early editions of the Book of Mormon such as changing the name of King Benjamin to King Mosiah ( King Benjamin was already dead at this point ) or changing that Mary was the ' mother of God ' to the ' mother of the son of God ' .
Overall there have been some 3,913 changes to the first edition of Book of Mormon .
This is the book Joseph called ' the most correct book on earth ' .
For more detail on the changes go to : Link is here .
So when determining whether or not Joseph could have written the Book of Mormon , we should actually be looking at the first edition of the Book of Mormon and not the current version we have today which has been altered by people other than Joseph Smith .
How does the Book of Mormon compare to other literary works ?
Most non-LDS authors are not all that impressed with the Book of Mormon - certainly no non-LDS authors are so impressed as to even entertain the idea that the book could not have been written by a man without divine help .
Mark Twain thought the Book of Mormon was extremely boring and referred to it as ' chloroform in print ' .
The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history , with the Old Testament for a model ; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament .
The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint , old - fashioned sound and structure of our King James 's translation of the Scriptures ; and the result is a mongrel — half modern glibness , and half ancient simplicity and gravity .
The latter is awkward and constrained ; the former natural , but grotesque by the contrast .
Whenever he found his speech growing too modern — which was about every sentence or two — he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as " exceeding sore , " " and it came to pass , " etc. , and made things satisfactory again .
" And it came to pass " was his pet .
If he had left that out , his Bible would have been only a pamphlet .
Mark Twain , Roughing It .
For the complete review of the Book of Mormon by Mark Twain
Even Assistant Church Historian and General Authority B.H. Roberts objectively stated :
… [ T ] here is a certain lack of perspective in the things the book relates as history that points quite clearly to an undeveloped mind as their origin .
The narrative proceeds in characteristic disregard of conditions necessary to its reasonableness , as if it were a tale told by a child , with utter disregard for consistency …
Is this all sober history …or is it a wonder - tale of an immature mind , unconscious of what a test he is laying on human credulity when asking men to accept his narrative as solemn history .

In The New Yorker 's review of The Lost Book of Mormon ( by Avi Steinberg ) , the author says ,
Steinberg rarely quotes directly from the Book of Mormon , which seemed odd until I tried to read it myself .
As exciting as the plot sounds in paraphrase , the actual text smothers it in so many King Jamesian locutions that it ’s barely discernable .
No one ’s ever claimed that the Book of Mormon rivals the literary achievements of the Bible or the poetic grace of the Koran in Arabic , but I was still surprised by the tedium .
" In Search of the Great American Bible " By Rollo Romig , The New Yorker , February 9 , 2015 .
Slate 's review of Understanding the Book of Mormon : A Reader 's Guide , by Grant Hardy , says ,
Whatever one 's views on the authenticity of the text , it has been widely regarded as a rather inferior work of literature , especially when compared to the King James Bible .
" Chloroform in print , " is Mark Twain 's famous dismissal of it .
I found myself willing — indeed eager — to go along with Hardy 's suggestion .
Mormonism has fascinated me ever since I developed an interest in religion .
… If someone can convince me that the reason for Mormonism 's success lies in the narrative structure of its sacred text , I am willing to be convinced .
Hardy concludes his book by citing Twain 's famous quip that Wagner 's music " is better than it sounds . " the Book of Mormon , he wants us to believe , is better than it reads .
Here is where he loses me .
I can get so absorbed in an opera like Siegfried that when it ends , six or so hours after it began , I cannot wait until the next one in the Ring , Die Götterdämmerung , starts .
The same thing simply cannot be said about the Book of Mormon , at least to a non-Mormon like me .
Hardy 's heroic efforts to prove that there is literature somewhere buried in all those passages starting with " Behold " or " And so it came to pass " leave me , like Twain , gasping for air .
Hardy does convince me that writing the Book of Mormon required an amazing amount of dedication .
How else to explain its length and the fervent imagination clearly at work within it .
He has not convinced me that what was written qualifies as great , or even good .
Mormonism 's success suggests that a religion can flourish in spite of rather than because of its founding texts .
I do not doubt that Mormons are inspired by the words associated with Joseph Smith .
But if another reference to music is permitted , I simply cannot imagine anyone setting those words to music the way Handel did with the Bible in his oratorios .
the Book of Mormon has a structure .
It does not sing .
" Chloroform in Print : Does the Book of Mormon get a bad rap ? "
By Alan Wolfe , Slate , 17 May 2010 .
the Book of Mormon pales in comparison to such literary masterpieces as A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens , War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy or anything by William Shakespeare .
Many books are far more complex and difficult to write than the Book of Mormon .
In Tolkien 's fictional Lord of the Rings series , not only are multiple interacting civilizations created , but also their own languages .
the Book of Mormon is not so spectacular of a book that it could only have been written with divine intervention — many authors in Joseph Smith 's day could have written it .
However , it 's one thing to say a trained author could have written the Book of Mormon , and quite another to say Joseph Smith could have written it .
So , could Joseph Smith have produced the book without divine help ?
When the Book of Mormon was first published , Joseph claimed that a revelation told him to sell the copyright to the Book of Mormon to a publishing company in Canada to earn money ; it was treated like any other book written by an author , as if there was nothing special about it .
Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery went to Toronto for this purpose , but they failed to sell the copyright , returning without any money .
( Revelation , circa Early 1830 , ID # 6473 , The Joseph Smith Papers )
It should be noted that the first edition of the Book of Mormon has listed on its title page that Joseph Smith is the " author and proprietor " of the book , but the Preface of the same edition states that Joseph translated it .
Subsequent editions changed the term " author and proprietor " to " translator . "
The word " author " is used by some critics to claim that Joseph admitted to having written the book on his own .
However , this MT editor believes the reason " author and proprietor " was included was to comply with copyright laws of the time , and not an indication that Joseph was claiming to have written it on his own .
See the then - existent copyright laws ( 1790 ) that frequently used the term " author or proprietor . "

Joseph 's life as a child
Joseph Smith was born on December 23 , 1805 in Sharon , Vermont to Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith .
He grew up on a series of farms in Vermont , New Hampshire , and New York .
Although the LDS church has painted a picture of Joseph Smith as an uneducated farm boy , he was home schooled quite extensively in " reading , writing , and the ground rules of arithmetic , " as his mother put it .
According to Joseph 's mother , even from an early age , it is apparent that Joseph was not a typical boy , but possessed some qualities and mannerisms that seemed beyond his years .
Some Mormons know about Joseph 's terrible operation on his leg at age seven .
Infected bone was cut from his swollen and infected lower leg without any anesthesia .
Joseph 's mother reported the incident in her writings :
The principal surgeon , after a moment 's conversation , ordered cords to be brought to bind Joseph fast to a bedstead ; but to this Joseph objected .
The doctor , however , insisted that he must be confined , upon which Joseph said very decidedly , " No , doctor , I will not be bound , for I can bear the operation much better if I have my liberty . "
" Then , " said Dr. Stone , " will you have some brandy ? … "
" No , " exclaimed Joseph , " I will not touch one particle of liquor , neither will I be tied down ; but I will tell you what I will do — I will have my father sit on the bed and hold me in his arms , and then I will do whatever is necessary in order to have the bone taken out . "
Looking at me , he said , " Mother I want you to leave the room , for I know you cannot bear to suffer so ; father can stand it , but you have carried me so much , and watched over me so long , you are almost worn out . "
Then looking up into my face , his eyes swimming in tears , he continued , " Now , mother , promise me that you will not stay , will you ?
The Lord will help me , and I shall get through with it . "
Biographical Sketches of Joseph Smith The Prophet , Lucy Mack Smith , p. 64 .
That manner of speech and control is certainly not typical for a seven - year - old child .
Even at that tender age , it appears Joseph had the verbal skills and some influence over those much older than he .
Although Joseph survived the operation quite well , he walked with a limp from that day forward .
A few LDS depictions will show Joseph with a limp and occasionally using a cane .
It is apparent in our studies of Joseph Smith that he had academic strengths and weaknesses .
We would describe Smith as creative , articulate , and well - read .
By his early teens , he had quite a thorough knowledge of The Holy Bible and many other books .
Although well - read beyond average , he appeared weak in areas such as writing and grammar and , of course , in formal education subjects such as the sciences and mathematics .
Joseph 's education
Joseph Smith had a limited formal education which is often used as a reason why he could not have written the Book of Mormon .
However , just because his formal schooling was limited , that does not mean he did not have the mental acumen to produce a work like the Book of Mormon .
Education was important to the Smith family , and although Joseph may have only had limited formal education in a typical classroom , his parents undoubtedly schooled him at home .
Joseph 's mother wrote that they did not neglect the education of their children .
This was an educated family : Joseph 's father , Joseph Smith , Sr. , was a school teacher during the off season .
Joseph 's brother , Hyrum , worked as a school teacher during the off season also .
His mother and maternal grandmother were school teachers .
One of his sisters may have also been a teacher at some point in her life .
Joseph attended school when he was about 20 years old in Harmony , PA with the Stowell children .
According to his own words , Joseph read and pondered scriptures .
He had access to books and newspapers .
He even held a position as " exhorter " at a local church and participated in the debate group in Palmyra .
Despite limited schooling Joseph Smith loved to study and learn .
In part he was influenced by schoolteacher associates .
His father once taught school .
His maternal grandmother , a schoolteacher , taught his mother the rudiments of ' sums , ' write - o- hand ' and spelling . '
Joseph 's wife was a schoolteacher , 'a woman of liberal culture and insistent on education . '
And his primary scribe during the translating of the Book of Mormon was schoolteacher Oliver Cowdery .
" Joseph Smith and Nauvoo's Youth , " By William G. Hartley .
September 1979 Ensign .
In the early 1800s few children were able to have a full education .
Most children in rural America worked on farms and often had much of their education done at home .
As Joseph Smith Sr. was an actual school teacher at various times in his life , he would be quite capable of teaching general education to his children , including Joseph .
Joseph 's mother , Lucy Smith , would undoubtedly help as well .
Even Abraham Lincoln had a very limited formal education , and Benjamin Franklin also had only one year of formal education .
Look at the amazing things they wrote and accomplished .
Today , many people home - school their children — are they to be considered uneducated ?
It 's true that they do not have a " formal " education , but for the most part , home - schooled children have similar , and in some cases superior , education than traditionally - schooled children .
Religious education
Young Joseph was able to read and ponder scriptures .
Joseph also attended Protestant church services and apparently studied the Bible in depth .
According to Lucy Mack Smith , Joseph 's mother , less than a year after first being visited by Moroni , Joseph said :
Mother , I do not wish to prevent your going to [ church ] , or any of the rest of the family ; or your joining any church you please ; but , do not ask me to join them .
I can take my Bible , and go into the woods and learn more in two hours than you can learn at meeting in two years , if you should go all the time .

Critic 's comment :
One has to wonder why a document translated in the 19th century uses 17th century English .
Although , if Joseph was so well acquainted with the Bible , it may help explain why the Book of Mormon is so similar to the Bible .
The English used in the 1830s certainly did n't match the Book of Mormon language .
The " thees " and " thous " seem included so as to make the book sound more scripture - like .
Additionally , why is the translation so inconsistent : sometimes " you " was used and other times " thou " was used ; " shown " vs. " shewn ; " " had " vs. " hath ; " etc. Did Reformed Egyptian actually use two different words , one modern and one archaic , to mean the same thing ?
Does the Book of Mormon consistently use the different words in different contexts , or is it arbitrary ?
It must be noted that the bible also has the same issue .
Michael Quinn has made the best case for Joseph Smith 's information environment .
Joseph knew the Bible , Camp meetings , American antiquities , strategies of the war of 1812 and earlier American / Indian wars , and the strong anti-Masonic sentiments between 1826 - 1830 in his environment ( Hyrum Smith was a Mason in NY , and belonged to a lodge . )
In other words , the very things that Joseph was most " schooled " in he had observed from his own backyard and were the very things we find discussed in the Book of Mormon .
The poor grammar in the 1830 Book of Mormon shows the lack of formal education that Joseph had .
However , lack of education does not mean lack of intelligence or imagination .
The original grammar and the errors in the Book of Mormon is what would be expected from someone with limited formal education ( but not if the words were given to him by the power of God in the manner in which it is claimed to have happened — word for word and , according to Martin Harris , " if not written correctly it remained until corrected . " ) .
An example of Joseph 's writing from before he published the Book of Mormon is in the section below ' What about Emma Smith ? '
William E. McLellin , a schoolteacher , said of Joseph as an adult learner :
He attended my High school during the winter of 1834 .
He attended my school and learned science all winter .
I learned the strength of his mind as < to > the study and principles of science .
Hence I think I knew him .
And I here say that he had one of < the > strongest , well balanced , penetrating , and retentive minds of any < man > with which < whom >
I ever formed an acquaintance , among the thousands of my observation .
Although when I took him into my school , he was without scientific knowledge or attainments .

Additional information and source material for some of the above points .
In his own handwriting , Joseph Smith claimed that by the age of twelve he spent time not just reading , but " searching the scriptures " and " applying [ himself ] to them . "
He knew them well enough that he could judge that the people he personally knew did not behave " agreeable to what I found contained in " the bible .
" From the age of twelve years to fifteen , " Joseph " pondered many things …of the world of mankind . "
But " by searching the scriptures [ he ] found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but they had apostatised from the true and liveing faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament . "
Also , through " searching the scriptures , " Joseph said he " felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world ; " knew that " God was the same yesterday to day and forever " and that " he was no respecter to persons for he was God … "
Full quote :
…we were deprived of the bennifit of an education suffice it to say I was mearly instructtid in reading writing and the ground rules of Arithmatic which constituted my whole literary acquirements .
At about the age of twelve years my mind become seriously imprest with regard to the all importent concerns for the wellfare of my immortal Soul which led me to searching the scriptures believeing as I was taught , that they contained the word of God thus applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with those of differant denominations led me to marvel excedingly for I discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository this was a grief to my Soul thus from the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart concerning the sittuation of the world of mankind the contentions and divisions the wickedness and abominations and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind my mind become excedingly distressed for I become convicted of my sins and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but they had apostatised from the true and liveing faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament and I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday to day and forever that he was no respecter to persons for he was God for I looked upon the sun the glorious luminary of the earth and also the moon rolling in their magesty through the heavens and also the stars shining in their courses and the earth also upon which I stood and the beast of the field and the fowls of heaven and the fish of the waters and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in magesty and in the strength of beauty whose power and intiligence in governing the things which are so exceding great and marvilous even in the likeness of him who created them and when I considered upon these things my heart exclaimed well hath the wise man said it is a fool that saith in his heart there is no God my heart exclaimed all all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotant and omnipreasant power a being who makith Laws and decreeeth and bindeth all things in their bounds who filleth Eternity who was and is and will be from all Eternity to Eternity and when I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worshep him as worship him in spirit and in truth therefore I cried unto the Lord for mercy for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy …

During this period , Joseph , Senior , worked on the farm summers , and taught school part of the time winters .
His son Joseph attended the school on Dewey Hill , and was taught his letters by Dea[ con ] Jonathan Kinney , the schoolmaster there .

Father Smith taught common school for several winters while the Smiths lived in the Prophet 's birthplace .
But young Joseph was not ready for regular instruction until after his family had moved to neighboring Royalton Township , where Joseph Smith Sr. appears on the tax records from 1809 to 1811 .
A granddaughter of Royalton deacon Jonathan Kinney said he " oft repeated " that " I taught Joseph Smith , the Mormon prophet , his letters while teaching school upon Dewey Hill about the year 1810 - 15 . "

From 1812 - 13 , while living in Lebanon , New Hampshire , Joseph Sr. and Lucy sent their children to school , until , apparently , the typhoid fever outbreak of 1813 :
… as my children had been deprived of school we made every arrangement to suply that deficency our second son we sent to the accademy in Hanover the remmainder who were old enough [ which would include Joseph , then 6 or 7 ] attended a school near by whilst I their Father and myself were industriously laboring late and early to do all in our power for their future wellfare We met with success on every hand [ . ]

Someone familiar with the Smith family when they lived in Palmyra , New York , recollected the following in 1851 :
Joseph had a little ambition , and some very laudable aspirations ; the mother 's intellect shone out in him feebly , especially when he used to help us solve some portentous questions of moral or political ethics in our juvenile debating club , which we moved down to the old red schoolhouse on Durfee street , to get rid of the critics that used to drop in upon us in the village .
And subsequently , after catching a spark of Methodism in the camp meeting , away down in the woods , on the Vienna road , he was a very passable exhorter in the evening meetings .
Personal recollection of O. Turner , author of History of the Pioneer Settlement of Phelps and Gorham 's Purchase , p. 214 .
Herbert S. Salisbury , grandson of Joseph Smith , Jr. 's sister , Katherine Smith Salisbury , said the following about Joseph Smith :
The enemies of the Prophet Joseph Smith accuse him of being an ignorant young man at the time he received the first revelation .
The defenders of the church have exaggerated his lack of learning . …
He was not as ignorant as his enemies would have us believe , anyhow .
I have his New England Reader , used by him in school , and afterwards by his sister Catherine , who gave it to me , and it would take some of our college and university men to fully appreciate its lofty sentiment , expressed in the sesquipedal verbiage of the noted scholars and writers of the great Puritan age , from Milton up to the beginning of our Constitutional Period .
He , and many of the early church men , were the product of the best Puritan stock , with whom education was one of the first considerations .
Joseph Smith , jr. 's , maternal grandmother , Lydia Gates Mack , was a school - teacher and taught his mother .
Joseph Smith , sr. , was a public - school teacher in Royalton , Vermont .
His wife , Emma Hale , was also a school - teacher , a woman of liberal culture and insistent on education .
Inasmuch as New England had enjoyed free public schools for nearly two centuries before Joseph Smith appeared upon the stage of action , and in light of the fact that his immediate ancestors were people of high rank in Massachusetts , and of the teaching profession , it is unreasonable to suppose that he had absolutely no common education .
H. S. Salisbury , " History of Education in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , " Journal of History , Vol. XV , No. 3 ( July , 1922 ) , pp. 257-58 .
Besides his ability to read and think about the bible , Joseph could write .
Although he felt a need to have a scribe to help with the Book of Mormon , Joseph had good penmanship .
His spelling and punctuation may not have been the best , but he could compose and write , as the already quoted 1832 history attests .
To see his penmanship , see his 1832 history and also his letter to his wife , Emma , June 6 , 1832
These writings were a mere 3 - 4 years after the writing of the Book of Mormon .
It could be that in those years Joseph had learned to write , but more likely than not he was already a capable writer when the Book of Mormon was penned .
Although apparently aided by an angelic being with the content ( Moroni ) , Joseph was capable of telling stories as a 16 year old :
In the course of our evening conversations Joseph would give us some of the most ammusing recitals which could be immagined he would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent their dress thier maner of traveling the animals which they rode
The cities that were built by them the structure of their buildings with every particular of their mode of warfare their religious orship - as particularly as though he had spent his life with them [ . ]

It is not implausible for those with little to no formal education to be intelligent and creative individuals .
The following are several examples of such people from approximately the same time period as Joseph Smith .
[ Abraham ] Lincoln 's education was typical , fulfilling Joseph Kett 's image of adolescents practicing " a mixture of formal schooling and private self - education . "
Lincoln reminisced that " the aggregate of his schooling did not amount for one year . "
Instead , he joined several self - improvement groups , including the New Salem Debating Society and the Springfield Lyceum .
By and large , however , self - education was solitary , even secretive .
Self - education , however , was a rare achievement in a pioneer culture , even one on the verge of a commercial revolution .
Like most farmboys , Lincoln received little encouragement from his family to forego manual labor to read and think .
Back in Indiana , for example , his love of reading and writing earned him little more than a reputation for laziness .
John Romine , who hired the boy , recalled that " Abe was awful lazy : he worked for me - was always reading &thinking - used to get mad at him . "
Lincoln 's second cousin Dennis Hanks remembered that " Lincoln was lazy - a very lazy man-He was always reading - scribbling - writing - Ciphering - writing Poetry & c. &c . "
Even in Illinois , Lincoln 's solitary reading habits earned him an unflattering reputation .
Stephen T. Logan , cousin of Mary Todd and later Lincoln 's law partner , heard about the lazy young newcomer and later reminisced that " The impression that I had at the time was that he was a sort of loafer . "
Only much later did anyone recognize this diligent reading , thinking , and writing as hard work , in fact a new kind of labor , mental work .

Horace Greeley was born on February 3 , 1811 , on a farm about five miles from Amherst , New Hampshire .
He could not breathe for the first twenty minutes of his life .
It is suggested that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger 's syndrome - some of his biographers , such as Mitchell Snay , maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life .
Greeley was the son of poor farmers Zaccheus and Mary ( Woodburn ) Greeley .
Zaccheus was not successful , and moved his family several times , as far west as Pennsylvania .
Horace attended the local schools , and was a brilliant student …
Seeing the boy 's intelligence , some neighbors offered to pay Horace 's way at Phillips Exeter Academy , but the Greeleys were too proud to accept charity .
In 1820 , Zaccheus 's financial reverses caused him to flee New Hampshire with his family lest he be imprisoned for debt , and settle in Vermont .
Even as his father struggled to make a living as a hired hand , Horace Greeley read everything he could - the Greeleys had a neighbor who let Horace use his library .
In 1822 , Horace ran away from home to become a printer 's apprentice , but was told he was too young .
In 1826 , at age 15 , he was made a printer 's apprentice …
" Horace Greeley , " Wikipedia .
In later life Horace Greeley started the New - York Tribune ( 1841 - 1966 ) and was influential in journalism in general .
He was a US Congressman and helped start the Republican Party .
Samuel [ Clemen ] 's father was a judge , and he built a two - story frame house at 206 Hill Street in 1844 .
As a youngster , Samuel was kept indoors because of poor health .
However , by age nine , he seemed to recover from his ailments and joined the rest of the town 's children outside .
He then attended a private school in Hannibal .
When Samuel was 12 , his father died of pneumonia , and at 13 , Samuel left school to become a printer 's apprentice .
After two short years , he joined his brother Orion 's newspaper as a printer and editorial assistant .
It was here that young Samuel found he enjoyed writing .

Essay : “ Reassessing Joseph Smith Jr. ’s Formal Education ”
Anyone interested in knowing just how much formal schooling Joseph Smith had should read Bill Davis ’ essay “ Reassessing Joseph Smith Jr. ’s Formal Education ” in the latest issue of Dialogue : A Journal of Mormon Thought ( Winter 2016 ) .
It is a year - by - year assessment of the documentary evidence , and while an exact number is not possible due to the incompleteness of the sources , Bill can show that “ the overall estimated time that Joseph spent in formal education to the equivalent of approximately seven full school years — a notable increase to that proposed in previous historical representations .... ”
This does not include instruction he probably received from his teacher father and brother Hyrum .
I highly recommend Bill ’s well - researched and reasoned essay .

Joseph's age
We 've heard many times that it 's impossible for a young boy to have written the Book of Mormon .
Although the Church does n't teach this , many members mistakenly confuse the age of Joseph when he translated the Book of Mormon with the age Joseph was when he had the First Vision at age 14 or 15 .
The first edition of the Book of Mormon was published in 1830 when Joseph was 24 .
So Joseph was in his early to mid twenties when the Book of Mormon was translated and not a teenager .
Many authors have written very impressive works and were younger than when Joseph translated the Book of Mormon such as Ernest Hemingway .
See below for examples of extraordinary accomplishments by people younger than Joseph was when he translated the Book of Mormon .
Joseph 's imagination
Critics often say that young Joseph was known for story - telling and often cite the following account from Joseph 's mother :
During our evening conversations , Joseph would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined .
He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent , their dress , mode of travelings , and the animals upon which they rode ; their cities , their buildings , with every particular ; their mode of warfare ; and also their religious worship .
This he would do with as much ease , seemingly , as if he had spent his whole life among them .
Biographical Sketches of Joseph Smith The Prophet , Lucy Mack Smith , p. 92 .
However , as we 're an organization that promotes total fairness , we must point out that although this is a true quote , it is not the complete quote .
LDS apologists contend that the knowledge came from Joseph 's encounters with Moroni and not from his imagination .
So we will show the entire account as provided by Assistant Church historian , LDS apologist and General Authority B.H. Roberts who suggests that Joseph could not have learned any of these things from Moroni :
THE IMAGINATIVE MIND OF PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH : EVIDENCE OF ITS EXISTENCE -EXAMPLES OF ITS FORCE
One other subject remains to be considered in this division of the " study " here conducted , viz . - was Joseph Smith possessed of a sufficiently vivid and creative imagination as to produce such a work as the Book Mormon from such materials as have been indicated in the preceding chapters - from such common knowledge as was extant in the communities where he lived in his boyhood and young manhood ; from the Bible , and more especially from the View of the Hebrews , by Ethan Smith ?
That such power of imagination would have to be of a high order is conceded ; that Joseph Smith possessed such a gift of mind there can be no question .
The fact of it is first established by the testimony of the mother who bore him , Lucy Smith .
Speaking of the days immediately following the revelation making known the existence of the Book of Mormon to her son - the ever memorable 23rd day of September , 1823 - Lucy Smith in her History of the Prophet Joseph Smith , recounts how in the evening of that day , the young prophet sat up late detailing to the family the wonderful conversations he had with the angel ; until the elder brother , Alvin , noting how exhausted the youthful prophet was suggested an adjournment of the story being related until the following evening .
And this was done .
This seems to have been the inauguration of a long series of such evenings according to the History by " Mother Lucy Smith " for she writes : " From this time forth , Joseph continued to receive instructions from the Lord , and we continued to get the children together every night evening , for the purpose of listening while he gave us a relation of the same .
I presume our family presented an aspect as singular as any that ever lived upon the face of the earth - all seated in a circle , father , mother , sons and daughters , and giving the most profound attention to a boy , eighteen years of age , who had never read the Bible through in his life ; he seemed much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of our children , but far more given to meditation and deep study ..
During our evening conversations , Joseph would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined .
He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent , their dress , mode of traveling , and the animals upon which they rode ; their cities , their buildings , with every particular ; their mode of warfare ; and also their religious worship .
This he would do with as much ease , seemingly , as if he had spent his whole life among them . "
( History of the Prophet Joseph , 1901 edition , Salt Lake City , Utah .
Published under the sanction and direction of the late President Joseph F. Smith ) .
It must be remembered that the above took place before the young prophet had received the plates of the Book of Mormon : these were the evenings immediately following the first interviews with Moroni .
Whence came his knowledge for these recitals of " the dress , " " the mode of the ancient inhabitants of America of traveling , " " the animals on which they rode , " " their cities , " " their buildings , " " their mode of warfare , " " their religious worship " ?
And all this given " with as much ease , seemingly , as if he had spent his whole life among them " ?
Whence indeed , since all this happened before even the second interview with Moroni had taken place , and between three and four years before the translation of the Book of Mormon began .
And yet it must be from that book that he would get his knowledge of the ancient inhabitants of America , unless he has caught suggestions from such common knowledge , or that which was taken for " knowledge , " as existed in the community concerning ancient American civilization , and built by imagination from this and possible contact with Ethan Smith 's View of the Hebrews his description of the ancient inhabitants of the land , their life , religion and customs .
A year later he will be helped by Josiah Priest 's book , The Wonders of Nature and Providence , published only twenty miles away , and it will have much to say about the Hebrew origin of the American Indian , and his advanced culture and civilization .
Whence comes the young prophet 's ability to give these descriptions " with as much ease as if he had spent his whole life " with these ancient inhabitants of America ?
Not from the Book of Mormon , which is , as yet , a sealed book to him ; and surely not from Moroni , since he had had but one day and night of interviews with him , during which there had be several interviews , it is true , but these had been occupied with other subject matter than the things enumerated by Lucy Smith .
These evening recitals could come from no other source than the vivid , constructive imagination of Joseph Smith , a remarkable power which attended him through all his life .
It was as strong and varied as Shakespeare 's and no more to be accounted for than the English Bard's .
Chapter XIV , Studies of the Book of Mormon , B.H. Roberts , pp 243-244 .
B.H. Roberts Conclusion
In his book Studies of the Book of Mormon , Roberts concluded that Joseph Smith had sufficient imagination and was capable of producing the Book of Mormon even though he had little formal education .
He was , however , prone to make silly mistakes , such as : 1 ) evidence of an undeveloped mind , 2 ) repetition of the same themes , 3 ) repetition of the same villains , 4 ) repetition of same battles and wars , 5 ) conversions typical of 19th century conversions .
In light of this evidence , there can be no doubt as to the possession of a vividly strong , creative imagination by Joseph Smith , the Prophet .
An imagination , it could with reason be urged , which , given the suggestions that are to be found in the ' common knowledge ' of accepted American Antiquities of the times , supplemented [ sic ] by such a work as Ethan Smith's , View of the Hebrews , would make it possible for him to create a book such as the Book of Mormon is . …
There is a certain lack of perspective in the things the book relates as history that points quite clearly to an undeveloped mind as their origin , The narrative proceeds in characteristic disregard of conditions necessary to its reasonableness , as if it were a tale told by a child , with utter disregard for consistency …
Is this all sober history …or is it a wonder - tale of an immature mind , unconscious of what a test he is laying on human credulity when asking men to accept his narrative as solemn history . " … was Joseph Smith possessed of a sufficiently vivid and creative imagination as to produce such a work as the Book of Mormon from such materials as have been indicated in the preceding chapters …?
That such power of imagination would have to be of a high order is conceded ; that Joseph Smith possessed such a gift of mind there can be no question .
Studies of the Book of Mormon , B.H. Roberts , p. 243 .
Book of Mormon – evidences of other sources
Editor 's Note :
The following are ideas as to how Joseph Smith may have used available sources while writing the Book of Mormon .
Some of these ideas are more probable sources than others , although none of them are a silver bullet .
MormonThink does not necessarily believe any of these sources were actually used ; we merely present them to show there other possibilities for the genesis of the Book of Mormon besides just a supernatural explanation .
From time to time the word " plagiarized " is used to describe Joseph Smith 's writing of the book of Mormon .
It must be kept in mind that there is a difference between the plagiarism of words and that of ideas .
Although some critics believe Joseph Smith took actual words from various sources ( most definitely from the Bible , and some believe other sources ) , this editor believes it is more likely that he was informed by the ideas expressed in other writing and simply the climate of his time and place , so while interesting , the parallels presented between the Book of Mormon and other writings of his day do not necessarily prove Joseph plagiarised words .
Lucy Mack Smith reported that her husband , Joseph Smith Sr. , had the following dream when Joseph Smith Jr. was 5 years old :
" I thought , " said he , " I was travelling in an open , desolate field , which appeared to be very barren .
As I was thus travelling , the thought suddenly came into my mind that I had better stop and reflect upon what I was doing , before I went any further .
So I asked myself , ' What motive can I have in travelling here , and what place can this be ? '
My guide , who was by my side , as before , said , ' This is the desolate world ; but travel on . '
The road was so broad and barren that I wondered why I should travel in it ; for , said I to myself , ' Broad is the road , and wide is the gate that leads to death , and many there be that walk therein ; but narrow is the way , and straight is the gate that leads to everlasting life , and few there be that go in thereat . '
Travelling a short distance further , I came to a narrow path .
This path I entered , and , when I had travelled a little way in it , I beheld a beautiful stream of water , which ran from the east to the west .
Of this stream I could see neither the source nor yet the termination ; but as far as my eyes could extend I could see a rope , running along the bank of it , about as high as a man could reach , and beyond me was a low , but very pleasant valley , in which stood a tree such as I , had never seen before .
It was exceedingly handsome , insomuch that I looked upon it with wonder and admiration .
Its beautiful branches spread themselves somewhat like an umbrella , and it bore a kind of fruit , in shape much like a chestnut bur , and as white as snow , or , if possible , whiter .
I gazed upon the same with considerable interest , and as I was doing so , the burs or shells commenced opening and shedding their particles , or the fruit which they contained , which was of dazzling whiteness .
I drew near , and began to eat of it , and I found it delicious beyond description .
As I was eating , I said in my heart , ' I can not eat this alone , I must bring my wife and children , that they may partake with me . '
Accordingly , I went and brought my family , which consisted of a wife and seven children , and we all commenced eating , and praising God for this blessing .
We were exceedingly happy , insomuch that our joy could not easily be expressed .
While thus engaged , I beheld a spacious building standing opposite the valley which we were in , and it appeared to reach to the very heavens .
It was full of doors and windows , and they were all filled with people , who were very finely dressed .
When these people observed us in the low valley , under the tree , they pointed the finger of scorn at us , and treated us with all manner of disrespect and contempt .
But their contumely we utterly disregarded .
I presently turned to my guide , and inquired of him the meaning of the fruit that was so delicious .
He told me it was the pure love of God , shed abroad in the hearts of all those who love him , and keep his commandments .
He then commanded me to go and bring the rest of my children .
I told him that we were all there .
' No , ' he replied , ' look yonder , you have two more , and you must bring them also . '
Upon raising my eyes , I saw two small children , standing some distance off .
I immediately went to them , and brought them to the tree ; upon which they commenced eating with the rest , and we all rejoiced together .
The more we eat , the more we seemed to desire , until we even got down upon our knees , and scooped it up , eating it by double handfulls .
After feasting in this manner a short time , I asked my guide what was the meaning of the spacious building which I saw .
He replied , ' It is Babylon , it is Babylon , and it must fall .
The people in the doors and windows are the inhabitants thereof , who scorn and despise the Saints of God , because of their humility . '
I soon awoke , clapping my hands together for joy . "

Critic 's comment :
This is the " Tree of Life " story as told in the Book of Mormon starting in 1 Nephi 11:25 .
If Lucy recalled Joseph Sr.'s dream with this much detail in 1844 - 45 ( when she wrote the first draft of the above quote ) , one must assume that Joseph Sr. told it many times .
Surely Joseph Jr. was well - acquainted with it when he wrote the Book of Mormon .
Although faithful LDS try to explain this as evidence that Joseph 's father was also inspired , there is another more plausible explanation : Joseph Jr. simply incorporated this dream experience , that had such an impact on his father , into the Book of Mormon .
Many parts of the Book of Mormon are identical to the Bible .
Entire chapters of the Bible are contained within the Book of Mormon .
Plagiarism is not difficult for anyone to do .
LDS faithful say that there are a couple of reasons for this .
The first one is that the Book of Mormon peoples had the Old Testament writings , that they had taken with them from Jerusalem , so there is n't a problem in quoting Old Testament prophets like Isaiah as the Book of Mormon prophets had the Old Testament .
Another reason is that these stories were on the plates because the same experiences that happened in the Americas also happened in Jerusalem .
For example , since Christ taught the ' sermon on the mount ' to the Jews , he would also teach that same exact message to the Nephites as it's the same gospel .
Problems with portions of the Bible in the Book of Mormon
The King James version of The Holy Bible has some translation problems with it as stated in the Articles of Faith .
These translation errors occurred when the original Greek and Hebrew Bibles were translated into English .
Obviously if the Book of Mormon used the Old Testament records that the Nephites brought with them from Jerusalem in 600 BC , then they would not have English translation errors made in the Middle Ages .
However the Book of Mormon has these same errors .
The Bible has some rare errors such as plurals of certain words .
The portions of the Book of Mormon that appear to quote the Bible have these same errors .
Also the term ' Lucifer ' was translated incorrectly in the Bible and was also used in the same incorrect manner as in the King James Bible .
Some LDS apologists admit that Joseph must have used the King James Bible when bringing forth the Book of Mormon .
They explain that when Joseph recognized parts of the plates that were identical to the Bible , he used the Bible instead , as expressed in the Ensign :
In fact , the language in the sections of the Book of Mormon that correspond to parts of the Bible is quite regularly selected by Joseph Smith , rather than obtained through independent translation .
For instance , there are over 400 verses in which the Nephite prophets quote from Isaiah , and half of these appear precisely as the King James version renders them .
Summarizing the view taken by Latter - day Saint scholars on this point , Daniel H. Ludlow emphasizes the inherent variety of independent translation and concludes : “ There appears to be only one answer to explain the word - for - word similarities between the verses of Isaiah in the Bible and the same verses in the Book of Mormon . ”
That is simply that Joseph Smith must have opened Isaiah and tested each mentioned verse by the Spirit : “ If his translation was essentially the same as that of the King James version , he apparently quoted the verse from the Bible . ”
31 Thus the Old Testament passages from Isaiah display a particular choice of phraseology that suggests Joseph Smith ’s general freedom throughout the Book of Mormon for optional wording .
" By the Gift and Power of God , " By Richard Lloyd Anderson , Ensign , September 1977 .
( emphasis in original )
It is clearly obvious that Joseph looked at a Bible , but this brings up a cunundrum : Witnesses to the translation process either do not mention , or vehemently deny , that any materials were consulted during the translation process other than the seer stones / urim & thummim .

Yet later on , in the Joseph Smith translation of the Bible , Joseph corrected many of the parts of the Sermon on the Mount .
So the question is , if the sermon on the mount was not translated correctly in the Bible , why then , is it the same incorrect translation in the Book of Mormon ?
Why is it not corrected like Joseph later did with his Bible translation ?
Critics say the obvious answer is that originally Joseph just copied the sermon on the mount out of the Bible .
It was n't until later he came up with the idea to fix the Bible .

View of the Hebrews was a very popular book published in New England in 1823 which said that the American Indians are really descended from Hebrews and that they came over here to America and separated into two factions , one civilized and one wild and bloodthirsty , and that there were lots of wars between them , and finally the wild faction wiped out the civilized faction .
The book begins with the destruction of Jerusalem , quotes a lot from Isaiah and also mentions a prophet standing on a wall saying " wo " unto the people , and the people shoot arrows at him ( pg 26 ) .
Parallels between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon
There are significant parallels between View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon .
B.H. Roberts ( 1857 -1933 ) , a prominent LDS scholar and apologist for the Book of Mormon , wrote Book of Mormon Difficulties : A Study , later published as Studies of the Book of Mormon .
In a letter to President Heber J. Grant and other church officials , Roberts urged " all the brethren herein addressed becoming familiar with these Book of Mormon problems , and finding the answer for them , as it is a matter that will concern the faith of the Youth of the Church now as also in the future , as well as such casual inquirers as may come to us from the outside world . "
Roberts discusses elements which he considers to be similar between the two books :
Origin of the inhabitants of the American continents
Roberts states that both View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon make the claim that the Hebrews " occupied the whole extent of the American continents . "
In addition , Roberts states that Mormon speakers and writers often ignorantly claim that the Book of Mormon was the first book to represent that the American Indians were descendents of Hebrews .
He points out that Ethan Smith and many other writers made this claim earlier , and that this idea was " very generally obtained throughout New England . "
A number of parallels presented by Roberts require the belief , as Roberts himself believed , that the people described in the Book of Mormon arrived at and populated an empty North and South American continent , and that all people on those continents descended from these people .
Destruction of Jerusalem
Roberts notes that the entire first chapter of View of the Hebrews describes the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70 .
He compares this to information given in first chapters of the Book of Mormon , in which Lehi prophesies of the destruction of Jerusalem prior to their leaving the area of the city around 600 B.C.E .
Stories of a " lost book "
An account is given in View of the Hebrews in which " an old Indian " stated that his ancestors " had a book which they had for a long time preserved , " but that " having lost the knowledge of reading it .
they buried it with an Indian chief . "
This is compared with Joseph Smith 's story of the retrieval of the golden plates from a stone box in the hill Cumorah in New York .
The discovery of what is claimed to be a Jewish phylactery by a " Mr. Merrick " is described in View of the Hebrews .
The item was dug out of the ground and " contained four folded leaves of old parchment . "
The leaves were described as being " dark yellow " and were said to contain Hebrew writing .
Roberts speculates that the " dark yellow " might suggest " gold color " and adds a note : " Query : Could all this have supplied structural work for the Book of Mormon ? "
Breastplate and the Urim and Thummim
Ethan Smith describes a breastplate " in resemblance of the Urim and Thummim " made of a white conch shell with two holes in it to which are fastened buckhorn white buttons " as if in imitation of the precious stones of the Urim . "
Roberts compares this to the Urim and Thummim which Joseph Smith said that he was given for the purpose of translating the plates .
Egyptian hieroglyphics
Hieroglyphic paintings found in the area New Mexico are described in View of the Hebrews .
Roberts writes " Was this sufficient to suggest the strange manner of writing the Book of Mormon in an altered Egyptian ? "
Barbarous and civilized people
Ethan Smith was challenged regarding his postulation of a highly civilized society among ancient Americans , which was in contrast with the nomadic lifestyle of the American Indians of his day .
Ethan Smith supposes that the Hebrews who arrived on the American continent split into two classes , and that " most of them fell into a wandering idle hunting life " but that " more sensible parts of this people associated together to improve their knowledge of the arts . "
Ethan Smith believed that the more civilized portion of this society separated from the more primitive group , who " lost the knowledge of their having descended from the same family . "
As a result of their " tremendous wars , " the civilized group " became extinct . "
This situation is compared to the story of the Nephites and Lamanites , who also split into two groups and had frequent wars , which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the more civilized Nephites .
It is noted by LDS scholars that in the Book of Mormon , the two groups retained their knowledge of having descended from the same family up until the time that the Nephites were destroyed , contrary to Smith 's supposition in View of the Hebrews that this knowledge was lost .
Isaiah and the scattering and gathering of Israel
Roberts points out that both View of the Hebrews and the Book of Mormon include extensive quotations from Isaiah regarding the scattering and future gathering of Israel .
Roberts adds the note " Query : Did the Author of the Book of Mormon follow too closely the course of Ethan Smith in this use of Isaiah would be a legitimate query . "
It is noted by LDS scholars that View of the Hebrews includes many scriptural prophecies about the restoration of Israel , including Deuteronomy 30 ; Isaiah 11 , 18 , 60 , 65 ; Jeremiah 16 , 23 , 30 - 31 , 35 - 37 ; Zephaniah 3 ; Amos 9 ; Hosea and Joel .
Of the scriptures cited , only Isaiah 11 appears in the Book of Mormon .
Quetzalcoatl
Ethan Smith discusses the legends of the " bearded white god " Quetzalcoatl and proposes that this " lawgiver " or " Mexican messiah " was actually Moses .
Ethan Smith also suggests that this belief held by the people of Mexico at the time of Montezuma allowed the Spanish to easily conquer the country because " the Mexicans mistook the white bearded invaders from the east for the descendents of their long cherished culture - hero Quetzalcoatl . "
Roberts note states " The legitimate query : did this character spoken of in the '' View of the Hebrews , '' published five years before the Book of Mormon , furnish the suggestion of the ' ' Christ ' ' on the '' Western Continent ?
Additional parallels include :
the future gathering of Israel and restoration of the Ten Lost Tribes
the peopling of the New World from the Old via a long journey northward which encountered " seas " of " many waters "
a religious motive for the migration
the description of extensive military fortifications with military observatories or " watch towers " overlooking them
a change from monarchy to republican forms of government
the preaching of the gospel in ancient America .
Both tell of prophets in ancient America
Both maintain that the purpose of America in the last days is to gather up the remnants of Israel , bringing them into Christianity , and bringing forth the millennium .
Joseph quotes View of the Hebrews in support of the Book of Mormon
There was a reference to View of the Hebrews within Joseph Smith 's lifetime coming from the prophet himself .
In an article published in the Times and Seasons on June 1 , 1842 , Joseph quoted View of the Hebrews in support of the Book of Mormon :
If such may have been the fact , that a part of the Ten Tribes came over to America , in the way we have supposed , leaving the cold regions of Assareth behind them in quest of a milder climate , it would be natural to look for tokens of the presence of Jews of some sort , along countries adjacent to the Atlantic .
In order to this , we shall here make an extract from an able work : written exclusively on the subject of the Ten Tribes having come from Asia by the way of Bherings Strait , by the Rev. Ethan Smith , Pultney , Vt. , who relates as follows : " Joseph Merrick , Esq. , a highly respectable character in the church at Pittsfield , gave the following account :
That in 1815 , he was leveling some ground under and near an old wood shed , standing on a place of his , situated on ( Indian Hill ) …
[ Joseph then discusses the supposed phylacteries found among Amerindians , citing View of the Hebrews p. 220 , 223 . ]
( Joseph Smith , Jr. , " From Priest 's American Antiquities , " ( 1 June 1842 ) Times and Seasons 3:813-815 . )

Early American influences in the Book of Mormon .
Early American influences in the Book of Mormon stand in direct contradiction to the testimonies of witnesses to Joseph Smith 's translation process .
" Translation " is a generous term considering the word - for - word dictation method as observed by those closest to Smith : scrying with his seer stone in his hat , delivering each word from the plates in order .
This leaves little room for Smith to add to what he saw in his stone .
( See the 2014 essay , " Book of Mormon Translation , " published on the LDS.org website verifying his scrying method , as well as Mormon Think 's comprehensive response to that essay . )
Yet , when compared to available contemporary writing , the Book of Mormon is shown repeatedly to borrow verbiage and phrases from its time ( examples of contemporaneous texts below ) .
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery always gave as their response to the translation method that they used the Urim and Thummim , which they always identified as the " Nephite Interpreters " found with the golden plates , in direct contrast to the rock - in - the - hat method as verified in the 2013 LDS essay linked to above .
It is readily apparent that the King James Bible was used to directly quote from , especially the Isaiah passages ( see Mormon Think 's treatment of this issue ) .
One must come to the conclusion that Joseph and Oliver were willing to , at the least , stretch the truth of the " translation " method .
Since we know the KJV bible was copied from directly , could n't they have easily copied from other sources as well ?
Defenders of Smith counter that any duplication of phrases between his Book of Mormon and contemporary sources are merely accidental anomalies generated through the permutation of a finite number of words .
If this be the case then the chiasmus and Hebraisms , often pointed to by many of Smith 's defenders , must suffer the same fate .
However , in the world of Book of Mormon apology , a faith - promoting parallel is taken as evidence of its divinity while more suspicious evidence of borrowing and plagiarism is considered insignificant .
Larry Morris of the pro-LDS group FARMS took the proper perspective in relation to this material when he said :
Believers in the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham have every reason to move cautiously when citing parallels in support of their belief because the use of parallels is a two - edged sword .
Critics of the Book of Mormon , for example , have long cited parallels between that book of scripture and Ethan Smith 's View of the Hebrews ( published before the Book of Mormon ) as evidence that Joseph Smith borrowed freely from Ethan Smith .
Similarly , Thomas E. Donofrio has recently attempted to prove that Joseph Smith drew on such sources as David Ramsay 's Life of George Washington and Mercy Otis Warren 's History of the Rise , Progress , and Termination of the American Revolution in producing the Book of Mormon . "
" The Book of Abraham : Ask the Right Questions and Keep on Looking , " FARMS Review 16/2 ( 2004 ) , p. 370 , fn. 29 .
A two edged sword indeed it is .
However , we believe there was enough material available in Joseph Smith 's environment to show that at the least , Joseph Smith 's Book of Mormon was simply a product of his time , nicely fitting in with the many other contemporaneous works that used scriptural language and covered many of the same themes as the Book of Mormon .
Contemporaneous texts to the Book of Mormon
This list is not exhaustive , but there is enough of a sample to show that the Book of Mormon is not unique to its time .
It must be stressed that although there are often strong parallels in some cases , it is not necessarily every critic 's belief that Joseph Smith directly plagiarized from any other source , but rather that he may have been influenced by these sources in some way .
If nothing else , it demonstrates that it was possible to create a book like the Book of Mormon without any supernatural means .
However , as noted above , it is not being completely ruled out that Joseph and Oliver may have had texts directly available in the place in which they penned the Book of Mormon .

Could others have helped Joseph ?
Joseph Smith may simply have had help from someone else to write the Book of Mormon .
Someone else may have written the Book of Mormon ( or most of it ) and Joseph was merely the one to deliver it to the world .
There are many theories regarding this idea .
They generally involve some combination of Joseph Smith , Oliver Cowdery , Sidney Rigdon and perhaps an author by the name of Solomon Spalding .
The Spalding theory often does not get much attention these days , although some feel there is significant information that worthy of further study .
It should be noted that most critics these days do not accept the theory as a source for the Book of mormon .
From the " Formerly Mormon " blog :
The Spalding - Rigdon
Theory proposes that the Book of Mormon is the product of a pious fraud orchestrated by Sidney Rigdon , a popular preacher in the 1820 's Christian Restoration movement .
More specifically , it proposes that Rigdon added Restoration doctrines and his own theology to the unpublished narratives of Spalding , then deceased , to create documents that were subsequently compiled and edited to produce the 1830 version of the Book of Mormon .
In executing this plan , Rigdon understood that the Book of Mormon would only be accepted as divinely approved if it could be brought to light through means that would appear supernatural .
He was also well known for the theology that he had added to the Book of Mormon , and thus needed a way to reveal the book without exposing his own role in its creation .
The answer came in the person of Joseph Smith , Jr. , a con man and master of the gold digging scam .
Smith 's charm and ability to induce belief made him an excellent Revelator .
For Smith , the " gold bible business " was a way to make money and to help his family escape poverty .
For Rigdon it was the springboard to leadership of a religious movement .
In carrying out this plan , however , Rigdon and Smith were concerned that their lack of education and " weakness in writing " would prevent timely completion of the book and its public acceptance .
So they secured the editorial assistance of Smith 's distant cousin - Oliver Cowdery , a schoolteacher with editing experience .
Historical evidence connecting Rigdon to Spalding Rigdon shared a post office with Solomon Spalding and evidently frequented a print ship where Spalding had left a manuscript entitled Manuscript Found .
For a time , the manuscript disappeared .
Spalding reportedly suspected Rigdon had taken it .
John Winter reported that Rigdon kept a copy of a Spalding manuscript in his study .
Witnesses familiar with Spalding 's Manuscript Found testified that it was similar to the Book of Mormon but lacked the religious content .
Rigdon and Spalding were independently named as authors before anyone was aware of a connection between them .
In 1839 , Rigdon wrote a letter denying his role in the composition of the Book of Mormon .
His letter contained demonstrable falsehoods .
In 1888 , Walter Sidney Rigdon - Sidney Rigdon 's grandson - said that his grandfather 's role in fabrication of the Book of Mormon was a family secret .
Textual and theological evidence implicating Rigdon
The theology of Alexander Campbell , Rigdon 's mentor , is sprinkled throughout the Book of Mormon .
On those issues where Rigdon and Campbell disagreed prior to 1830 , the Book of Mormon strongly endorses Rigdon 's views .
Sections of the Book of Mormon likely added after loss of the first 116 pages in June 1828 describe spiritual rebirth after baptism , consistent with Rigdon 's changed beliefs after meeting with Walter Scott in March 1828 .
The phrase " children of men " appears with exceptionally high frequency in those parts of the Book of Mormon that contain theological content reflecting Rigdon 's pre-1830 views .
Rigdon is known to have worked with Smith to produce The Book of Moses .
The phrase " children of men " appears with high frequency in those parts of The Book of Moses that contain theological content reflecting Rigdon 's pre-1830 views .
Historical evidence connecting Rigdon to Smith before 1830 Prior to 1830 , Rigdon reportedly made several statements in which he indicated his foreknowledge of the Book of Mormon and the impending rise of a new religion .
At a Reformed Baptist convention in Aug 1830 , Rigdon spoke of a fuller revelation about to come forth and the need for a complete restoration of the gospel .
Rigdon denied meeting Smith before 1830 , but several people reported seeing him at or near the Smith 's prior to that date and Rigdon 's calendar contains gaps at critical time periods when he would have had time to visit Smith .
In 1868 Rigdon wrote a letter in which he claimed to know the contents of the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon .
James Jeffery , a friend of Rigdon's , testified that in 1844 he heard Rigdon say that Smith used a Spalding manuscript to fabricate the Book of Mormon .
Historical evidence related to the long - term relationship between Rigdon and Smith Almost immediately after his baptism , Rigdon acted as though he was in charge of the church .
As soon as he officially met Smith , they began work on The Book of Moses , a scripture that endorses Rigdon 's 1828 " discovery " of spiritual rebirth after baptism .
In March of 1828 , the " Revelator " of The Book of Commandments and the Book of Mormon attempted to limit Smith 's role to translation only .
In 1863 Rigdon said that Smith was supposed to be the Translator and Ridgon the Gatherer of Israel .
Rigdon and Smith engaged in a see - saw power struggle that can be understood considering their vulnerabilities and co-dependency .
Rigdon and Smith collaborated on joint revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants .
They collaborated in changing revelations after the fact .
They collaborated on illegal financial transactions .
In 1844 Sidney Rigdon seized upon the opportunity of Smith 's death , instigating a cynical power grab , threatening to " expose the secrets of the church " and professing new revelations and visions

I worked with old and young Jo at farming .
I have frequently seen old Jo drunk .
Young
Jo had a forked witch - hazel rod with which he claimed he could locate buried money or hidden things .
Later he had a peep - stone which he put into his hat and looked into it .
I have seen both .
Joshua Stafford , a good citizen , told me that young Jo Smith and himself dug for money in his orchard and elsewhere nights .
All the money digging was done nights .
I saw the holes in the orchard which were four or five feet square and three or four feet deep .
Jo and others dug much about Palmyra and Manchester .
I have seen many of the holes .
The first thing he claimed to find was gold plates of the " Book of Mormon , " which he kept in a pillowcase and would let people lift , but not see .
I came to Ohio in 1818 , and became acquainted with Sydney Rigdon in 1820 .

Aside from those that claimed that Oliver Cowdery admitted that the Book of Mormon originated with Solomon Spalding 's unpublished manuscript , there are also witnesses that testified that Sidney Rigdon personally told them the same thing .
Here 's one of them :
STATEMENT OF JAMES JEFFERY .
I know more about the Mormons than any man east of the Alleghenies , although I have given no attention to the matter for twenty - five years .
I did not know I was in possession of any information concerning the Book of Mormon unknown to others .
I supposed that as Rigdon was so open with me , he had told others the same things .
Forty years ago I was in business in St. Louis .
The Mormons then had their temple in Nauvoo , Ill .
I had business transactions with them .
Sidney Rigdon I knew very well .
He was general manager of the affairs of the Mormons .
Rigdon , in hours of conversation told me a number of times there was in the printing office with which he was connected in Ohio , a manuscript of Rev. Spaulding , tracing the origin of the Indian race from the lost tribes of Israel ; that this manuscript was in the office for several years ; that he was familiar with it ; that Spaulding had wanted it printed , but had not the money to pay for the printing ; that he ( Rigdon ) and Joe Smith used to look over the manuscript and read it over Sundays .
Rigdon and Smith took the manuscript and said — " I 'll print it , " and went off to Palmyra , N. Y .
I never knew the information was of any importance — thought others were aware of these facts .
I do not now think the matter is of any importance .
It will not injure Mormonism .
That is an " ism , " and chimes in with the wishes of certain classes of people .
Nothing will put it down but the strong arm of the law .
Otherwise it will go on forever , like Tennyson 's " Brook . "
This is the substance of what I remember about the matter .

PALMYRA , Wayne Co. , N.Y. May 2 , 1879 .
I , Able D. Chase , now living in Palmyra , Wayne Co. , N.Y. , make the following statement regarding my early acquaintence with Joseph Smith and the incidents about the production of the so - called Mormon Bible .
I was well acquainted with the Smith family , frequently visiting the Smith boys and they me .
I was a youth at the time from twelve to thirteen years old , having been born Jan. 19 , 1814 , at Palmyra , N. Y .
During some of my visits at the Smiths , I saw a STRANGER there WHO THEY SAID WAS MR .
RIGDON .
He was at Smith 's several times , and it was in the year of 1827 when I first saw him there , as near as I can recollect .
Some time after that tales were circulated that young Joe had found or dug from the earth a BOOK OF PLATES which the Smiths called the GOLDEN BIBLE .
I do n't think Smith had any such plates .
He was mysterious in his actions .
The PEEPSTONE , in which he was accustomed to look , he got of my elder brother Willard while at work for us digging a well .
It was a singular looking stone and young Joe pretended he could discover hidden things in it
My brother Willard Chase died at Palmyra , N. Y. , March 10 , 1871 .
His affidavit , published in Howe 's " History of Mormonism , " is genuine .
Peter Ingersoll , whose affidavit was published in the same book , is also dead .
He moved West years ago and died about two years ago .
Ingersoll had the reputation of being a man of his word , and I have no doubt his sworn statement regarding the Smiths and the Mormon Bible is genuine .
I was also well acquainted with Thomas P. Baldwin , a lawyer and Notary Public , and Frederick Smith , a lawyer and magistrate , before whom Chase 's and Ingersoll 's depositions were made , and who were residents of this village at the time and for several years after .
ABEL D. CHASE .
Reference : Joseph Smith , His Family and Friends
Able D. Chase signed the above statement in our presence , and he is known to us and the entire community here as a man whose word is always the exact truth and above any possible suspicion .
PLINY T. SEXTON ,
J. H. GILBERT . *
The statement of Abel D. Chase is corroborated by a letter from J. H. Gilbert , addressed to Mr. Cobb , dated Palmyra , October 14 , 1879 .
Mr. Gilbert says :
Last evening I had about 15 minutes conversation with Mr. Lorenzo Saunders of Reading , Hillsdale Co. , Mich .
He has been gone about thirty years .
He was born south of our village in 1811 , and was a near neighbor of the Smith family — knew them all well ; was in the habit of visiting the Smith boys ; says he knows that RIGDON was hanging around Smith 's for EIGHTEEN MONTHS PRIOR TO THE PUBLISHING OF THE MORMON BIBLE . "
'' He ' found ' Joe Smith and they had a great many talks together befores they brought out the plates .
None of us ever doubted that they got the whole thing up ; but father always maintained that grandfather helped get up the original Spaulding book .
At any rate he got a copy very early and schemed on some way to make it useful .
Although the family knew these facts , they refused to talk on the subject while grandfather lived .
In fact , he and they took on a huge disgust at the whole subject . ''

A lost Spalding manuscript was found in Hawaii and LDS believers have said that puts the nail in the Spalding Theory coffin .
The manuscript that was discovered was Manuscript Story , not Manuscript Found , even though it was given that name later on , perhaps as wishful thinking so the Spalding theory would die .
Yet discussions have included both names over the years .
So then if there was only one manuscript , then it was / is Manuscript Story , and Manuscript Found does n't exist , unless it is indeed the second manuscript , the one which Solomon Spalding did indeed submit to a print shop in Pittsburgh .
The point of contention then becomes whether that manuscript later became the basis for the Book of Mormon .
Ethan Smith - the author of A View of the Hebrews was Oliver Cowdery 's minister from 1823 - 1828 - they both are from Poultney , VT .
This is also where the book was published .
Solomon Spalding was also a classmate of Ethan Smith and both were graduates of the same religious college .
Some people believe that both Ethan and Solomon 's works are plagiarized in the Book of Mormon .

A recent book has come forth entitled Who really Wrote the Book of Mormon - The Spalding Enigma .
This volume examines the origins of the Book of Mormon based upon a hypothesis of the Spalding Enigma .
The Pro-Mormon challenge of " supplying a more plausible account " is hereby met .
The organization Spalding Research Associates continues to research this theory .
Editor Comments :
We do n't necessarily support the Spalding theory ; however , if this theory is true then it neatly answers many of the concerns that faithful members have who question the Church .
It may or may not be true , but it 's certainly an interesting proposition .
The following quotes from " Manuscript Found " makes one wonder .
This was written by Solomon Spalding who died in 1816 and who appears to have had ties to Joseph Smith 's associates :
NEAR the west Bank of the Coneaught River there are the remains of an ancient fort .
As I was walking and forming various conjectures respecting the character situation & numbers of those people who far exceeded the present Indians in works of art and inginuety , I hapned to tread on a flat stone .
This was at a small distance from the fort , it lay on the top of a great small mound of Earth exactly horizontal .
The face of it had a singular appearance .
I discovered a number of characters , which appeared to me to be letters , but so much effaced by the ravages of time , that I could not read the inscription .
With the assistance of a leaver I raised the stone .
But you may easily conjecture my astonishment when I discovered that its ends and sides rested on stones & that it was designed as a cover to an artificial Cave .
I found by examining that its sides were lined with stones built in a connical form with down , & that it was about eight feet deep .
Determined to investigate the design of this extraordinary work of antiquity , I prepared myself with the necessary requisites for that purpose and descended to the Bottom of the Cave .
Observing one side to be perpendicular nearly three feet from the bottom , I began to inspect that part with accuracy .
Here I noticed a big flat stone fixed in the form of a doar .
I immediately tore it down and lo , a cavity within the wall presented itself ; it being about three feet in diameter from side to side and about two feet high .
Within this cavity I found an earthen box with a cover which shut it perfectly tight .
The box was two feet in length one and half in breadth and one and three inches in diameter .
My mind filled with awful sensations which crowded fast upon me (( and ) ) would hardly permit my hands to remove this venerable deposit , but curiosity soon gained the ascendancy (( and ) ) the box was taken and raised to open ( ( its cover . ) )
When I had removed the cover I found that it contained twenty - eight ( ( rolls ) ) of parchment ; and that when ( ( examined ) ) appeared to be manuscripts written in elegant hand with ROMAN letters and in the Latin Language .
They were written on a variety of subjects .
But the roll which principally attracted my attention contained a history of the author 's life and that part of America which extends along the Great Lakes and the waters of the Mississippi .
Extracts of the most interesting and important matters contained in this roll I take the liberty to publish .
Gentle Reader , tread lightly on the ashes of the venerable dead .
Thou must know that this country was once inhabited by great and powerful nations , considerably civilized and skilled in the arts of war ; and that on ground where thou ( ( now ) ) treadest many a bloody battle hath been fought , and heroes by thousands have been made to bite the dust .
This sounds familiar .

Modern contextual analysis - Chris Johnson
As more books from the early 1800s are digitized and made available , large computer databases are being developed with thousands of books leading to computer - aided studies looking for commonalities and word phrase matches between various books .
There are similarities and word phrases common among almost all contemporary books .
Chris Johnson developed computer algorithms to analyze a database of over 100,000 books and compare them to the Book of Mormon .
One of the more interesting matches was with The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain - see the comparison study .

Translating speed of the Book of Mormon
One marvel is the very rapidity with which Joseph was translating — at an estimated average rate of eight of our printed pages per day !
The total translation time was about 65 working days .
( See " How long did it take Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon ? " Ensign , Jan. 1988 , 47 . )
By comparison , one able LDS translator in Japan , surrounded by reference books , language dictionaries , and translator colleagues ready to help if needed , indicated that he considered an output of one careful , final page a day to be productive .
And he is retranslating from earlier Japanese to modern Japanese !
More than 50 able English scholars labored for seven years , using previous translations , to produce the King James Version of the Bible , averaging about one precious page per day .
The Prophet Joseph Smith would sometimes produce 10 pages per day !
" By the Gift and Power of God , " Elder Neal A. Maxwell Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , Ensign , January 1997 .
Devout Mormons believe Joseph translated the Book of Mormon in 60 - 90 days .
If true this would lend credibility to Joseph Smith 's explanation of the Book of Mormon 's existence as it would have been difficult for Joseph ( or perhaps anyone ) to come up with the whole Book of Mormon in such a short period of time .
The writing of the first 116 pages was " painfully slow … since Joseph was just learning to translate , " a long and difficult process at best .
Yet less than a year later he completes a 275,000 word manuscript in three months .
[ This three month 's translation feat is something Nibley and other apologists frequently flaunt as ' proof ' of the Book of Mormon 's authenticity .
I heard Nibley claim on another occasion that it took only 60 days to write the entire Book of Mormon .
The methodology used in computing translation time is seriously flawed .
The lost 116 pages , according to the text of the Book of Mormon itself , is essentially duplicated in the subsequent version which we now have as First and Second Nephi .
That takes up a significant amount of the 275,000 words .
The first 116 pages took months to create alone .
During the interim period , after the manuscript was lost , of about a year ( which Nibley and others do n't include in the calculation ) Joseph was n't doing much of anything .
He did n't have a job .
He could have easily been coming up with text for the book .
Joseph Smith 's mother stated that Joseph was telling stories about the Indians from the time he was young .
The plot and narrative could have been worked on for two or three years or more .
Nibley 's assertion that it was done in only two or three months is pure speculation at best .
Considering that the content of the Book of Mormon is largely borrowed and adapted from the KJV of the Bible , the time involved to ' translate ' need not be significant anyway .
Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon April , May , and June 1829 .
However , he was thinking about it since at least 1823 and he had a practice run doing the lost 116 pages in April - June 1828 with Martin Harris .
Per LDS Historian Grant Palmer
The following is a plausible scenario for how the Book of Mormon came to be .
After Joseph 's marriage to Emma Hale in January 1827 , he promised his father - in - law that he would give up treasure hunting .
Influenced by the revival fervor and by his mother 's piety , his mind began to fill with impressions that blended his familiarity with Indian lore and his conviction of biblical promises .
Perhaps the outline of a book began to form sometime before Martin Harris became his scribe in April 1828 .
He had already experimented with seer stones , and perhaps he thought that through greater faith and concentrations , God would open to his mind a vision of the secrets of the artifacts being discovered in upstate New York .
The dictation proceeded , and after Martin lost the first 116 pages of transcription in mid-1828 , this may have been fortuitous .
An apprenticeship had been served , and the vision that was unfolding in Joseph 's mind may have become more clear .
The dictation probably progressed haltingly at first , perhaps as a kind of stream - of - consciousness narrative .
Before Oliver Cowdery became his new scribe in April 1829 , the prophet had had nine months to ponder the details of the plots and subplots and to flesh out the timeline .
Given his familiarity with the Bible and with American antiquities , it would have become progressively easier for him to put form to vision .
He dictated the final manuscript in about ninety days .
Over the next eight months , before the book was published in March 1830 , he had the opportunity to make textual refinements .
He thus had three years to develop , write , and refine the book - six years from the time he told his family about the project .
An Insider 's View of Mormon Origins , Grant Palmer , pp 66 - 67 .
It should also take into consideration the fact that Joseph Smith had years to come up with text and plot .
There are tons of books , far superior in writing style and story line , that did n't take nearly as long as the Book of Mormon did to complete .
It may have been dictated in 90 days but he had been working on it , if only in his head , for years .
Of course if the Spalding theory has any validity to it , the translating speed is not an issue at all as he would have basically been dictating a book already written .

What about Emma Smith ?
When answering critics about if Joseph could have written the Book of Mormon , Joseph 's wife Emma has stated that he was incapable of writing anything like the Book of Mormon .
Two issues are often brought up by supporters of Joseph regarding Emma : 1 ) the walls of Jerusalem and 2 ) that Joseph could pick up dictation where he left off .
Emma gives an example that in the process of translating , Joseph Smith was surprised to see a reference to Jerusalem surrounded by walls as he did n't seem to know that Jerusalem had walls around it .
Emma had to inform him of that .
This experience helped Joseph seem more credible as a prophet in Emma 's eyes .
… one time while he was translating he stopped suddenly , pale as a sheet , and said , " Emma , did Jerusalem have walls around it ? "
When I answered , " Yes , " he replied " Oh ! I was afraid I had been deceived . "
He had such a limited knowledge of history at that time that he did not even know that Jerusalem was surrounded by walls
Edmund C. Briggs , " A Visit to Nauvoo in 1856 , " Journal of History Vol. 9 No. 2 .
Critic 's Comment : If Joseph was indeed committing a fraud , but wanted to convince his wife that he was really translating an ancient document , then that is exactly the kind of thing that Joseph would do .
He simply acted like he did n't know that Jerusalem had walls so she would think he was translating from another document and not merely making it up .
Or if the Book of Mormon came from another source such as Sidney Rigdon , then he may have been genuinely surprised to read that and simply stated as such .
It is also possible that Emma 's recollection
It is well known that Joseph read and studied the Bible .
There are numerous Bible verses that mention Jerusalem 's walls :
1 Kgs. 3:1 - 1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt , and took Pharaoh 's daughter , and brought her into the city of David , until he had made an end of building his own house , and the house of the Lord , and the wall of Jerusalem round about .
1 Kgs. 9:15 - 15
And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the Lord , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
2 Kgs. 14:13 - 13
And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth - shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
2 Kgs. 25:10 - 10
And all the army of the Chaldees , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about .
Neh .
2:13 , 17 - 13
And I went out by night by the gate of the valley , even before the dragon well , and to the dung port , and viewed the walls of Jerusalem , which were broken down , and the gates thereof were consumed with fire .
17 ¶ Then said I unto them , Ye see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
2 Chr. 25:23 - 23
And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth - shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The sweeping Wall Street reform bill moving through the U.S. Congress calls for no fewer than 39 studies -- an impressive level of trying to look busy while dodging controversy , even by Washington standards .
In what amounts to a full employment act for policy analysts , the 2,300 - page bill seeks further inquiry on topics ranging from " ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae FNM.N ( and ) Freddie Mac FRE.N " to " oversight of carbon markets . "
One study is supposed to look into the “ effect of drywall presence on foreclosures , ” while another targets “ the macroeconomic effects of risk retention requirements . ”
Some of the reports that result may influence future decision - making , but most will probably just gather dust .
“ In theory , there ’s nothing wrong with Congress mandating studies .
It can really enhance the legislature ’s fact - finding ability , ” said Raj Date , head of the Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy , a research group .
“ In practice , such studies are only useful if Congress still cares about the issue when the results come back .
And the maximum that Congress will care about these issues is right now .
It only goes downhill from here . ”
The House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the most thorough overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s .
The Senate is expected to do the same in mid-July , although Democrats are still scrambling to nail down the votes for it .
Over more than a year of debate , Congress examined several reform proposals that would have made the bill even more hard - hitting and then , in a time - honored practice , put off decisions and ordered studies instead .
“ PATHETIC DISPLAY ”
The study bonanza “ evidences a lack of understanding and vision by the Congress -- pathetic display in the face of bank lobbying blitz , ” said Christopher Whalen , managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics , a bank research firm .
From early in the debate , reformers split between those who wanted to break up the big Wall Street firms and those who argued it would be sufficient to ring - fence the mega - firms with new regulations to reduce risk and bolster stability .
The bank busters lost , but got a study on “ the size and complexity of financial institutions . ”
On another front , Democratic Senator Al Franken had a proposal to shake up widely criticized credit rating agencies by interposing a government board between them and their clients , at least for rating new structured securities .
The Franken plan proved too radical for Congress , but the bill mandates a two - year study of the issue by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
If the agency ca n’t come up with a better idea , then it has to enact Franken ’s board .
“ When Congress wants to sidestep an issue rather than resolving it , they call for a study .
The studies can use up lots of resources and Congress typically ignores them , making them a waste of money , ” said the SEC ’s former chief accountant , Lynn Turner , a senior adviser at the consulting firm LECG .
What about the revolving door between the SEC and major corporate law firms and Wall Street ?
The steady flow of lawyers through this lucrative portal undermines the SEC ’s independence and aggressiveness , critics have said for years .
There ’s a study in the bill on that , too .

Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from natto , a Japanese traditional food made from fermented soybeans .
It is extracted , purified and then manufactured in either tablet or capsule form for convenience purposes and also to accommodate those people who are not fond of the slippery texture and pungent smell and taste of the natto .
Several articles and studies have discussed the health benefits of this enzyme on preventing diseases such as strokes , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis , phlebitis , and pulmonary embolism .
This enzyme is taken orally and is a cheaper but more potent alternative to Urokinase .
It does n’t have the side effects that anticoagulant medications have .
It has also been proven to have a longer effect inside the body when compared to Urokinase , another enzyme with similar effects but is extracted from urine .
The latter is more expensive , lasts only for a shorter duration and can only be administered intravenously when compared to nattokinase .
Research has also shown that nattokinase has four times greater clot - dissolving properties than plasmin , a naturally occurring enzyme in the body .
When we have wounds or cuts our bodies produce proteins known as , fibrinogens , which act on the injured site to stop bleeding by forming mesh work of fibers to create blood clots .
There are several proteins in our body that serve as fibrinogens but only one protein known as plasmin to counter its effects .
Plasmin is a fibrinolytic enzyme that serves to dissolve blood clots and prevents thrombosis in the body .
But as we age , our body gradually produces lesser amounts of this protein needed to break down clots or plaques that have formed within our blood vessels .
In addition to that , the fibrinogen or blood clotting factors in our bodies increases as we age , while plasmin levels continue to decrease .
This leads to an imbalance wherein there is more clot formation than clot dissolution leading to blockage of an artery or an organ that may eventually lead to diseases .
Nattokinase can help improve this by directly acting on the blood in order to dissolve blood clots .
It also enhances the body ’s production of plasmin and thus , also acts as preventative agent to hinder blood clots formation in our arteries and organs .
Nattokinase side effects
There are no known or reported side effects , toxicity or allergic reactions when using Nattokinase .
Although the effects of nattokinase in healthy people are still unknown , they are not advised to take them as health supplements for it may cause spontaneous bruising and bleeding .
People with bleeding disorders and those on warfarin medication such as Coumadin or other anti-coagulant drugs should not take nattokinase .
This enzyme can lower blood pressure and may interfere with the effectiveness of anticoagulants .
It may also cause internal bleeding in some patients .
Do not take nattokinase if you are taking Vitamin K or medications for your blood pressure , or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding .
Always consult your doctor before taking any health supplements to prevent any unwanted drug interactions .
Comments
The onset was fast .
It was December 2003 and the midnight screech of police sirens , usually no more than irritating , suddenly seemed deafening and unbearable .
Sleepless and paranoid , I would wander the house at 3 am seeking spy equipment .
In the daytime , flickering TVs and " wrong number " callers to my mobile , things others would hardly register , seemed to signal imminent danger .
And hovering helicopters zoomed in on my every move with sophisticated zoom - lens technology .
At the time , I believed that I was at the centre of a conspiracy populated by a quasi terrorist gang of scriptwriters , songwriters and presenters who communicated with me via the TV , radio and computers .
This group of people , who I believed lived in London art squats , wanted me to suffer excruciating , lifelong physical pain in prison .
After six weeks of terror , no sleep and exasperatedly trying to explain my conspiracy theory to anyone who would listen – including Stafford Police – my mother took me to the GP .
" Your thoughts are n't quite right , Erica , " the GP explained calmly .
I protested : " But I 'm sure these people are out to get me ... I can provide evidence ! "
" I think we should get you in with a psychiatrist as soon as possible . "
I thought he was a total idiot for having no interest in what I thought was revolutionary criminal activity from the heart of London 's art squats and my feelings of terror remained as they had been for weeks beforehand .
A few days later I had a consultation with a psychiatrist .
This was at St George 's Hospital in Stafford , otherwise mercilessly dubbed by locals as the Nut House , generally regarded as a place populated by the pitiful .
We agreed I should try a medication called Amisulpride , an anti-psychotic , on a daily basis .
But I remained convinced that these squatters were after me despite the psychiatrist , Dr Srinivasan , referring to my theory as a " false belief " .
Still , I responded well to the medication and stabilised quickly .
But it was n't until much later that I was diagnosed with " paranoid psychosis " .
At the time I wondered if had schizophrenia , as that 's what the tablet 's leaflet says it helps .
It was all a little confusing .
Nevertheless my family were relieved that I was getting help and I generally did n't mention it to friends , partly because I believed that were involved in the conspiracy , too .
While I could rationalise that they were n't , I could also rationalise how offensive it might be to mention how I thought they were trying to do me over .
I now know psychosis is not a condition in itself , but a symptom .
Around one in 200 people will have a psychotic episode at some point , and may find it hard to distinguish between what is real and what is imagined , sometimes seeing or hearing things that are not there .
Sufferers are often terrified , so the fear they inspire in others seems ironic .
The worst reaction came from my employers .
Shortly after seeking help and seeing the psychiatrist , but before the medication had taken full effect , I broke down in the office reception .
A man had come in to fix the office fax machine but I believed he was installing spy equipment into it , to monitor me .
I cried and spoke of my conspiracy theory ( which apparently translated to them as gibberish ) for about 10 minutes before calming down .
Then I took two days off before returning to work .
The following week , I mentioned I had a doctor 's appointment , but omitted to mention that it was a follow - up with a psychiatrist .
However , my boss enquired : " Is this to do with what happened the other day ? "
And I said , " Yes . "
Very shortly afterwards I was called to a meeting with my boss and the office manager and they said what had happened meant I could n't do the job .
There was too much risk it might happen again .
I was speechless for all but a few minutes before being shown the back door " to save any embarrassment " .
While they outlined my right to appeal , I was in no state for an employment battle and felt ashamed anyway .
Despite the fact that I was quickly stabilising on medication at this point , the impact of such treatment led me to contemplate suicide .
The terror had subsided and I was left feeling hopeless and desperate .
If I was n't part of a plot , then I was insane .
It felt like a lose - lose situation in which I 'd be locked - up either way .
And I 'd lost my job .
I could n't see a way out but I had all these pills to hand .
As luck would have it , I received three text messages from friends as I stared at a handful of pills under the duvet .
It was enough to put the pills down and put the kettle on to mull things over .
Days later I drastically decided to move to New York – to run away .
I 'd lived there briefly before and found it a great place to dissolve into .
My life was a mess , I 'd had a trauma and I needed to turn the page and bugger off for a bit .
Before departing to the States I remember peering over a nurses shoulder at my medical notes as I was getting undressed for a smear .
" Psychotic " .
There it was .
It was a frightening word .
Even I was afraid of me and what that meant I 'd do .
And although I was stabilised by this point , I still feared prison as much as I feared being sectioned .
I immediately decided not to have children , because I might murder them .
It took a long time for me to realise that I was n't a threat to other people .
So it does n't surprise me that anti-stigma campaign Time to Change found that 44 per cent of people in the UK believe people with a mental health diagnosis are potentially violent .
If that 's the case , what good is a diagnosis ?
My official one is " paranoid psychosis " , but various psychiatrists have suggested I use " nervous disorder " or even the slightly odd " acute disability " when I raise it with potential employers .
According to Mind , more than half of people would not employ the person they thought was the best candidate during an interview if they had disclosed a mental health problem .
The general consensus is that I got sick through a combination of stress and smoking skunk ( something I was doing to quell the stress , ironically ) .
However , since 2003 I 've been taking medication , thus successfully managing my psychosis without too much problem , while also trying to talk frankly about it through my writing .
However , stigma still looms .
Since returning from New York , I 've experienced ostracism and many a frosty reception from groups and individuals while working in PR , retail and moonlighting as a journalist .
Rebuffs like this are mostly the result of slightly eccentric ideas I share with colleagues without thinking them through .
I often feel anxious around people , which sometimes makes me act in haste .
I 'm so sensitive to these results and they only compound my paranoid thoughts that people are out to get me .
It 's upsetting .
So much so that today I work from home as a freelance journalist and content writer in order to avoid other people as much as possible .
Before going freelance full - time late last year , writing online content and articles , I was teaching at a university and some of my students at the time started a link on Facebook which ridiculed the paranoid symptoms I 'd shared in a newspaper interview that was still on the internet .
The comments were really unpleasant .
It was a rude awakening and I concur that the worst part of my so - called mental illness is what society thinks it means .
People too often forget that there 's a difference between mad and bad .
During my meltdown in December 2003 , I did n't squash a fly .
Nor did I go on a murder spree , blow up any buildings or run around naked with a banana up my bottom causing a public nuisance .
A friend with a diagnosis of bipolar illness sometimes holds the belief that she 's a Hindu god .
How many Hindu Gods would act in an aggressive way ?
It might be the response of a sane person to get the facts before passing judgement or forming opinion .
According to Mind , it 's a fact that there 's more chance of being killed by lightning than by someone with a mental illness .
Compared with all killings , the number committed by people with mental health problems has actually fallen to a little more than 1 in 10 ( and only a fraction of these are attacks by random strangers ) .
Arguably , more people will experience psychotic symptoms without ever receiving a diagnosis of a mental health problem , too .
So does my diagnosis mean I 'm mad ?
No more than you are , I think .
So long as it's managed with medication I 'm okay and not overwhelmingly , or astoundingly , paranoid or psychotic .
I have a small circle of close friends that are the best in the world .
I work independently and have even started my own fashion label , Medfed , which is colourful and fun .
It aims to challenge the bleak mental health stereotypes that are often in the media .
In groups and with individuals , I 'm still a little awkward , even angry sometimes .
I get overly nervous , sweaty or excited around new , loud , terribly clever or attractive people .
Tories tend to scare me somewhat , too .
But this is surely the response of a sane person .
Mental illness – how to help
* One in four adults will experience a mental health problem at some point in their life and 87 per cent of people with mental health problems reported the negative impact of stigma and discrimination on their lives , according to the Stigma Shout survey .
* If a friend or loved one is mentally ill , be there to talk and listen .
Most mentally ill people report being afraid to talk about their problems , because they fear people 's reactions .
If someone talks to you , acknowledge their problem and let them know you 're there for them .
* Be understanding and supportive .
When people with mental health problems do speak up , the majority report being misunderstood by family members , ignored by friends and work colleagues , or called names and much worse by neighbours .
Be sensitive to their situation and respect their feelings .
* Make time to stay in touch .
Include them in your day - to - day activities , such as going shopping , going to the pub or taking a holiday .
* Ask how you can help .
People may want support at different times and in different ways .
* Keep in mind that having a mental health problem is just one part of the person .
People do n't want to be defined by their mental illness .
The Time to Change campaign , run by the mental health charities Mind and Rethink , aims to end the stigma and discrimination faced by people with mental health problems .

PyvaScript - Pythonic syntax for your browser
Update ( 2019 ) : If you 're interested in programming languages , you should follow Waldemar 's new AI - based , declarative programming language Ensody .
Hey , after a lot of work in the last few weeks I 'm finally ready to introduce you to one of our latest projects called PyvaScript .
It 's a new scripting language for your client side code with a syntax inspired by our favorite language Python . :)
So let 's take a closer look at what Waldemar conjured up .
We all know the pain resulting from switching between programming languages .
Writing web projects using Django means to code in Python on the server side and ( mostly ) to code in JavaScript on the client side .
Switching between both languages leads to many bugs and forces us to think differently in each language .
This becomes even worse if we first write much of the code in one of both languages over a longer period of time and then switch over to the other one .
In the end the result means unnecessary work .
The goal of PyvaScript is to solve this problem by giving you the possibility to use a Python like syntax as well as common functions from Python wherever that is possible on the client side too .
Thus PyvaScript addresses developers who love Python while still being able to write fast code and interface with JS .
Diving in
So let 's see what PyvaScript looks like :
# demo. pyva li_elements = { ' First message ' : ' < li > I want you to feel pain , </ li > ' , ' Second message ' : ' < li > to think about pain , </ li > ' , ' Third message ' : ' < li > to accept pain , </ li > ' , ' Fourth message ' : ' < li > to know pain .
-- Tsunade </ li >' , } $ ( document ) .ready ( def ( ) : ul = $ ( " #ul " ) for key in li_elements : ul.append(li_elements[key ] ) )
This simple example demonstrates some key features of PyvaScript .
First you see that PyvaScript wipes out semicolons as well as curly braces used to form blocks .
Second you can see how to use the for - in - loop we all know and love from Python .
Third it demonstrates the ability to use multi-line lambda functions which we are used to from JavaScript thus combining clean syntax with JavaScript features .
And fourth you see that PyvaScript allows to use forbidden characters in Python like " $ " for variable names .
This allows PyvaScript to use JavaScript libraries without having to write any wrapper .
In this example it 's jQuery .
Now run
compile - pyva.py demo.
pyva
from within the shell to compile the code to JavaScript .
This creates a new file called " demo.js " .
( note that you have to install PyMeta 2 via setup.py install first )
Now you can add " demo.js " to your html file .
But before this you have to include PyvaScript's " stdlib.js " containing function definitions used by the compiled source file .
So put the following line into the head section of your html files before any compiled PyvaScript file :
... < script src=" stdlib.js " type = " text / javascript " ></ script > < script src=" demo.js " type = " text / javascript " ></ script > ...
That 's it .
Your first PyvaScript can now run in your browser . :)
What 's different to Javascript ?
There are still some differences to JavaScript .
These are :
PyvaScript only supports the for - in - loop and optimizes it at compile time .
You do n't have to use the keyword var anymore to define local variables .
anymore to define local variables .
Global variables can be defined using the keyword global .
You still can use window.var_definition but it 's cleaner to use global .
.
You still can use but it 's cleaner to use .
You have to use isinstance instead of instanceof .
instead of .
Functions are defined via the keyword def instead of function .
instead of .
We started to add common functions from Python to PyvaScript .
At the moment you can use join on strings as well as append , insert and extend on arrays while still being able to use push instead of append for example .
Additionally you can use the range function in for - loops .
Beside these points PyvaScript behaves just like JavaScript .
What 's different to Python ?
While trying to stay as close as possible to Python there are still some differences :
tuple objects are just lists .
This means that they are mutable .
PyvaScript does neither support keyword arguments nor classes nor any other complex features from Python .
You can use multi-line lambda functions .
You can use characters like " $ " as the first character for variable names .
This allows you to interact with other JavaScript libraries like jQuery which otherwise would only be possible with additional wrapper code .
Potential pitfalls
In order to make PyvaScript work you have to keep two things in mind :
You have to include PyvaScripts " stdlib.js " before any of your compiled PyvaScript files .
Never call a function JS .
PyvaScript defines a function called JS by itself to allow the use of native JavaScript code in PyvaScript so that you can write something like JS ( ' for ( var i=0 ; i< 5 ; i++) alert ( i ) ; ') which would n't be possible with PyvaScript .
As this is the first version of PyvaScript we will try to extend it wherever possible so that switching between languages will be even less painful .
In particular we will focus on the following steps
Extending PyvaScript with standard methods for strings , lists , ...
Combining PyvaScript with the PyJS compiler from PyJamas
The last point is especially interesting because PyJS emulates many features from Python .
It even includes many modules from Python , sys is just one example .
So why use PyvaScript ?
As it turns out , PyJS emulates many features , therefore being not able to produce high - performance code .
Additionally there is no easy way to use native JavaScript libraries without having to write wrappers .
PyvaScript is intended to focus on these issues while leaving the emulation of complex features in PyJS .
Thus PyvaScript aims to close this gap and to allow flawless interaction with PyJS .
So stay tuned to PyvaScript development .
There is more to come .
Oops .
AT&T has egg on its face after leaving sensitive information on 114,000 owners of the iPad 3G exposed on the Web .
A group known as Goatse Security has published the personal e-mail addresses of the victims -- many of whom are popular celebrities , prominent executives and high - ranking dignitaries -- that it obtained by exploiting an automated script on an AT&T server .
The true motive behind Goatse Security exposing this information is unknown .
Had the group followed generally accepted vulnerability disclosure ethics , it would have contacted AT&T directly to notify them of the flaw , and allowed AT&T a reasonable amount of time to respond to the issue before announcing the discovery .
And , of course , an ethical disclosure would not include exposing the compromised data .
Perhaps Goatse Security simply wanted to embarrass AT&T or Apple .
The official statement I received from an AT&T spokesperson reads :
" AT&T was informed by a business customer on Monday of the potential exposure of their iPad ICC IDS .
The only information that can be derived from the ICC IDS is the e-mail address attached to that device .
This issue was escalated to the highest levels of the company and was corrected by Tuesday ; and we have essentially turned off the feature that provided the e-mail addresses .
The person or group who discovered this gap did not contact AT&T .
We are continuing to investigate and will inform all customers whose e-mail addresses and ICC IDS may have been obtained .
We take customer privacy very seriously and while we have fixed this problem , we apologize to our customers who were impacted . "
Thankfully , the data leak did not include more sensitive data such as credit card number or home address .
While the individuals involved in the data compromise might need a stronger spam filter -- or simply new e-mail addresses -- there is n't any real security concern resulting from the breach .
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , and Diane Sawyer of ABC News may be inundated with unwanted e-mail of all sorts , but most spam today is simply mass distributed to all possible combinations at a given domain .
It 's more likely that famous personalities might see an influx of unwanted messages from average citizens .
What was included aside from the e-mail address is the ICC - ID of each individual 's iPad 3G .
The ICC - ID , or integrated circuit card identifier , is a unique code assigned to the SIM chip in the iPad which allows it to connect with AT&T's 3G network .
There have been some concerns expressed over whether exposing the ICC - ID opens up any additional security repercussions .
But , a Gawker report on the incident quotes Emmanuel Gadaix , a Nokia veteran , explaining that while there have been " vulnerabilities in GSM crypto discovered over the years , none of them involve the ICC ID ... as far as I know , there are no vulnerability or exploit methods involving the ICC ID . "
The fact that there is little to no security concern resulting from the data breach offers some consolation to the 114,000 affected iPad 3G owners .
However , it does n't do much for AT&T 's reputation with customers or its credibility with Apple .

Radio - frequency I.D. ( RFID ) tags are a convenient way to track items and cut costs for companies .
But this technology is increasingly being used to track other things , like security badges — or even people — giving it the potential to cause a horrific erosion of privacy .
Tracking people with smart tags , their shopping preferences , their activities , and their personal belongings sounds like something from a sci - fi thriller .
But
If you got your panties in a twist over Walmart 's decision to track your undies via RFID smart tags , then you 'll be doublely concerned at how close we are to cradle - to - grave surveillance .
RFID tags reached a tipping point with Walmart 's announcement that , starting next month , the retailer will place removable " smart tags " on consumer goods .
The RFID tags can be read by hand - held scanners to track inventory levels and keep a better eye on loss prevention .
Recent drops in the cost per RFID tags have encouraged adoption of this technology .
With Wal - Mart publicly embracing RFID , you 'll see other retailers quickly fall in line .
The RFID revolution : in pictures
If your trash is filled with RFID tags , your trash could be exploited by cybercriminals ( driving by with a RFID reader ) .
Perhaps consumers should be advised to trash the offending tag before they leave Walmart parking lot ?
I ’m honestly less concerned that cybercriminals will be cataloging an individual ’s purchases via their trash than I am about RFID becoming " spychips " — using the RFID technology to track the whereabouts of citizens who have no idea they are being tracked .
RFID chips are already embedded into passports and other everyday items .
These potential - privacy - decimating spychips can be the size of a dust speck .
I ’m not railing against all creative uses for RFID tracking .
There are uses for it that are n’t intended to be violations of your privacy ( though in the wrong hands , who knows ? )
A project called " RememberMe " was started earlier this year as a way of recording memories by tracking clothes and other objects by tagging them with an RFID tag and Quick Response ( QR ) codes .
When the owners of the objects donate them to the shop , a research assistant would record brief stories about the donated objects into a microphone : where they acquired it , the memories attached and any associated stories .
Everyone that participates volunteers to do so — so no one ’s privacy is violated in this case .
Food is tracked with RFID for freshness and any possible contamination .
A company came out with the world 's smartest coffee mug that was embedded with RFID to store the owner 's account information , purchase habits , and preferences .
Perhaps your business has utilized RFID tracking with products such as Microsoft 's BizTalk RFID Mobile ?
Many companies now use RFID tracking , be it in employee badges or for product tracing .
When it comes to using RFID to track humans and our whereabouts , that 's when my hackles get raised .
Not that this is new either .
In 2007 , after newspapers reported on a controversial program designed to compile massive dossiers of data on most every American , the website for Total Information Awareness was taken down .
People naturally freaked out at the privacy invasion .
But the idea is far from dead .
How about if governments started using RFID to issue automated ticket violations ?
As part of a project called ASSET - Road , VTT Technical Research Center in Finland , has developed RFID license plate tracking .
The project began in 2008 and will wrap in June , 2011 .
VTT attempts to detect traffic congestion but it also achieved the goal of “ traffic violations detected in a flash . ”
And then Arizona - based camera vendor American Traffic Solutions ( ATS ) expanded upon that RFID technology by developing automated tailgating tickets as a feature that can soon be added to existing speed camera programs .
Now add in this bit of info :
There are also drivers licenses that " come equipped with radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) tags that can be read right through a wallet , pocket or purse from as far away as 30 feet . "
Along similar lines is a company using RFID to track employees .
An Indian company , Unity Infraprojects , uses RFID employee tags to keep track of so - called " ghost workers . "
The only way an employee gets paid is by a combination of RFID evidence and physical presence to collect daily payment .
And there are those taking this idea of tracking people a step further .
RFID transponders can be embedded as a subdermal implant , similar to a microchip .
Microchips for tracking our beloved pets are now common .
Microsoft has HealthVault and Google has Google Health for e-health record management services and both are pushing for RFID medical bracelets .
Between 2007 and 2009 , RFID in the guise of VeriChip implants were given to hundreds of Alzheimer ’s patients to help identify them and notify caregivers in case of an emergency .
Since 2008 , RFID infant protection systems have been placed on some infants at birth to prevent them from being abducted from the hospital or from being given to the wrong mother .
A new RFID product , " guarantees that RFID will follow you straight to your grave . "
The palm - size stone tablet has an RFID tag that talks with mobile phones to direct users to an Internet memorial archive .
And such uses for RFID are only the tip of the iceberg .
Thing Magic , a company that builds embedded RFID readers , recently launched 100 Uses of RFID .
In themselves , most of these are " valid uses " of RFID technology .
Indeed RFID chips are often an embraced technology due to the good they could do for loss prevention .
Then again , RFID technology can be the cause of security vulnerabilities .
For instance , security badges with RFID chips can broadcast to the criminals where those badges are located .
In an article about Fort Gordon stolen military IDs , embedded with RFID , Pentagon ’s Counterintelligence Field Activity released a report stating , “ The mere possession of a stolen card could , in fact , pose a security risk . ”
Former NSA employee James Atkinson , still immersed in the world of intelligence and counterintelligence , said his business and government clients , " often fail to recognize security holes that to him seem big enough to steer a tank through . "
In regards to the missing RFID enabled military badges , Atkinson stated , “ If a spy can get within 300 feet of where classified material is handled , he owns it .
I mean , he owns it big time . ”
At this year 's HOPE hacker conference , the hackers showed both the good and the bad that comes when a person is attached to an RFID badge .
“ This badge knows what talks you go to .
It knows who you talk to .
It knows what places in the conference you go .
It knows when you were there , ” says Rob Zinkov , of the HOPE badge team .
If you use that data to enhance your own conference experience , RFID is good .
If someone else uses that data , unbeknownst to you , not good .
Extreme - range RFID tracking ( hundreds of meters ) will be explored and exploited during DEFCON .
Also this year 's DEFCON Badge was described as " a full - fledged , active electronic system .
Pushing fabrication techniques to the limit and using some components that are so new they barely exist , the design of this year 's badge took some serious risks . "
At last year 's DEFCON , some hackers were able to temporarily steal other hackers ' and a fed 's identity .
According to ThreatLevel , when a RFID " reader caught an RFID chip in its sights — embedded in a company or government agency access card , for example — it grabbed data from the card , and the camera snapped the card holder ’s picture . "
Location - aware apps are scary enough , based on GPS with the broad range they offer .
But for the most part you still have to sign up for those .
RFID is being implemented all around you .
It has slowly been moving to mainstream .
It can track infants to senior citizens with Alzheimer ’s .
In between it can track your clothes , your purchases , your car — even you .
RFID is on the verge of tracking us all , cradle to the grave .

I would have been still in my teens when LS Lowry first gave me one of his pictures .
It was the mid-50s , and I used to help my uncle out delivering milk from his farm , driving around the streets of Mottram in Cheshire each morning in his little Austin van .
Lowry lived in a large , detached stone house on Stalybridge Road , and I always arrived there at 11 o'clock sharp ; the house was full of clocks and they 'd all start chiming as I arrived .
He was already fairly famous by the time he moved in , and you 'd see him around the village in his black raincoat and trilby .
He worked in a glass conservatory at the side of the house and I 'd take the milk in there – he had two pints every day .
He was a shy man , not unfriendly , but not one for idle chitchat either .
One particular morning , he was working on a sketch – he did many in pencil or charcoal – and he took one of the bottles of milk from me and tried to open it .
In those days , there 'd be two inches of cream at the top of the bottle , and as Lowry pressed his thumb into the foil , cream spurted out all over the paper .
He tried to mop it up , but the picture just got more smudged .
In the end , he passed it to me and said , " Put that in the dustbin on your way out , please . "
So that 's what I did – I never thought twice about it .
In the months after that , he gave me several other drawings .
I never questioned him doing this .
After the first incident , I just assumed he wanted them thrown away .
I 've always imagined they were either finished pieces he was n't happy with or works in progress that were n't going too well – he certainly never gave the impression they were gifts or anything .
I could have kept them , but they simply did n't appeal to me , so into the bin they went .
When I first visited Lowry 's house , his pictures were scattered all over the place .
I never thought much of them – it always seemed to me a child could have done better .
I prefer a good landscape or portrait , something that looks real .
He once said to me , " I might be rich when I 'm dead , but it wo n't do me any good . "
He did n't seem very interested in money – he stayed in the same house for 30 years and nothing ever changed .
By the late 50s , his fame grew and he always seemed to have visitors .
I no longer saw his pictures all over the place – they got packaged up as soon as they were finished , sold to collectors and galleries .
That 's when it occurred to me that maybe I 'd been a bit hasty throwing away those sketches .
My uncle once asked Lowry to paint something for him , but he never did .
I know he presented one to Mrs Swindell , the lady who used to clean and cook for him , and it got stolen from her home .
Someone else bought one from him for a large sum and he was burgled , too .
I remember feeling glad that I did n't have any – they 'd only have attracted thieves .
A few years ago , I visited the doctor , and while I was in the waiting room I noticed a Lowry print on the wall .
It was one with matchstick men coming out of a factory , and the spitting image of the sketches he gave me .
Perhaps it had been a work in progress that he'd handed to me .
You do hear of drawings like the ones I was given fetching many thousands of pounds in auction ; someone said if I 'd hung on to them , I could have ended up a millionaire .
But I 've never really regretted what I did – I do n't believe in fretting about things that are gone .
I 'd barely thought about it until an artist came to our local community centre to paint a mural inspired by Lowry , and included me in it carrying a crate of milk .
It was the first time I 'd mentioned throwing away those sketches , but word soon spread .
I went to the market the other day and an auctioneer there shouted out , " All right , Ben , got any Lowrys ? "
At first I took those sorts of comments as idle jokes , but it upsets me that people take the mickey .
I feel they could easily have done the same .
Now , though , I can appreciate Lowry 's paintings more – they 're full of old mills and beautiful stone buildings that were knocked down long ago , or turned into flats , and they remind me of my youth .
But that 's just nostalgia .
I 've never believed in hoarding things in case they become valuable – I take each day as it comes .
Lowry did , too , I think , and I 'm sure he would have respected my decision .
A wind - powered car has reached a top speed of 38.61 miles per hour ( 62 kilometers per hour ) .
By itself that might not sound impressive , but it appears to answer a long - running physics question : can a wind powered vehicle travel downwind at a speed faster than said wind .
The main argument against such a possibility is that it would create perpetual motion , meaning that once the vehicle started it would never stop .
It ’s generally held that this would violate the laws of thermodynamics .
However , supporters of the “ downwind faster than the wind ” idea have argued it is not perpetual motion .
In the past , there have been no full - scale demonstrations that the theory holds up in reality .
Instead there have been a variety of demonstrations using small models on a treadmill .
The treadmill is n’t cheating , but rather a way to recreate a “ perfectly straight road that ’s perfectly aligned with a perfectly steady wind ” , which is easy to assume in physics theory , but trickier to achieve in the real world .
That is until a project run by Rick Cavallero , the chief scientist at Sportvision Inc .
His team received funding from Google and wind turbine firm Joby Energy , and worked with San Jose State University ’s aero department .
They ’ve now built a vehicle known as Blackbird and repeatedly achieved speeds of 2.85 times faster than the wind which was powering the car .
The key to this achievement is that the wind does n’t directly turn the propeller .
Instead the wind pushes the vehicle and the wheels turn the propeller ( in the opposite direction to normal wind - powered vehicles ) .
This pushes the wind backwards and thus creates more forward momentum for the vehicle .
Wendy McMahon of New Zealand opened can of pears she bought at a Pak 'N Save , and was " shocked " to find a pear with a " face " peering back at her .
She called the toll free number listed on the can to complain .
A representative returned McMahon 's call , and followed up by sending her a NZ $ 15 voucher .
McMahon then mailed the pear to the canning company ( Heinz - Wattie ) .
The representative called back to report that nothing was wrong with the pear , and offered McMahon a NZ$ 30 voucher .
McMahon told the representative " that was n't good enough , " and demanded that the pear be returned to her .

Image caption Guillermo Farinas began his hunger strike after another dissident died
Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas has ended his hunger strike after the government announced it was freeing 52 political prisoners .
Mr Farinas , who has been refusing food for more than 130 days , was reported to have been near death in recent days .
The death of another hunger striker in February put pressure on Cuba .
Mr Farinas began his fast after Orlando Zapata Tamayo's death following an 85 - day hunger strike .
Mr Farinas told BBC
Mundo that he would resume the hunger strike if the Cuban government did n't keep its promise .
" If by 7 November the prisoners are not back in their own homes , not only me but several scores of people will also declare themselves on hunger strike , " he said .
The decision to release the prisoners were not motivated by concern for their welfare but for the government 's own political standing , Mr Farinas said .
" This is a door that the Cuban government did n't want to open but the international pressure and the economic , political and social conditions together with the historic moment in the country forced them to open it and now nobody can close this door anymore , " he added .
' Overdue '
Following Wednesday 's announcement of the prisoner releases , Spain 's foreign minister called on the EU to soften its Common Position on Cuba .
The 1996 policy calls for advances in human rights and democracy before relations with Cuba can be normalised .
It 's obvious that times are changing in Cuba but it's not clear what it will change into Jim Corrigan Have your say
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was encouraged by the Cuban move , which she described as " something that is overdue , but nevertheless very welcome " .
The BBC's Michael Voss , in Havana , says this is the largest prisoner release for years in Cuba and may be a turning point in ties with the US and EU .
Cuba has always denied that it has political prisoners , calling them mercenaries paid by the US to undermine Havana 's rule , according to our correspondent .
He says President Raul Castro has been stung by the strength of international criticism following the death of Mr Tamayo in February .
This regex implementation is backwards - compatible with the standard ‘ re ’ module , but offers additional functionality .
The re module ’s behaviour with zero - width matches changed in Python 3.7 , and this module will follow that behaviour when compiled for Python 3.7 .
If no version is specified , the regex module will default to regex .
DEFAULT_VERSION .
Version 1 behaviour ( new behaviour , possibly different from the re module ) :
Please note that the re module ’s behaviour may change over time , and I ’ll endeavour to match that behaviour in version 0 .
Version 0 behaviour ( old behaviour , compatible with the re module ) :
In order to be compatible with the re module , this module has 2 behaviours :
In the version 1 behaviour , the flag is on by default .
In the version 0 behaviour , the flag is off by default .
The regex module supports both simple and full case - folding for case - insensitive matches in Unicode .
Use of full case - folding can be turned on using the FULLCASE or F flag , or ( ? f ) in the pattern .
Please note that this flag affects how the IGNORECASE flag works ; the FULLCASE flag itself does not turn on case - insensitive matching .
but in the version 1 behaviour ( nested sets , enhanced behaviour ) as :
For example , the pattern [ [ a - z ] --[ aeiou ] ] is treated in the version 0 behaviour ( simple sets , compatible with the re module ) as :
It ’s not possible to support both simple sets , as used in the re module , and nested sets at the same time because of a difference in the meaning of an unescaped " [ " in a set .
The BESTMATCH flag makes fuzzy matching search for the best match instead of the next match .
The ENHANCEMATCH flag makes fuzzy matching attempt to improve the fit of the next match that it finds .
If neither the ASCII , LOCALE nor UNICODE flag is specified , it will default to UNICODE if the regex pattern is a Unicode string and ASCII if it ’s a bytestring .
There are 2 kinds of flag : scoped and global .
Scoped flags can apply to only part of a pattern and can be turned on or off ; global flags apply to the entire pattern and can only be turned on .
If you want to prevent ( \w + ) from being group 2 , you need to name it ( different name , different group number ) .
In the regex ( \s+ ) ( ? |(? P< foo > [ A - Z ] + ) |( \w + ) ( ? P< foo > [ 0 - 9 ] + ) there are 2 groups :
Group numbers will be reused across different branches of a branch reset , eg. ( ?|( first ) |( second ) ) has only group 1 .
If capture groups have different group names then they will , of course , have different group numbers , eg. ( ? |(? P< foo> first ) |(? P< bar>second ) ) has group 1 ( “ foo ” ) and group 2 ( “ bar ” ) .
The same name can be used by more than one group , with later captures ‘ overwriting ’ earlier captures .
All of the captures of the group will be available from the captures method of the match object .
Groups with the same group name will have the same group number , and groups with a different group name will have a different group number .
All capture groups have a group number , starting from 1 .
The regex module releases the GIL during matching on instances of the built - in ( immutable ) string classes , enabling other Python threads to run concurrently .
It is also possible to force the regex module to release the GIL during matching by calling the matching methods with the keyword argument concurrent =
True .
The behaviour is undefined if the string changes during matching , so use it only when it is guaranteed that that wo n’t happen .
Additional features
The issue numbers relate to the Python bug tracker , except where listed as “ Hg issue ” .
Added support for lookaround in conditional pattern ( Hg issue 163 ) The test of a conditional pattern can now be a lookaround .
Examples : >>> regex .
match ( r '( ?(? =\d ) \d+|\w+ ) ' , ' 123abc ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 3 ) , match = ' 123 ' > >>> regex .
match ( r '( ?(? =\d ) \d+|\w+ ) ' , ' abc123 ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 6 ) , match = ' abc123 ' >
This is not quite the same as putting a lookaround in the first branch of a pair of alternatives .
Examples : >>> print ( regex .
match ( r '(?:(?=\d)\d+\b|\w+ ) ' , ' 123abc ' ) ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 6 ) , match = ' 123abc ' > >>> print ( regex .
match ( r '(?(?=\d)\d+\b|\w+ ) ' , ' 123abc ' ) )
None
In the first example , the lookaround matched , but the remainder of the first branch failed to match , and so the second branch was attempted , whereas in the second example , the lookaround matched , and the first branch failed to match , but the second branch was not attempted .
Added POSIX matching ( leftmost longest ) ( Hg issue 150 ) The POSIX standard for regex is to return the leftmost longest match .
This can be turned on using the POSIX flag ( ( ? p ) ) .
Examples : >>> # Normal matching . >>> regex .
search ( r ' Mr| Mrs ' , ' Mrs ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 2 ) , match = ' Mr ' > >>> regex .
search ( r ' one ( self ) ?( selfsufficient ) ? ' , ' oneselfsufficient ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 7 ) , match = ' oneself ' > >>>
# POSIX matching . >>> regex .
search ( r '( ? p ) Mr|Mrs ' , ' Mrs ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 3 ) , match = ' Mrs ' > >>> regex .
search ( r '( ? p ) one ( self ) ?( selfsufficient ) ? ' , ' oneselfsufficient ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 17 ) , match = ' oneselfsufficient ' >
Note that it will take longer to find matches because when it finds a match at a certain position , it wo n’t return that immediately , but will keep looking to see if there ’s another longer match there .
Added ( ?( DEFINE ) ... ) ( Hg issue 152 ) If there ’s no group called “ DEFINE ” , then … will be ignored , but any group definitions within it will be available .
Examples : >>> regex .
search ( r '( ?( DEFINE ) (? P< quant >\d + ) (? P< item >\w+ ) ) (?&quant ) ( ? &item ) ' , ' 5 elephants ' ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 11 ) , match = ' 5 elephants ' >
Added ( * PRUNE ) , ( * SKIP ) and ( * FAIL ) ( Hg issue 153 ) ( * PRUNE ) discards the backtracking info up to that point .
When used in an atomic group or a lookaround , it wo n’t affect the enclosing pattern .
( * SKIP ) is similar to ( * PRUNE ) , except that it also sets where in the text the next attempt to match will start .
When used in an atomic group or a lookaround , it wo n’t affect the enclosing pattern .
( * FAIL ) causes immediate backtracking .
( * F ) is a permitted abbreviation .
Added \K ( Hg issue 151 ) Keeps the part of the entire match after the position where \K occurred ; the part before it is discarded .
It does not affect what capture groups return .
Examples : >>> m = regex .
search ( r '( \w\w\K\w\w\w ) ' , ' abcdef ' ) >>> m [ 0 ] ' cde ' >>> m [ 1 ] ' abcde ' >>> >>> m = regex .
search ( r '( ?r ) ( \w\w\K\w\w\w ) ' , ' abcdef ' ) >>> m [ 0 ] ' bc ' >>> m [ 1 ] ' bcdef '
Added capture subscripting for expandf and subf / subfn ( Hg issue 133 ) You can now use subscripting to get the captures of a repeated capture group .
Examples : >>> m = regex .
match ( r " ( \w ) + " , " abc " ) >>> m . expandf ( " { 1} " ) ' c ' >>> m . expandf ( " { 1 [ 0 ] } { 1 [ 1 ] } { 1 [ 2 ] } " ) ' a b c ' >>> m . expandf ( " { 1 [ - 1 ] } { 1 [ - 2 ] } { 1 [ - 3] } " ) 'c b a ' >>> >>> m = regex .
match ( r " (? P< letter >\w ) + " , " abc " ) >>> m . expandf ( " {letter} " ) ' c ' >>> m . expandf ( " { letter [ 0 ] } { letter [ 1 ] } { letter [ 2 ] } " ) ' a b c ' >>> m . expandf ( " { letter [ - 1 ] } { letter [ - 2 ] } { letter [ - 3]} " ) 'c b a '
Added support for referring to a group by number using ( ? P=... ) .
This is in addition to the existing \g < ...> .
Fixed the handling of locale - sensitive regexes .
The LOCALE flag is intended for legacy code and has limited support .
You ’re still recommended to use Unicode instead .
Added partial matches ( Hg issue 102 ) A partial match is one that matches up to the end of string , but that string has been truncated and you want to know whether a complete match could be possible if the string had not been truncated .
Partial matches are supported by match , search , fullmatch and finditer with the partial keyword argument .
Match objects have a partial attribute , which is True if it ’s a partial match .
For example , if you wanted a user to enter a 4 - digit number and check it character by character as it was being entered : >>> pattern = regex .
compile ( r '\d { 4} ' ) >>> #
Initially , nothing has been entered : >>> print ( pattern .
fullmatch ( '' , partial = True ) ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 0 ) , match = '' , partial = True > >>> #
An empty string is OK , but it 's only a partial match . >>> #
The user enters a letter : >>> print ( pattern .
fullmatch ( ' a ' , partial = True ) ) None >>> #
It 'll never match . >>> #
The user deletes that and enters a digit : >>> print ( pattern .
fullmatch ( ' 1 ' , partial = True ) ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 1 ) , match = ' 1 ' , partial = True > >>> #
It matches this far , but it 's only a partial match . >>> #
The user enters 2 more digits : >>> print ( pattern .
fullmatch ( ' 123 ' , partial = True ) ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 3 ) , match = ' 123 ' , partial = True > >>> #
It matches this far , but it 's only a partial match . >>> #
The user enters another digit : >>> print ( pattern .
fullmatch ( ' 1234 ' , partial = True ) ) < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 0 , 4 ) , match = ' 1234 ' > >>> #
It 's a complete match . >>> #
If the user enters another digit : >>> print ( pattern .
fullmatch ( ' 12345 ' , partial = True ) )
None >>> #
It 's no longer a match . >>> #
This is a partial match : >>> pattern . match ( ' 123 ' , partial = True ) .
partial True >>> #
This is a complete match : >>> pattern . match ( ' 1233 ' , partial = True ) .
partial False
* operator not working correctly with sub ( ) ( Hg issue 106 ) Sometimes it ’s not clear how zero - width matches should be handled .
For example , should .* match 0 characters directly after matching >0 characters ?
Examples : # Python 3.7 and later >>> regex .
sub ( '.*' , ' x ' , ' test ' ) 'xx ' >>> regex .
sub ( '.*?' , ' | ' , ' test ' ) '
|
|
|
|
|
| | | | ' # Python 3.6 and earlier >>> regex . sub ( '(? V0 ) .*' , ' x ' , ' test ' ) ' x ' >>> regex . sub ( '( ? V1 ) .*' , ' x ' , ' test ' ) 'xx ' >>> regex . sub ( '( ? V0 ) .*?' , '| ' , ' test ' ) ' | t|e|s|t| ' >>> regex . sub ( '( ?
V1 ) .*?' , ' | ' , ' test ' ) '
|
|
| | | | | | | '
Added capturesdict ( Hg issue 86 ) capturesdict is a combination of groupdict and captures : groupdict returns a dict of the named groups and the last capture of those groups .
captures returns a list of all the captures of a group capturesdict returns a dict of the named groups and lists of all the captures of those groups .
Examples : >>> m = regex .
match ( r " ( ?:(? P< word >\w+ ) (? P< digits >\d+ )
) + " , " one 1
two 2
three 3
" ) >>> m . groupdict () { ' word ' : ' three ' , ' digits ' : ' 3 ' } >>> m . captures ( " word " ) [ ' one ' , ' two ' , ' three ' ] >>> m . captures ( " digits " ) [ ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' ] >>> m . capturesdict () { ' word ' : [ ' one ' , ' two ' , ' three ' ] , ' digits ' : [ ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' ]}
Allow duplicate names of groups ( Hg issue 87 ) Group names can now be duplicated .
Examples : >>> #
With optional groups : >>> >>> #
Both groups capture , the second capture ' overwriting ' the first . >>> m = regex .
match ( r " (? P< item >\w + ) ? or ( ? P< item >\w + ) ? " , " first or second " ) >>> m . group ( " item " ) ' second ' >>> m . captures ( " item " ) [ ' first ' , ' second ' ] >>> #
Only the second group captures . >>> m = regex .
match ( r " (? P< item >\w + ) ? or (? P< item >\w + ) ? " , " or second " ) >>> m . group ( " item " ) ' second ' >>> m . captures ( " item " ) [ ' second ' ] >>> #
Only the first group captures . >>> m = regex .
match ( r " (? P< item >\w + ) ? or ( ? P< item >\w + ) ? " , " first or " ) >>> m . group ( " item " ) ' first ' >>> m . captures ( " item " ) [ ' first ' ] >>> >>> #
With mandatory groups : >>> >>> #
Both groups capture , the second capture ' overwriting ' the first . >>> m = regex .
match ( r " ( ? P< item > \w * ) or ( ? P< item > \w* ) ? " , " first or second " ) >>> m . group ( " item " ) ' second ' >>> m . captures ( " item " ) [ ' first ' , ' second ' ] >>> #
Again , both groups capture , the second capture ' overwriting ' the first .
>>> m = regex .
match ( r " ( ? P< item > \w* ) or ( ? P< item > \w * ) " , " or second " ) >>> m . group ( " item " ) ' second ' >>> m . captures ( " item " ) [ '' , ' second ' ] >>> #
And yet again , both groups capture , the second capture ' overwriting ' the first .
>>> m = regex .
match ( r " ( ? P< item > \w* ) or ( ? P< item > \w * ) " , " first or " ) >>> m . group ( " item " ) '' >>> m . captures ( " item " ) [ ' first ' , '' ]
Added fullmatch ( issue # 16203 ) fullmatch behaves like match , except that it must match all of the string .
Examples : >>> print ( regex .
fullmatch ( r " abc " , " abc " ) . span ( ) ) ( 0 , 3 ) >>> print ( regex .
fullmatch ( r " abc " , " abcx " ) ) None >>> print ( regex .
fullmatch ( r " abc " , " abcx " , endpos = 3 ) . span ( ) ) ( 0 , 3 ) >>> print ( regex .
fullmatch ( r " abc " , " xabcy " , pos = 1 , endpos = 4 ) . span ( ) ) ( 1 , 4 ) >>> >>> regex .
match ( r " a.*? " , " abcd " ) . group ( 0 ) ' a ' >>> regex .
fullmatch ( r " a.*? " , " abcd " ) . group ( 0 ) ' abcd '
Added subf and subfn subf and subfn are alternatives to sub and subn respectively .
When passed a replacement string , they treat it as a format string .
Examples : >>> regex .
subf ( r " ( \w+ ) ( \w + ) " , " { 0} => { 2 } { 1} " , " foo bar " ) ' foo bar => bar foo ' >>> regex . subf ( r " (? P< word1 >\w+ ) (? P< word2 >\w + ) " , " { word2} { word1} " , " foo bar " ) ' bar foo '
Added expandf to match object expandf is an alternative to expand .
When passed a replacement string , it treats it as a format string .
Examples : >>> m = regex .
match ( r " ( \w+ ) ( \w + ) " , " foo bar " ) >>> m . expandf ( " {0} => { 2 } { 1} " ) ' foo bar => bar foo ' >>> >>> m = regex .
match ( r " (? P< word1 >\w+ ) (? P< word2 >\w+ ) " , " foo bar " ) >>> m . expandf ( " { word2} { word1} " ) ' bar foo '
Detach searched string A match object contains a reference to the string that was searched , via its string attribute .
The detach_string method will ‘ detach ’ that string , making it available for garbage collection , which might save valuable memory if that string is very large .
Example : >>> m = regex .
search ( r " \w + " , " Hello world " ) >>> print ( m . group ( ) ) Hello >>> print ( m . string )
Hello world >>> m . detach_string ( ) >>> print ( m . group ( ) ) Hello >>> print ( m . string )
None
Recursive patterns ( Hg issue 27 ) Recursive and repeated patterns are supported .
( ? R ) or ( ?0 ) tries to match the entire regex recursively .
( ? 1 ) , ( ? 2 ) , etc , try to match the relevant capture group .
( ? &name ) tries to match the named capture group .
Examples : >>> regex .
match ( r " ( Tarzan|Jane ) loves ( ?1 ) " , " Tarzan loves Jane " ) . groups () ( ' Tarzan ' , ) >>> regex .
match ( r " ( Tarzan|Jane ) loves ( ?1 ) " , " Jane loves Tarzan " ) . groups () ( ' Jane ' , ) >>> m = regex .
search ( r " ( \w ) ( ? :(? R ) |( \w ? ) ) \1 " , " kayak " ) >>> m . group ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) ( ' kayak ' , 'k ' , None )
The first two examples show how the subpattern within the capture group is reused , but is _not_ itself a capture group .
In other words , " ( Tarzan|Jane ) loves ( ?1 ) " is equivalent to " ( Tarzan|Jane ) loves ( ?: Tarzan|Jane ) " .
It ’s possible to backtrack into a recursed or repeated group .
You ca n’t call a group if there is more than one group with that group name or group number ( " ambiguous group reference " ) .
The alternative forms ( ?
P>name ) and ( ? P&name ) are also supported .
Full Unicode case - folding is supported .
In version 1 behaviour , the regex module uses full case - folding when performing case - insensitive matches in Unicode .
Examples ( in Python 3 ) : >>> regex .
match ( r " (?iV1 ) strasse " , " stra \N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S} e " ) . span () ( 0 , 6 ) >>> regex .
match ( r " (?iV1) stra\N{LATIN
SMALL LETTER SHARP S}e " , " STRASSE " ) . span () ( 0 , 7 ) In version 0 behaviour , it uses simple case - folding for backward compatibility with the re module .
Approximate “ fuzzy ” matching ( Hg issue 12 , Hg issue 41 , Hg issue 109 ) Regex usually attempts an exact match , but sometimes an approximate , or “ fuzzy ” , match is needed , for those cases where the text being searched may contain errors in the form of inserted , deleted or substituted characters .
A fuzzy regex specifies which types of errors are permitted , and , optionally , either the minimum and maximum or only the maximum permitted number of each type .
( You can not specify only a minimum . )
The 3 types of error are : Insertion , indicated by “ i ”
Deletion , indicated by “ d ”
Substitution , indicated by “ s ” In addition , “ e ” indicates any type of error .
The fuzziness of a regex item is specified between “ { ” and “ } ” after the item .
Examples : foo match “ foo ” exactly
match “ foo ” exactly ( ?: foo ) {i} match “ foo ” , permitting insertions
match “ foo ” , permitting insertions ( ?: foo ) {d} match “ foo ” , permitting deletions
match “ foo ” , permitting deletions ( ?: foo ) {s} match “ foo ” , permitting substitutions
match “ foo ” , permitting substitutions ( ?: foo ) {i , s} match “ foo ” , permitting insertions and substitutions
match “ foo ” , permitting insertions and substitutions ( ?: foo ) {e} match “ foo ” , permitting errors
If a certain type of error is specified , then any type not specified will not be permitted .
In the following examples I ’ll omit the item and write only the fuzziness : {d < =3} permit at most 3 deletions , but no other types
permit at most 3 deletions , but no other types {i<=1, s<=2} permit at most 1 insertion and at most 2 substitutions , but no deletions
permit at most 1 insertion and at most 2 substitutions , but no deletions { 1 < =e < =3} permit at least 1 and at most 3 errors
permit at least 1 and at most 3 errors { i< =2 , d < =2,e<=3} permit at most 2 insertions , at most 2 deletions , at most 3 errors in total , but no substitutions
It ’s also possible to state the costs of each type of error and the maximum permitted total cost .
Examples : { 2i+2d+1s <=4} each insertion costs 2 , each deletion costs 2 , each substitution costs 1 , the total cost must not exceed 4
each insertion costs 2 , each deletion costs 2 , each substitution costs 1 , the total cost must not exceed 4 {i<=1, d<=1, s<=1,2i+2d+1s < =4 } at most 1 insertion , at most 1 deletion , at most 1 substitution ; each insertion costs 2 , each deletion costs 2 , each substitution costs 1 , the total cost must not exceed 4
You can also use “ < ” instead of “ < = ” if you want an exclusive minimum or maximum .
You can add a test to perform on a character that ’s substituted or inserted .
Examples : {s < =2 : [ a - z ] } at most 2 substitutions , which must be in the character set [ a - z ] .
at most 2 substitutions , which must be in the character set .
{ s < =2 ,i<=3 :\d} at most 2 substitutions , at most 3 insertions , which must be digits .
By default , fuzzy matching searches for the first match that meets the given constraints .
The ENHANCEMATCH flag will cause it to attempt to improve the fit ( i.e. reduce the number of errors ) of the match that it has found .
The BESTMATCH flag will make it search for the best match instead .
Further examples to note : regex.search ( " ( dog ) {e} " , " cat and dog " ) [ 1 ] returns " cat " because that matches " dog " with 3 errors ( an unlimited number of errors is permitted ) .
returns because that matches with 3 errors ( an unlimited number of errors is permitted ) . regex.search ( " ( dog ) {e< =1} " , " cat and dog " ) [ 1 ] returns " dog " ( with a leading space ) because that matches " dog " with 1 error , which is within the limit .
returns ( with a leading space ) because that matches with 1 error , which is within the limit. regex.search ( " ( ?e ) ( dog ) {e < =1} " , " cat and dog " ) [ 1 ] returns " dog " ( without a leading space ) because the fuzzy search matches " dog " with 1 error , which is within the limit , and the ( ?e ) then it attempts a better fit .
In the first two examples there are perfect matches later in the string , but in neither case is it the first possible match .
The match object has an attribute fuzzy_counts which gives the total number of substitutions , insertions and deletions . >>> # A 'raw ' fuzzy match : >>> regex .
fullmatch ( r " (?:cats|cat ) {e< =1} " , " cat " ) .
fuzzy_counts ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) >>>
# 0 substitutions , 0 insertions , 1 deletion . >>> #
A better match might be possible if the ENHANCEMATCH flag used : >>> regex .
fullmatch ( r " (?e ) (?:cats|cat ){e< =1} " , " cat " ) .
fuzzy_counts ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) >>>
# 0 substitutions , 0 insertions , 0 deletions .
The match object also has an attribute fuzzy_changes which gives a tuple of the positions of the substitutions , insertions and deletions .
>>> m = regex .
search ( '( fuu ) {i< =2, d< =2,e< =5} ' , ' anaconda foo bar ' ) >>> m < regex .
Match object ; span = ( 7 , 10 ) , match = ' a f ' , fuzzy_counts = ( 0 , 2 , 2 ) > >>> m . fuzzy_changes ( [ ] , [ 7 , 8 ] , [ 10 , 11 ] )
What this means is that if the matched part of the string had been : ' anacondfuuoo bar ' it would ’ve been an exact match .
However , there were insertions at positions 7 and 8 : ' anaconda fuuoo bar ' ^^ and deletions at positions 10 and 11 : ' anaconda f~~oo bar ' ^^
So the actual string was : ' anaconda foo bar '
Named lists ( Hg issue 11 ) \ L < name >
There are occasions where you may want to include a list ( actually , a set ) of options in a regex .
One way is to build the pattern like this : >>> p = regex .
compile ( r " first|second|third|fourth|fifth " ) but if the list is large , parsing the resulting regex can take considerable time , and care must also be taken that the strings are properly escaped and properly ordered , for example , “ cats ” before “ cat ” .
The new alternative is to use a named list : >>> option_set = [ " first " , " second " , " third " , " fourth " , " fifth " ] >>> p = regex .
compile ( r " \L< options > " , options = option_set )
The order of the items is irrelevant , they are treated as a set .
The named lists are available as the .named_lists attribute of the pattern object : >>> print ( p . named_lists ) # Python 3 { ' options ' : frozenset ( { ' fifth ' , ' first ' , ' fourth ' , ' second ' , ' third ' }) } # Python 2 { ' options ' : frozenset ( [ ' fifth ' , ' fourth ' , ' second ' , ' third ' , ' first ' ] ) }
If there are any unused keyword arguments , ValueError will be raised unless you tell it otherwise : >>> option_set = [ " first " , " second " , " third " , " fourth " , " fifth " ] >>> p = regex .
compile ( r " \L< options > " , options = option_set , other_options = [ ] )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module >
File " C: \Python37\lib\site - packages \r egex \r egex.py " , line 348 , in compile return _compile ( pattern , flags , ignore_unused , kwargs )
File " C: \Python37\lib\site - packages \r egex \r egex.py " , line 585 , in _compile raise ValueError ( 'unused keyword argument {! a} ' . format ( any_one ) )
ValueError : unused keyword argument ' other_options ' >>> p = regex .
compile ( r " \L< options > " , options = option_set , other_options = [ ] , ignore_unused = True ) >>>
Start and end of word \m matches at the start of a word .
\M matches at the end of a word .
Compare with \b , which matches at the start or end of a word .
Unicode line separators
Normally the only line separator is
( \x0A ) , but if the WORD flag is turned on then the line separators are \x0D\x0A , \x0A , \x0B , \x0C and \x0D , plus \x85 , \u2028 and \u2029 when working with Unicode .
This affects the regex dot " . " , which , with the DOTALL flag turned off , matches any character except a line separator .
It also affects the line anchors ^ and $ ( in multiline mode ) .
Set operators Version 1 behaviour only Set operators have been added , and a set [...] can include nested sets .
The operators , in order of increasing precedence , are : || for union ( “ x||y ” means “ x or y ” )
for union ( “ x||y ” means “ x or y ” ) ~~ ( double tilde ) for symmetric difference ( “ x~~y ” means “ x or y , but not both ” )
( double tilde ) for symmetric difference ( “ x~~y ” means “ x or y , but not both ” ) && for intersection ( “ x&&y ” means “ x and y ” )
for intersection ( “ x&&y ” means “ x and y ” ) -- ( double dash ) for difference ( “ x–y ” means “ x but not y ” )
Implicit union , ie , simple juxtaposition like in [ ab ] , has the highest precedence .
Thus , [ ab&&cd ] is the same as [ [ a| |b ] && [ c||d ] ] .
Examples : [ ab ] #
Set containing ‘ a’ and ‘b ’
# Set containing ‘ a’ and ‘ b ’ [ a - z ] #
Set containing ‘ a’ .. ‘z ’
# Set containing ‘ a’ .. ‘ z’ [ [ a -z ] -- [ qw ] ] #
Set containing ‘ a’ .. ‘ z’ , but not ‘ q ’ or ‘w ’
# Set containing ‘ a’ .. ‘ z’ , but not ‘ q ’ or ‘ w ’ [ a-z-- qw ] # Same as above
# Same as above [ \p{L}--QW ] #
Set containing all letters except ‘ Q’ and ‘ W ’
# Set containing all letters except ‘ Q’ and ‘ W ’ [ \p {N} --[ 0 - 9 ] ]
#
Set containing all numbers except ‘ 0 ’ .. ‘ 9 ’
# Set containing all numbers except ‘ 0 ’ .. ‘ 9 ’ [ \ p{ASCII}&&\p{Letter} ] #
Set containing all characters which are ASCII and letter
regex.escape ( issue # 2650 ) regex.escape has an additional keyword parameter special_only .
When True , only ‘ special ’ regex characters , such as ‘?’ , are escaped .
Examples : >>> regex .
escape ( " foo ! ? " , special_only = False ) ' foo \\ ! \\ ?' >>> regex .
escape ( " foo ! ? " , special_only = True ) ' foo ! \\ ?'
regex.escape ( Hg issue 249 ) regex.escape has an additional keyword parameter literal_spaces .
When True , spaces are not escaped .
Examples : >>> regex .
escape ( " foo bar ! ? " , literal_spaces = False ) ' foo \\ bar ! \\ ?' >>> regex .
escape ( " foo bar ! ? " , literal_spaces = True ) ' foo bar ! \\ ?'
Repeated captures ( issue # 7132 )
A match object has additional methods which return information on all the successful matches of a repeated capture group .
These methods are : matchobject.captures([group1 , ... ])
Returns a list of the strings matched in a group or groups .
Compare with matchobject.group([group1 , ... ] ) .
matchobject.starts ( [ group ] )
Returns a list of the start positions .
Compare with matchobject.start ( [ group ] ) .
matchobject.ends ( [ group ] )
Returns a list of the end positions .
Compare with matchobject.end ( [ group ] ) .
matchobject.spans ( [ group ] )
Returns a list of the spans .
Compare with matchobject.span([ group ] ) .
Examples : >>> m = regex .
search ( r " ( \w { 3} ) + " , " 123456789 " ) >>> m . group ( 1 ) ' 789 ' >>> m . captures ( 1 ) [ ' 123 ' , ' 456 ' , ' 789 ' ] >>> m . start ( 1 ) 6 >>> m . starts ( 1 ) [ 0 , 3 , 6 ] >>> m . end ( 1 ) 9 >>> m . ends ( 1 ) [ 3 , 6 , 9 ] >>> m . span ( 1 ) ( 6 , 9 ) >>> m . spans ( 1 ) [ ( 0 , 3 ) , ( 3 , 6 ) , ( 6 , 9 ) ]
Atomic grouping ( issue # 433030 ) ( ?>...)
If the following pattern subsequently fails , then the subpattern as a whole will fail .
Possessive quantifiers . (?:...)?+ ; (?:...)*+ ; (?:...)++ ; (?:...) {min , max} +
The subpattern is matched up to ‘ max ’ times .
If the following pattern subsequently fails , then all of the repeated subpatterns will fail as a whole .
For example , ( ?:...)++ is equivalent to ( ?>(?:... )+ ) .
Scoped flags ( issue # 433028 ) ( ? flags - flags : ...)
The flags will apply only to the subpattern .
Flags can be turned on or off .
Definition of ‘ word ’ character ( issue # 1693050 )
The definition of a ‘ word ’ character has been expanded for Unicode .
It now conforms to the Unicode specification at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/ .
Variable - length lookbehind A lookbehind can match a variable - length string .
Flags argument for regex.split , regex.sub and regex.subn ( issue # 3482 ) regex.split , regex.sub and regex.subn support a ‘ flags ’ argument .
Pos and endpos arguments for regex.sub and regex.subn regex.sub and regex.subn support ‘ pos ’ and ‘ endpos ’ arguments .
‘ Overlapped ’ argument for regex .
findall and regex .
finditer regex.findall and regex.
finditer support an ‘ overlapped ’ flag which permits overlapped matches .
Splititer regex.splititer has been added .
It ’s a generator equivalent of regex .
split .
Subscripting for groups A match object accepts access to the captured groups via subscripting and slicing : >>> m = regex .
search ( r " (? P< before >.*? ) (? P< num>\d+ ) (?
P< after >.* ) " , " pqr123stu " ) >>> print ( m [ " before " ] ) pqr >>> print ( len ( m ) ) 4 >>> print ( m [ : ] ) ( ' pqr123stu ' , ' pqr ' , ' 123 ' , ' stu ' )
Named groups Groups can be named with ( ? < name >... ) as well as the current (? P < name > ... ) .
Group references Groups can be referenced within a pattern with \ g < name > .
This also allows there to be more than 99 groups .
Named characters \ N{name} Named characters are supported .
( Note : only those known by Python ’s Unicode database are supported . )
Unicode codepoint properties , including scripts and blocks \p{property=value} ; \ P{property=value} ; \p{value} ; \ P{value} Many Unicode properties are supported , including blocks and scripts .
\p {property=value} or \p{property : value} matches a character whose property property has value value .
The inverse of \p{property=value} is \ P{property=value} or \p{^property=value} .
If the short form \p{value} is used , the properties are checked in the order : General_Category , Script , Block , binary property : Latin , the ‘ Latin ’ script ( Script=Latin ) .
, the ‘ Latin ’ script ( ) .
BasicLatin , the ‘ BasicLatin ’ block ( Block =BasicLatin ) .
, the ‘ BasicLatin ’ block ( ) .
Alphabetic , the ‘ Alphabetic ’ binary property ( Alphabetic=Yes ) .
A short form starting with Is indicates a script or binary property : IsLatin , the ‘ Latin ’ script ( Script=Latin ) .
, the ‘ Latin ’ script ( ) .
IsAlphabetic , the ‘ Alphabetic ’ binary property ( Alphabetic=Yes ) .
A short form starting with In indicates a block property : InBasicLatin , the ‘ BasicLatin ’ block ( Block =BasicLatin ) .
POSIX character classes [ [ : alpha : ] ] ; [ [ : ^alpha : ] ]
POSIX character classes are supported .
These are normally treated as an alternative form of \p { ...} .
The exceptions are alnum , digit , punct and xdigit , whose definitions are different from those of Unicode . [ [ :alnum : ] ] is equivalent to \p{posix_alnum} . [ [ : digit : ] ] is equivalent to \p{posix_digit} . [ [ : punct : ] ] is equivalent to \p{posix_punct} . [ [ :xdigit : ] ] is equivalent to \p{posix_xdigit} .
Search anchor \G A search anchor has been added .
It matches at the position where each search started / continued and can be used for contiguous matches or in negative variable - length lookbehinds to limit how far back the lookbehind goes : >>> regex .
findall ( r " \w { 2} " , " abcd ef " ) [ ' ab ' , 'cd ' , 'ef ' ] >>> regex .
findall ( r " \G\w { 2} " , " abcd ef " ) [ ' ab ' , ' cd ' ]
The search starts at position 0 and matches 2 letters ‘ ab ’ .
The search continues at position 2 and matches 2 letters ‘ cd ’ .
The search continues at position 4 and fails to match any letters .
The anchor stops the search start position from being advanced , so there are no more results .
Reverse searching Searches can now work backwards : >>> regex .
findall ( r " . " , " abc " ) [ ' a ' , ' b ' , ' c' ] >>> regex .
findall ( r " ( ?r ) . " , " abc " ) [ ' c ' , ' b ' , ' a' ]
Note : the result of a reverse search is not necessarily the reverse of a forward search : >>> regex .
findall ( r " .. " , " abcde " ) [ ' ab ' , ' cd ' ] >>> regex .
findall ( r " ( ?r ) .. " , " abcde " ) [ ' de ' , ' bc ' ]
Matching a single grapheme \X
The grapheme matcher is supported .
It now conforms to the Unicode specification at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/ .
Branch reset ( ?|...|...)
Capture group numbers will be reused across the alternatives , but groups with different names will have different group numbers .
Examples : >>> regex .
match ( r " ( ?|( first ) |( second ) ) " , " first " ) . groups () ( ' first ' , ) >>> regex .
match ( r " ( ?|( first ) |( second ) ) " , " second " ) . groups ( ) ( ' second ' ,)
Note that there is only one group .
Default Unicode word boundary
The WORD flag changes the definition of a ‘ word boundary ’ to that of a default Unicode word boundary .
This applies to \b and \ B .

An Egyptian security official declared the blockade of Gaza a failure Monday and said his country will keep its border with the Palestinian territory open indefinitely .
Keeping that crossing point open long term would ease the blockade imposed by Israel three years ago to isolate and punish Gaza 's Hamas rulers .
It also restores a link to the outside the world for some of Gaza 's 1.5 million Palestinians .
Obama Administration Biden : US seeks new ways to deal with Gaza AFP American vice president meets with Egyptian President Mubarak in Sharm el - Sheikh , says discussed ways to address humanitarian , economic , security and political situation in Strip Biden : US seeks new ways to deal with Gaza
Egypt opened its border with Gaza soon after Israel 's deadly raid on an international flotilla of activists trying to break the blockade a week ago .
Israel has not publicly protested the Egyptian move , but officials declined to comment Monday .
In another escalation of the tension off Gaza 's shores , Israeli naval forces shot and killed four men wearing wet suits off the coast on Monday , and the militant group Al - Aqsa Martyrs '
Brigades said they were members of its marine unit training for a mission .
Vice President Joe Biden said Monday the US is closely consulting with Egypt and other allies to find new ways to " address the humanitarian , economic , security , and political aspects of the situation in Gaza . "
He issued the statement after meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El - Sheikh .
Egypt and Israel have maintained the blockade since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 , with Israel describing it as an essential measure to stop weapons from reaching Hamas militants , who have hit southern Israel with rockets and in past years killed hundreds in suicide bombings .
The Egyptian security official said , however , that the closure has failed to achieve its goals , including the release of an Israeli soldier held by Hamas since 2006 .
Israeli airstrikes and Egyptian security efforts have also yet to choke off a bustling smuggling trade that uses hundreds of tunnels along the Gaza - Egypt border , though the official said Egypt is determined to shut them down .
The crossing point at the border town of Rafah is still subject to restrictions , with Egypt letting in some humanitarian aid and allowing Palestinians into Egypt on a case - by - case basis for medical treatment or to travel onward to attend foreign universities , for example .
' Hamas becomes more extremist '
Egypt will not allow in large cargo shipments or construction material because the terminal is designed primarily as a crossing for travelers , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue .
For its part , Israel allows through only basic humanitarian goods , blocking crucial items like cement needed to rebuild war damage because it argues the material could be used by Hamas .
The closure has crushed Gaza 's already fragile economy .
The Egyptian official said Israel must work out a new policy to end the suffering of the Palestinians while keeping pressure on Hamas .
Like Israel , Egypt also fears sharing a border with a slice of territory controlled by Islamic militants backed by regional rival Iran .
Concerned about the flow of weapons , Egypt late last year began building an underground , metal barrier to seal the smuggling tunnels .
" We have a constant security concern , because Iran has its aims , Hezbollah has its aims , Hamas has its aspirations and aims , and al - Qaeda can very well be present in Sinai and Gaza , " the official said .
Egypt has been harshly criticized in the Muslim world for having helped maintain the blockade .
The official called it a " continuously embarrassing situation " for Egypt and blamed Israel for thinking the closure could pressure Hamas to release the captured soldier , Gilad Shalit .
" Israel still insists that the blockade is a pressure tool , it can release Shalit and force Hamas to stop resistance , " the official said .
" On the contrary , it becomes more extremist . "
In Monday 's clash , the Israeli military said a naval force spotted the Palestinians in the waters off Gaza and opened fire .
It claimed the forces had prevented an attack on Israeli targets .
Al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades said the four killed were training in Gaza 's waters .
The violent offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah faction , made the claim in a text message sent to reporters in Gaza .
Four bodies were retrieved and taken to a hospital in central Gaza , said Moawiya Hassanain , a Palestinian health official .
The Palestinian naval police said two people were still missing .
" The bloody escalation today is a desperate attempt by the occupation government to divert the world attention away from the massacre committed against the flotilla , " Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told reporters in Gaza .
The May 31 flotilla clash , in which eight Turkish men and one dual American - Turkish citizen were killed aboard one of the vessels seized by Israeli commandos , has put Israel under international pressure to lift or at least ease the blockade .
The killings seriously damaged Israel 's relations with Turkey , which had been its closest ally in the Muslim world .
In Istanbul , a 20 - member Asian security group kicked off a summit with Turkey seeking to condemn Israel for the raid .
Israel has sought to portray the nine activists killed as terrorsits , saying they prepared for the fight before boarding the flotilla .
The military Monday released the names of five of the activists it said have long - standing ties to terror organizations .
" The state of Israel is under attack , " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers in his Likud party .
He said the attack was a " direct continuation " of international condemnations of Israel 's war against Hezbollah guerrillas in 2006 and last year 's military offensive against Hamas in Gaza .
More than six years before the biggest sex discrimination lawsuit in history was filed against Wal - Mart Stores , the company hired a prominent law firm to examine its vulnerability to just such a suit .
The law firm , Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld , found widespread gender disparities in pay and promotion at Wal - Mart and Sam ’s Club stores and urged the company to take basic steps  like posting every job opening and creating specific goals to promote women and minorities  to avoid liability .
The 1995 report said that women employed by Wal - Mart earned less than men in numerous job categories , with men in salaried jobs earning 19 percent more than women .
By one measure , the law firm found , men were five and a half times as likely as women to be promoted into salaried , management positions .
Without significant changes , the lawyers said in their confidential analysis , Wal - Mart “ would find it difficult to fashion a persuasive explanation for disproportionate employment patterns . ”

Renault may introduce its version of the F - duct in the next race at the Hockenheimring .
But team principal Eric Boullier admitted it is more likely to appear for the first time at Spa - Francorchamps for the Belgian Grand Prix .
Speaking on the Renault F1 podcast he said :
The second part of the season will be crucial to see where exactly our pace is and if we can get the best of our car to get some more pace and more podiums .
You always have some inertia , when you have an upgrade on the car the decision to do it and to manufacturer it was done two weeks or maybe three races before .
So we still have some good developments coming for the next two , three or four races .
We obviously have some specific tracks like Singapore , Monza or Budapest where we will have a special aerodynamics package .
But we still have some good upgrades including an F - duct coming so that is quite promising for the end of the season .
Actually I ca n’t wait to have all this on the car !
[ Its introduction will be ] depending on the production , because now we have validated a good package , and depending on the schedule because Budapest is a high - downforce track so we do n’t need to have it there .
Maybe we will get it before but very likely right after .
Eric Boullier
Boullier added he was pleased to re-sign Robert Kubica for another two years and believes it is a vote of confidence in the team by his driver :
That was very good news before the Grand Prix because we had very good discussions with him .
First of all I ’m happy for the team , it ’s a great mark of confidence towards the team that Robert is signing a two year deal with us .
With all respect for the other teams he is a very highly - ranked driver and a lot of prestigious names in the paddock were chasing him or were supposed to be chasing him .
It ’s good for our project to have Robert committing for two years because it means we have some credibility in his eyes and it means our team has done a good job but we are supposed to do a better job in future .
Eric Boullier
Boullier also praised the efforts of Vitaly Petrov , calling him the best rookie in F1 this year , while urging the Russian driver to improve his consistency :
His future in his hands .
We have not been disappointed by him , he clearly is the best rookie in the paddock .
He did a very good performance and an amazing job sometimes .
Very frankly he is lacking some consistency to get the points he deserves and we definitely need to have both cars scoring points .
So that obviously creates some rumours around him and his race seat but we are totally committed to him , we are happy to have him on board and we will do everything we can to help him make the final step to where he wants to be .
Eric Boullier
The federal government 's plan to change the Canadian census in 2011 will mean government and business wo n't have the information they need , a prominent Nova Scotia economist says .
Fred Morley , executive vice - president and chief economist of the Greater Halifax Partnership , said making the long - form census voluntary will decrease the quality of the data available about the Canadian population .
" We 're going to look at a significant degrading of census data , " Morley said Thursday .
" Making it voluntary changes the whole dynamic .
In fact , it creates a break in the data which means we can't look at trends anymore , we can't look at past information .
It makes it more difficult to project into the future .
It 's bad in any number of different ways . "
The Conservative government announced at the end of June that the long form part of the questionnaire will no longer be mandatory because of privacy concerns .
Now , Canadians who receive the long form can refuse to fill it out .
P.O.V. : Census :
Is it an invasion of privacy ?
Take our poll .
The 2006 census required about 20 per cent of Canadians to complete the long form which provides detailed household information used to decide everything from bus routes to new subdivisions to what support services are in local schools
Morley said businesses and government rely on the detailed census data when they decide where jobs are created or cut .
" They need good information .
They need information they can rely on .
If you do n't have that , you make poor decisions , " he said .
He said a voluntary census will also cost more money to promote if the government wants a good result .
Morley said the Conservatives are responding to a vocal fringe that distrusts government .
No consultation
" There 's tremendous restrictions on this data and the use of this data .
The general public probably gives out more , and more detailed , information when they fill out a ballot at a trade show , " he said .
Morley said the government made the change without consulting any of the groups that use the data .
The co-ordinator of the Every Woman 's Centre in Sydney said she is also against the plan to scrap the long census form .
Louise Smith - MacDonald said the data provided by those surveys are very useful .
" The long form gathers information that we feel is really necessary for a number of reasons .
One , it helps to identify issues that people are living with , " she said .
" And the other is that ... it provides a statistical record for us which is important to be able to have that information when we 're applying for other funding and to run programs and to do some research . "
Smith - MacDonald said she is worried that the poor and disadvantaged will statistically disappear if information on income is no longer rigorously collected in the census .
The Canadian Medical Association said Thursday that the census data are an essential tool in the delivery of health - care services to Canadians .
“ Abortion trauma syndrome ” is a myth created by anti-choicers .
Research confirms a woman 's mental health after an abortion is best indicated by her mental health before the abortion .
Abortion does not cause mental illness .
The very idea of “ abortion trauma syndrome ” is a myth .
Period .
In my years of treating women as an ob - gyn , I have never seen a patient who developed a serious psychiatric problem just because she had an abortion .
My colleague Dr. Nada Stotland — a psychiatrist , past president of the American Psychiatric Association , and former board member of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health — has studied the research behind the “ syndrome . ”
She explains that it does n’t stand up to medical scrutiny :
There are a great number of publications alleging that there is psychiatric damage from abortion .
They usually do n’t describe a syndrome ; they describe suicide , alcoholism , depression , anxiety , whatever .
And those articles are characterized by severe methodological problems .
They do n’t compare properly with people who have had babies .
They do n’t account for why you had the abortion .
They do n’t account for did they get this data by recruiting people who are already convinced that abortion made them sick rather than from a population of women which had abortions .
There ’s one problem after the other that are so severe that all bona fide scientists have agreed that that literature just does n’t cut it .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

But the bad science has n’t stopped anti-abortion activists from spreading “ abortion trauma ” as truth .
Crisis pregnancy centers tell women that an abortion will destroy their mental health .
And in South Dakota , Texas , Utah , and West Virginia , the law requires abortion providers to “ inform ” women that they may have suicidal thoughts or develop the syndrome as a result of an abortion .
Helping the myth take hold , Dr. Stotland says , is the pervasive confusion between a feeling and a disease :
Women who have abortions have a range of feelings .
One of the problems we have is that we use the word “ depression ” as an every day word to say you are having a bad day .
And it also means a disease and those are two different things .
So abortion does n’t cause depression the disease , but people can be upset around having an abortion .
So there are a lot of things that make you upset , that can make you sad about having an abortion , but they do n’t make you have a psychiatric disease .
Indeed , a 2000 study in the Archives of General Psychiatry confirmed what clinicians know from our medical practice : that a woman ’s mental health after an abortion is best indicated by her mental health before the abortion .
The same is true for post - partum mental health .
Dr. Stotland and I and our colleagues across the country do our best to treat patients and give advice based on the strongest medical evidence .
That is our duty .
We will challenge any bunk meant to separate women from the care they need .
Manuel Cáceres Artesero , conocido por todos como Manolo el del Bombo , está a punto de abandonar Sudáfrica .
Lo hará con lágrimas en los ojos y un sudor frío en el cuerpo .
Una gripe complicada con una neumonía crónica le han hecho imposible seguir en el Mundial .
Se trata del primero que no puede seguir hasta el final desde que apareció en la escena futbolística española hace casi 30 años , durante España ' 82 .
Puestos en comunicación telefónica con él camino del aeropuerto , su llanto le impedían apenas hablar .
Ayer mismo , los médicos de la selección española le aconsejaron , después de analizarle , que regresera a España , a otro clima .
Las duras temperaturas le han vencido .
Aunque ha estado varios días encerrado en su habitación del hotel de Potchefstroom para recuperarse , las salidas a los partidos y el frío reinante en las noches sudafricanas le han hecho recaer y no recuperarse .
Manolo el del Bombo tiene 61 años y jamás ha faltado a ningún encuentro de la selección dentro y fuera de España desde el Mundial ' 82 .
Si consigue mejorar a lo largo de los próximos días y el equipo nacional alcanza la final , podría regresar .
" Seguro que lo haré aunque me cueste la vida " , afirmó a ELMUNDO .es entre sollozos inconsolables .
In Joe Turner 's ultra-efficient house in Salt Lake City , the windows never feel cold nor do the concrete floors even though they do n't have in - floor heating .
" The whole house is the same temperature , " says Turner , a computer programmer who built it with his partner , Rebecca Guymon .
" It 's nice not to have these drafty spots .
The house is also super quiet . "
The secret ?
Their house -- picked as " This Week 's Green House " -- is among the first in the United States to be certified by the Passive House Institute , an Illinois - based firm that verifies whether homes meet strict efficiency standards .
Thousands of passive homes , which use up to 90 % less energy than other houses , have been built in Europe , especially Germany .
Yet fewer than a dozen exist in the United States , according to Turner 's architect David Brach , who is fully certified by the institute .
The institute lists fewer than 100 approved consultants nationwide .
Passive homes are very well - insulated and almost airtight , so the little energy they need can come from passive solar gain , solar panels or tiny HVAC equipment .
To ensure good air circulation , they use mechanical ventilation .
Turner and Guymon had lived on the property for years in an old home that they initially considered remodeling .
Instead , in December 2007 , they began working with Brach to design a new passive house .
They moved into a basement apartment four blocks away during construction , which begin last April .
" We 'd walk by every day , " recalls Turner , often wishing the project would go faster .
In December , they moved into the 3,000 - square - foot house , twice the size of their old one .
Their house , including design , cost about $ 175 per square foot .
He says they spent $ 30,000 on their 2.2 - kilowatt solar array but got $ 12,000 back in federal and state credits .
Aside from the solar panels , Turner says the house cost about 16 % more than a regular new house .
He says the bulk of that was because of its fiberglass Serious Windows , which are perhaps the most efficient ones made in the United States .
He expects the payback will come in about 11 years .
Their energy bill for March , which was quite cold in Salt Lake City , was $ 40 and it's on track to be $ 10 this month , Turner says .
In the summer , he expects to sell power back to the grid , receiving a credit from the utility that he 'll then use in the winter for heating .
" It 's probably not net zero but close , " says Brach , referring to whether the house produces as much energy as it uses .
Turner says they also did the simple stuff , such as using Energy Star appliances , dual - flush toilets and , instead of a gas cooktop , an induction one .
He says he knew his house would be energy - efficient but he never realized just how comfortable and quiet it would be .
He adds : " I love it . "
… K-i-s-s-i-n-g !
I know .
Romance and science fiction hybrid stories ?
Scandalous .
But is it really ?
Is n’t this rather old news , that writers in mainstream , niche , and fan fiction venues have blended romance and science fiction in books , films , television , graphic novels , and even videogames ?
In light of runaway blockbuster hybrid films like Avatar , it is rather passé .
These days , science fiction romance stories ( including romantic SF ) are poised to exit the ghetto .
Because it ’s one thing to say you do n’t care for romance - SF blends , and quite another to say they have no place in science fiction … or romance , for that matter .
The cat ’s already out of the Han and Leia bag .
Therefore , I reckon it ’s a right swell time to have this conversation again — the one about the changing nature of science fiction .
And here are a few happening right now :
Over at SF Signal , there ’s a discussion brewing in the weekly Mind Meld about the blending of romance and science fiction , with participants being asked the participants these questions , “ Is there a taboo against romance in science fiction ?
What does romance bring to the SF genre ?
What are some good examples of romance in SF that illustrate this ? ”
Recently , I speculated on my blog about Why SF Fandom Is Full of Romance Haterz :
“ … for decades , romance , SF , and action - adventure were segregated along gender lines ( see my previous post A Brief History of Science Fiction Romance ) .
That went a long way toward constricting the definition of a science fiction story , a romance story , and what were the “ acceptable ” elements to include in either one .
Is it any wonder that , in large part , SF authors were conditioned to avoid including romance in their stories , and that romance authors were conditioned to avoid including speculative / action - adventure elements in theirs ? ”
Then I noticed that Jacqueline Lichtenberg posed a similar question at Alien Romances in Why Do “ They ” Despise Romance ? :
“ I ’ve been blogging here about how we can change the public perception into a respect for Romance in general , and the cross - genre Romance forms in particular .
In exploring that issue , we ’ve examined the whole publishing field and much of the screenwriting world , the writer ’s business model , and even the esoteric roots of human emotion .
But we still have n’t solved the problem . ”
In Why do I read more male SF writers ? , SF author Ann Wilkes reveals the following :
“ Here ’s my problem .
I ’m an advocate of women writing speculative fiction because , well , I ’m a woman , and more importantly , a woman who writes speculative fiction .
But if I ’m such an advocate , why do I read novels by men far more than those written by women ?
Perhaps it ’s because I know I wo n’t get any romance in my science fiction . ”
Ding ding ding !
Science fiction romance author KS Augustin responds to the post — at Ann Wilkes ’ blog , no less !
She states that :
“ Romance is not merely about the kissing and the sex .
Romance is about the psychology of the people involved and how they try to establish connections while the universe is against them .
What a lot of SF writers have forgotten , in my opinion , is that you take yourself with the technology . ”
In Dick Does Chick Flick , JP Frantz expresses concern that by including a romance in the The Adjustment Bureau ( September 2010 ) , the filmmakers ruined a perfectly good Philip K . Dick story :
“ Is this some sort of mad attempt by the writers to cram a romance storyline into a PKD novel ?
Is that even possible and if so , Matt Damon ? ! ”
Is The Adjustment Bureau doomed ?
Time will tell , but in the meantime , I responded with a post of my own and pointed out that folks are consistently describing this film as “ science fiction romance … . ”
Frankly , if films like The Adjustment Bureau attract more readers to science fiction , then that ’s a good thing .
Whether you agree or disagree about the place of romance in SF , my challenge to you is this :
Let ’s have a conversation about romance in science fiction that ’s constructive instead of destructive .
What ’s your response to the Mind Meld questions ?
And just as importantly , how does science fiction as a whole benefit from cross - genre stories ?

Upper toothrows of Timor 's extinct giant rat ( left ) , the biggest rat that ever lived , compared with the skull of a black rat ( right ) .
The black rat ( Rattus rattus ) is one of the world 's most common rat species .
It is also known as the house , roof or ship rat and is found throughout Africa , Asia , Australia , Europe and the Americas .
A typical adult weighs about 150 grams .

Archaeological research in East Timor has unearthed the bones of the biggest rat that ever lived , with a body weight around 6 kg .
The cave excavations also yielded a total of 13 species of rodents , 11 of which are new to science .
Eight of the rats weighed a kilogram or more .
" East Indonesia is a hot spot for rodent evolution .
We want international attention on conservation in the area , " CSIRO 's Dr Ken Aplin says .
" Rodents make up 40 per cent of mammalian diversity worldwide and are a key element of ecosystems , important for processes like soil maintenance and seed dispersal .
Maintaining biodiversity among rats is just as important as protecting whales or birds . "
Carbon dating shows that the biggest rat that ever lived survived until around 1000 to 2000 years ago , along with most of the other Timorese rodents found during the excavation .
Only one of the smaller species found is known to survive on Timor today .
" People have lived on the island of Timor for over 40,000 years and hunted and ate rats throughout this period , yet extinctions did not occur until quite recently , " Dr Aplin says .
" We think this shows people used to live sustainably on Timor until around 1000 to 2000 years ago .
This means extinctions are n't inevitable when people arrive on an island .
Large scale clearing of forest for agriculture probably caused the extinctions , and this may have only been possible following the introduction of metal tools . "

Each of the islands of eastern Indonesia evolved it own unique collection of rats .
Dr Aplin has also found six new rat species in a cave on the island of Flores .
Some of these might still be living on Flores but they have evaded detection by modern collectors and further surveys are urgently needed .
Timor has few native mammals , with bats and rodents making up the majority of species .
Most of Timor today is arid , transformed from the lush rainforests of the past .
But there is still room for imagination .
" Although less than 15 per cent of Timor 's original forest cover remains , parts of the island are still heavily forested , so who knows what might be out there ? "
Dr Aplin says .
" During a recent field trip in East Timor , I found the remains of a freshly dead rat which we knew about only from cave deposits . "

Overnight violence erupted in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland after Monday 's parades .
Elderly nun dies in blast at Ukraine Orthodox church Published duration 28 July 2010

The blast comes after days of protests against a visit by the head of the Russian Orthodox church
An 80 - year - old nun has died after an explosion at an Orthodox Christian church in southern Ukraine which injured at least eight other people , officials say .
The blast in the city of Zaporizhzhya is believed to have been caused by a homemade explosive device .
It is not clear who is behind the explosion .
It came towards the end of a visit to Ukraine by the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill I which has attracted protests by right - wing nationalists .
Wednesday saw Orthodox church celebrations in the region of the anniversary of the adoption of Christianity in 988 AD .
As well as heading the Russian Orthodox church , Patriarch Kirill also leads the largest branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox church .
However some clergy in Ukraine have declared themselves to be independent of Moscow .
' Parcel bomb '
Local media said the woman who died in hospital following the explosion was a nun from the Holy Protection of the Virgin church - which belongs to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate .
Emergency official Yulia Barysheva told Associated Press news agency that the device detonated near the entrance of the church .
Other officials were quoted by Ukrainian media as saying the device was a parcel bomb and was equivalent to 500g of TNT .

Have you seen this smoking 2 - year old kid ?
He ’s pretty much the biggest pimp I ’ve ever seen .
He commands the nursery like he was born for it .
And there ’s a reason .
Turns out he ’s actually a pimp .
BBC got an interview with him and even though it has n’t aired yet , I got my hands on EXCLUSIVE screen caps !
Check it out !
There ’s more too :
I 'm freewheeling down Macquarie Street , breathing the salt - sparkle , seeing the Opera House rise from the bush , mindful of the good Guvnor 's legacy , when a car veers in , shoving me dangerously near the parked vehicles .
" Ya , gedoff the road ! " yell its occupants , evidently delighted with their command of broadest yobbo .
Admittedly , my middle digit may have raised itself microscopically from handlebar level , but the yobs ' next move was to rev that clapped out Ford Fiesta , accelerate past and swerve hard in front , gesticulating wildly , screaming , " Hope ya crash , bitch ! " before tearing off to the expressway .
That was weeks ago , my first experience of car - on - bike road rage , and it did rather take the shine off the ride .
Since then , though , such incidents are noticeably more common .
Just yesterday morning , I was pedalling happily along my local inner-city bike lane when , from a large furniture van , travelling the other way ( and therefore entirely unimpeded by me ) , came the same full - throated war - cry : " Gedoff the road ! "
Seconds later a small white van buzzed past in my direction , horn blaring loud and long without reason or provocation .
At almost the same moment , it transpired , my student daughter , cycling a couple of blocks away , was cussed and spat at by ( of all things ) a pedestrian .
Nice .
I put this sudden rash of bike - hate down to shock - jock syndrome , it having happened since Alan Jones took his war on cyclists to the airwaves .
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , a target of Democrats , had little incentive to break with her party on the measure .

Dems table campaign finance reform
Senate Democrats failed to attract a single Republican vote on the DISCLOSE Act Tuesday , effectively defeating the bill and casting doubts over whether any campaign finance measure can pass the upper chamber before the November elections .
Aides in both the Senate and the House insisted the legislation will come up for consideration again .
But with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) painting the bill — which failed 57 - 41 — as detrimental to his conference , a packed legislative docket and contentious elections on the horizon , sending the DISCLOSE
Act to the president ’s desk now appears to be a long shot at best .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , in accordance with the procedural rules , voted against opening debate on the bill to leave open the opportunity to bring it to the floor at a later date .
“ There ’s no reason to rush toward trying to pass a piece of legislation that needs broad support and [ requires getting ] the policy right , constructing the approach right — and certainly not in time for this election , ” Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) told POLITICO , citing the years - long process of completing the 2002 McCain - Feingold campaign finance reform bill .
“ One has to ask the question as to why [ Democrats ] need to be driving this for this election .
Perhaps it benefits their side more than it does ours — I do n’t know — but the fact is , we ’ve got to get the policy right , and it ’s not there yet . ”
Snowe had been a key target for Democrats pressing for a bill that had the support of their full caucus .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , who missed the vote Tuesday for a funeral , told Reid he would have supported cloture , according to leadership aides , but Snowe had little incentive to break with her party on a measure the GOP leadership stood strongly against .
Opening debate on the DISCLOSE
Act would have pushed a small - business jobs bill Snowe has been working on for months off the floor again .
“ Right now , we should be focusing on jobs and the economy and small businesses , but they want to continue to incorporate all these other issues at a time in which the overarching issue facing Americans today is high unemployment and the economy , ” Snowe said .
Despite the bleak outlook for securing 60 votes to break a procedural filibuster , Reid spokesman Jim Manley said Tuesday that the majority leader “ intends to revisit the issue at some point later in the future . ”
A House Democratic aide close to the negotiations on the bill echoed what Senate staffers had earlier suggested :
The Senate should return to the issue in September , giving voters and independent groups time to pressure on - the - fence senators during the August recess , while also drawing attention , closer to Election Day , to Republicans ’ “ siding with corporations . ”
“ Quite frankly , I do n’t think it ’s a bad idea to bring this up again in September , when you give it a chance to crystallize the position of Democrats as standing for the public ’s interest and Republicans [ as standing ] against it , ” the aide said .
“ You let this vote sit out there for six weeks in these senators ’ states — there are a lot of good - government groups where this is their top priority — and you build an aggressive campaign highlighting these senators ’ votes on this , and you pressure them to change their minds . ”
A Senate official confirmed that the bill could be revisited after the recess , adding that “ it is also a good debate for us in the fall , ” since Democrats would be able to characterize themselves as fighting for increased transparency in election spending , after passing a Wall Street reform bill that drew minimal Republican support .
The other wild card in Congress ’s push on the bill , which aims to temper the effects of a spring Supreme Court decision lifting many of the restrictions on corporate giving , is the White House .
President Barack Obama was slow to throw his weight behind the bill , making a last - ditch effort Monday by challenging Republicans in a Rose Garden address .
But with continued administration support , the bill could find new life in the fall .
In a policy statement Tuesday , the White House stood strongly behind the principles of DISCLOSE , which supporters believe implements new transparency guidelines within the parameters of the Supreme Court decision .
“ This bill is not perfect .
For example , the administration would have preferred no exemptions .
But by providing for unprecedented transparency , S. 3628 takes great strides to hold corporations that participate in the nation ’s elections accountable to the American people , ” the statement read .
“ As this is a matter of urgent importance , the administration urges the Senate to approve the DISCLOSE Act and looks forward to working with both houses of Congress promptly to produce a final bill for the president ’s signature . ”
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , the bill ’s chief Senate sponsor , had altered the House version of the legislation late last week to attempt to lure Republican votes .
The new Senate language sought to make the treatment of unions and corporations more balanced .
The tweaked legislation would require corporations , unions and advocacy groups to reveal their roles in political ads or mailings in the closing months of a campaign .
Companies that receive Troubled Asset Relief Program funding and smaller government contractors would also be barred from underwriting “ electioneering communications . ”
But further changes seem unlikely , as Senate and House Democratic officials said “ Schumer has gone the extra mile ” trying to generate a bill that “ could get Republicans on board . ”
GOP aides said delaying the date the bill would go into effect — so that it would n’t govern the upcoming election — might attract some Republican votes .
Snowe , however , told POLITICO that such a concession would not earn her vote .
Despite the daunting reality , independent groups lobbying for the DISCLOSE
Act remain hopeful that something will get done eventually .
“ Several Republican members of Congress have a long history of supporting transparency when it comes to money in politics , though none in the Senate displayed that sense today .
The issue is not whether there is a Republican member of Congress who supports disclosure — there are plenty — but whether one or more of these public officials are willing to stand for this principle against the wishes of national Republican Party leaders , ” said Craig Holman , legislative representative for Public Citizen , a nonprofit advocacy group .
“ The DISCLOSE Act will not fade away . ”
SEATTLE – The American Federation of Teachers convention here honored 300 Filipino teachers in Louisiana who fought back against an unscrupulous recruiting agency that lured them to the U.S. where they worked under conditions of near - peonage .
Dr. Lorretta Johnson , AFT executive vice president , presented the President ’s International Democracy Award to Ingrid Jomento - Cruz , founder of the Filipino Educators Federation of Louisiana , in a July 9 ceremony .
“ It took great courage for the Filipino teachers to come forward , ” Johnson said .
“ Just think about the qualities these teachers have : personal courage , the willingness to speak up and the belief in collective action . ”
Johnson pointed out that her home local , the Baltimore Teachers Union , has welcomed many Filipino teachers into its ranks and elected Filipina Aileen Mercado to the BTU Executive Board .
When the Filipino teachers contacted the AFT , the union responded quickly , Jomento - Cruz told the convention .
“ A few years ago , we were voiceless , vulnerable , and scared .
Today we are organizing and we will never be silent again about our human rights and labor rights . ”
A video projected on giant screens told the harrowing story of the Filipino teachers .
They paid the Los Angeles recruiting company $ 15,000 each as a placement fee for teaching positions promising $ 40,000 in annual salaries .
But when they arrived in Los Angeles they were told they had to pay thousands of dollars more and would be placed in Louisiana , contrary to earlier promises .
The video shows the prison - like building they were housed in when they arrived in Louisiana , surrounded by a chain link fence with razor - wire coiled along the top .
The teachers were held incommunicado but Jomento - Cruz managed to contact the Louisiana Federation of Teachers , which launched an investigation and helped the teachers organize .
An AFT lawsuit resulted in the Louisiana Workforce Commission ordering the company to refund the $ 1.8 million in hidden fees to the teachers .
The Filipino Educators Federation also filed a complaint with the U.S. Labor Department protesting inflated fees , commissions and rents their recruiter attempted to collect from them in return for U.S. work visas .
Jomento - Cruz said the AFT solidarity was in the Filipino spirit of “ bayanihan , ” in which neighbors help a relocating family by carrying the family ’s house on their shoulders to their new location .
“ We can clearly see the heroes in the community collectively work and sacrifice for each other , ” she said .
“ In essence , bayanihan is … one with the spirit of unionism . ”
Others were honored at the convention for acts of solidarity .
A resolution praised the outpouring of humanitarian aid for the people of Haiti after the January earthquake , including members of the AFT - affiliated Vermont Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals who flew to Haiti to provide emergency health care after the disaster .
The resolution calls on the U.S. government to help Haiti establish a system of public “ free , universal education ” which it has never had .
The convention approved a resolution calling for a speedy end to the war in Afghanistan , opposing “ further escalation ” and urging a “ specific timetable for the rapid , orderly withdrawal of all armed forces and military contractors from Afghanistan . ”
The resolution calls for “ the reallocation of the funds that would otherwise be directed to the war in Afghanistan for job creation , education , health care and other urgently needed social programs for working people in this country . ”
Another resolution calls for an end to repression of teachers and trade unionists in Honduras and ending the U.S. recognition of the “ illegitimate government ” in Honduras .
Progressive teachers submitted a resolution lauding Cuban educators “ who have worked diligently over the past half - century in eradicating illiteracy in their country ” and supporting “ their continued work in this area . ”
The same resolution condemned the half - century U.S. embargo for causing the Cuban people hardship .
The resolution urged the government to increase the “ remittances ” Cuban - Americans are allowed to send their relatives in Cuba , “ end individual and group travel restrictions to Cuba , and “ begin fruitful discussions with Cuba ” on increased exchanges between the two nations .
However , the resolution was “ precluded ” in favor of a resolution hostile to the Cuban government and expressing support for a dissident Cuban group called the Colegio de Pedagogos Independientes .

My parents sent me to China with two goals : to improve my Chinese before shipping off to college in the fall ; to learn about Chinese culture and how China works from an inside perspective .
So I visited a Chinese factory .

If you have been paying attention to technology news as of late , you may have heard that Foxconn , manufacturer of all iThings among others , has been having some issues with worker suicides which has brought to light the abysmal working conditions to which it subjects its employees .
10 hour days , no in - and out - privileges , a KGB - like security force , production line rushing –the list goes on .
Having just visited a few Shenzhen based factories and talked to various factory owners and operators , I can say with confidence that Foxconn is the exception , not the rule .
We in the States buy so much stuff that we do n't need , myself included , but we tend not to think about where it comes from .
Sure it 's all " made in China , " but that tends to be where most people stop asking questions ( again , myself included ) .
The fact of the matter is these gadgets we so often take for granted are made by people like you and me who each have their own story to tell .
It 's important to recognize this .
After hearing about all the Foxconn suicides , I found myself feeling rather guilty about ignoring these people for so long .
So I decided I needed to see for myself what life is really like for the people who make our consumer lifestyle possible .
A few phone calls and emails later , I found myself in the heart of Shenzhen .

Penthouse view
Before I talk about the factories , I 'd like to take a minute to talk about Shenzhen itself .
I had envisioned this polluted wasteland where rivers ran black , living conditions were terrible , and soot blocked out the sun .
To my surprise , I was greeted by world - class shopping malls , tropical flower gardens aplenty , and luxury condominiums rising thirty - five stories into the clear , blue sky .
Apparently , times are kind of hard though because the Ferrari dealership recently closed — just kidding , it was replaced by a Rolls Royce dealer .
It 's also a surprisingly cosmopolitan city with businessmen from all over China and the rest of the world constantly coming in and out for business .
That said , the housing for factory workers offered a pretty stark contrast to the otherwise pleasant landscape .
The family friend who was guiding me around town told me that it's not uncommon for five or six workers to live in the same one - bedroom apartment for the entirety of their employment .
The only truly scary part were the roads ; not the roads themselves but the people who used them .
Traffic signals and lane lines are taken more like a suggestion rather than law .
Cars seemed to zig zag across highways and roads which were shared by foot traffic and bike / electric bike traffic ( even though there are sidewalks ) .
It was kind of like that scene from Shaun of the Dead where they 're dodging zombies in the Phillips ' Jaguar , except with hundreds of cars doing the same .
It is not uncommon for cars drive straight through a red light without so much as a look left or right .
Even police cars and fire trucks were n't given preferential treatment despite having their lights flashing .

The view from the factory 's window
The first factory I visited was an assembly plant where all the components come together to form a finished product .
This factory occupied an entire floor of an unassuming - looking office - type structure and was sandwiched by similar factories above and below it while other , similar buildings were going up all around it .
When inside , I observed that the lines ran at a reasonable pace ; nothing like the horror stories out of Foxconn .
The workers were even chatting and joking with each other while they worked .
The ceiling fans kept the facilities at a reasonable temperature and the lines were well lit by a combination of sunlight and fluorescent bulbs aided by the all - white interior paint - job and linoleum floors .
The labor was tedious but it was n't laborious and there were no security guards out to get people and no obvious safety violations .
All in all , it did n't seem like such a bad way to make a living .
( As a side note , when I asked the owner what the hottest product is , he said e-book readers . )
Advertisement
The second workshop I visited was a lot worse in terms of atmosphere , but that 's the nature of the job at hand .
Assembling a product from already - made components is one thing , making the components is a whole other story .
The component factory I visited specialized in plastic casings for speakers , MP3 players , etc .
The smell of melted plastic hung heavy throughout the factory and gave me a headache ( which eventually got better after about ten minutes of acclimatization ) .
Although the smell was bad , the worst part about the factory was the noise .
There were air guns going off every few seconds or so , and someone somewhere was always hammering away at something .
This made work time chatter all but impossible .
That said , there was nothing that I or anyone reasonable would consider to be unsuitable working conditions .
Although there were a lot of opportunities for injury , precautionary measures were properly utilized to prevent them such as robotic arms for extracting injected casings from the heat , face masks and eye protection as needed , and pulleys on rails to help move the heavy tooling .
The foremen were amiable people and showed great hospitality towards myself and their workers .
The job these workers have is unpleasant but it is not the result of overbearing production quotas or apathetic management ; it 's just an inherently unpleasant job — but someone has to do it .
Advertisement
Working conditions aside , Westerners often gripe about the quality of Chinese goods .
While this might be true of Happy Meal toys , the same cannot be said lightly about its electronics .
At the casing factory , the foreman showed us an example of a product he had made that he deemed to be of unacceptable quality .
Some of the casings for this internet radio had hairline fractures in them ( or so he claimed ) so he offered to redo the batch at great discount .
Upon close inspection under bright light , we were still unable to find the fractures but he insisted they were damaged and he would not be willing to sell them .
There are motivational posters about quality posted on every wall and pillar of both factories and unlike in many American office posters , these meant what they said .
When I asked the factory owners what they thought it was like to be a worker , they both acknowledged that it 's not very rewarding and that most workers can only work one or two years before quitting , but it is a job that someone , somewhere needs to do and if not in China , there 's really nowhere else .
Chinese people have an inherently strong work ethic and are good at following directions .
More importantly , there are lots and lots of them so labor is cheap .
No American would be willing to polish a steel mold to a mirror shine by hand and if they were , they definitely would n't do it for cheap .
That said , they agreed that China will most likely not be able to keep doing this forever and it remains to be seen who , if anyone could fill this role in the future .
Americans get the best quality stuff for the cheapest prices because other people do the work we are n't willing to do .
Americans often complain about other countries taking our jobs , but I can all but guarantee that Americans would n't be willing to do these jobs at American minimum wage , much less Chinese average wage ( there is not minimum wage ) .
For now , we should just be happy that there is someone to do these jobs so we can buy cheap stuff .
Michael Zhao is studying in China this summer and reporting his experiences in his saucily named blog .
Update :
When editing Michael 's piece , I misinterpreted the very crux of the thing :
That the factory that he visited was a Foxconn factory .
In fact it was not , but instead a factory operated by Zhao family friends — a fact Michael made me very aware of as soon as he saw my edits .
I have changed the headline and the lede to reflect this .
The error was completely mine .

Whales are remarkably diverse , with 84 living species of dramatically different sizes and more than 400 other species that have gone extinct , including some that lived partly on land .
Why are there so many whale species , with so much diversity in body size ?
To answer that , UCLA evolutionary biologists and a colleague used molecular and computational techniques to look back 35 million years , when the ancestor of all living whales appeared , to analyze the evolutionary tempo of modern whale species and probe how fast whales changed their shape and body size .
They have provided the first test of an old idea about why whales show such rich diversity .
" Whales represent the most spectacularly successful invasion of oceans by a mammalian lineage , " said Michael Alfaro , UCLA assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology , and senior author of the new study , which was published this month in the early online edition of Proceedings of the Royal Society B and will appear at a later date in the journal 's print edition .
" They are often at the top of the food chain and are major players in whatever ecosystem they are in .
They are the biggest animals that have ever lived .
Cetaceans ( which include whales , as well as dolphins and porpoises ) are the mammals that can go to the deepest depths in the oceans .
" Biologists have debated whether some key evolutionary feature early in their history allowed whales to rapidly expand in number and form , " Alfaro said .
" Sonar , large brains , baleen ( a structure found in the largest species for filtering small animals from sea water ) and complex sociality have all been suggested as triggers for a diversification , or radiation , of this group that has been assumed to be rapid .
However , the tempo -- the actual rate of the unfolding of the cetacean radiation -- has never been critically examined before .
Our study is the first to test the idea that evolution in early whales was explosively fast . "
One explanation for whale diversity is simply that they have been accumulating species and evolving differences in shape as a function of time .
The more time that goes by , the more cetacean species one would expect , and the more variation in body size one would expect to see in them .
" Instead , what we found is that very early in their history , whales went their separate ways from the standpoint of size , and probably ecology , " Alfaro said .
" This pattern provides some support for the explosive radiation hypothesis .
It is consistent with the idea that some key traits opened up new ways of being ' whale - like ' to the earliest ancestors of modern cetaceans , and that these ancestors evolved to fill them .
Once these forms became established , they remained . "
Species diversification and variations in body size were established early in the evolution of whales , Alfaro and his colleagues report .

Large whales , small whales and medium - sized whales all appeared early in the history of whales , with the large whales eating mostly plankton , small whales eating fish and medium - sized whales eating squid .
" Those differences were probably in place by 25 million years ago at the latest , and for many millions of years , they have not changed very much , " said the study 's lead author , Graham Slater , a National Science Foundation - funded UCLA postdoctoral scholar in Alfaro 's laboratory .
" It 's as if whales split things up at the beginning and went their separate ways .
The distribution of whale body size and diet still corresponds to these early splits . "
" The shape of variation that we see in modern whales today is the result of partitioning of body sizes early on in their history , " Alfaro said .
" Whatever conditions allowed modern whales to persist allowed them to evolve into unique , disparate modes of life , and those niches largely have been maintained throughout most of their history .
" We could have found that the main whale lineages over time each experimented with being large , small and medium - sized and that all the dietary forms appeared throughout their evolution , or that whales started out medium - sized and the largest and smallest ones appeared more recently -- but the data show none of that .
Instead , we find that the differences today were apparent very early on . "
Killer whales are an exception , having become larger over the last 10 million years , Alfaro and Slater said .
Killer whales are unusual in that they eat mammals , including other whales .
advertisement
" If we look at rates of body - size evolution throughout the whale family tree , the rate of body - size evolution in the killer whale is the fastest , " Slater said .
" It came from the size of a dolphin you would see at SeaWorld about 10 million years ago and grew substantially . "
Whales range in size from the largest animal known to have ever existed , the blue whale , which is more than 100 feet long , to small species that are about the size of a dog and can get caught in fishermen 's nets , Slater said .
Alfaro and Slater do not find evidence for rapid whale diversification , but extinctions may have made it difficult to detect early rapid diversification .
Whales are about 55 million years old , but the first group of whales to take to water is extinct , Alfaro said .
Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the rapid appearance and diversification of modern whales , which coincided with the extinction of the primitive whales .
Before the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , there were large marine reptiles in the oceans that went extinct .
When the earliest whales first went into the oceans some 55 million years ago , they had essentially no competitors , Alfaro and Slater noted .
These primitive whales ranged in size from several feet to 65 feet long and looked similar to land animals , Slater said .
They all fed on fish ; the earliest whales did not dive deep down to catch squid .
Alfaro 's laboratory uses many techniques , including the analysis of DNA sequences , computational techniques and the fossil record to analytically test ideas about when major groups appear and when they become dominant .
He and his research team integrate information from the fossil record with novel computational methods of analysis .
" We are interested in understanding the causes of biodiversity , " Alfaro said .
" If we really want to understand species diversity , the number of species in any given group and how the variation in body size came to be , this paper points out that we will need to rely on more of a collaboration between paleontologists and molecular biologists to detect possible changes in the rate at which new species came into existence , " Slater said .
The analytical tools for integrating the fossil data with the molecular data are just being developed , said Alfaro , whose research is bridging the divide .
Co-authors on the Proceedings of the Royal Society B study are Samantha Price , a postdoctoral scholar at UC Davis , and Francesco Santini , a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in Alfaro 's laboratory .
The research is federally funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and by the NSF - funded National Evolutionary Synthesis Center .

It was only yesterday that Britain 's societies of accountants and economists disturbed 5 o'clock tea , saying that - according to their calculations - the Empire 's public net debts of £ 2 Trillion were more than double the official figure .
This was a bad guess .
It is £ 4 Trillion or again double that overnight , at least according to this story in the Independent :
The true scale of Britain 's national indebtedness was laid bare by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) yesterday : almost £ 4 trillion , or £ 4,000bn , about four times higher than previously acknowledged .
It quantifies the burden that will be placed on future generations , and it is the ONS 's first attempt to draw together the " off - balance - sheet " liabilities that have been accumulated by the state .
The figures imply a huge " intergenerational transfer " - broadly in favour of today 's " baby boomer " generation at the expense of younger people and future generations .
The debt primarily consists of the cost of public sector and state pensions , and of payments promised to private contractors under private finance initiatives .
It far exceeds any of the figures so far published for the national debt , the largest current estimate for which is £ 903 bn ...
It appears Dagong 's " AA - " rating is closer to the reality than the " AAA " given by Western rating agencies , who have so far only cautioned a downgrade in the distant future for the UK .
But it still escapes my understanding how 3 major bodies can differ so widely on the key figure of these times : total government debt .
We have seen it before earlier this year , when debt figures of Greece and Ireland multiplied within a few days / hours , leading to massive loss of confidence in the troubled Euro .
This is understandable .
Can we trust official figures anymore when they exponentially mushroom overnight ?
I have searched the reported figures on the ONS website with a blank result for the staggering £ 4 Trillion number , this being the latest on public net debt .
Note the steeper curve due to bank rescues , though .
The Independent exclusively has these details and a sobering perspective for future generations :
If the current generation of taxpayers wanted to remove the higher bills facing their children and grandchildren , they would now be paying around 30 per cent more in tax .
The ONS data strengthens the Government 's hand in its attempt to pull down state spending .
The ONS itemised the public sector 's main liabilities as :
Future payments for the state old age pension : £ 1.1 to £ 1.4 Trillion
Unfunded public sector pensions for teachers , NHS staff and civil servants : £ 770 billion to £ 1.2 Trillion
Payments under private finance initiative contracts : £ 200 billion
Contingent liabilities ( eg bank deposit guarantees ) : £ 500 billion
Nuclear power plant decommissioning : £ 45 billion
Impact of financial sector interventions : £ 1to £ 1.5 Trillion
Given the wide estimates , would you be surprised if another Trillion gets tacked on ?
If you still count find the exact figure of global debts from 2009 , that figure still stands unchanged and unchallenged .
For all of its wild popularity , caffeine is one seriously misunderstood substance .
It 's not a simple upper , and it works differently on different people with different tolerances — even in different menstrual cycles .
But you can make it work better for you .

We 've covered all kinds of caffeine " hacks " here at Lifehacker , from taking " caffeine naps " to getting " optimally wired . "
And , of course , we 're obsessed with the perfect cup of coffee .
But when it comes to why so many of us love our coffee , tea , soda , or energy drink fixes , and what they actually do to our busy brains , we 've never really dug in .

While there 's a whole lot one can read on caffeine , most of it falls in the realm of highly specific medical research , or often conflicting anecdotal evidence .
Luckily , one intrepid reader and writer has actually done that reading , and weighed that evidence , and put together a highly readable treatise on the subject .
Buzz : The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine , by Stephen R. Braun , is well worth the short 224 - page read .
It was released in 1997 , but remains the most accessible treatise on what is and is n't understood about what caffeine and alcohol do to the brain .
It 's not a social history of coffee , or a lecture on the evils of mass - market soda — it 's condensed but clean science .
Advertisement
What follows is a brief explainer on how caffeine affects productivity , drawn from Buzz and other sources noted at bottom .
We also sent Braun a few of the questions that arose while reading , and he graciously agreed to answer them .
Caffeine Doesn't Actually Get You Wired
Right off the bat , it 's worth stating again : the human brain , and caffeine , are nowhere near totally understood and easily explained by modern science .
That said , there is a consensus on how a compound found all over nature , caffeine , affects the mind .
Advertisement
Every moment that you 're awake , the neurons in your brain are firing away .
As those neurons fire , they produce adenosine as a byproduct , but adenosine is far from excrement .
Your nervous system is actively monitoring adenosine levels through receptors .
Normally , when adenosine levels reach a certain point in your brain and spinal cord , your body will start nudging you toward sleep , or at least taking it easy .
There are actually a few different adenosine receptors throughout the body , but the one caffeine seems to interact with most directly is the A1 receptor .
More on that later .
Advertisement
Enter caffeine .
It occurs in all kinds of plants , and chemical relatives of caffeine are found in your own body .
But taken in substantial amounts — the semi-standard 100 mg that comes from a strong eight - ounce coffee , for instance — it functions as a supremely talented adenosine impersonator .
It heads right for the adenosine receptors in your system and , because of its similarities to adenosine , it 's accepted by your body as the real thing and gets into the receptors .

Update : Commenter dangermou5e reminds us of web comic
The Oatmeal 's take on adenosine and caffeine .
It 's concise :
Advertisement
More important than just fitting in , though , caffeine actually binds to those receptors in efficient fashion , but does n't activate them — they 're plugged up by caffeine 's unique shape and chemical makeup .
With those receptors blocked , the brain 's own stimulants , dopamine and glutamate , can do their work more freely —
" Like taking the chaperones out of a high school dance , " Braun writes in an email .
In the book , he ultimately likens caffeine 's powers to " putting a block of wood under one of the brain 's primary brake pedals . "
Advertisement
It 's an apt metaphor , because it spells out that caffeine very clearly does n't press the " gas " on your brain , and that it only blocks a " primary " brake .
There are other compounds and receptors that have an effect on what your energy levels feel like — GABA , for example — but caffeine is a crude way of preventing your brain from bringing things to a halt .
" You can , " Braun writes , " get wired only to the extent that your natural excitatory neurotransmitters support it . "
In other words , you can't use caffeine to completely wipe out an entire week 's worth of very late nights of studying , but you can use it to make yourself feel less bogged down by sleepy feelings in the morning .
These effects will vary , in length and strength of effect , from person to person , depending on genetics , other physiology factors , and tolerance .
But more on that in a bit .
What 's important to take away is that caffeine is not as simple in effect as a direct stimulant , such as amphetamines or cocaine ; its effect on your alertness is far more subtle .

It Boosts Your Speed , But Not Your Skill — Depending on Your Skill Set

Johann Sebastian Bach loved him some coffee .
So did Voltaire , Balzac , and many other great minds .
But the type of work they did did n't necessarily get a boost from their prodigious coffee consumption — unless their work was so second - nature to them that it felt like data entry .
The general consensus on caffeine studies shows that it can enhance work output , but mainly in certain types of work .
For tired people who are doing work that 's relatively straightforward , that does n't require lots of subtle or abstract thinking , coffee has been shown to help increase output and quality .
Caffeine has also been seen to improve memory creation and retention when it comes to " declarative memory , " the kind students use to remember lists or answers to exam questions .
Advertisement
( In a semi-crazy side note we could n't resist , researchers have implied this memory boost may be tied to caffeine 's effect on adrenaline production .
You have , presumably , sharper memories of terrifying or exhilarating moments in life , due in part to your body 's fight - or - flight juice .
Everyone has their " Where I was when I heard that X died " story , plugging in John F. Kennedy , John Lennon , or Kurt Cobain , depending on generational relatability ) .
Then again , one study in which subjects proofread text showed that a measurable boost was mainly seen by those who could be considered " impulsive , " or willing to sacrifice accuracy and quality for speed .
And the effect was only seen in morning tests , indicating the subjects may have either become lightly dependent on caffeine , or were more disposed to such tasks at that time of day .

So when it comes to caffeine 's effects on your work , think speed , not power .
Or consider it an unresolved question .
If we 're only part of the way to understanding how caffeine affects the brain , we 're a long way to knowing exactly what kind of chemicals or processes are affected when , say , one writes a post about caffeine science one highly caffeinated afternoon .
For a more direct look at what happens to your brain when there 's caffeine in your system , we turn to the the crew at Current .
They hooked up one of their reporters to a brain monitor while taking on some new caffeine habits , and share their brains on caffeine :
Effectiveness , Tolerance , and Headaches
Why do so many patients coming out of anesthesia after major surgery feel a headache ?
It 's because , in most cases , they 're not used to going so long without coffee .
The good news ?
If they wait a few more days , they can start saving coffee again for when they really need it .
Advertisement
The effectiveness of caffeine varies significantly from person to person , due to genetics and other factors in play .
The average half - life of caffeine — that is , how long it takes for half of an ingested dose to wear off — is about five to six hours in a human body .
Women taking oral birth control require about twice as long to process caffeine .
Women between the ovulation and beginning of menstruation see a similar , if less severe , extended half - life .
For regular smokers , caffeine takes half as long to process — which , in some ways , explains why smokers often drink more coffee and feel more agitated and anxious , because they 're unaware of how their bodies work without cigarettes .
Advertisement
As one starts to regularly take in caffeine , the body and mind build up a tolerance to it , so getting the same kind of boost as one 's first - ever sip takes more caffeine — this , researchers can agree on .
Exactly how that tolerance develops is not so clear .
Many studies have suggested that , just as with any drug addiction , the brain strives to return to its normal function while under " attack " from caffeine by up - regulating , or creating more adenosine receptors .
But regular caffeine use has also been shown to decrease receptors for norepinephrine , a hormone akin to adrenaline , along with serotonin , a mood enhancer .
At the same time , your body can see a 65 percent increase in receptors for GABA , a compound that does many things , including regulate muscle tone and neuron firing .
Some studies have also seen changes in different adenosine receptors when caffeine becomes a regular thing .
Caffeine , it 's been suggested , is probably not directly responsible for all these changes .
By keeping your brain from using its normal " I 'm tired " sensors , though , your caffeine may be causing the brain to change the way all of its generally excitable things are regulated .
Your next venti double shot goes a little less far each time , in any case .

A 1995 study suggests that humans become tolerant to their daily dose of caffeine — whether a single soda or a serious espresso habit — somewhere between a week and 12 days .
And that tolerance is pretty strong .
One test of regular caffeine pill use had some participants getting an astronomical 900 milligrams per day , others placebos — found that the two groups were nearly identical in mood , energy , and alertness after 18 days .
The folks taking the equivalent of nine stiff coffee pours every day were n't really feeling it anymore .
They would feel it , though , when they stopped .
You start to feel caffeine withdrawal very quickly , anywhere from 12 to 24 hours after your last use .
That 's a big part of why that first cup or can in the morning is so important — it 's staving off the early effects of withdrawal .
The reasons for the withdrawal are the same as with any substance dependency : your brain was used to operating one way with caffeine , and now it 's suddenly working under completely different circumstances , but all those receptor changes are still in place .
Headaches are the nearly universal effect of cutting off caffeine , but depression , fatigue , lethargy , irritability , nausea , and vomiting can be part of your cut - off , too , along with more specific issues , like eye muscle spasms .
Generally , though , you 'll be over it in around 10 days — again , depending on your own physiology and other factors .

Update : Commenter microinjectionist offers his own summary of more recent caffeine studies , which offers expanded reasons why caffeine users feel a " morning crash , " as well as why your whole body , not just your brain , might feel so bad when you withdraw .
Getting Out of the Habit and Learning to Tame Caffeine
Beyond the equivalent of four cups of coffee in your system at once , caffeine is n't giving you much more boost — in fact , at around the ten - cup level , you 're probably less alert than non-drinkers .
So what if you want to start getting a real boost from caffeine once again , in a newly - learned , less - dependent way ?

Our own Jason Fitzpatrick has both intentionally " quit " caffeine , as well as just plain run out of coffee .
Being the kind of guy who measures his own headaches and discomfort , he suggests measuring your caffeine intake , using caffeine amounts in all your drinks , chocolate , and other " boosting " foods .
Wise Bread has a good roundup of caffeine amounts , and the Buzz Vs. The Bulge chart also shows how many calories you 'll be cutting if you start scaling back .
Once you know your levels , map out a multi - week process of scaling down , and stick to it .
Jason also suggests that dependency kicking is a good time to start taking walks , doing breathing exercises , or other mind - clearing things , because , in his experience , their effects are much greater when caffeine is not so much a part of your make - up .

Braun , author of Buzz , sees it the same way , but still uses coffee — strategically , according to our email exchange :
In practical terms , this means that if you 'd like to be able to turn to caffeine when you need it for a quick , effective jolt , it 's best to let your brain " dry out " for at least several days prior to administration .
This is actually my current mode of consumption .
I do n't regularly drink coffee anymore ( gasp ) .
This from a man who loved ( and wore out ) his home espresso maker .
I love coffee in all its guises .
But after 30 + years it was n't working for me .
For one thing , the problem with caffeine is that there are adenosine receptors all over the body , including muscles .
For me , that meant that caffeine made me vaguely stiff and sore , and it aggravated a tender lower back that was prone to spasm .
But I also just was n't getting a clean , clear buzz from coffee ... I drank so much , so regularly , that drinking an extra cup or two did n't do a helluva lot except , perhaps , make me a little more irritable .
So about a year ago I slowly tapered down , and now I have , if anything , a cup of tea ( half black , half peppermint ) in the morning .
( The amount of caffeine from the black tea is n't enough to wire a gnat . )
Not only does my body feel better now , my brain is clean of caffeine , so I really want ( or need ) a good neural jump - start , I will freely ... nay , ecstatically ... indulge .
Then I stop and let the brain settle again .
That 's the theory , anyway ... and it 's basically true , although I 'll freely admit that sometimes I have an espresso or coffee just because it tastes so damned good .

Facebook , MySpace and other social networks have apparently been sending personal and identifiable information about users to advertisers without consent , despite assurances to the contrary .
Large advertising companies including Google 's DoubleClick and Yahoo's Right Media have received information including usernames and ID numbers that could be traced back to individual profiles as users clicked on ads .
The data could potentially be used to look up personal information about the user , including real name , age , occupation , location and anything else made public on the profile .
Both of the aforementioned companies denied being aware of the " extra " data they were receiving and claim they have not made use of it .
The Wall Street Journal reports that since questions were raised about the practice with Facebook and MySpace , both companies have since rewritten at least some of the code that allowed transmission of identifiable data .
Beyond those two companies , LiveJournal , Hi5 , Xanga and Digg made the list of sites who have sent identifiable information back to advertisers when a user clicked on individual ads .
The WSJ found that Facebook went farther than most in sharing identifiable data by sending the username of the person clicking the ad as well as the username of the profile he or she was viewing at the time .
This news could hardly come at a worse time for Facebook , a company that currently faces a privacy backlash potent enough to make the cover of Time Magazine this month .
Outside of Facebook , the other companies named in the article maintain the data they send to advertisers contains the user ID of the profile a user is visiting when he or she clicks on an ad , and not the user ID of the individual visitor .
Both Google and Yahoo strongly refuted the idea that they would ever make use of any such personally identifiable data .
Yahoo VP of Global Policy Anne Toth said of the allegations , " We prohibit clients from sending personally identifiable information to us .
We have told them .
' We do n't want it .
You should n't be sending it to us .
If it happens to be there , we are not looking for it . ' "
What do you think :
Is this another privacy - related stain on Facebook as well as other social networks , or much ado about nothing ?
UPDATE : Digg contacted us to clarify what they do and do not do with respect to personally identifiable information sent to advertisers .
Chas Edwards , Publisher & Chief Revenue Officer at Digg , indicated that although the URL of the page the user is currently visiting is passed through ( note that this is normal behavior — essentially how URLs function on the web ) , no personally identifiable information about the user themselves is passed through : " We do n't share user data or any other personally identifiable information with any advertisers or ad networks , even if a user clicks on an ad ; we only provide URLs of pages being visited .
For site analytics purposes , we do share user data — that is * encrypted * so that it can't be tracked to PII on an individual user — with 3rd party research suppliers such as Omniture . "
“ It would be like saying the Canadians are having travel difficulties and the U.S. says we ’ll make you U.S. passports and you can go over , ” Ms. Waterman said .

Only a few Indian nations issue their own passports , said Robert J. Miller , a professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland , Ore. , who has written extensively about federal Indian law .
He said that he had never heard of the United States government objecting to the use of such a document .
Neither has Robert Anderson , who was associate solicitor for Indian affairs in the Interior Department during the Clinton administration and now directs the Native American Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law .
“ The tribes will probably say , ‘ Hey , we ’ve got the authority to do this , ’ ” he said .
But the State Department said Monday that federal law does not allow a tribal document to be used in lieu of a United States passport when traveling outside the United States .
A spokeswoman said that an October 2008 internal directive emphasized that policy , though it noted that other countries had sometimes recognized such documents .
Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano on Monday to express his dismay that the players were being prohibited from traveling with their tribal passports .
“ It ’s a matter of tribal sovereignty and respecting the rights of the Native American population of this country , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Representative Dan Maffei , a Democrat from upstate New York , said that the federal government ’s refusal to recognize the Iroquois passports had the potential to be an “ embarrassing situation ” for the United States .
Approximately 700 IP - addresses of BitTorrent users who allegedly shared a copy of ' The Hurt locker ' have been submitted to the Washington D.C. District Court .
The public court records show that nearly all IPs in the group were tracked from the last week of April until the first week of May .
Little more than a week ago the makers of The Hurt Locker filed a complaint against the first 5,000 ‘ unidentified ’ BitTorrent users .
Helped by the U.S. Copyright Group ( USCG ) , the film makers are requesting the personal details connected to the IP - addresses that allegedly shared the film on BitTorrent .
The first batch of IP - addresses ( copy below ) has now been submitted to the Court , linked to customers of over a dozen US Internet providers .
Besides the IP - address and the time when the alleged infringement was recorded the document reveals very little evidence .
It is unclear from the current details what file was tracked and whether the evidence gathering techniques will stand up to scrutiny .
The D.C District Court will now have to decide whether or not the ISPs of the alleged infringers will be ordered to hand over the personal information of the users associated with the IP - addresses .
If this happens , the customers who are identified will receive a settlement offer of $ 2,500 .
Through this scheme , the USCG and Hurt Lockers ’ makers hope to collect millions of dollars in revenue , beating their box office earnings .
It ’s interesting to note that none of the IP - addresses in this first batch are linked to Time Warner customers .
The ISP in question is the only one that is standing up against the money grab , as it went to court hoping to prevent a subpoena that will force them to expose hundreds of customers to the USCG .
Time Warner claims that this process would prove too time consuming .
A problem that has been overlooked by most of the press and expert comments is the fact that there will be dozens of wrongfully accused people .
Through similar cases in the UK we ’ve learned that the evidence provided by the copyright holders is very flaky to say the least .
We suspect that the USCG , which appears to be a two man operation , is simply out to collect as much money as possible through settlements and will avoid taking individual cases to court .
Besides The Hurt Locker , USCG is working together with smaller film companies in similar campaigns , and they are looking for new clients to expand their profitable business .
This success story has not gone unnoticed by their UK equivalent ACS : LAW who have announced they will also enter the US market .
In the UK this scheme has been labeled a scam by politicians , while its lawyers are accused of “ harassment , bullying and intrusion ” and “ legal blackmail ” .
Yesterday , the Justice Department arrested a total of eight people for allegedly carrying out long - term , “ deep - cover ” assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation .
These secret agents were planted in the U.S. and given fake identities and high - tech equipment in order to carry out a mission : “ To search and develop ties in policymaking circles in the U.S. and to send reports to Center , ” according to the federal complaint .
To do this , the feds say , they used all kinds of cool spy stuff , like invisible handwriting , short - wave radio , codes and ciphers , and “ brush passes ” ( Defined as “ the clandestine , hand - to - hand delivery of items or payments made as one person walks by another in a public place ” ) .
Just like in the movies !
But the following interaction between two of the spies , “ Richard Murphy ” of New Jersey and “ Michael Zottoli ” of Virginia , at what sounds like Tillie ’s Coffee Shop in Fort Greene , Brooklyn , suggests it was n’t always all glamour and excitement and metal briefcases and mysterious women with severe bangs .
From the complaint :
At approximately 11 am , agents conducting surveillance in Brooklyn observed that Murphy and Zottoli meet at a pay phone located at the corner of Vanderbilt and DeKalb Avenues , and then walk to a nearby coffee shop .
Zottolli and Murphy sat down at a table together where they stayed for approximately one hour and fifty minutes .
During that time , law enforcement agents stationed inside the coffee shop overheard Murphy and Zottoli discussing the problems the Seattle conspirators were having with the computer equipment that they used for communicating with the center .
In response to Zottoli ’s description of these communications problems , Murphy stated ( in substance and in part ) , “ This should help . ”
Murphy further responded ( in substance and in part ) , “ If this does n’t work we can meet again in six months ” and also said , “ they do n’t understand what we go through over here . ”
Ah , frustration in the workplace .
Cuts across all lines , does n’t it .

As the ongoing fight about a trans - inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act ( ENDA ) bill rages on in the United States , a recent report in New York has raised questions about the effectiveness of such bills in tackling discrimination against transgender people in the workplace .
Undertaken by Make the Road New York ( the “ New York LGBTQ Justice Project ” ) , the “ Transgender Need Not Apply ” report engaged in a rather stunning experiment .
They investigated potential employment discrimination in New York by using the “ matched pairs ” methodology used in some social science experiments .
The matched pairs of job applicants used were alike in every way ( race , sex , age , qualifications , interview technique ) except transgender status , thus attempting to filter out other variables in discrimination .
Two pairs of job - seekers were sent out to the same interviews at high - end Manhattan stores like J. Crew , American Eagle and Virgin Megastore .
The results were stunning .
Out of the 24 employers , 11 hired the cisgender ( that is , not trans ) applicant but not the trans one .
At one store , both were offered jobs .
In only one store ( Virgin Megastore ) was the trans applicant offered a job and the cis control group not .
Most egregiously , at J. Crew and American Eagle , both cis applicants were offered jobs while the trans applicants were not .
To summarize , the study found an “ astonishing 42 % discrimination rate ” against transgender job seekers .
For transgender people , this news will not come as much of a surprise , ringing true with anecdotal experience for mass unemployment in our community .
Although there have been few large - scale studies on trans unemployment , some studies have suggested that trans people are up to 60 % unemployed .
A further survey undertaken by Make the Road found that 49 % of their 82 transgender respondents had never been offered a job while living as a transgender person .
So while a matched - pairs study involving only one transgender woman and one transgender man is undoubtedly limited , the results are nevertheless quite telling .
With such a small sample size we may debate the broader occurrence of discrimination , but what is clear from this experiment is that there is some significant measure of discrimination against trans people looking for work .
What is even more significant is that New York City has had a law against transgender discrimination since 2002 , and has fairly comprehensive protections against discrimination in education , housing , employment and public accommodations .
Further , unlike some jurisdictions which define transgender access to anti-discrimination by surgical status , New York defines “ gender ” in the broadest possible terms :
The term “ gender ” shall include actual or perceived sex and shall also include a person ’s gender identity , self - image , appearance , behavior or expression , whether or not that gender identity , self - image , appearance , behavior or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the legal sex assigned to that person at birth .
The point is , therefore , even with the most inclusive bill possible , in a city that has long been home to a large trans population , discrimination appears to be endemic and widespread eight years after the bill ’s passing .
The abilities of anti-discrimination bills to truly address employment systemic discrimination against marginalized populations , therefore , seem profoundly limited .
As Joi-Elle White , a transgender member of Make the Road , says in the report :
“ The law in New York has been out there since 2002 but it ’s hard to enforce it .
Employers are getting smarter is the only difference ; they ’re more polite when they do n’t hire you .
And if they hire you but later find out you ’re trans , they ’ll get rid of you for no reason .
Like you came late once .
Or they ’ll say that you lied on the application about your gender .
The real reason they ’re firing you is you ’re trans .
So while transgender bloggers have been rightly up - in - arms about Senator Barney Frank ’s move to once again remove transgender protections from the ENDA bill , it ’s worth noting how incomplete and and ineffective anti-discrimination bills can be .
This is not a reason to not pass bills , or to pursue legal reform in transgender activism .
Rather , as the New York experiment suggests , anti-discrimination bills can only ever be a first step and not an end point in themselves .
Even if a trans - inclusive ENDA bill passed , depressingly , it is likely that as a community transgender people will be in roughly the same position , employment - wise .
Indeed , the Make the Road experiment also illuminates broader labor trends in the United States .
Workers in the high - end retail jobs the matched pairs applied for have little to no protections themselves .
Joi-Elle
White ’s comment suggests the vulnerability of workers in the retail and service industries , able to be fired for minor to non-existent infractions without any recourse .
The road to solutions to trans unemployment therefore is profoundly murky ; however , there may be some hope in LGBT / Labor partnerships .
As a tiny minority , transgender men and women have far from the numbers to cause the kinds of systemic change and education needed to reduce the discrimination in workplaces .
Unions , however , have the power to create collective bargaining agreements , to advocate effectively for trans people in particular fields .
Less than 1 in 10 American workers is the member of a union .
Perhaps the path to employment protection lies in joining unions , for despite the wishful thinking of free - market dogmatists , employers rarely make progressive changes out of the sheer kindness of their hearts .
In practice , the invisible hand of the market rarely produces vicious competition and beneficent social change without prompting from either government or labor .
The election of Mary Kay Henry as president of the Service Employees International Union , the first openly queer person to hold the position , suggests that some activists have seen labor as a more productive route to GLBT rights .
It is a path we can only hope that transgender activists will begin to follow in addressing the needs of the community .

Prosecutors in the western city of Aachen are questioning a man for spying on schoolgirls using the web cameras on their own computers .
Police used the man 's Internet Protocol ( IP ) address to track him to his home , according to an association of German data protection specialists .
The daily Westfalenblatt reported that the man spied used a computer virus to spy on over 150 girls .
Prosecutors confirmed an investigation was ongoing but declined to comment on the number of victims .
A widespread problem
One girl 's chat contacts provided a list of victims for the hacker
The case was discovered by Thomas Floss , a data protection advocate who gives presentations in schools to promote awareness of safe Internet practices .
Two girls came forward after one of his presentations to tell him that their web cameras lit up even when the girls had not activated them .
Floss said he believes the problem to be widespread .
" I 've visited 50 to 60 schools , and each time at least one girl tells me she has had this kind of problem , " he said .
Floss 's suspicions were confirmed when he discovered a so - called Trojan virus on one of the girl 's computers .
It is now believed the hacker broke into one of the girl 's accounts on the ICQ chat application and sent the virus to new targets he found on the girl 's contact list .
' Reset the Internet '
The girls knew something was wrong when their webcams lit up by themselves
Politicians responded to the uproar surrounding the case , stressing the need to protect young Web surfers from dangerous hackers .
" This case has made clear how web cameras and other input devices can be manipulated , " said Federal Data Protection Commissioner Peter Schaar .
" They pose a greatly underestimated danger . "
Wolfgang Bosbach , a leading member of the Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union , meanwhile called for a systematic prosecution of Internet crime to discourage copy - cats .
" This is why it 's so important to educate especially children and teenagers about the dangers of the Internet , " he said .
Stronger demands came from Klaus Jansen , head of the Association of German Detectives , who insisted that there was no longer room for anonymity on the Internet .
Jansen called for identification requirements for web surfers - and for the introduction of a " reset button for the Internet " that would allow the German chancellor to remove Germany from the Internet in the case of an emergency .
A simpler solution ?
Constanze Kurz of the hacker association Chaos Computer Club , dismissed Jansen 's suggestions .
" He can put away his science fiction novels now , " she said .
Kurz stressed that anonymity on the Internet was key to freedom of information and the formation of opinions .
She prescribed a " quite simple solution to the problem :
Put a sticker over the lens . "

" The Rest of the Story * " Boardwalk and Park Place go to War !
By Patrick Tillery
In September 1944 a hungry , cold , terrified airman hunched over what remained of a recently arrived Red Cross package .
He had been a POW since his Lancaster was shot down over the Ruhr valley in 1943 .
His excitement grew as he saw the tiny red spot .
He had been briefed about it just before his first mission .
To identify a ' special '
Monopoly set , a tiny red dot , designed to look like a simple printing glitch , was in the corner of the Free Parking square !
1941 Monopoly Box

His hands trembled as he split the box cardboard in the dim light from the tiny barred window above his head .
He had already ravenously eaten the food that was left in the Red Cross Package and now found the strength to consider another escape attempt .
A previous attempt had led to failure and severe punishment .
Getting through the barbed wire had been relatively easy but finding his way through the snow and forests of Eastern Germany was not , nor was finding help or purchasing food or train tickets .
He simply got lost until the patrols with dogs ran him down .

As he gently spread the layers of cardboard of the package , he found two slivers of metal which screwed together to form a file .
He broke the little wooden red hotel to find a tiny silk map of his region folded very tightly .
Under the packaged Monopoly money was real German Reich marks ready to spend and , finally , inside the Scotty dog was a tiny compass .
Here was what he needed to be among the estimated 35,000 Allied POWs who escaped from German and Italian camps during WWII .
The contraband in the Monopoly games is credited with at least one third of them During WWII , it is estimated that there were 135,000 British ( 50,000 from Dunkirk alone ) and 95,532 US Prisoners of War held by Germany .
By 1945 American and British POWs were mostly concentrated in about a dozen camps of several thousand each .
Hitler , earlier , had decreed that all American and British prisoners were to be held at least 1000 miles from the English Channel .
In order to make successful escapes as difficult as possible , Germans located the camps as far east as possible .
As luck would have it , ' games and pastimes ' was a category allowed into packages sent by the International Red Cross to prisoners of war .
To help prisoners escape , in 1941 , the British Secret Service asked John Waddington Ltd. ( The Monopoly manufacturer in UK ) to add a few little secret goodies to some sets .
The most valuable aid was considered to be the maps showing the specific area of the POW camp with places marked where an escapee could expect help .

There were several problems here .
Maps were fragile and noisy when opened or closed .
MI - 5 came up with the idea of printing escape maps on silk .
It is durable , can be folded - up into tiny spaces , and unfolded as many times as needed  all silently .
At that time , there was only one manufacturer in Great Britain that had perfected the technology of printing on silk and that was John Waddington , Ltd .
They were already printing silk maps for British and American air crews .
They now started printing silk maps to be hidden inside Monopoly games .
When processed , these maps were folded small enough to fit inside a Monopoly playing piece .
Also , under the fake money was real French , German and Italian currency .
Secret devices like files and compasses were also disguised as game pieces .
Waddington 's also managed to add a playing token containing a small magnetic compass and a two - part metal file that could easily be screwed together .
In absolute secrecy in a guarded , inaccessible workshop at Waddington's , a group sworn - to - secrecy was producing the sets .
After the war any remaining sets were quietly destroyed .
Everyone involved , even the escaped prisoners , were sworn to secrecy .
The Cold War was now beginning so Allied officials wanted to ensure the innocent looking board game could go back to war if required .
This secrecy continued with the help of The British Official Secrets Act until 2007 .
The story was then declassified and surviving craftsmen and the Waddington firm itself was honored in a public ceremony .

Image caption John Sweeney followed the debt trail of the Glazer family
Manchester United 's owners are £ 1.1 bn in debt - £ 400 m more than previously known - after borrowing extensively against their shopping mall business .
BBC Panorama has found evidence that the Glazer family 's debt levels may threaten their hold on the club .
A spokesman for the American family has said it holds more than £ 2bn in assets .
But the extent of the debt owed by the Glazers is likely to fuel a continuing revolt by some supporters , who oppose their ownership of the club .
Green and gold
Details of the financial arrangements of the owners also come at a time when the sport 's governing bodies are facing questions about Premier League debts that have reached a combined total of £ 3.4bn and the growing popularity of leveraged buyouts in English clubs .
These are people who tell us not to worry about Manchester United debt because they are great businessmen .
In their core business in the US they got it absolutely wrong Andy Green , City Analyst and Man U supporter
Mortgage documents seen by the BBC show that the Glazers have borrowed £ 388 m ( $ 570 m ) against shopping malls and £ 66 m ( $ 95 m ) against their American National Football League team , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .
In addition to their mortgages in the US , a portion of the Glazer family 's £ 700 m Manchester United debt will soon see them charged interest at a rate of 16.25 % .
Fans fear that , despite the club 's record of success on the pitch , the Glazers ' leveraged buy - out of United has saddled the club with debt and that may mean that there is no spare money in the future to buy a new generation of star players .
Disappointed fans have launched the " green and gold " campaign that resurrects the original team colours in protest over the Glazers ' ownership .
Their numbers have reached 158,000 and former United star David Beckham has signalled his support .
They point to the £ 80 m sale of star striker Cristiano Ronaldo last year and note that he has not been replaced by a player of similar quality .
Yet ticket prices have gone up by more than a third .
The club 's management denies any lack of commitment to buying new talent and says that cash is available for Sir Alex Ferguson to buy players .
Negative equity
City analyst Andy Green , 37 , is the disgruntled Manchester United supporter who first uncovered the extent of the Glazers ' debts .
Mr Green said : " They borrowed more money at inflated valuations right at the top of the cycle .

" These are people who tell us not to worry about Manchester United debt because they are great businessmen .
In their core business in the US they got it absolutely wrong . "
The debt levels at the club are also drawing the attention of other prominent football figures .
Dave Whelan , Chairman of Wigan Athletic , told Panorama : " I do n't think anybody can be satisfied with how Manchester United are being run ... they have got somewhere in the order of three - quarters of a billion pounds worth of debt .
That has got to be eliminated and eliminated quickly . "
The Glazer family 's main assets are the shopping centre business in America , First Allied Corporation , along with Manchester United and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .
First Allied is a private business and its accounts are not publicly available .
But Mr Green discovered that the Glazers ' shopping mall mortgages had been bundled with other loans as Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities .
Those bundles are publicly traded and therefore require the Glazers to provide detailed information on all the mortgages , which are then publicly available in the US .
Mr Green found mortgages - confirmed by the BBC - on 63 of 64 First Allied shopping centres , totalling £ 388 m ( $ 570 m ) .
Most of those were taken out with Lehman Brothers before the US investment banking giant went bankrupt , triggering the global banking crisis in 2008 .
' Watch list '
While Lehmans collapsed , the Glazers ' mortgage debt lived on and many of those shopping centres are not generating enough income to keep up with interest payments .
With falling commercial property values , many are also now in negative equity .
Banks have put 28 of the shopping centres on a watch list , meaning they are worried about the loans .
Four shopping centres - one each in Ohio , New Mexico , Texas and Georgia - have already gone bankrupt .
When they bought Manchester United in 2005 , the Glazer family borrowed £ 500 m and paid the remaining £ 272 million in cash .
Mr Green found that the Glazers had remortgaged 25 of their shopping centres in the six months before the takeover .
He believes the family borrowed against their US properties to pay for United : " At the time when they had to present a huge amount of cash over here in the UK they borrowed a huge amount of extra money in the US and publicly they did n't buy anything else that year . "
A spokesman for the family did not respond to questions about the mortgages taken out by First Allied .
But with properties now worth about £ 380 m ( $ 550 m ) but mortgages valued at £ 395 m ( $ 570 m ) , the shopping mall company now appears to be worth next to nothing .
' Commercial expertise '
That financial picture has analyst Mr Green questioning how the Glazers will service their £ 1.1 bn debt .
Image caption Fans are wearing green and gold in protest over the Glazers ' ownership
United chief executive , David Gill , has said : " We 're very confident the business model we have in place will ensure the club can continue to compete at the top of football for many years to come .
" The owners have been true to their word since they took over the club in 2005 .
They 've brought commercial expertise and commercial benefit to us in a numbers of areas , and we 've seen our revenues grow significantly . "
The Glazers ' most troublesome debts are held by Red Football , the parent company that owns Manchester United .
They are payment in kind loans , or PIKs , worth £ 200 m and the interest owing on them will soon rise to 16.25 % .
Mr Gill told the BBC in January : " We do n't worry about the PIK repayment .
That 's nothing to do with the club . "
A spokesman for Manchester United told the BBC last week that the club stands behind Mr Gill 's assertion that the debts will be repaid without involving the club .
But sources close to the Glazers have confirmed that Red Football may use cash from Manchester United to pay off the PIKs in the future .
The Glazers are said to be " comfortable " with the PIKs .
The situation at Manchester United reflects the wider issue within the Premier League , where clubs like Liverpool and West Ham are struggling with huge debts and FA Cup finalists Portsmouth barely staved off bankruptcy .
Both the Premier League and the FA declined requests for interviews on the subject of debt in football .

A Nation At Risk
If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today , we might well have viewed it as an act of war .
As it stands , we have allowed this to happen to ourselves .
We have even squandered the gains in student achievement made in the wake of the Sputnik challenge .
Moreover , we have dismantled essential support systems which helped make those gains possible .
We have , in effect , been committing an act of unthinking , unilateral educational disarmament .
Our society and its educational institutions seem to have lost sight of the basic purposes of schooling , and of the high expectations and disciplined effort needed to attain them .
This report , the result of 18 months of study , seeks to generate reform of our educational system in fundamental ways and to renew the Nation 's commitment to schools and colleges of high quality throughout the length and breadth of our land .
That we have compromised this commitment is , upon reflection , hardly surprising , given the multitude of often conflicting demands we have placed on our Nation 's schools and colleges .
They are routinely called on to provide solutions to personal , social , and political problems that the home and other institutions either will not or cannot resolve .
We must understand that these demands on our schools and colleges often exact an educational cost as well as a financial one .
On the occasion of the Commission 's first meeting , President Reagan noted the central importance of education in American life when he said : " Certainly there are few areas of American life as important to our society , to our people , and to our families as our schools and colleges . "
This report , therefore , is as much an open letter to the American people as it is a report to the Secretary of Education .
We are confident that the American people , properly informed , will do what is right for their children and for the generations to come .
The Risk
The risk is not only that the Japanese make automobiles more efficiently than Americans and have government subsidies for development and export .
It is not just that the South Koreans recently built the world 's most efficient steel mill , or that American machine tools , once the pride of the world , are being displaced by German products .
It is also that these developments signify a redistribution of trained capability throughout the globe .
Knowledge , learning , information , and skilled intelligence are the new raw materials of international commerce and are today spreading throughout the world as vigorously as miracle drugs , synthetic fertilizers , and blue jeans did earlier .
If only to keep and improve on the slim competitive edge we still retain in world markets , we must dedicate ourselves to the reform of our educational system for the benefit of all - - old and young alike , affluent and poor , majority and minority .
Learning is the indispensable investment required for success in the " information age " we are entering .
Our concern , however , goes well beyond matters such as industry and commerce .
It also includes the intellectual , moral , and spiritual strengths of our people which knit together the very fabric of our society .
The people of the United States need to know that individuals in our society who do not possess the levels of skill , literacy , and training essential to this new era will be effectively disenfranchised , not simply from the material rewards that accompany competent performance , but also from the chance to participate fully in our national life .
A high level of shared education is essential to a free , democratic society and to the fostering of a common culture , especially in a country that prides itself on pluralism and individual freedom .
For our country to function , citizens must be able to reach some common understandings on complex issues , often on short notice and on the basis of conflicting or incomplete evidence .
Education helps form these common understandings , a point Thomas Jefferson made long ago in his justly famous dictum :
I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves ; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion .
Indicators of the Risk
International comparisons of student achievement , completed a decade ago , reveal that on 19 academic tests American students were never first or second and , in comparison with other industrialized nations , were last seven times .
Some 23 million American adults are functionally illiterate by the simplest tests of everyday reading , writing , and comprehension .
About 13 percent of all 17 - year - olds in the United States can be considered functionally illiterate .
Functional illiteracy among minority youth may run as high as 40 percent .
Average achievement of high school students on most standardized tests is now lower than 26 years ago when Sputnik was launched .
Over half the population of gifted students do not match their tested ability with comparable achievement in school .
The College Board 's Scholastic Aptitude Tests ( SAT ) demonstrate a virtually unbroken decline from 1963 to 1980 .
Average verbal scores fell over 50 points and average mathematics scores dropped nearly 40 points .
College Board achievement tests also reveal consistent declines in recent years in such subjects as physics and English .
Both the number and proportion of students demonstrating superior achievement on the SATs ( i.e. , those with scores of 650 or higher ) have also dramatically declined .
Many 17 - year - olds do not possess the " higher order " intellectual skills we should expect of them .
Nearly 40 percent cannot draw inferences from written material ; only one - fifth can write a persuasive essay ; and only one - third can solve a mathematics problem requiring several steps .
There was a steady decline in science achievement scores of U.S. 17 - year - olds as measured by national assessments of science in 1969 , 1973 , and 1977 .
Between 1975 and 1980 , remedial mathematics courses in public 4 - year colleges increased by 72 percent and now constitute one - quarter of all mathematics courses taught in those institutions .
Average tested achievement of students graduating from college is also lower .
Business and military leaders complain that they are required to spend millions of dollars on costly remedial education and training programs in such basic skills as reading , writing , spelling , and computation .
The Department of the Navy , for example , reported to the Commission that one - quarter of its recent recruits cannot read at the ninth grade level , the minimum needed simply to understand written safety instructions .
Without remedial work they cannot even begin , much less complete , the sophisticated training essential in much of the modern military .
These deficiencies come at a time when the demand for highly skilled workers in new fields is accelerating rapidly .
For example :
Computers and computer - controlled equipment are penetrating every aspect of our lives -- homes , factories , and offices .
One estimate indicates that by the turn of the century millions of jobs will involve laser technology and robotics .
Technology is radically transforming a host of other occupations .
They include health care , medical science , energy production , food processing , construction , and the building , repair , and maintenance of sophisticated scientific , educational , military , and industrial equipment .
Analysts examining these indicators of student performance and the demands for new skills have made some chilling observations .
Educational researcher Paul Hurd concluded at the end of a thorough national survey of student achievement that within the context of the modern scientific revolution , " We are raising a new generation of Americans that is scientifically and technologically illiterate . "
In a similar vein , John Slaughter , a former Director of the National Science Foundation , warned of " a growing chasm between a small scientific and technological elite and a citizenry ill - informed , indeed uninformed , on issues with a science component . "
But the problem does not stop there , nor do all observers see it the same way .
Some worry that schools may emphasize such rudiments as reading and computation at the expense of other essential skills such as comprehension , analysis , solving problems , and drawing conclusions .
Still others are concerned that an over - emphasis on technical and occupational skills will leave little time for studying the arts and humanities that so enrich daily life , help maintain civility , and develop a sense of community .
Knowledge of the humanities , they maintain , must be harnessed to science and technology if the latter are to remain creative and humane , just as the humanities need to be informed by science and technology if they are to remain relevant to the human condition .
Another analyst , Paul Copperman , has drawn a sobering conclusion .
Until now , he has noted :
Each generation of Americans has outstripped its parents in education , in literacy , and in economic attainment .
For the first time in the history of our country , the educational skills of one generation will not surpass , will not equal , will not even approach , those of their parents .
Hope and Frustration
We have heard the voices of high school and college students , school board members , and teachers ; of leaders of industry , minority groups , and higher education ; of parents and State officials .
We could hear the hope evident in their commitment to quality education and in their descriptions of outstanding programs and schools .
We could also hear the intensity of their frustration , a growing impatience with shoddiness in many walks of American life , and the complaint that this shoddiness is too often reflected in our schools and colleges .
Their frustration threatens to overwhelm their hope .
What lies behind this emerging national sense of frustration can be described as both a dimming of personal expectations and the fear of losing a shared vision for America .
On the personal level the student , the parent , and the caring teacher all perceive that a basic promise is not being kept .
More and more young people emerge from high school ready neither for college nor for work .
This predicament becomes more acute as the knowledge base continues its rapid expansion , the number of traditional jobs shrinks , and new jobs demand greater sophistication and preparation .
On a broader scale , we sense that this undertone of frustration has significant political implications , for it cuts across ages , generations , races , and political and economic groups .
We have come to understand that the public will demand that educational and political leaders act forcefully and effectively on these issues .
Indeed , such demands have already appeared and could well become a unifying national preoccupation .
This unity , however , can be achieved only if we avoid the unproductive tendency of some to search for scapegoats among the victims , such as the beleaguered teachers .
On the positive side is the significant movement by political and educational leaders to search for solutions -- so far centering largely on the nearly desperate need for increased support for the teaching of mathematics and science .
This movement is but a start on what we believe is a larger and more educationally encompassing need to improve teaching and learning in fields such as English , history , geography , economics , and foreign languages .
We believe this movement must be broadened and directed toward reform and excellence throughout education .
Excellence in Education
We do not believe that a public commitment to excellence and educational reform must be made at the expense of a strong public commitment to the equitable treatment of our diverse population .
The twin goals of equity and high - quality schooling have profound and practical meaning for our economy and society , and we cannot permit one to yield to the other either in principle or in practice .
To do so would deny young people their chance to learn and live according to their aspirations and abilities .
It also would lead to a generalized accommodation to mediocrity in our society on the one hand or the creation of an undemocratic elitism on the other .
Our goal must be to develop the talents of all to their fullest .
Attaining that goal requires that we expect and assist all students to work to the limits of their capabilities .
We should expect schools to have genuinely high standards rather than minimum ones , and parents to support and encourage their children to make the most of their talents and abilities .
The search for solutions to our educational problems must also include a commitment to life - long learning .
The task of rebuilding our system of learning is enormous and must be properly understood and taken seriously :
Although a million and a half new workers enter the economy each year from our schools and colleges , the adults working today will still make up about 75 percent of the workforce in the year 2000 .
These workers , and new entrants into the workforce , will need further education and retraining if they -- and we as a Nation - - are to thrive and prosper .
The Learning Society
In contrast to the ideal of the Learning Society , however , we find that for too many people education means doing the minimum work necessary for the moment , then coasting through life on what may have been learned in its first quarter .
But this should not surprise us because we tend to express our educational standards and expectations largely in terms of " minimum requirements . "
And where there should be a coherent continuum of learning , we have none , but instead an often incoherent , outdated patchwork quilt .
Many individual , sometimes heroic , examples of schools and colleges of great merit do exist .
Our findings and testimony confirm the vitality of a number of notable schools and programs , but their very distinction stands out against a vast mass shaped by tensions and pressures that inhibit systematic academic and vocational achievement for the majority of students .
In some metropolitan areas basic literacy has become the goal rather than the starting point .
In some colleges maintaining enrollments is of greater day - to - day concern than maintaining rigorous academic standards .
And the ideal of academic excellence as the primary goal of schooling seems to be fading across the board in American education .
Thus , we issue this call to all who care about America and its future : to parents and students ; to teachers , administrators , and school board members ; to colleges and industry ; to union members and military leaders ; to governors and State legislators ; to the President ; to members of Congress and other public officials ; to members of learned and scientific societies ; to the print and electronic media ; to concerned citizens everywhere .
America is at risk .
We are confident that America can address this risk .
If the tasks we set forth are initiated now and our recommendations are fully realized over the next several years , we can expect reform of our Nation 's schools , colleges , and universities .
This would also reverse the current declining trend - - a trend that stems more from weakness of purpose , confusion of vision , underuse of talent , and lack of leadership , than from conditions beyond our control .
The Tools at Hand
the natural abilities of the young that cry out to be developed and the undiminished concern of parents for the well - being of their children ;
the commitment of the Nation to high retention rates in schools and colleges and to full access to education for all ;
the persistent and authentic American dream that superior performance can raise one 's state in life and shape one 's own future ;
the dedication , against all odds , that keeps teachers serving in schools and colleges , even as the rewards diminish ;
our better understanding of learning and teaching and the implications of this knowledge for school practice , and the numerous examples of local success as a result of superior effort and effective dissemination ;
the ingenuity of our policymakers , scientists , State and local educators , and scholars in formulating solutions once problems are better understood ;
the traditional belief that paying for education is an investment in ever - renewable human resources that are more durable and flexible than capital plant and equipment , and the availability in this country of sufficient financial means to invest in education ;
the equally sound tradition , from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 until today , that the Federal Government should supplement State , local , and other resources to foster key national educational goals ; and
the voluntary efforts of individuals , businesses , and parent and civic groups to cooperate in strengthening educational programs .
The Public 's Commitment
This public awareness -- and I hope public action -- is long overdue ....
This country was built on American respect for education .
. .
Our challenge now is to create a resurgence of that thirst for education that typifies our Nation 's history .
At the same time , the public has no patience with undemanding and superfluous high school offerings .
In another survey , more than 75 percent of all those questioned believed every student planning to go to college should take 4 years of mathematics , English , history / U.S. government , and science , with more than 50 percent adding 2 years each of a foreign language and economics or business .
The public even supports requiring much of this curriculum for students who do not plan to go to college .
These standards far exceed the strictest high school graduation requirements of any State today , and they also exceed the admission standards of all but a handful of our most selective colleges and universities .
Another dimension of the public 's support offers the prospect of constructive reform .
The best term to characterize it may simply be the honorable word " patriotism . "
Citizens know intuitively what some of the best economists have shown in their research , that education is one of the chief engines of a society 's material well - being .
They know , too , that education is the common bond of a pluralistic society and helps tie us to other cultures around the globe .
Citizens also know in their bones that the safety of the United States depends principally on the wit , skill , and spirit of a self - confident people , today and tomorrow .
It is , therefore , essential -- especially in a period of long - term decline in educational achievement -- for government at all levels to affirm its responsibility for nurturing the Nation 's intellectual capital .
And perhaps most important , citizens know and believe that the meaning of America to the rest of the world must be something better than it seems to many today .
Americans like to think of this Nation as the preeminent country for generating the great ideas and material benefits for all mankind .
The citizen is dismayed at a steady 15 - year decline in industrial productivity , as one great American industry after another falls to world competition .
The citizen wants the country to act on the belief , expressed in our hearings and by the large majority in the Gallup Poll , that education should be at the top of the Nation 's agenda .

Four veterinarians from the Natonal Zoo are heading to Louisiana to help with the oil slick animals that continue to struggle with the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
The animals are being cleaned up and then released back into the wild with fingers crossed .
Hopefully , they will not return to the fouled areas and become drenched in oil again , but these are nesting and migratory creatures and they have a homing instinct that makes them return to their " territory . "
They do n't carry memories of almost being killed by a thick black soup .
The veterinarians from the National Zoo will be rotating in and out of Houma , La. , over the next eight weeks to help at the incident command center there .
The first vet left yesterday .
They will be working with the U.S. Coast Guard to help determine where to release the cleaned and rehabilitated animals .
This BP disaster has dragged on for months now .
There is some hope that the flow will be diminishing soon and that a second well will stop the underwater gusher .
But for the animals , the tragedy is just beginning .
KEYNES HAYEK 1932 Cambridge vs.LSE
by Mario Rizzo
My friend economist Richard Ebeling has discovered two extremely important letters .
( Click the link above . )
In 1932 before John Maynard Keynes ’s General Theory was written , these letters appeared in The Times of London regarding the appropriate economic policies for Britain to follow during the slump .
There are a number of things that catch the eye .
First , the letter signed by J.M. Keynes is also signed by A. C. Pigou whom Keynes was later to consider a prime representative of the out - dated “ classical ” economics .
Second , Pigou and Keynes ( as well as the other signatories ) caution against both private sector and public sector austerity .
This is essentially the same stimulus idea that Keynesians are promoting today .
“ Consequently , in present conditions , private economy does not transfer from consumption to investment part of an unchanged national real income .
On the contrary , it cuts down the national income by nearly as much as it cuts down consumption .
Instead of enabling labour - power , machine - power and shipping - power , to be turned to a different and more important use , it throws them into idleness .
Moreover , what is true of individuals acting singly is equally true of groups of individuals acting through local authorities .
If the citizens of a town wish , to build a swimming - bath or a library , or a museum , they will not , by refraining from doing this , promote a wider national interest .
They will be “ martyrs by mistake , ” and , in their martyrdom , will be injuring others as well as themselves .
Through their misdirected good will the mounting wave of unemployment will be lifted still higher . ”
The letter signed by F.A. Hayek and Lionel Robbins ( and others ) is noteworthy because , first , it makes clear that “ everyone ” is in agreement that deflation is not desirable and should be avoided .
“ It is agreed that hoarding money , whether in cash or in idle balances , is deflationary in its effects .
No one thinks that deflation in itself is desirable . ”
Second , Hayek and Robbins stress that the Keynes - Pigou skepticism about private frugality is short - sighted :
“ The signatories of the [ above ] letter … , however , appear to deprecate the purchase of existing securities on the ground that there is no guarantee that the money will find its way into real investment .
Under modern conditions the securities markets are an indispensable part of the mechanism of investment .
A rise in the value of old securities is an indispensable preliminary to the flotation of new issues .
The existence of a lag between the revival of old securities and the revival elsewhere is not questioned …
[ Thus ] the sale of securities or the withdrawal of …deposits would [ not ] assist the coming of recovery . “
Third , the letter goes on to reject Keynes - Pigou fiscal stimulus on the grounds that expansion of the public debt would increase the frictions that inhibit recovery .
Finally , Hayek and Robbins conclude :
“ If the Government wish to help revival , the right way for them to proceed is , not to revert to their old habits of lavish expenditure , but to abolish those restrictions on trade and the free movement of capital … which are at present impeding even the beginning of recovery . “
It does not take much to see that the issues are basically the same today .
The positions of the opposing sides are also the same .
As I have said many times before , the great debate is still Keynes versus Hayek .
All else is footnote .

tox : Testing projects with multiple versions of Python
mock is tested on Python 2.4 upwards .
Running all the tests is done with unittest2 test discovery , so up until now I 've had several scripts for running the tests with different versions of Python .
Not difficult , but a pain .
Enter a new project by the prodigious Holger Krekel :
To use tox you create a simple config file tox.ini specifying the test command and Python versions and tox will create a virtualenv for each Python version and run your tests in it .
I can now run all the mock tests for Python 2.4 - 2.7 on both Mac OS X and Windows with a single command ( a single command on each platform - although tox does have Hudson support for continuous integration servers ) .
As well as running tests tox can execute arbitrary commands .
This means it can run sphinx commands .
For mock I have tox execute two Sphinx commands to build the documentation and run all the doctests ( only for Python 2.6 & 2.7 as some of the doctests use the with statement ) .
This way the tox run fails if there are any errors in the documentation , either reStructured
Text errors or doctest failures .
A successful run looks something like this ( output from Windows shown - with lots of it snipped ) :
C:\compile\mock > tox _________________________________

C:\compile\mock
Notice how the output from tox shows us exactly which commands are being executed .
The test execution is done with test discovery using the command .tox\py24 \Scripts\unit2 discover .
Here 's the tox.ini for the mock module :
[ tox ] envlist = py24 , py25 , py26 , py27 [ testenv ] deps=unittest2 commands=unit2 discover [ ] [ testenv: py26 ] commands= unit2 discover [ ] sphinx - build - b doctest docs html sphinx - build docs html deps = unittest2 sphinx [ testenv: py27 ] commands= unit2 discover [ ] sphinx - build - b doctest docs html sphinx - build docs html deps = unittest2 sphinx
This tells tox that when the tox command is run it is to create four different virtual environments with the four different versions of Python ( so all these versions of Python need to be installed ) .
For Python 2.6 and 2.7 there are custom command sets and Python 2.4 and 2.5 use the default [ testenv ] block .
Note Setting the PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE environment variable to a valid directory allows pip to reuse downloaded packages when it creates and populates virtual environments .
It will reuse virtual environments anyway , but keeping the cache around can be a good way of avoiding unnecessary network traffic for package downloads .
The dependencies for Python 2.4 & 2.5 are just unittest2 , for 2.6 & 2.7 Sphinx is also a dependency .
The test command is , as we 've seen , with unit2 discover .
The [ ] after the command allows extra command line options to be passed through from tox to the test runner .
For example we could use this to modify the parameters for test discovery :
tox -- - p test_signal \*
Although tox is in its early days its already useful for me to be able to run tests on four versions of Python , including testing the Sphinx documentation builds correctly and the code examples work , with a single command .
unittest2 0.5.0 : setuptools compatible test collector and Python 2.3 distribution
unittest2 0.5.0 has just been released .
This version of unittest2 has " feature parity " with the version of unittest in Python 2.7 :
If you want to ensure that your tests run identically under unittest2 and unittest in Python 2.7 you should use unittest2 0.5.0 .
Later versions of unittest2 will include changes in unittest made in Python 3.2 and onwards after the release of Python 2.7 .
unittest2 is a backport of the recent enhancements in the Python unittest testing library in Python 2.7 .
Improvements in unittest2 over standard unittest in Python 2.6 and earlier include :
automatic test discovery from the command line
failfast , catch and buffer command line options
class and module level setup and teardowns
addCleanup for better resource handling
for better resource handling test skipping and expected failures
improvements to assertRaises and assertAlmostEqual
and many new assert methods , plus better failure messages
load_tests protocol for customizing test loading
protocol for customizing test loading various other API improvements and fixes
unittest2 is tested with Python 2.4 - 2.7 .
New in 0.5.0 is a distribution for Python 2.3 contributed by Mark Roddy .
Also new in 0.5.0 is a setuptools compatible test collector .
If you put test_suite = ' unittest2.collector ' in setup.py you can then find and run your tests ( using test discovery ) with :
python setup.py test
This starts test discovery with the default parameters from the directory containing setup.py , so it is perhaps most useful as an example ( see unittest2/collector.py ) .
All Changes in 0.5.0
Addition of a setuptools compatible test collector ( very basic ) .
Specify test_suite = ' unittest2.collector ' in your setup.py .
TestSuite.debug ( ) and TestCase.debug ( ) now execute cleanup functions and class and module level setups and teardowns .
No longer monkey - patch os .
path.relpath for Python 2.4 / 2.5 so that projects do n't accidentally depend on our patching .
Contributed by Konrad Delong .
Added a Python version specific unit2 entrypoint .
This will , for example , create a unit2 - 2.6 script if unittest2 is installed with Python 2.6 .
( Requires setuptools or distribute . )
Python 2.3 compatibility ( in the python2.3 branch of the repository ) , contributed by Mark Roddy .
setuptools console script entry points are created as '.py ' scripts on Windows .
Feature parity with the Python 2.7 final release .

Dr. George Gill ( and Jaime Stuart ) Does Race Exist ?
A proponent 's perspective
by George W. Gill
Slightly over half of all biological / physical anthropologists today believe in the traditional view that human races are biologically valid and real .
Furthermore , they tend to see nothing wrong in defining and naming the different populations of Homo sapiens .
The other half of the biological anthropology community believes either that the traditional racial categories for humankind are arbitrary and meaningless , or that at a minimum there are better ways to look at human variation than through the " racial lens . "
Are there differences in the research concentrations of these two groups of experts ?
Yes , most decidedly there are .
As pointed out in a recent 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook , forensic anthropologists ( those who do skeletal identification for law - enforcement agencies ) are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races , and yet those who work with blood - group data , for instance , tend to reject the biological reality of racial categories .
Where does George Gill stand in the " great race debate ? " Read on .
I happen to be one of those very few forensic physical anthropologists who actually does research on the particular traits used today in forensic racial identification ( i.e. , " assessing ancestry , " as it is generally termed today ) .
Partly this is because for more than a decade now U.S. national and regional forensic anthropology organizations have deemed it necessary to quantitatively test both traditional and new methods for accuracy in legal cases .
I volunteered for this task of testing methods and developing new methods in the late 1980s .
What have I found ?
Where do I now stand in the " great race debate ? "
Can I see truth on one side or the other — or on both sides — in this argument ?
Findings First , I have found that forensic anthropologists attain a high degree of accuracy in determining geographic racial affinities ( white , black , American Indian , etc. ) by utilizing both new and traditional methods of bone analysis .
Many well - conducted studies were reported in the late 1980s and 1990s that test methods objectively for percentage of correct placement .
Numerous individual methods involving midfacial measurements , femur traits , and so on are over 80 percent accurate alone , and in combination produce very high levels of accuracy .
No forensic anthropologist would make a racial assessment based upon just one of these methods , but in combination they can make very reliable assessments , just as in determining sex or age .
In other words , multiple criteria are the key to success in all of these determinations .
While he does n't believe in socially stipulated " age " categories , Gill says , he can " age " skeletions with great accuracy .
I have a respected colleague , the skeletal biologist C. Loring Brace , who is as skilled as any of the leading forensic anthropologists at assessing ancestry from bones , yet he does not subscribe to the concept of race .
[ Read Brace 's position on the concept of race . ]
Neither does Norman Sauer , a board - certified forensic anthropologist .
My students ask , " How can this be ?
They can identify skeletons as to racial origins but do not believe in race ! "
My answer is that we can often function within systems that we do not believe in .
As a middle - aged male , for example , I am not so sure that I believe any longer in the chronological " age " categories that many of my colleagues in skeletal biology use .
Certainly parts of the skeletons of some 45 - year - old people look older than corresponding portions of the skeletons of some 55 - year - olds .
If , however , law enforcement calls upon me to provide " age " on a skeleton , I can provide an answer that will be proven sufficiently accurate should the decedent eventually be identified .
I may not believe in society 's " age " categories , but I can be very effective at " aging " skeletons .
The next question , of course , is how " real " is age biologically ?
My answer is that if one can use biological criteria to assess age with reasonable accuracy , then age has some basis in biological reality even if the particular " social construct " that defines its limits might be imperfect .
I find this true not only for age and stature estimations but for sex and race identification .
" I am more accurate at assessing race from skeletal remains that from looking at living people standing before me , " Gill says .
The " reality of race " therefore depends more on the definition of reality than on the definition of race .
If we choose to accept the system of racial taxonomy that physical anthropologists have traditionally established — major races : black , white , etc. — then one can classify human skeletons within it just as well as one can living humans .
The bony traits of the nose , mouth , femur , and cranium are just as revealing to a good osteologist as skin color , hair form , nose form , and lips to the perceptive observer of living humanity .
I have been able to prove to myself over the years , in actual legal cases , that I am more accurate at assessing race from skeletal remains than from looking at living people standing before me .
So those of us in forensic anthropology know that the skeleton reflects race , whether " real " or not , just as well if not better than superficial soft tissue does .
The idea that race is " only skin deep " is simply not true , as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm .
Position on race
Where I stand today in the " great race debate " after a decade and a half of pertinent skeletal research is clearly more on the side of the reality of race than on the " race denial " side .
Yet I do see why many other physical anthropologists are able to ignore or deny the race concept .
Blood - factor analysis , for instance , shows many traits that cut across racial boundaries in a purely clinal fashion with very few if any " breaks " along racial boundaries .
( A cline is a gradient of change , such as from people with a high frequency of blue eyes , as in Scandinavia , to people with a high frequency of brown eyes , as in Africa . )
" Clines " represent gradients of change , such as that between areas where most people have blue eyes and areas in which brown eyes predominate .
Morphological characteristics , however , like skin color , hair form , bone traits , eyes , and lips tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones .
This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose , cheekbones , etc .
( For example , more prominent noses humidify air better . )
As far as we know , blood - factor frequencies are not shaped by these same climatic factors .
So , serologists who work largely with blood factors will tend to see human variation as clinal and races as not a valid construct , while skeletal biologists , particularly forensic anthropologists , will see races as biologically real .
The common person on the street who sees only a person 's skin color , hair form , and face shape will also tend to see races as biologically real .
They are not incorrect .
Their perspective is just different from that of the serologist .
So , yes , I see truth on both sides of the race argument .
Those who believe that the concept of race is valid do not discredit the notion of clines , however .
Yet those with the clinal perspective who believe that races are not real do try to discredit the evidence of skeletal biology .
Why this bias from the " race denial " faction ?
This bias seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all .
For the time being at least , the people in " race denial " are in " reality denial " as well .
Their motivation ( a positive one ) is that they have come to believe that the race concept is socially dangerous .
In other words , they have convinced themselves that race promotes racism .
Therefore , they have pushed the politically correct agenda that human races are not biologically real , no matter what the evidence .
Consequently , at the beginning of the 21 st century , even as a majority of biological anthropologists favor the reality of the race perspective , not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility .
In a case as flagrant as this , we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant , politically motivated censorship .
But , you may ask , are the politically correct actually correct ?
Is there a relationship between thinking about race and racism ?
Does discussing the concept of race promote racism ?
Race and racism
Does discussing human variation in a framework of racial biology promote or reduce racism ?
This is an important question , but one that does not have a simple answer .
Most social scientists over the past decade have convinced themselves that it runs the risk of promoting racism in certain quarters .
Anthropologists of the 1950s , 1960s , and early 1970s , on the other hand , believed that they were combating racism by openly discussing race and by teaching courses on human races and racism .
Which approach has worked best ?
What do the intellectuals among racial minorities believe ?
How do students react and respond ?
Three years ago , I served on a NOVA - sponsored panel in New York , in which panelists debated the topic " Is There Such a Thing as Race ? "
Six of us sat on the panel , three proponents of the race concept and three antagonists .
All had authored books or papers on race .
Loring Brace and I were the two anthropologists " facing off " in the debate .
The ethnic composition of the panel was three white and three black scholars .
As our conversations developed , I was struck by how similar many of my concerns regarding racism were to those of my two black teammates .
Although recognizing that embracing the race concept can have risks attached , we were ( and are ) more fearful of the form of racism likely to emerge if race is denied and dialogue about it lessened .
We fear that the social taboo about the subject of race has served to suppress open discussion about a very important subject in need of dispassionate debate .
One of my teammates , an affirmative - action lawyer , is afraid that a denial that races exist also serves to encourage a denial that racism exists .
He asks , " How can we combat racism if no one is willing to talk about race ? "
" How can we combat racism , " asks an affirmative - action lawyer , " if no one is willing to talk about race ? "
Who will benefit ?
In my experience , minority students almost invariably have been the strongest supporters of a " racial perspective " on human variation in the classroom .
The first - ever black student in my human variation class several years ago came to me at the end of the course and said , " Dr. Gill , I really want to thank you for changing my life with this course . "
He went on to explain that , " My whole life I have wondered about why I am black , and if that is good or bad .
Now I know the reasons why I am the way I am and that these traits are useful and good . "
A human-variation course with another perspective would probably have accomplished the same for this student if he had ever noticed it .
The truth is , innocuous contemporary human- variation classes with their politically correct titles and course descriptions do not attract the attention of minorities or those other students who could most benefit .
Furthermore , the politically correct " race denial " perspective in society as a whole suppresses dialogue , allowing ignorance to replace knowledge and suspicion to replace familiarity .
This encourages ethnocentrism and racism more than it discourages it .
Dr. George W. Gill is a professor of anthropology at the University of Wyoming .
He also serves as the forensic anthropologist for Wyoming law - enforcement agencies and the Wyoming State Crime Laboratory .

Following the critical and commercial success of its narrative - heavy adventure game , French development studio Quantic Dream is at work on two more projects , according to founder David Cage .
" After the success of , we continue to explore how we can go further with interactive drama , " Cage said in an Examiner interview , a thriller with a branching narrative , released this February to strong reviews , and has sold more than a million units worldwide .
Despite that , neither of Quantic Dream 's upcoming projects seems to be a sequel .
Rather , Cage implied the company would capitalize on the success of that new property to allow the company to keep making new games rather than sequels .
" After Heavy Rain , we have some credibility in experimenting with new IPs and new concepts , " he said .
" We are not going to play it safe from now .
We are going to use this credibility to continue to take risks , give ourselves exciting challenges and try to invent new ways of playing .
" The Paris - based independent studio's first game was the 1997 adventure , which it followed with 2005 's ( known asin North America ) .
Before the release of , Quantic Dream said it was working on ansequel and a new game called , the latter of which was later canceled .
Whilewas never officially dropped , in 2008 Cage said the studio had put it on hold to finish .
He also said Quantic Dream was considering opening a second studio to work on two games simultaneously , but no further statements on that matter have emerged .
Despite those various clues , Cage 's most recent updates point to entirely new games .
" I believe that this is what Quantic Dream 's fans expect us to do , " he said .
" It is also what keeps me passionate about what we are doing . "
White House sends BP a $ 69 million bill
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Obama administration has sent a $ 69 million bill to BP for the U.S. government 's efforts to help deal with the energy company 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The current $ 69 million bill accounts for 75 % of what BP owes to date , and the company has until July 1 to pay the full amount , an administration official said Thursday .
The Obama administration will bill BP regularly for costs related to the spill , according to the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command , which is the government and industry task force managing the spill response .
" As a responsible party , BP ( BP ) is financially responsible for all costs associated with the response to the spill , " the task force said .
The bill was also sent to Transocean , Andarko , Moex Offshore and QBE Underwriting , a copy of the bill obtained by CNN showed .
Included in the bill sent to BP was a $ 29 million charge for Federal agencies to operate ships , aircraft and boats to monitor environmental damage and another $ 29 million charge for the activation and deployment of the National Guard , an administration official said .
BP owes $ 7 million for removal operations and other environmental assessment efforts and $ 4 million for the Department of Defense 's removal efforts and operation of ships and aircraft .
The money received from BP will help to regularly replenish the $ 1.5 billion Oil Liability Trust Fund that covers damage costs associated with oil spills , according to the statement .
BP 's leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been gushing an estimated 19,000 barrels a day since April 20 .
Earlier this week , the company said its latest efforts to cap the leak -- the biggest in U.S. history -- had failed so far .
" The administration expects prompt payment and will take additional steps as necessary to ensure that BP and other responsible parties , not American taxpayers , pay all of the costs associated with the BP / Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill , " the statement said .
The bill obtained by CNN said companies should " expect additional billings as other response costs are finalized " and warned that if BP did not pay in full , interest would be applied .
Update your twitter with your current geolocation , from terminal
I was playing with a python wrapper around the Twitter API and made a simple class that would update twitter status with the geolocation derived from your IP address .

President Obama has promised to let the Bush tax cuts expire for households making more than $ 250,000 a year .
It 's a precarious pledge .
On the one hand , raising taxes in the teeth of a tough recovery could stifle private sector hiring and hurt aggregate demand .
On the other hand , Obama 's plan would shave an estimated $ 700 billion off the debt , at a time when deficit concerns are dominating the debate over the economy .
There are no easy answers on how to juice the economy while soaking up the deficit .
Unless you 're a Republican senator , in which case there is one very , very easy answer : cut taxes and everything will work itself out .
Here 's Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl on the magical power of tax cuts ( via ThinkProgress ) :
WALLACE : We 're running out of time , so how are you going to pay $ 678 billion just on the tax cuts for people making more than $ 250,000 a year ?
KYL : You should never raise taxes in order to cut taxes .
Surely Congress has the authority and it would be right , if we decide we want to cut taxes to spur the economy , not to have to raise taxes in order to offset those costs .
You do need to offset the cost of increased spending .
And that 's what Republicans object to .
But you should never have to offset cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans .
The statement " You should never raise taxes in order to cut taxes , " is masterful in its internal logic .
Raising taxes to cut taxes ... how paradoxical , and absurd !
They believe the animal has been depicted as ferocious , aggressive and bloodthirsty and are now trying to give the devils an image overhaul and portray them as shy and retiring in an attempt to convince the Australian public that they are worth saving .

San Diego Comic - Con is one of the best events to see hot cosplay and great outfits .
There 's so much hot cosplay here that if you tried to snap a picture of everything you 'd saw , you 'd never get anywhere -- you 'd have to stop walking every minute or so !
Unfortunately , for every gorgeous face and top - notch costume , there 's another misguided attempt or failure .
I suppose both make Comic - Con famous , so we should appreciate both .
I appreciate ones like this most .
On top of the hot / not cosplay , we 've included some of the better videogame getups we 've come across .
In the gallery you 'll see Metal Gear 's Snake in proper cosplay form , but you 'll see another old man that looks like Old Snake .
That one actually is n't cosplay -- he was a barista at Starbucks .
We 're back out today to take even more pictures .
We 're hoping for the best .
No promises .

Turkey could end up seeking alliances outside the West if the European Union keeps it dangling over its bid for membership , U.S. President Barack Obama said in a newspaper interview on Thursday .
Obama told Italy 's Corriere della Sera the United States believed it would be wise for the European Union to accept Turkey , and saw reluctance to let Turkey in as a factor behind changes seen in its traditionally West - facing foreign policy .

" I recognize that this raises strong feelings in Europe and I do not think the slow pace or European reluctance is the only or predominant factor at the root of some changes in the orientation recently observed in the Turkish attitude .
" But it is inevitably destined to play a role in how the Turkish people see Europe , " Obama said .
" If they do not feel themselves part of the European family , it is natural that they should end up looking elsewhere for alliances and affiliations . "
Turkey 's past secularist governments were wary of ties with Islamic neighbors in the East , and were firm Cold War allies of the West , due to a mistrust of communism and traditional rivalry with Russia over the Black Sea and Caucasus region .
But under Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan relations have warmed up considerably with neighbors like Iran and Syria , the wider Middle East , and post - Soviet countries , while a formerly close alliance with Israel has dwindled .
Ties with Israel are at the point of breaking following the killing of nine Turkish pro-Palestinian activists during an Israeli military operation to stop a Gaza - bound aid convoy .
Critics say the trend in foreign policy reflects the AK party 's Islamist roots , though the party sees itself as a Muslim version of Europe 's conservative Christian Democrat parties .
The government says Turkey 's commitment to the West is undiminished and critics are wrongly confusing efforts to build ties and find new markets for its growing economy with a change in orientation .
Obama called Turkey 's attempt to mediate an accord with Iran on the nuclear issue " unfortunate " , but said he understood its interest as an emerging power and neighbor of Iran .
Western powers rejected a deal negotiated by Turkey and Brazil for Iran to exchange some nuclear fuel abroad .
Turkey and Brazil responded last month by becoming the only two countries to vote against sanctions on Iran in the UN Security Council .
Turkey 's AK Party government entered negotiations to join the 27 - member EU in 2005 , but the process is at risk of grinding to a halt due to an impasse over the divided island of Cyprus .
Cyprus is an EU member and its Greek Cypriot government has stalled Turkey 's bid to join because of its support for Turkish Cypriots , though Ankara now backs reunification of the island .
Turkey suspects some EU governments of using the Cyprus issue to keep the door shut because of doubts over letting a Muslim country join their " Christian club " .
Obama spoke of the importance of strong relations with a strategic country at the crossroads between East and West .
" It is a NATO ally , its economy is expanding greatly , " Obama said .
" Furthermore , the fact that it is a democracy and a country that is mostly Islamic makes it a critically important model for other Muslim countries of the region . "

SALT LAKE CITY --
For the first time , Utah 's governor addressed the leak of hundreds of names of people accused of being in the country illegally .
Friday morning on KSL's " Doug Wright Show , " Gov. Gary Herbert announced , not only does the state know the list came from within the Department of Workforce Services , they 're pretty sure they know who 's behind it .
" I can tell you that we 've narrowed it down to at least two people , and we believe they 're involved in creating this list and possibly some others , " Herbert said .
Many Utahns still concerned over ' list '
Now many are wondering who the two employees are and how they get the information .
Right now there are few answers , as many people continue to wonder if they 're on this list .
Coming Up :
Sunday night at 10 : To help understand the complexity of the illegal immigration issue , KSL News will present a series of seven in - depth special reports .
Join us for the first report Sunday on KSL 5 News at 10 .
" My concern is not immigration .
I am a citizen , " Utahn Jackie Martinez said .
" My concern is certain individuals who have this hatred towards me , and who are willing to do anything to get Hispanics out of this state or this country .
My fear is for myself and my children . "
Martinez said when word spread that the list had been traced to DWS , she panicked .
" I did apply for unemployment through the Department of Workforce , so now they have my information , my children 's information , my home address , " she said .
Martinez is not an immigrant -- she was born in California -- but she believes her name is listed , along with hundreds of other Latinos .
DWS holds press conference on findings
Kristen Cox , executive director of Workforce Services , said most of the people on the list are there because their children are receiving benefits .
In a press conference Friday morning , Kristen Cox , executive director of the Department of Workforce Services , said , " The people we have identified certainly have some strong political opinions and seem to be frustrated with some of the issues surrounding immigration .
Regardless of that , if they work for the Department of Workforce Services , and if they want to go rogue , they need to quit the department . "
DWS handles some public benefits like food stamps , CHIP and Medicaid -- which is why its databases would have the information that appears on the list .
Herbert , who was also at the press conference , said the state plans to take action against those responsible .
He said the two people identified have been placed on administrative leave .
" Action is being taken in regards to that violation of not only our state protocol , rules and regulations and potential state law , but also violations of federal law in the giving of this information out inappropriately , " he said .
Herbert said the investigation is far from over and that the state believes there were others involved in the creation and distribution of the list .
" These people involved have been very patient ; they 've been very methodical ; they 've been very deliberate in violating protocols and breaching security to , in fact , gather this information . "
Gov. Gary Herbert
He said gaining access to the information was not easy , and that the people responsible worked hard to get it .
" These people involved have been very patient ; they 've been very methodical ; they 've been very deliberate in violating protocols and breaching security to , in fact , gather this information , " Herbert said .
The governor did n't deny his frustration over what he sees as inaction on illegal immigration from the federal government .
He said invading privacy and breaking state and federal law to do it just pours " kerosene on the fire " that is the debate .
" This tactic by these rogue employees to go out and to single out these individuals and their families , and in some cases falsely accusing people of an illegal status is , in fact , deplorable and is , in fact , counterproductive to dealing with the issue that ought to be the focus and that is the illegal immigration issue , " Herbert said .
Attorney General 's
Office will decide whether to file charges
Utah 's Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said Friday the people who compiled the list likely broke both state and federal laws , and a formal investigation will be underway as soon as the governor hands over the information they 've compiled .
Attorney General Mark Shurtleff says his office will likely work their investigation together with the U.S. Attorney 's Office because of the nature of possible crimes committed .
Shurtleff also called the list wrong and disgusting , and even compared the making of the list to something that would have been done in Nazi Germany .
" Putting together a list like this smacks of Nazism .
I mean , you replace Mexican , you replace illegal alien or illegal immigrant with Jew and use that same kind of language , that was spread throughout Nazi hit lists in Germany , " Shurtleff said .
The attorney general said his office will likely work their investigation together with the U.S. Attorney 's Office because of the nature of possible crimes committed .
He said government workers with access to government databases face tougher penalties for releasing protected data .
" Utah takes this type of crime , if a crime has occurred , very , very seriously , " Shurtleff said .
" This is not who we are as a people .
We condemn in the strongest possible terms the creation and dissemination of this list . "

' List ' brings foes together , tears comrades apart
The list of purported illegal immigrants living in the state of Utah has has brought two public people on opposite sides of the immigration debate came together for a common cause .
At the same time , it has created a rift between members of the Utah Minuteman Project .
As for looking into the background of those on the list to see if they are in fact in the country illegally , Shurtleff said that is not the job of the state .
" I do n't support illegal immigration .
I do n't condone breaking the law in any way , shape or form , " He said .
" The federal government has that list .
They 've had it for several months , and that 's their job . "
Intentionally releasing a private record in Utah is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine .
If someone stole such a record , it could be prosecuted as a felony with a penalty punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine .
The list consists of people with Latino surnames and includes names , addresses , phone numbers and some Social Security numbers and private health information , like due dates of babies .
Cox said most of the people on the list are there because their children are receiving benefits .
The list was anonymously sent to news media , law enforcement and other government officials , demanding people on the list be deported .
Some on the list say they are in the United States legally .

For - profit universities thrive on unemployment
By David E Maynard and Andre Damon
21 July 2010
With unemployment at the highest level since the Great Depression , millions of workers have sought to improve their job prospects by continuing their education .
Since public universities have drastically slashed admissions , the main beneficiary of this process has been the for - profit college industry , which provides degrees to students at rates far higher than that of standard colleges .
These so - called “ career colleges ” — primarily online institutions like the University of Phoenix , Capella , DeVry , and Kaplan University — hold out the false promise of a secure future , telling students that a college degree will enable them to find work .
Since 2000 , enrollment in for - profit colleges has tripled , growing from 673,000 students to over 2.6 million in 2010 .
The University of Phoenix , the most prominent of these colleges , is now the second - largest higher education institution in America , after the State University of New York ( SUNY ) system .
Its enrollment of nearly half a million students is larger than all Big Ten campuses combined , but its “ instructional costs and services ” — the total employee compensation — is $ 400 million , less than that of the University of Iowa , the smallest of the Big Ten ’s public universities .
This growth has been largely a result of predatory recruitment and lending practices , in which these colleges seek to extract profit from the desperation of the poor and unemployed .
Many of the programs are shot through with fraud and corruption , and rely on systematically misleading statements to dragoon potential students to sign up .
In Illinois , 350 former nursing students are suing the Illinois School of Health Careers after discovering that the program they enrolled in was not approved by the state Health Department .
The students were not eligible to work as nurses with their degrees despite claims by the college that they would be “ immediately qualified to take the state board exams . ”
In December , the Apollo group , the Fortune 500 that owns the University of Phoenix , paid a $ 78.5 million fine for illegally paying recruiters based on the number of students they enrolled .
This practice naturally led to abuses , as recruiters targeted anyone they could convince to enroll , regardless of their qualifications or ability to afford the classes .
These companies have profited significantly from federal student loan subsidies .
Last year the University of Phoenix received $ 4.3 billion in income from federal student aid , nearly eight times as much as the largest non-profit recipient , Penn State , according to a report by Senator Dick Durbin .
One for - profit college recruiter commented in an online discussion that “ we slam anyone …eligible for title IV funds … to take classes at almost $ 1,200 a five - week class .
It does n't matter if they have the competence or aptitude . ”
As a result of these policies , recruiters at for - profit universities have turned to preying on the most defenseless sections of society .
On June 17 , 20 leaders of shelters and services agencies from across the country sent an open letter to Education Secretary Arne Duncan , complaining that recruiters were “ systematically preying upon our clients . ”
The letter said that “ the for - profit education industry ’s seductive marketing messages and well - trained , unethical Iy - incentivized recruiters are out - maneuvering lower - priced , higher - quality post - secondary alternatives .
For - profit recruiters opportunistically target homeless men , women , and youth , luring them into taking on thousands of dollars in excessive debt . ”
Indeed , for - profit universities rely on a far - more indebted student population than those of public universities .
Ninety - six percent of students take out loans to pay for school at four - year for - profit schools , compared to only 64 percent of students at four - year public colleges .
As a result , the average student at a for - profit university graduates with $ 29,900 of debt — $ 19,000 more than their peers at public universities , according to data from the College Entrance Examination Board .
Meanwhile , only a tiny fraction of students end up receiving degrees from these universities .
Only four percent of University of Phoenix students graduate within six years , versus the national average of 57.3 percent .
Contrary to the deceptive claims of the for - profit education companies , even the small minority of those who graduate hardly benefits .
A study by the industry ’s own Online University Consortium found that employers prefer graduates of traditional school more than 4 to 1 over online college graduates .
Students are often led to believe that they can transfer their credits at for - profit universities to those at standard schools , but this is rarely the case .
One worker at the University of South Florida admissions department told the World Socialist Web Site , “ We would get a lot of people with degrees from for - profit universities who could n’t get any transfer credit at USF .
The students assumed their credits were just like those at any community college , and that they would be able to transfer .
They were not told that their degrees were n’t accredited by the state .
They usually spent 10 times more per credit at these schools , on totally worthless degrees . ”
Employees at for - profit universities are treated no better than the students .
Lecturers are paid as little as $ 850 per five - week course and are hired on single - course contracts , with no job security from term to term .
Academic advisors have reported working with over 400 students at a time in what are essentially high - pressure , high - turnover sales jobs , which involve little “ advising ” other than signing up more students .
While some Congress members have raised these issues , with the Senate holding a hearing on for - profit universities in late June , they have made it clear that their main intention is to protect wealthy investors .
The massive amounts of student loans given to “ high - risk ” students raises the threat of another default crisis similar to the implosion of the subprime housing market , holding the potential to wipe out billions of dollars in holdings .
While the Obama administration had announced on June 16 that these concerns would lead it to propose regulations of for - profit universities , recent statements by the administration have indicated that it fully supports these predatory institutions .
In a July 19 email statement to Businessweek , Education Department spokesman Justin Hamilton said that the White House ’s proposal will strengthen the “ critical role for - profit schools will play in helping us meet the president ’s 2020 goal : for America to once again lead the world in the number of college graduates . ”
With that , Mr. Hamilton all but announced that for - profit colleges will be allowed to con and defraud workers with the full support of the White House .
MARSHALL , Texas , July 21 / PRNewswire / --
The Lanier Law Firm is announcing a patent infringement lawsuit filed on behalf of Longview , Texas - based InNova Patent Licensing LLC against a group of 36 corporate defendants accused of infringing an InNova patent that represents one of the cornerstones of email communications .
The lawsuit , filed July 20 , 2010 , in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall , names some of the world 's most recognizable companies as defendants , including iPhone maker Apple ( Nasdaq : AAPL ) , retailer JCPenney Co. ( NYSE : JCP ) , search engine giant Google ( Nasdaq : GOOG ) and others .
The case is InNova Patent Licensing , LLC v. 3Com Corporation , et al. , No . 2:10 -cv-00251 .
The federal lawsuit focuses on a revolutionary InNova patent , U.S. Patent No. 6,018,761 , that covers technology used to differentiate between spam email messages and those that users actually want to receive .
The InNova patent was awarded to inventor and mathematician Robert Uomini nearly 15 years ago when Internet email was still in its formative stages .
Mr. Uomini is the founder of InNova .
Patent - infringement attorney Christopher Banys , lead counsel for InNova , says the company 's patent is one of the building blocks for all email communications .
InNova 's complaint alleges that the defendant companies have used InNova 's invention without permission for years .
" Email as we know it would essentially stop working if it were n't for InNova 's invention , " says Mr. Banys , who leads The Lanier Law Firm 's national intellectual property practice .
" More than 80 percent of email is spam , which is why companies use InNova 's invention rather than forcing employees to wade through billions of useless emails .
Unfortunately , the defendants appear to be profiting from this invention without any consideration for InNova 's legal patent rights . "
In addition to Apple , JCPenney and Google , the lawsuit also names as defendants 3Com Corporation ; Alcatel - Lucent Holding , Inc. ; American International Group , Inc. ; AOL , Inc. ; Bank of America Corporation ; Capital One Auto Finance , Inc. ; Capital One Financial Corporation ; Cinemark , Inc. ; Cinemark Holdings , Inc. ; Citigroup , Inc. ; Crossmark , Inc. ; Dell , Inc. ; Dr. Pepper Snapple Group , Inc. ; Ericsson , Inc. ; Frito - Lay , Inc. ; Frito - Lay North America , Inc. ; Hewlett - Packard Company ; HP Enterprise Services , LLC ; International Business Machines Corporation ; J.C.

A team of researchers from the University of Alberta and the National Institute for Nanotechnology has extended the operating life of an unsealed plastic solar cell from mere hours to eight months .
U of A chemistry researcher David Rider says plastic solar - cell technology is a very competitive field and the accomplishment by the U of A - NINT team is quite an achievement .
" Inexpensive , lightweight plastic solar - cell products , like a blanket or sheet that can be rolled up , will change the solar energy industry , " said Rider .
The research team initially hit a wall trying to increase the operating life of their plastic solar - cell design .
Rider says one of the problems involved electrodes , a key piece of the circuitry required for the efficient extraction of electricity from the solar cell .
" A typical electrode priming coating is known to be unstable and can migrate through the circuitry , potentially limiting the performance of our cell to about 10 hours , " said Rider .
So the researchers came up with a new polymer coating that outlasted their original by more than 5,000 per cent :
When Rider and team submitted their findings to a science journal , the new plastic solar cell had clocked 500 hours of high - capacity performance .
And Rider says that the solar cell might still be working at high capacity today , had it not been for damage caused during return shipping from additional testing in Ottawa .
" Seven months after we handed in the research on the 500 - hour breakthrough , the solar cell was still working , " said Rider .
The research of Rider and his colleagues Jillian Buriak and Michael J. Brett was published this week in Advanced Functional Materials .
Rider says that , despite his team 's success and advances made by research groups around the world , there 's a lot of work to be done before plastic solar - cell kits are available at home - improvement stores across Canada .
" We have to increase their efficiency while maintaining a long - performance life , " said Rider .
" Getting eight months of high - capacity performance out of our design is moving in the right direction . "

Last fall I had a feeling that the number of U.S. expatriations would be increasing , due to recent tax law changes .
I began tracking the number of expatriations , which appeared to be on the rise .
Today the Treasury Department published the names of individuals who renounced their United States citizenship ( “ expatriated ” ) during the quarter ending December 31 , 2009 .
A total of 502 individuals expatriated .
This is the highest quarterly number of individuals expatriating for many years .
In fact , during that one quarter , there were more expatriations than in the combined previous seven quarters .
The following graph shows the number of expatriates for the past 4 years .
The increase in expatriations likely results from 2008 changes to the expatriation rules under the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 .
Prior to these changes , for the 10 year period after expatriation individuals could not be present in the U.S. for more than 30 days in a calendar year without being taxed on their worldwide income .
Further , under the prior rules expatriates had to make certain U.S. tax filings for a period of 10 years .
Under current law , moderately wealthy individuals can expatriate without any U.S. taxation .
Further , the 10 year tax filings are no longer necessary , making the expatriation a clean break from the U.S.
The new rules also allow expatriates to return to the U.S. for up to 120 days each year without being subject to any U.S. income taxes .
With such generous rules as these , it is not surprising that expatriations are dramatically increasing .
Britain has been given a second and final written warning by Europe to clean up London 's air or be taken to the European court of justice and face fines of up to £ 300m .
The warning , sent today by the Environment commissioner Janez Potočni refers to minute airborne particles known as PM10s which are emitted by traffic and factories and can lead to heart attacks , strokes , asthma and lung diseases .
According to the Mayor of London 's Air Quality Strategy , particle pollution is responsible for over 4,300 premature deaths a year in London at an annual cost of up to £ 2bn .
( The figure is drawn from a report commissioned by the Mayor of London whose full findings were not published . )
London 's air pollution levels rank as the worst in the UK and also among the worst in Europe .
The EC move follows the start of legal proceedings against the UK in January 2009 for failing to meet air quality standards that came into effect at the end of 2004 .
The dying act of the last government , on 3 May , was to reapply for a time extension until 2011 to comply with air quality laws for dangerous airborne particles .
Today 's decision leaves the problem in the lap of the new coalition government and Boris Johnson , the mayor of London , who has a statutory duty to produce a strategy for improving London 's air quality .
Johnson has been heavily criticised by opposition parties for unravelling environment policies put in place by his predecessor , Ken Livingstone , such as his decision to delay the introduction of phase 3 of the Low Emission Zone ( Lez ) , which fines the most polluting vans , and his plan to abolish the western extension of the congestion charge zone by Christmas .
The Lez is designed to cut harmful emissions by encouraging the replacement of high - polluting vans and lorries with new models that meet the required emissions standards .
Transport for London has admitted that scrapping the western extension of the congestion charge will result in increased traffic .
Simon Birkett , spokesman for air quality watchdog group the Campaign for Clean Air in London , said that Johnson 's draft proposals to improve air quality were " riddled with wishful thinking " .
" He continues deliberately to take backward steps on air quality , particularly in respect of transport .
In that respect , for example , the removal of the [ Western extension of the congestion charge zone ] would be a double whammy because air quality will worsen and Transport for London will lose over £ 55 m income . "
Johnson told the London assembly last December that any fines incurred if the UK government is taken to court should " not be borne by this city " because he said it was the government 's fault that London was not compliant in the first place .
In a statement , Potočni said : " The UK submitted an exemption request for eight zones including the Greater London urban area .
However , the commission did not consider the exemption justified , as seven out of the eight zones already complied with the limit values .
For the Greater London urban area , the commission considered that the UK had not shown that compliance with the daily PM10 limit value would be achieved by the time the exemption period expired in 2011 .
The UK has recently sent a further exemption request for Greater London , which is still under assessment .
However , given that zones still exceed the PM10 limit values , the commission is sending the UK a final warning .
If the UK fails to take the necessary measures to comply with the legislation , the commission could refer the case to the European court of justice .
" Boris Johnson must introduce tougher measures to ensure that all London meets EU air pollution limits , rather than relying so heavily on the government to act " , said Jenny Bates , London Friends of the Earth campaigner .
" By making London a safer place to walk and cycle and improving public transport , he could get people out of cars and ensure cleaner air for everyone who lives in , works in or visits the capital . "
A spokesman for Johnson said last night : " The government made a submission to the European Commission last year seeking additional time to meet limit values .
Since then the mayor has published an air quality strategy and the government has re-submitted additional information to the commission .
We are therefore confident that these developments will address the concerns that triggered this legal action . "
The letter will also force Britain to clean up air quality in Gibraltar , which also regularly exceeds EC maximum levels and is classed by the EC as a British zone .

The Bing cashback program is coming to an end .
The kickback scheme , which gave Web shoppers cash back on purchases from affiliated stores , will be discontinued at 9 PM PDT on July 30 .
Users of the scheme will have a further year to claim their cash .
The rewards were often generous , with some companies offering 30 percent or more for purchases made through the system , and more than 1,000 retailers were part of the program .
In spite of this , however , Microsoft says that it " did not see the broad adoption [ it ] hoped for . "
Redmond says that shopping is still an important part of the searching experience , and is promising to provide new ways for merchants and advertisers to offer promotions through Bing .
Details on these will emerge later in the year .
The cashback promotion seemed to be popular among system builders and TV buyers in the Ars forums , thanks to companies like Tiger Direct offering 10 percent cash back .
However , it 's likely that this never translated into regular Bing usage , with people using Bing for their purchases , but sticking with Google for everything else .
If this is indeed the case , then the end of the programs is not altogether surprising .
London , England ( CNN ) --
From inside it looks like a swanky bachelor pad , kitted out with an abnormally large aquarium .
But , this is no fashionable New York apartment , rather the latest in sub-aquatic luxury -- a cruise yacht that doubles up as a submarine .
Still at the design stage , if built , the " U - 010 Undersea Yacht " would be the first to combine underwater exploration with all the comfort and style of a modern superyacht , say its designers .
" Submarines are generally thought of as cold and cramped military crafts , " Italian designer Sebastiano Vida told CNN .
" But this concept radically moves away from that assumption and introduces a new and luxurious way to experience life beneath the seas . "
With a relaxation parlor , sauna , lounge bar and vast spiral staircase -- the " U - 010 " certainly looks more like a Bond villain 's fantasy lair than a practical solution for wannabe ocean explorers .
But with the crushing pressures of a deep sea environment and associated design constraints -- like having to build only narrow spaces -- could this " pleasure submarine " ever be a reality ?
" It may look like a fantasy but we examined all the latest technology for constructing underwater vessels to ensure our concept would be viable , " said Vida .
" We 're looking for the right engineers to work with , and think it could be built within the next five years . "
In fact , Marina Colombo , co-creator of the " U- 010 , " told CNN they already have a potential buyer in mind -- multi-millionaire venture capitalist and former board member of Hewlett Packard , Tom Perkins .
" Tom Perkins commissioned the " Maltese Falcon " -- which was once the longest yacht in the world -- and we know that he'd want to build a submarine now . "
There are certainly plenty of multi-millionaires with a penchant for exotic exploration prepared to throw fistfuls of money at radical concepts .
Earlier this year British billionaire Richard Branson made the transition from madcap design to working reality when he launched the " Necker Nymph " -- a ' flying ' submarine capable of 40 - meter dives and dolphin - like flips .
At 11 a.m. this morning , vets , lawyers and activists hope to present a petition to Ned Calonge , Colorado 's chief medical officer , asking that post - traumatic stress disorder be added to a list of conditions that can be treated by medical marijuana .
The battle over PTSD and medical marijuana has been going on for months , notes Grimsinger 's attorney , Sensible Colorado 's Brian Vicente -- and he does n't expect it to be easily won .
" What has happened in the past is , Dr. Calonge has out of hand rejected any petition that 's come his way and not allowed a public hearing , " Vicente says .
" But we think at the very least this deserves a public hearing .
We think the petition shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that certain individuals who have PTSD benefit from medical marijuana , and we hope the state will recognize that . "
Also arguing on behalf of this action is Kevin Grimsinger , who 's become the Colorado poster child for PTSD and medical marijuana .
Grimsinger , an Army veteran who lost parts of both legs to an Afghanistan mine , is the face of the current fight .
Earlier this week , he was profiled by Denver Post columnist Susan Greene , and he 'll speak at today 's rally , which will take place at the health department 's offices , at 4300 Cherry Creek Drive South .
According to Vicente , Grimsinger represents plenty of fellow men and women in uniform who feel as he does but are reticent to take a public stand .
" We 've been hearing from veterans for years who have been injured in the line of duty protecting our country and have PTSD related to that , " he says .
" And they 're concerned about the lack of veteran access for medical marijuana for PTSD .
Currently , veterans face criminal prosecution for possessing or using medical marijuana to alleviate any sort of medical condition , and we just think that 's unconscionable .
People who have served our country deserve the best access to health care possible , and we want to make sure Kevin and folks like him have that access . "
These arguments were marshaled in March , when Boulder Representative Sal Pace presented an amendment to list PTSD among conditions that can be treated by medical marijuana .
At the time , the health department actively fought against the amendment , with staffers passing out a document to legislators arguing against this change , which was eventually voted down .
This move chagrined the likes of Wanda James and Drew Milburn , both of whom are dispensary owners and veterans who say they 've seen medical marijuana help those suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
In addition , Sensible Colorado has spent weeks talking to vets about the PTSD issue and gathering data that 's part of the petition .
The document " lays out the multitude of research that shows many people finding relief for PTSD symptoms by using medical marijuana , " Vicente allows .
" There are studies from abroad and studies from the U.S. that show this .
And really , the state has a very low bar in that , as per the constitution , they must accept petitions to expand treatable conditions , and the petitioner only has to show that the individual ' might ' benefit from the use of medical marijuana .
The word ' might ' is written in the constitution . "
As such , Vicente goes on , petitioners do n't have to incontrovertibly prove that medical marijuana is beneficial to everyone with post - traumatic stress disorder -- just that it might help them .
" We feel it 's a fairly reasonable standard , " he maintains , " and we want to make sure doctors have this possible treatment in their arsenal , and are able to advise patients to use it as necessary -- especially veterans , who are in a very difficult quandary .
Most Veterans Administration doctors will not recommend medical marijuana , because it 's federally a Schedule 1 controlled substance , which means it has no medical efficacy in the federal government 's view . "
Thanks to this designation , Vicente says , " we 've heard from dozens of veterans that if they choose medical marijuana , and their VA doctor learns about it , they can be taken off all medicine .
And we find that incredibly disturbing . "
Calonge has not been receptive to such arguments in the past -- so what are the options for Grimsinger and Vicente if he rejects their call for public hearings on the PTSD issue ?
" I think they 're setting themselves up for a costly lawsuit , " Vicente says .
" And I also think it 's poor public policy and disrespectful of our veterans . "
Look below to get more details about this morning 's event , as well as to look at a letter from Grimsinger to Calonge and the petition in its entirety :
Sensible Colorado release :
As highlighted in a Denver Post article , a rally will accompany the official submission of the PTSD petition on July 7 at 11 am at the Colorado Health Department office .
See more details below .
" The brave men and women who have served our country -- and been injured in the line of duty -- deserve access to all available health care treatment options , " said Brian Vicente , Executive Director of Sensible Colorado .
" Record numbers of veterans are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with severe mental issues , making this a critical time to amend our state law to reflect emerging science about the role of marijuana in treating PTSD .
Colorado should join neighboring states like New Mexico in allowing PTSD sufferers access to this beneficial drug . "
Sensible Colorado is filing this petition on behalf of Denver resident Kevin Grimsinger , an Army Sergeant ( ret ) and veteran on Kosovo , Operation Desert Storm , and Afghanistan .
Mr Grimsinger suffers from PTSD related to stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan .
His PTSD causes insomnia , nightmares , suicidal thoughts , and depression which he believes may be relieved by marijuana .
Under current Colorado law , those suffering from PTSD face criminal penalties for using medical marijuana to alleviate their symptoms .
SOUTH DENVER , CO -- On Wednesday , July 7 , at the Colorado Health Department Office , Sensible Colorado , the state 's leading medical marijuana advocacy non-profit , will join with veterans of the U.S. Armed Services in filing a petition to add Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) to the list of conditions for which doctors can recommend medical marijuana under Colorado law .
Letter from Kevin Grimsinger to Ned Calonge :
For myself , for veterans , and for other fellow Coloradans who suffer daily from the debilitating nature of life with PTSD , I respectfully submit this petition to add PTSD to the list of debilitating conditions that qualify for the use of marijuana as part of a recommended treatment from a physician that may have a beneficial effect .
From personal experience and as stated in the petition with the support of scientific evidence , the use of marijuana to treat PTSD symptoms has been effective .
I am not alone in this experience , researchers have estimated that veterans returning from our current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have an 18.3 % percent incidence rate for PTSD .
In addition there are the millions of other people that the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) estimate to suffer with PTSD in the United States every year .
I look forward to further recovery physical recovery , but a serious concern I have is that once my physical pains are deemed to no longer be debilitating by my physicians , I will lose access to the medicine that makes life bearable dealing with my PTSD from that day in Kandahar .
Someday I may be completely free from pain from my injuries but I will most likely never be free from the sleepless nights , constant memories , suicidal thoughts , and depression that plague those diagnosed with PTSD .
I submit this petition to you as a veteran who faces an uncertain future when it comes to my ability to access my medicine .
My name is Kevin Grimsinger .
I have served our country in Kosovo , Operation Desert Storm , and Afghanistan .
In 2003 , I stepped on a landmine in Kandahar , losing parts of both of my legs as well as sustaining severe injuries throughout my internal organs .
I was in the hospital for two years before I was released , and to this day I still suffer from my injuries .
The pain makes it difficult to eat , to sleep , and to function in my day - to - day life .
I was recommended medical marijuana in 2005 and have been using marijuana along with a number of other prescriptions to fight the pain .
On behalf of the state of Colorado 's sick , disabled , and dying veterans , please consider this an official petition to add Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) to the list of conditions for which doctors may recommend to their patients the use of medical marijuana as treatment under the provisions of the Colorado Constitution , Article 18 , Section 14 .
This petition is submitted in accordance with 5 CCR 1006 - 2 , Regulation 6 ( D ) , which states that the Board of Health will consider " whether there is scientific evidence that treatment with marijuana may have a beneficial effect . " [ emphasis added ]
The following petition provides ample proof that the use of marijuana as treatment for PTSD is based on scientific evidence and should be added to the list of debilitating conditions kept by the department .
PTSD petition :
The Use of Medical Cannabis to Treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
I. Introduction
Currently , there are approximately 500 suicides a month in patients with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) and over three hundred thousand backlogged disability claims involving PTSD and depression . n 1 .
Those suffering from PTSD also have a reduced quality of life , an increased number of hospitalizations , high frequency of depressions and alcohol drug abuse , and suffer in social , family , and work life . n 2 .
For patients who are treated , many have poor responses to psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment and often turn to alcohol and drugs .
n3 .
Recent studies demonstrate the potential benefits of the use of cannabis for PTSD .
These studies confirm that extinction of aversive memories and the adaptation to stress responses are in part , controlled by endocannabinoids . n 4 .
There are two cannabinoid receptors in the brain , CB1 and CB2 .
These receptors are activated by : endocannabinoids , which are synthesized internally in the body , cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant ( such as THC ) , and synethic cannabinoids that are synthesized in a laboratory .
This natural system works much like our natural GABA system .
Just as we produce our own endocannabinoids , we produce our own internal GABA , and we use synthetic benzodaizapines that bind to the receptors .
Likewise , we have cannabinoid receptors , and we should be using cannabis to modulate them .
Cannabinoids can act as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases associated with the inappropriate retention of aversive memories , such as PTSD .
n5 Furthermore , because of the effects of the cannabis on the stress response , it is likely that potential patients treated with cannabinoids may also benefit from the stress - reversing effects of the drug .
n6
While the state of Colorado has acknowledged and approved the use of cannabis for many physical illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and chronic pain , it has failed to acknowledge the use of cannabis for psychological disorders such as PTSD , in which the medical benefits of cannabis are scientifically proven .
This reflects unfounded discrimination on mental illness and psychological disorders .
As Nancy Pelosi stated in a recent address on health care , " Illness of the brain must be treated just like illness anywhere else in the body . " n 7 .
Recently , the federal government has expressly acknowledged this in its passage of the Mental Health Parity and Equalization Act of 2008 , mandating that health care providers provide equal treatment for mental disorders / substance abuse disorders as it does for any other physical illness .
n8
The stereotype that psychological illnesses are any less debilitating or credible than physical illnesses is unacceptable and has no basis in science or reality .
In both cases people are sick and need care ; in both cases there are treatments that can relieve them of pain .
When people receive the necessary treatment , people have the potential to get better and be productive and independent citizens . n9 .
Hundreds of recent studies indicate that cannabis is an effective treatment for PTSD .
Considering the high suicide rate associated with PTSD ( 50 - 100 suicides a month for veterans alone ) n10 , and that accepted psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments are often ineffective , n11 , it is imperative that PTSD patients have access to another option that is effective , natural , safe , and can be regulated by a doctor .
These are people , often veterans , whose chronic psychological trauma , depression , insomnia , and accompanying symptoms cannot be relived by conventional therapy or psychothearaputics and is worsened by alcohol . n 12 .
In fact , since the U.S. sent more than 1.6 million men and women into combat in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2001 , 18.3 % of those returning have PTSD or major depression . n 13 .
These patients have fought for our country and are now plagued with horrible memories .
Their health and quality of life should be of top priority , and studies show and patients have testified that cannabis is an effective , alternative treatment .
Cannabis can help relieve these patients of psychological trauma , it can stop horrible nightmares and stress related sleep disorders , and it can provide them with a better quality of life . n 14
II .
The Effectiveness of Cannabis as a treatment for PTSD .
a) The endocannabinoid system reverses enhancing effects of stress and helps with retention of aversive memories .
Over the past few years , remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of the endocannabinoid system and its molecular and physiological functions . n 15 .
The potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid modulation is highlighted by the dense expression of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor in regions known to be significant for anxiety and emotional learning , particularly the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) . n 16 .
The endocannabinoid system has specific involvement in the habituation component of fear extinction and mediates habituation to repeated stress , suggesting that augmentation of endocannabinoid signaling is a good target for the treatment of affective disorders .
n 18 , n19 .
The endocannabinoid system has a direct effect on the natural brain 's function of dealing with information and can in fact aid the brain in discarding unneeded information . n 20 .
The functions of the endocannabinoid system are especially relevant to the treatment of conditions associated with retention of aversive memories and stress related disorders , such as PTSD .
A recent study examining the cannabinoid receptor activation in the BLA found that it reverses the enhancing effects of environmental stress on inhibitory avoidance ( IA ) conditioning and its impairing effects on extinction . n 21 .
The study tested rats , known for their love of dark places , who were given electric shots when entering the darkened region of their cage .
Shortly thereafter , the rats became afraid of the dark area and began to remain in the brighter part of the cage .
The researchers then stopped giving the electric shock treatment and the rats returned to the dark area .
The length of time between the shocks stopping and the rats returning was measured .
In the next phase of the study , a new group of rats were used .
These rats were shocked as they entered the dark area of the cage and were placed on an elevated grid .
( Most animals , including rats , avoid walking over elevated grids as they find the distressing ) .
It took longer for this group of rats to trust the dark region again .
The researchers then tested a third group of rats , who were treated in the same way as the second group , except in this group a synthetic THC - like compound was injected into a the BLA , the region of their brains associated with fear .
This medical - marijuana receiving group of rats returned just as quickly to the dark spot in the cage as the rats in group one . n 22 .
The beneficial effects of cannabinoids in the BA are extremely significant .
Specifically , the study found that : 1 ) cannabinoid receptor activation in the BA blocks the effects of stress on the conditioning and extinction of inhibitory avoidance ( IA ) ; 2 ) ; cannabinoid receptor stimulation in the BLA reduces stress - induced elevations in corticosterone levels ( this is significant because most people with PTSD show a high secretion of cortisol ) , n23 ; and ( 3 ) the CB1 receptor has an extremely important role in the BLA in the extinction of avoidance behavior because the receptor antagonist impairs IA extinction . n 24 .
These findings show that cannabinoid receptor activation can act to reverse the effects of stress on memory .
These results support a wide therapeutic application for the cannabis cannabinoids in the treatment of conditions in which patients suffer from aversive memories and stress .
PTSD patients should be entitled to a treatment that can have such a profound beneficial effect on relieving traumatic memories .
b ) Cannabinoids are effective in cessation of nightmares and a reduction in nightmare intensity
The disruption of sleep is often one of the most debilitating parts of PTSD and patients are often unable to find relief through pharmaceutical treatment . n 25 .
Particularly , nightmares and sleep disorders are frequent symptoms of PTSD , with some patients experiencing even more severe problems such as violent or injurious behaviors during sleep , sleep paralysis , and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations .
n 26 , n27 .
Recent studies have shown that cannabis is effective in cessation of nightmares and reduction of nightmare intensity .
In a study evaluating the effects of an endocannabinoid receptor agonist on treatment - resistant nightmares in patients diagnosed with PTSD , patients who had continued nightmares despite treatment with conventional anti-depressants and hypnotics were reviewed after treatment with nabilone , an endocannabinoid receptor agonist . n 28 .
A large majority ( 72 % ) of patients experienced either cessation of nightmares or a significant reduction in nightmare intensity .
n 29 .
Furthermore , patients noted improvement in sleep time , the quality of sleep , and the reduction of daytime flashbacks and night sweats . n30 .
These findings are extremely significant because they not only illustrate the many benefits of cannabis on PTSD symptoms , but also that cannabis can be an effective option for patients who are unable to find relief with the currently accepted treatments .
Dr. Tod Mikuriya , psychiatrist , author , and former marijuana research for the National Institute of Health , emphasized the importance of treating sleep deficits in those with PTSD when he explained , " PTSD often involves irritability and inability to concentrate , which is aggravated by sleep deficit .
Cannabis use enhances the quality of sleep through modulation of emotional reactivity .
It eases the triggered flashbacks and accompanying emotional reactions , including nightmares .
The importance of restoring circadian rhythm of sleep cannot be overestimated in the management of PTSD . " n 31 .
c ) Cannabinoids promote neurogenesis and produce anxiolytic and antidepressant like effects .
The hippocampus is able to generate new neurons ( neurogenesis ) throughout the lifespan of mammals . n 32 .
Studies teach us that newborn hippocampal neurons are functionally integrated into the existing circuitry and are positively correlated with learning and memory processes and the developmental mechanisms of stress and mood disorders . n 33 .
Recent studies have shown that chronic treatment with synthetic cannabinoids produces antidepressant and anxiolyic effects .
The anxiolytic effects are achieved by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis , which is in turn promoted by cannabinoids . n 34 .
By finding that embryonic and adult rat hippocampal neural stem / progenitor cells are immunoreactive for CB1 cannabinoid receptors , studies demonstrate that cannabinoids can act on CB1 receptors to regulate neurogenesis . n 35 .
This is further corroborated by findings that cannabinoids promote proliferation , but not differentiation , of embryonic hippocampal neural stem / progenitor cells via activation of CB1 receptors combined with G proteins and ERK signaling . n 36 .
The anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects of cannabis are important as anxiety and depression are frequent symptoms of PTSD and can be very debilitating . n 37 .
It is well - founded that cannabis and its major psychoactive component , ( - ) - trans - Δ9 - tetrahydrocannabinol , have profound effects on mood and can modulate anxiety and mood states . n 38 .
Thus , stimulating the endogenous cannabinoid system with natural cannabinoids could be a major therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety - related and mood disorders . n 39 .
In a study that looked at treating anxiety with cannabinoids , blocking the CB1 receptor resulted in the rats having more fear , demonstrating that modulation may be useful treatment for blocking fear , as seen in the blockade mice . n 40 .
These results indicate that the endocannabinoid system can be modulated to enhance emotional learning and that endocannabinoid modulators may be therapeutically useful for exposure based psychotherapies such as those used to treat PTSD and other anxiety disorders . n 41 .
Based on its efficacy alone , cannabis should be considered an acceptable treatment for PTSD .
As Dr. Mikuriya said " Cannabis relieves pain , enables sleep , normalizes gastrointestinal function and restores peristalsis .
Fortified by improved digestion and adequate rest , the patient can resist being overwhelmed by triggering stimuli .
There is no other psychotherapeutic drug with these synergistic and complementary effects . " n 42 . Dr. Mikuriya also emphasizes that cannabis can relieve many other symptoms of PTSD such as physical pain , fatigue , and sleep deficit .
Furthermore , restorative exercise and diet are requisite components of PTSD treatment and depression treatment , and cannabis , unlike some analgesics , sedatives , and benzodiazepines , does not leave the patient too immobile to exercise . n 43 .
III .
PTSD and substance abuse
Many PTSD patients have poor responses to psychotherapy and often turn to alcohol and drugs . n 44 .
Moreover , many suffer from chronic pain and become addicted to opiate pain medications . n 45 .
Due to continuous problems such as depression , anxiety , secondary alcoholism , and substance abuse that PSTD patients suffer from and the numerous poor responses to pharmacological and psychological treatments , alternative treatments such as cannabis are imperative .
While many studies , and the Colorado Department of Health , cite cannabis use as substance abuse in PTSD patients , they ignore the positive effects of cannabis on the brain and the reality that patients may not be abusing cannabis , but using it as an alternative , effective treatment .
Abuse can occur with any drug , including medically prescribed Oxycontin or Vicodin as well as an over the counter drug like Tylenol .
But the possibility that these drugs can be abused does not make them illegal .
The possibility that some people might abuse cannabis should not make it illegal , when , like these other drugs , it is scientifically proven to effectively treat a condition .
In fact , " it is generally appreciated that the use of cannabinoids is related to their positive modulatory effects on brain - rewarding processes along with their ability to positively influence emotional states and remove stress responses . " n 46 .
The differing effects of cannabis and other drugs of abuse on the brain highlight the difference between using a drug as an effective treatment versus substance abuse .
Chronic administration of the major drugs of abuse including opiates , alcohol , nicotine , and cocaine has been reported to suppress hippocampal neurogenesis in rats . n 47 .
Unlike these major drugs that inhibit neurogenesis , studies demonstrate that cannibas promotes hippocampal neurogenesis . n 48 .
This suggests a role of hippocampal neurogenesis in the initiation , maintenance , and treatment of drug addiction .
The specific effect of the cannabinoid system on the fear response is significant and suggests the potential for long - term relief . n 49 .
Current acceptable treatments such as behavior therapy , on the other hand , are ineffective for many .
While behavior therapy for human anxiety disorders is often effective , extinction - like treatments require repeated cue exposures and are vulnerable to reversal by a number of environmental factors , particularly stress . n 50 .
Thus , cannabis has the potential to be an effective alternative to often - ineffective behavior therapy and extinction treatment . n 51 .
The ineffectiveness of currently acceptable treatments leads to substance abuse .
Patients unable to find relief seek it elsewhere , with substances that are not regulated or monitored by a physician .
Moreover , psychiatrist - advised use of medical marijuana can actually help PTSD patients reduce their alcohol intake .
Marijuana addiction potential is a fraction of that of alcohol ( 3 % vs. 10 % ) . n 52 . Dr. Christopher Ficthner , section chief for PTSD at Hines V.A. Hospital in Illinois , explained that the use of medical cannabis can reduce the physical and psychological harm for those who self - medicate with alcohol . n53 .
IV .
New Mexico : Taking the lead in treating PTSD with cannabis .
New Mexico has taken the lead in explicitly allowing people with PTSD to have access to marijuana under its medical marijuana law .
PTSD accounts for more patients than any other of the state 's 16 eligible debilitating conditions approved for medical marijuana treatment . n 54 .
After a review of the evidence of the effectiveness of marijuana in treating PTSD , health professionals in New Mexico agreed that medical marijuana could be beneficial for patients with PTSD .
On the other hand , health officials in Colorado are denying veterans and other patients suffering from PTSD a legitimate , safe , treatment alternative .
The chief medical officer of the Colorado health department said , " There is no evidence of efficacy of marijuana for treatment of PTSD in the medical literature . " n 50 .
This statement is outright false , inconsistent with evidence - based medicine and demonstrates ignorance of the hundreds of medical studies on the efficacy of marijuana for PTSD treatment .
To deny the enormous body of medical literature is outrageous and offensive to the suffering PTSD patients who are now the victims of the health department 's ignorance .
Dr. Eve Elting , a New Mexico physician , emphasized the offensiveness of the Colorado Health Department when she said , " It 's bad enough they have something that makes life so challenging .
On top of that they 're discriminated against , made to feel like they 're doing something wrong . " n 55 .
New Mexico is not alone in recognizing cannabis as an effective treatment for PTSD .
In Canada , the government pays for medical marijuana for their veterans , acknowledging that for many , its is more effective than available alternatives , with fewer side effects . n 56 .
In Israel , the Ministry of Health is currently granting licenses for people who have PTSD to use medical marijuana . n 57
Even Croatia acknowledges cannabis as a treatment for PTSD .
In 2009 , Croatia 's Supreme Court threw out a jail sentence given to a veteran who used marijuana for his PTSD . n 58 .
This ruling is extremely significant considering Croatia 's " zero tolerance " drug policy .
In its ruling , the court noted that " the defendant suffers from PTSD , and marijuana relaxes him and helps him to overcome psychological problems . " n 59 .
V. Conclusion
To deny those with PTSD suffering from psychological trauma and terrifying flashbacks access to a natural herb that is scientifically proven to provide them with relief is simply outrageous .
By allowing PTSD to be treated with medical marijuana , physicians can help patients treat their condition with cannabis and assist the patient in using cannabis in a manner that is safe and most effective for the particular patient .
Physicians can be re-assured that there is an ample body of medical literature that supports the beneficial use of cannabinoids .
Studies teach us that we have our own cannabinoid receptors in our internal cannabinoids , and these should be modulated as they are proven to reverse effects of stress and help with retention of aversive memories , promote neurogenesis , and can reduce nightmares , fear , anxiety , mood disorders and other PTSD symptoms .
The importance of the endocannabinoid system and the large body of medical literature supporting the beneficial use of cannabis should be acknowledged .
Without the acceptance of cannabis to treat PTSD , patients who cannot find relief with pharmaceuticals and psychotherapy are forced to turn to the streets to have access to cannabis .
They are denied the very important role of the doctor in helping them treat their condition .
These patients will often turn to substance abuse and many turn to suicide .
We are sending millions of our citizens to Iraq and Afghanistan , and many are coming back afflicted with PTSD and other psychological trauma . n 60 .
We should give them all of the tools available to regain their health .
The enormous volume of scientific research and data proves that the use of medical marijuana for PTSD is safe and effective .
To deny patients access to a treatment whose efficacy is well founded with scientific evidence is callous and discriminatory at best .

Fabio Capello has published his controversial Capello Index ratings for England 's players from the World Cup .
The England manager was prevented by the Football Association from running the marks during the tournament but has now gone public with his assessment of their performances .
The goalkeeper Robert Green gets the lowest mark for the tournament with a rating of 51.67 out of 100 , having made a dreadful mistake in his only game , against the USA .
Jermain Defoe tops the list with an average of 62.47 across the matches he played , which included scoring the winner against Slovenia .
England 's second - best player according to the Capello Index was John Terry ( 60.48 ) .
Uruguay 's Diego Forlán , who was awarded the official player of the tournament award , gets an average score of 65.77 by comparison .
Wayne Rooney , widely accepted to have had a dismal World Cup , is marked at 58.87 , marginally higher than Spain 's Fernando Torres and only slightly less than Jérôme Boateng , part of the Germany team that finished third at the tournament .
England 's best individual performance of the tournament was rated by the index to be Steven Gerrard 's against the USA ( 66.36 ) .
The marks are calculated using a complicated scoring system which awards points for categories such as long passing , assists , mistakes , dribbles , goals , shots and headers .

Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamComey defends FBI Russia probe from GOP criticism The Hill 's Campaign Report : Debate fallout l Trump clarifies remarks on Proud Boys l Down to the wire in South Carolina Poll finds Trump , Biden in statistical dead heat in South Carolina MORE ( R - S.C. ) on Wednesday called for the criminal prosecution of Wikileaks , the website that published classified military documents this week .
Graham , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a reserve military lawyer , seemed to go further than other GOP colleagues by calling for the prosecution of Wikileaks itself , and not just the source of the leaks .
“ I ’m willing to prosecute anybody who led to undermining the war effort , ” Graham said during an appearance on Fox News .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ As far as I know , there ’s no immunity for a website to be able to pass on documents , ” Graham added , responding “ yes ” when asked directly if the website should be prosecuted .
Wikileaks has come under scrutiny for its decision to publish classified military documents detailing suspicions that elements within the Pakistani government were coordinating with the Taliban .
These documents led to a full - fledged story in The New York Times , which has led to angry reactions from many lawmakers , who fear the leak undercut national security .
Graham ’s colleagues — Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and Rep. Pete King ( R - N.Y. ) , among others — have called for the prosecution of whoever leaked the documents , but few have spoken of prosecuting Wikileaks itself .
McCain said Wednesday that he believes whoever leaked the documents to the organization should be punished with a life sentence .
Asked by syndicated conservative radio host Michael Medved if that was an appropriate punishment , McCain replied " Oh , I would think so . "
Wikileaks ’s founder has said he does not know the source of the leak .
Reports have swirled suggesting that an Army private was responsible for the leak .
“ We need to go after anyone who was involved in the leak of classified documents , ” Graham said .

Tang Lin joined the “ Kidney - stone - baby parent ” network in 2008 as he suspected the cause of his baby 's death was due to melamine contamination of infant milk formula .
Since then , he kept paying visit petition to the Chinese authorities but was neglected .
According to nddaily.com ( via 163.com page removed ) , in May 17 2010 , Tang wrote on the “ Sanlu Milk Power Incident ” QQ group saying that he would “ take extreme action ” that would be “ reported by newspapers ” .
The police in Chongqing city arrested him on 19 of May and claimed that Tang 's discussion on the group intended to “ spread terrorizing information and create a terrorizing atmosphere ” .
Online group members said that Tang was emotional but what he said should not be taken seriously : “ How can they turn grumble into crime ? ”
Chongqing city 's Committee of Reform - through - labour decided to take administrative measure in sentencing Tang Lin one year reform - through - labour .
Tang 's online message has been deleted and there is no way for the public to know what exactly he had said to “ spread terrorizing information ” .
Tang 's baby boy was born in March 2007 .
Since January 2008 , they started to feed the baby with Sanlu milk power and the kid died in June the same year .
4 days before his death , he could not urinate .
In September 2008 , the media exposed the Sanlu milk powder problem but his case had been rejected by the health bureau as they could not present the ultrasound report of their baby 's kidney stone and the kid 's body had been buried .
Earlier this year , the founder of “ kidney stone babies ” , Zhao Lianhai had also been arrested under the charge of “ provoking an incident ” .
He was put on court on March 30 , but the verdict has n't been announced yet .

WPS documentation
The 31 examples of similarities between WPS and the SAS Manuals
(1) Copying of formulae and descriptions of formulae in the SAS Manuals
" Quade ( unpublished report , SAS Institute , 1986 ) provided a summary of earliest references for most of these estimators .
Y 1 , Y 3 , and Y 8 are given in Parzen ( 1979 ) ; Y 4 appears in Read ( 1972 ) .
Hogg and Craig ( 1978 ) discuss the case of ( n + l ) p an integer , wherein Y 4 and Y 5 coincide .
Y 7 is treated by Moore ( 1969 ) and by Cramer ( 1946 ) for np not an integer ; Cramer also presents definitions Y 3 and Y 5 .
Y 3 is given in Ogawa ( 1962 ) , and Y 5 appears in Greenberg ( 1978 ) . "
As counsel for SAS Institute pointed out , no reference is given for Y 2 , and the other four definitions implemented in PROC UNIVARIATE appear to have originated from disparate sources in the literature .
" Many of the nonparametric estimators considered here are frequently encountered in data analysis software , and , in some cases , data analysts are permitted to choose from among several of these .
The various estimators can deliver significantly different results , especially when sample sizes are small .
The performance characteristics of individual estimators depend on the manner in which the estimator is defined , the sample size , the quantile level being estimated , and the underlying parent distribution .
Characteristics such as bias , variance , mean squared error , and relative efficiency facilitate comparisons among estimators .
In order to make comparisons that were computationally exact , this investigation assumed a normal parent distribution .
Under this condition , the estimators defined by Y 8 and Y 9 are clearly the best of the set .
The worst performers are those based on a single order statistic , such as the empirical CDF estimators Y 3 , Y 6 , and Y 7 .
Y 8 proved to be the least biased , while Y 9 provided the lowest MSE values overall .
Y 9 requires much greater computational effort than does Y 8 , and , in practical situations , this may offset its MSE advantage .
It will be of interest to consider further the performance characteristics of these estimators for nonnormal parent distributions . "
As counsel for SAS Institute pointed out , this suggests that the best definition to implement in a computer program is Y 8 , and yet this is not implemented in PROC UNIVARIATE .
(2) PROC UNIVARIATE parser - reproduction of keywords
addUnsupportedKeywordOption ( " all " ) ;
(3) Reproduction of names for procedures , functions , etc
Bit Condition Code Hex Description
1 DSLABEL 1 001X Data set labels differ
baseprocplugin\proc_compare\procCompare.cpp in WPS contains a section of code that corresponds to Table 10.1 in which the same names for the various conditions are used in conjunction with the keyword SYSINFO , for instance :
static const int SYSINFO_DSLABEL = 0x1 ;
It is not necessary to the functioning of the WPS code that the names of the conditions be the same .
Dr Quarendon again explained that the reason why WPL adopted this approach was again to ensure traceability .
(4) Reproduction of default values
(5) Copying of output text
(6) Comments in the WPS source code
// Strange transformation for dates before 1900 .
This is probably a SAS bug
// but since we do not know what else to do we copy this buggy behaviour .
(7) Use of SAS Manuals as the source of optimising information for WPS
" The LOGISTIC procedure uses a simple empirical approach to recognize the data configurations that lead to infinite parameter estimates .
The basis of this approach is that any convergence method of maximising the log likelihood must yield a solution giving complete separation , if such a solution exists .
In maximizing the log likelihood , there is no checking for complete or quasi - complete separation if convergence is attained in eight or fewer iterations .
Subsequent to the eighth iteration , the probability of the observed response is computed for each observation .
If the predicted response equals the observed response for every observation , there is a complete separation of data points and the iteration process is stopped . "
// Do n't check whether Maximum Likelihood estimate
//exists until we get to iteration 9 , bizarre but this
//is what SAS does .
(8) Use of SAS data file formats
(9) Use of SAS test scripts from the SAS Manuals
It is common ground that this piece of C++ code runs the same SAS script as is set out in the Manual .
Thus it reproduces that part of the Manual .

European directives
" [ 1 ]
Whereas computer programs are at present not clearly protected in all Member States by existing legislation and such protection , where it exists , has different attributes ; [ 2 ]
The development of computer programs requires the investment of considerable human , technical and financial resources while computer programs can be copied at a fraction of the costs needed to develop them independently ; [ 4 ]
Whereas certain differences in the legal protection of computer programs offered by the laws of the Member States have direct and negative effects on the functioning of the common market as regards computer programs and such differences could well become greater as Member States introduce new legislation on this subject ; [ 5 ]
Whereas existing differences having such effects need to be removed and new ones prevented from arising , while differences not adversely affecting the functioning of the common market to a substantial degree need not be removed or prevented from arising ; [ 6 ]
Whereas the Community 's legal framework on the protection of computer programs can accordingly in the first instance be limited to establishing that Member States should accord protection to computer programs under copyright law as literary works and , further , to establishing who and what should be protected , the exclusive rights on which protected persons should be able to rely in order to authorize or prohibit certain acts and for how long the protection should apply ; [ 7 ]
Whereas , for the purpose of this Directive , the term ' computer program ' shall include programs in any form , including those which are incorporated into hardware ; whereas this term also includes preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program provided that the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage ; [ 10 ]
Whereas the function of a computer program is to communicate and work together with other components of a computer system and with users and , for this purpose , a logical and , where appropriate , physical interconnection and interaction is required to permit all elements of software and hardware to work with other software and hardware and with users in all the ways in which they are intended to function ; [ 11 ]
Whereas the parts of the program which provide for such interconnection and interaction between elements of software and hardware are generally known as ' interfaces ' ; [ 12 ]
Whereas this functional interconnection and interaction is generally known as ' interoperability ' ; whereas such interoperability can be defined as the ability to exchange information and mutually to use the information which has been exchanged ; [ 13 ]
Whereas , for the avoidance of doubt , it has to be made clear that only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program , including those which underlie its interfaces , are not protected by copyright under this Directive ; [ 14 ]
Whereas , in accordance with this principle of copyright , to the extent that logic , algorithms and programming languages comprise ideas and principles , those ideas and principles are not protected under this Directive ; [ 15 ]
Whereas , in accordance with the legislation and jurisprudence of the Member States and the international copyright conventions , the expression of those ideas and principles is to be protected by copyright ; [ 19 ]
Whereas a person having a right to use a computer program should not be prevented from performing acts necessary to observe , study or test the functioning of the program , provided that these acts do not infringe the copyright in the program ; [ 20 ]
Whereas the unauthorized reproduction , translation , adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author ; [ 21 ]
Whereas , nevertheless , circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of Article 4 ( a ) and ( b ) are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs ; [ 22 ]
Whereas it has therefore to be considered that in these limited circumstances only , performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorization of the rightholder ; [ 23 ]
Whereas an objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system , including those of different manufacturers , so that they can work together ; [ 24 ]
Whereas such an exception to the author 's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program ; "
" Article 1 Object of protection 1 .
In accordance with the provisions of this Directive , Member States shall protect computer programs , by copyright , as literary works within the meaning of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works .
For the purposes of this Directive , the term ' computer programs ' shall include their preparatory design material .
2 . Protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program .
Ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program , including those which underlie its interfaces , are not protected by copyright under this Directive .
3 . A computer program shall be protected if it is original in the sense that it is the author 's own intellectual creation .
No other criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility for protection .
Article 4 Restricted Acts Subject to the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 , the exclusive rights of the rightholder within the meaning of Article 2 , shall include the right to do or to authorize : ( a ) the permanent or temporary reproduction of a computer program by any means and in any form , in part or in whole .
Insofar as loading , displaying , running , transmission or storage of the computer program necessitate such reproduction , such acts shall be subject to authorization by the rightholder ; ( b ) the translation , adaptation , arrangement and any other alteration of a computer program and the reproduction of the results thereof , without prejudice to the rights of the person who alters the program ; Article 5 Exceptions to the restricted acts 1 .
In the absence of specific contractual provisions , the acts referred to in Article 4 ( a ) and ( b ) shall not require authorization by the rightholder where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose , including for error correction .
2 . The making of a back - up copy by a person having a right to use the computer program may not be prevented by contract insofar as it is necessary for that use .
3 . The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be entitled , without the authorization of the rightholder , to observe , study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so while performing any of the acts of loading , displaying , running , transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do .
Article 6 Decompilation 1 . The authorization of the rightholder shall not be required where reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of Article 4 ( a ) and ( b ) are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs , provided that the following conditions are met : ( a ) these acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a right to use a copy of a program , or on their behalf by a person authorized to do so ; ( b ) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available to the persons referred to in subparagraph ( a ) ; and ( c ) these acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary to achieve interoperability .
2 . The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not permit the information obtained through its application : ( a ) to be used for goals other than to achieve the interoperability of the independently created computer program ; ( b ) to be given to others , except when necessary for the interoperability of the independently created computer program ; or ( c ) to be used for the development , production or marketing of a computer program substantially similar in its expression , or for any other act which infringes copyright .
3 . In accordance with the provisions of the Berne Convention for the protection of Literary and Artistic Works , the provisions of this Article may not be interpreted in such a way as to allow its application to be used in a manner which unreasonably prejudices the right holder 's legitimate interests or conflicts with a normal exploitation of the computer program .
Article 9 Continued application of other legal provisions 1 .
The provisions of this Directive shall be without prejudice to any other legal provisions such as those concerning patent rights , trademarks , unfair competition , trade secrets , protection of semiconductor products or the law of contract .
Any contractual provisions contrary to Article 6 or to the exceptions provided for in Article 5 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) shall be null and void . "
" ( 15 ) The Diplomatic Conference held under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ( WIPO ) in December 1996 led to the adoption of two new Treaties , the ' WIPO Copyright Treaty ' and the ' WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty ' , dealing respectively with the protection of authors and the protection of performers and phonogram producers .
Those Treaties update the international protection for copyright and related rights significantly , not least with regard to the so - called ' digital agenda ' , and improve the means to fight piracy world - wide .
The Community and a majority of Member States have already signed the Treaties and the process of making arrangements for the ratification of the Treaties by the Community and the Member States is under way .
This Directive also serves to implement a number of the new international obligations .
( 20 ) This Directive is based on principles and rules already laid down in the Directives currently in force in this area , in particular Directives
91/250 / EEC , 92/100/EEC , 93/83/EEC , 93/98/EEC and 96/9/ EC , and it develops those principles and rules and places them in the context of the information society .
The provisions of this Directive should be without prejudice to the provisions of those Directives , unless otherwise provided in this Directive .
( 44 ) When applying the exceptions and limitations provided for in this Directive , they should be exercised in accordance with international obligations .
Such exceptions and limitations may not be applied in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with the normal exploitation of his work or other subject - matter .
The provision of such exceptions or limitations by Member States should , in particular , duly reflect the increased economic impact that such exceptions or limitations may have in the context of the new electronic environment .
Therefore , the scope of certain exceptions or limitations may have to be even more limited when it comes to certain new uses of copyright works and other subject - matter .

Interpretation of domestic legislation in the context of European directives
Interpretation of domestic legislation in the context of international treaties
Interpretation of European directives
" According to settled case - law , in interpreting a provision of Community law it is necessary to consider not only its wording , but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part ( see , in particular , Case C- 156/98 Germany v Commission [ 2000 ] ECR I -6857 , paragraph 50 , and Case C - 53/05 Commission v Portugal [ 2006 ] ECR I - 6215 , paragraph 20 ) " .
" Moreover , Community legislation must , so far as possible , be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with international law , in particular where its provisions are intended specifically to give effect to an international agreement concluded by the Community ( see , in particular , Case C-341/95 Bettati [ 1998 ] ECR I - 4355 , paragraph 20 and the case - law cited ) . "
In that case the Court interpreted Article 3 ( 1 ) of the Information Society Directive in accordance with Article 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty .
Domestic case law concerning copyright in literary works other than computer programs
" (a ) As already stated , the overriding question is whether , in creating the defendant 's work , substantial use has been made of the skill and labour which went into the creation of the claimant 's work and thus those features which made it an original work .
( b) The quality or importance [ Catnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith Ltd [ 1982 ] R.P.C. 183 at 223 ] of what has been taken is much more important than the quantity .
[ There are statements in many authorities to this effect .
See , e.g. Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd v William Hill ( Football ) Ltd [ 1964 ] 1 W.L.R. 273 at 276 ; Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams ( Textiles ) Ltd [ 2001 ]
1 W.L.R. 2416 , at 2422 , 2425 , 2431 ..]
The issue thus depends therefore not just on the physical amount taken but on its substantial significance [ Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd v William Hill ( Football ) Ltd [ 1964 ] 1 W.L.R. 273 , at 283 . ] or importance to the copyright work , [ Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams ( Textiles ) Ltd [ 2001 ] 1 W.L.R. 2416 , per Lord Millett , at 2426 . ] so that the quality , or importance , of the part is frequently more significant than the proportion which the borrowed part bears to the whole .
In this context , expressions such as quality or importance need to be properly understood .
A literary work may convey a very important idea but , as already discussed , the law of copyright is concerned with the protection of the expression of such ideas , not the idea itself .
Quality and importance must therefore be understood in terms of the features of the work which made it an original work in the first place .
It follows that the quality relevant for the purposes of substantiality in the case of a literary work refers to the literary originality of that which has been copied .
( c) Depending on the circumstances , the question may depend on whether what has been taken is novel or striking , or is merely a commonplace arrangement of words or well known material .
[ Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd v William Hill ( Football ) Ltd [ 1964 ] 1 W.L.R. 273 , at 276 . ]
In this respect it may be a helpful shortcut to ask whether the part taken could itself be the subject of copyright , [ . ] although this should not be used as a substitute for the proper and full test of substantial part .
[ Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd v William Hill ( Football ) Ltd [ 1964 ] 1 W.L.R. 273 , at 277 . ]
In any event it is in reality merely a restatement of the basic question , which is whether use has been made of those features of the claimants work which , by reason of the skill and labour employed in their production , constitute it an original copyright work .
(d) As a corollary of the last point , the more simple or lacking in substantial originality the copyright work , the greater the degree of taking will be needed before the substantial part test is satisfied .
In the case of works of little originality , almost exact copying will normally be required to amount to infringement . [ ]
(e) The more abstract and simple a copied idea , the less likely it is to constitute a substantial part .
Originality , in the sense of the contribution of the authors skill and labour , tends to lie in the detail with which the basic idea is presented .
[ Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams ( Textiles ) Ltd [ 2001 ] 1 W.L.R. 2416 , at 2423 , per Lord Hoffmann : .]
( f) In general it is wrong to dissect the claimant 's work , taking each part which has been copied and asking whether each part could be the subject of copyright if it had stood alone .
It is the work as a whole which must be considered , [ ibid. , at 2421 . ] particularly where the originality of the work lies in the creation of the work as a whole .
( j) If what has been taken from the claimants work is material which was not original to the maker of the work , because for example it was copied from another work , then it should be disregarded in deciding this issue .
[ Warwick Film Productions v Eisinger [ 1969 ] Ch 1969 ]
If , however , part of the originality of the claimant 's work consisted of the choosing and collecting together of unoriginal material , and the defendant has made unfair use of this labour and skill , then the test will be satisfied .
This can often be seen in compilation cases
On the other hand , that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will , when robbed of that collocation , not be a substantial part of the copyright .
[ Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd v William Hill ( Football ) Ltd [ 1964 ] 1 W.L.R. 273 at 293 . ]
It is , therefore , often important to isolate what it is the real worth of a work from the copyright point of view , in particular what parts of the work constitute the original contribution of the author and thus represent the skill or labour of his creation .
"
The leading authority on what amounts to reproduction of a substantial part in cases of what is sometimes referred to as " non-textual " copying is the decision of the House of Lords in Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams ( Textiles ) Ltd [ 2001 ] 1 WLR 2416 , [ 2001 ]
FSR 11 ( the latter report has the advantage of added paragraph numbers , and hence has frequently been quoted from in subsequent cases ) which is repeatedly cited in the above passage .
Although this was a case about the copying of an artistic work , Lord Hoffmann also considered literary works in a passage in his speech which has subsequently been cited in several cases concerning literary works :
" [ 23 ]
It is often said , as Morritt L.J. said in this case , that copyright subsists not in ideas but in the form in which the ideas are expressed .
The distinction between expression and ideas finds a place in the Agreement on Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) ( O.J. 1994 L. 336 , p. 213 ) , to which the United Kingdom is a party ( see article 9.2 : ' Copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas ' ) .
Nevertheless , it needs to be handled with care .
What does it mean ?
As Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone said in L.B. ( Plastics ) Ltd v. Swish Products Ltd. [ 1979 ] R.P.C. 551 , 629 , 'it all depends on what you mean by " ideas " ' .
[ 24 ]
Plainly there can be no copyright in an idea which is merely in the head , which has not been expressed in copyrightable form , as a literary , dramatic , musical or artistic work .
But the distinction between ideas and expression cannot mean anything so trivial as that .
On the other hand , every element in the expression of an artistic work ( unless it got there by accident or compulsion ) is the expression of an idea on the part of the author .
It represents her choice to paint stripes rather than polka dots , flowers rather than tadpoles , use one colour and brush technique rather than another , and so on .
The expression of these ideas is protected , both as a cumulative whole and also to the extent to which they form a ' substantial part ' of the work .
Although the term ' substantial part ' might suggest a quantitative test , or at least the ability to identify some discrete part which , on quantitative or qualitative grounds , can be regarded as substantial , it is clear upon the authorities that neither is the correct test .
Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd. v. William Hill ( Football ) Ltd. [ 1964 ]
1 W.L.R. 273 establishes that substantiality depends upon quality rather than quantity ( Lord Reid , at p. 276 , Lord Evershed , at p. 283 , Lord Hodson , at p. 288 , Lord Pearce , at p. 293 ) .
And there are numerous authorities which show that the ' part ' which is regarded as substantial can be a feature or combination of features of the work , abstracted from it rather than forming a discrete part .
That is what the judge found to have been copied in this case .
Or to take another example , the original elements in the plot of a play or novel may be a substantial part , so that copyright may be infringed by a work which does not reproduce a single sentence of the original .
If one asks what is being protected in such a case , it is difficult to give any answer except that it is an idea expressed in the copyright work .
[ 25 ]
My Lords , if one examines the cases in which the distinction between ideas and the expression of ideas has been given effect , I think it will be found that they support two quite distinct propositions .
The first is that a copyright work may express certain ideas which are not protected because they have no connection with the literary , dramatic , musical or artistic nature of the work .
It is on this ground that , for example , a literary work which describes a system or invention does not entitle the author to claim protection for his system or invention as such .
The same is true of an inventive concept expressed in an artistic work .
However striking or original it may be , others are ( in the absence of patent protection ) free to express it in works of their own : see Kleeneze Ltd. v. D.R.G. ( U.K. ) Ltd. [ 1984 ] F.S.R. 399 .
The other proposition is that certain ideas expressed by a copyright work may not be protected because , although they are ideas of a literary , dramatic or artistic nature , they are not original , or so commonplace as not to form a substantial part of the work .
Kenrick & Co. v. Lawrence & Co. ( 1890 ) 25 Q.B.D. 99 is a well known example .
It is on this ground that the mere notion of combining stripes and flowers would not have amounted to a substantial part of the plaintiff 's work .
At that level of abstraction , the idea , though expressed in the design , would not have represented sufficient of the author 's skill and labour as to attract copyright protection .
[ 26 ]
Generally speaking , in cases of artistic copyright , the more abstract and simple the copied idea , the less likely it is to constitute a substantial part .
Originality , in the sense of the contribution of the author 's skill and labour , tends to lie in the detail with which the basic idea is presented .
Copyright law protects foxes better than hedgehogs .
In this case , however , the elements which the judge found to have been copied went well beyond the banal and I think that the judge was amply justified in deciding that they formed a substantial part of the originality of the work . "
" [ 9 ]
The judge did not explain the last sentence of his citation from Lord Hoffmann 's speech in the Designers Guild case , in which the judge had appeared as leading counsel .
Indeed Lord Hoffmann did not elaborate on his reference to hedgehogs and foxes .
However , it appears that it is a reference to a fragment of Greek poetry of the seventh century BC , with which the late Sir Isaiah Berlin begins his famous essay on Tolstoy :
' There is a line among the fragments of a Greek poet Archilochus which says " The fox knows many things , but the hedgehog knows one big thing " ' . '
( The Hedgehog and the Fox : An Essay on Tolstoy 's View of History by Isaiah Berlin . ( 1953 , as revised in 1978 ) ( Phoenix ) ( 1999 ) p.3 ) .
[ 10 ]
Sir Isaiah points out that scholars have differed about the correct interpretation of these ' dark ' words .
They may , on the one hand , mean no more than that the fox , for all his cunning , is defeated by the hedgehog 's one defence .
But the fragment may also be taken figuratively as contrasting those with a single central vision and organising principle as against those who pursue many ends , often unrelated or contradictory .
It was , I think , in the figurative sense that Lord Hoffmann was using his metaphor . "
" Copyright does not subsist in ideas ; it protects the expression of ideas , not the ideas themselves .
No clear principle is or could be laid down in the cases in order to tell whether what is sought to be protected is on the ideas side of the dividing line , or on the expression side . "
He went on to quote parts of Lord Hoffmann 's speech in Designers ' Guild at [ 24 ] to [ 25 ] .
" 145 .
The decided cases help in identifying the relevant necessary and sufficient conditions for substantiality .
Thus , it is not necessary for the actual language of the copyright work to be copied or even for similar words to be used tracking , like a translation , the language of the copyright work .
It is sufficient to establish that there has been substantial copying of the original collection , selection , arrangement , and structure of literary material , even of material that is not in itself the subject of copyright .
146 .
It is not , however , sufficient for the alleged infringing work simply to replicate or use items of information , facts , ideas , theories , arguments , themes and so on derived from the original copyright work .
147 .
I agree with Lloyd LJ that no clear principle can be laid down on how or where to draw the line between the legitimate use of the ideas expressed and the unlawful copying of their expression . "
Domestic case law concerning copyright in computer programs
" 2 . The case raises starkly an issue of considerable importance in the law of copyright .
While there are comparatively minor allegations of infringement by copying of certain code and an allegation in relation to the databases , that I summarise below , the striking feature of this action is that Navitaire does not suggest that easyJet or BulletProof ever had access to the source code of the OpenRes system .
What is alleged , and not disputed , is that easyJet wanted a new system that was substantially indistinguishable from the OpenRes system , as easyJet used it , in respect of its ' user interface ' .
This term is used to denote the appearance that the running software presents to the user , who may be an agent in a call centre or a private individual seeking to make a booking by use of the World Wide Web .
It substantially achieved this far - from - simple goal .
It is not in dispute that none of the underlying software in any way resembles that of OpenRes , save that it acts upon identical or very similar inputs and produces very similar results , but it is said that the copyright in OpenRes is infringed by what was called ' non-textual copying . '
5 . There is here an issue of general importance .
To emulate the action of a piece of software by the writing of other software that has no internal similarity to the first but is deliberately designed to ' look ' the same and achieve the same results is far from uncommon .
If Navitaire are right in their most far - reaching submission , much of such work may amount to the infringement of copyright in the original computer program , even if the alleged infringer had no access to the source code for it and did not investigate or decompile the executable program . "
" 85 .
However , I am acutely conscious that this may not be a satisfactory answer to the problem .
It depends too much upon the way in which OpenRes was written .
In answer to a question from me , it was made clear by Dr Hunt that it would be possible to record the command names and their syntax expressly and use a program ( a ' parser generator ' ) automatically to construct a parser that recognised such commands accompanied by arguments according to such a syntax .
The commands and their syntax would , in such a case , be recognisable as such in the source code for the parser generator .
In such a case the copyright owner could point to a written work describing exactly how the alleged infringer 's program parsed the code and the consequences would be very different .
I am most reluctant to come to a conclusion that depends upon the happenstance of the manner in which the programmer decided to set about constructing his parser .
In either case , the ultimate result is a computer program which recognises the input according to the prescribed rules .
86 . I consider that the better approach is to take the view that it is not possible to infringe the copyright that subsists either in the source code for a parser or in the source code for a parser generator by observing the behaviour of the final program and constructing another program to do the same thing .
In expressing this view , I am verging on drawing a distinction between the ' idea ' of the program and its ' expression ' , and , Navitaire contends , that is not a distinction known to English law and is entirely contrary to the observations of Jacob J. ( as he then was ) in the leading case of Ibcos Computers Ltd v Barclays Mercantile Highland Finance Ltd [ 1994 ] F.S.R. 275 .
87 . I think the problem should be approached in the following way .
To define a series of commands and their syntax to be recognised by the computer is to define a computer language .
It is exactly the same as defining a language such as BASIC or a simple language to control a calculator program .
A program consists of a statement or series of statements in that ' language ' .
Thus , to take the availability command as an example , one would say that the language includes an availability statement that starts with the letter ' A ' and one of the permissible forms of which is A[ date ] [ City - Pair ] +.
An example of a statement that will be parsed as an allowable statement to control the computer in accordance with this language is A13JUNLTNAMS +.
Recitals 13 , 15 and 14 ( fn They are not numbered in the original , but this is a convenient way to refer to them ) of the Software Directive are as follows : .
88 . The Software Directive is a harmonising measure .
I must construe any implementing provision in accordance with it : if the implementing provision means what it should , the Directive alone need be consulted : if it departs from the Directive , then the latter has been incorrectly transposed into UK law .
( fn See Case C-106/89 : Marleasing [ 1990 ] ECR I -4135 , and in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Century Life Plc [ 2001 ] S.T.C. 38 . )
The recitals quoted are said by Laddie , Prescott & Vitoria , Modern Law of Copyright and Designs , ( 3rd edn ) , para.34.19 to make it clear that ' computer languages are not included in the protection afforded to computer programs ' .
With this conclusion I agree , although the point cannot be said to be entirely clear and will require to be referred to the Court of Justice .
In my view , the principle extends to ad hoc languages of the kind with which I am here concerned , that is , a defined user command interface .
It does not matter how the ' language ' of the interface is defined .
It may be defined formally or it may be defined only by the code that recognises it .
Either way , copyright does not subsist in it .
This is of course not to suggest that the expression of a program in a particular language is not entitled to copyright .
Quite the reverse .
What this recital [ sic ] , and the associated dispositive provision of Art. 1 ( 2 ) , appear to be intended to do , is to keep the language free for use , but not the ideas expressed in it :
89 .
There is here more than an echo of a conceptual distinction between idea and expression , but it is unprofitable to pursue this approach in the light of the express reference to computer languages and interfaces in the recital and to the interfaces in Art . 1 ( 2 ) . "
" Copyright protection for computer software is given , but I do not feel that the courts should be astute to extend that protection into a region where only the functional effects of a program are in issue .
There is a respectable case for saying that copyright is not , in general , concerned with functional effects , and there is some advantage in a bright line rule protecting only the claimant 's embodiment of the function in software and not some superset of that software .
The case is not truly analogous with the plot of a novel , because the plot is part of the work itself .
The user interface is not part of the work itself .
One could permute all the letters and other codes in the command names , and it would still work in the same way , and all that would be lost is a modest mnemonic advantage .
To approach the problem in this way may at least be consistent with the distinction between idea and expression that finds its way into the Software Directive , but , of course , it draws the line between idea and expression in a particular place which some would say lies too far on the side of expression .
I think , however , that such is the independence of the particular form of the actual codes used from the overall functioning of the software that it is legitimate to separate them in this way , and not to afford them separate protection when the underlying software is not even arguably copied . "
" They are , in my view , ' ideas which underlie its interfaces ' in the sense used in Art. 1 ( 2 ) of the Directive : they provide the static framework for the display of the dynamic data which it is the task of the software to produce . "
It appears from this that he considered that the VT100 screen displays were not protected by copyright .
He went on in Annexe 5 of the judgment at [ 308 ] to consider the individual displays , from which it appears that he considered that the defendants had not reproduced a substantial part of anything protected by literary copyright in any event .
His analysis in respect of the reports in Annexe 6 of the judgment is to the same effect .
" The Directive is concerned only with the protection of computer programs as literary works , and I do not read it as having any impact on relevant artistic copyrights . "
Thus the claim in respect of the GUI screens succeeded for the reasons given in more detail in Annexe 5 at [ 309 ] -[ 317 ] .
" As I have indicated above , the case advanced by Navitaire is based on the fact that the functions of OpenRes and eRes are identical to the user so far as the aspects of the system of interest to easyJet are concerned .
The case had its origin in the suggestion that what was called the ' business logic ' of OpenRes had been appropriated . "
" 112 .
I shall return to first principles .
For present purposes , a computer running a particular program is a deterministic machine .
A particular input to the machine will produce a predictable result derived from all previous inputs to the machine .
If therefore one studies a machine in operation , it should be possible to identify the machine 's response to all possible sequences of inputs , and so construct a new machine that operates to give the same outputs for the same sequences of inputs by writing an appropriate program .
Navitaire contend that if this is done , it follows axiomatically that any copyright in the source code for the first machine must be infringed in writing the second program .
Indeed , it was urged on me at an earlier hearing that it was unnecessary to consider any of the source code for the OpenRes system in determining whether there had been copying of a substantial part of the copyright ( s ) subsisting in the source code for it .
113 .
There is no doubt that easyJet and BulletProof had no access to the source code of OpenRes , and it is not in dispute that in languages used , actual code and architecture ( subject to the claim in respect of the database ) the systems are quite different .
There is no suggestion that the eRes code represents a translation or adaptation of the OpenRes code .
The term ' non- textual copying ' might be replaced by the more accurate ' copying without access to the thing copied , directly or indirectly ' .
114 .
The claim depends first upon the contention that the manner in which a machine behaves under the control of a program represents part of the skill and labour that went into the program .
This is not an unreasonable observation .
On the contrary , it is the whole object of the programmer to get the computer to behave in the required manner .
115 .
To copy an operating machine in this manner avoids the need to conduct any systems analysis or the production of functional specifications .
Thus , it may be observed that although the copyist has not avoided the need to write software to achieve the desired result , he has avoided the need to identify the result by any of the normal methods of analysis that either precede or accompany the writing of a substantial piece of business software . "
" 125 .
This does not answer the question with which I am confronted , which is peculiar , I believe , to computer programs .
The reason it is a new problem is that two completely different computer programs can produce an identical result : not a result identical at some level of abstraction but identical at any level of abstraction .
This is so even if the author of one has no access at all to the other but only to its results .
The analogy with a plot is for this reason a poor one .
It is a poor one for other reasons as well .
To say these programs possess a plot is precisely like saying that the book of instructions for a booking clerk acting manually has a plot : but a book of instructions has no theme , no events , and does not have a narrative flow .
Nor does a computer program , particularly one whose behaviour depends upon the history of its inputs in any given transaction .
It does not have a plot , merely a series of pre-defined operations intended to achieve the desired result in response to the requests of the customer .
126 .
The view in favour of the Navitaire case is expressed concisely by the authors of The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs , 3rd ed ( 2000 ) ( I have assumed that when they speak of ' obtains from the original program ' they do not mean obtain directly , but indirectly from watching the program work ) , at para 34.64 :
' For instance , the writing of a financing program may require as part of the task a careful elucidation of the relevant tax regulations so that they may be reduced to a series of unambiguous statements and it will be evident to any lawyer that this alone will probably involve a very large amount of work .
A competitor might write a program of his own in a different computer language and arranged in a different way and with many improvements of his own but if he obtains the rules for calculating the tax from the original program instead of working these out for himself it is hard to see why he should not be considered a plagiarist . '
127 .
There is a counter - example that throws some light on the nature of the problem .
Take the example of a chef who invents a new pudding .
After a lot of work he gets a satisfactory result , and thereafter his puddings are always made using his written recipe , undoubtedly a literary work .
Along comes a competitor who likes the pudding and resolves to make it himself .
Ultimately , after much culinary labour , he succeeds in emulating the earlier result , and he records his recipe .
Is the later recipe an infringement of the earlier , as the end result , the plot and purpose of both ( the pudding ) is the same ?
I believe the answer is no .
128 .
I think that the answer to the problem is to be gathered from the passage in Lord Hoffmann 's speech immediately following that quoted above . from the Designers ' Guild case : [ he proceeded to cite [ 25 ] -[ 26 ] ] .
129 .
The questions in the present case are both a lack of substantiality and the nature of the skill and labour to be protected .
Navitaire 's computer program invites input in a manner excluded from copyright protection , outputs its results in a form excluded from copyright protection and creates a record of a reservation in the name of a particular passenger on a particular flight .
What is left when the interface aspects of the case are disregarded is the business function of carrying out the transaction and creating the record , because none of the code was read or copied by the defendants .
It is right that those responsible for devising OpenRes envisaged this as the end result for their program : but that is not relevant skill and labour .
In my judgment , this claim for non-textual copying should fail .
130 .
I do not come to this conclusion with any regret .
If it is the policy of the Software Directive to exclude both computer languages and the underlying ideas of the interfaces from protection , then it should not be possible to circumvent these exclusions by seeking to identify some overall function or functions that it is the sole purpose of the interface to invoke and relying on those instead .
As a matter of policy also , it seems to me that to permit the ' business logic ' of a program to attract protection through the literary copyright afforded to the program itself is an unjustifiable extension of copyright protection into a field where I am far from satisfied that it is appropriate . "
In the subsequent case of Nova Productions Ltd v Mazooma Games Ltd [ 2007 ] EWCA Civ 219 , [ 2007 ]
Bus LR 1032 , the claimant was the developer of a video game called Pocket Money which simulated a game of pool .
The defendants developed two video games called Jackpot Pool and Trick Shot which also simulated pool games and which the claimant alleged infringed its copyrights .
A remarkable feature of the case was that , although there were certain similarities between the defendants ' games and the claimant 's at a high level of generality , at a more detailed level they were very different .
" 31 . Mr Howe had to face the formidable objection created by Art. 1.2 of the [ Software ] Directive and recitals 13 and 15 .
To my mind these provisions are abundantly clear .
The well - known dichotomy between an idea and its individual expression is intended to apply and does to copyright in computer software .
When I say ' well - known ' I mean not just known to copyright lawyers of one country but well - known all over the world .
Recital 15 refers to the protection of the expression of ideas as being ' in accordance with the legislation and jurisprudence of the Member States and the international copyright conventions ' and is clearly a reference to this dichotomy .
The TRIPS agreement of 1994 likewise recognises this dichotomy , see particularly Art , 9.2 .
32 . Mr Howe suggested that the dichotomy was intended to apply only to ideas which underlie an element of a program  what he called a ' building block ' .
He cited ( as did the Judge ) what Lord Hoffmann said about the dichotomy outside the context of computer programs in Designers Guild : [ quoting [ 25 ] ] .
33 .
As regards [ Lord Hoffmann 's ] first proposition I said much the same thing in Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile [ 1994 ] FSR 275 at p.291
' The true position is that where an ' idea ' is sufficiently general , then even if an original work embodies it , the mere taking of that idea will not infringe .
But if the ' idea ' is detailed , then there may be infringement .
It is a question of degree .
The same applies whether the work is functional or not , and whether visual or literary .
In the latter field the taking of a plot ( i.e. the " idea " ) of a novel or play can certainly infringe if that plot is a substantial part of the copyright work .
As Judge Learned Hand said ( speaking of the distinction between " idea " and " expression " ) : " Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary and nobody ever can " , Nichols v Universal Pictures ( 1930 ) 45 F. ( 2d ) 119 . '
34 . Mr Howe then submitted that the ' idea ' of the cue pulsing with the power - meter could not be discounted within Lord Hoffmann 's first category because here we are concerned with copyright in a computer program .
You can not say the " idea " has no connection with the nature of the work .
Nor did it fall within the second category because it was not held ' commonplace , ' merely ' obvious . '
He sought to bolster the argument by reference to the travaux préparatoires to the Directive .
At the very least , he submitted , the position was unclear and that we should refer some questions to the European Court of Justice pursuant to Art. 234 of the Treaty .
35 . I reject all of that .
First I think the fact that we are considering a computer program copyright does not in any way preclude a mere ' idea ' as to what the program should do from being excluded as having nothing to do with the nature of the work .
The nature of the work is a computer program having all the necessary coding to function .
The general idea is only faintly related to that  no different from the relationship of the general idea of a plastic letter - box draught excluder to the artistic works consisting of the drawings for a particular excluder in the Kleeneze case .
Indeed I have to say that , as Mr Howe waxed lyrical about the combination of features in the animation , he sounded more like counsel in a patent case than one in a copyright case .
Not all of the skill which goes into a copyright work is protected  the obvious example being the skill involved in creating an invention which is then described in a literary work .
An idea consisting of a combination of ideas is still just an idea .
That is as true for ideas in a computer program as for any other copyright work .
36 . Nor am I impressed by Mr Howe 's attempt to limit the dichotomy to ' building blocks ' .
He sought to do this by reference to recital 14 which refers to ' logic , algorithms and programming languages ' as comprising ' ideas and principles . '
I see no reason to suppose that recital 13 is thereby limited .
Recital 14 is clearly drawn on the basis that the basic position of recital 13 - no protection for ideas and principles - applies also to those specified matters .
37 .
The same conclusion is reached if one considers TRIPS .
Although normally a UK
Act is not to be construed by reference to a later international Treaty , I note that Lord Hoffmann considered TRIPS to be of relevance to our domestic copyright law in Designers Guild ( ) .
Here the position is much clearer because we are dealing with EU law .
The ECJ has held that TRIPS ( to which the EU as well as its Member States is a party ) is relevant to the construction of earlier EU legislation concerned with intellectual property [ citing Case C - 89/99 Schieving - Nijstad v Groeneveld ] .
38 . Mr Howe sought to escape from the fact that we should construe the UK
Act in accordance with the Directive which should be construed so far as possible as to conform to TRIPS by a further submission : that TRIPS was only concerned with minimum standards for intellectual property rights and that its signatories were free to provide for greater rights .
So , he said , the EU could provide that copyright protection extended to ideas if it so wanted .
Now it is in general true that a party to TRIPS can provide more extensive protection than called for TRIPS , see Art.1 .
But the concluding words of the first sentence of Art.1 add ' provided that such protection does not contravene the provisions of this Agreement ' .
Art. 9.2 positively provides that ' copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas etc. as such ' .
So in this instance TRIPS lays down a positive rule as to the point beyond which copyright protection may not go .
To protect by copyright mere ideas as such would contravene TRIPS .
The Software Directive must be construed so as to conform to TRIPS and so must be construed as not to protect ideas as such .
39 .
As to the travaux Mr Howe took us through the following :
i ) the original Commission " Proposal for a Council Directive on the legal protection of computer programs " COM ( 88 ) 816 final  SYN 183 , submitted on 5 January 1989 ( 89/C91/05 ) ;
ii ) the amended proposal COM ( 90 ) 509 final  SYN 183 ( 1990 / C 320/11 ) , submitted on 18 October 1990 ; and
iii ) the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee .
40 . Mr Howe was unable to point to any clear unequivocal statement anywhere suggesting that copyright in computer programs should extend to ideas .
Given that state of affairs it would be a waste of time to set out all the material in detail .
It is sufficient to record that the submission is based on an argument by implication from unexplained alterations from the original proposal .
In particular the original proposal did not use the expression ' element of a computer program ' in proposed Art.1.2 but merely to ' the ideas , principles , logic , algorithms or programming languages . '
I cannot extract from this any intention to extend protection to ideas provided they are not 'elements . '
41 . I am reinforced in my view by the fact that the Economic and Social Committee ( whose report is specifically recited in the Directive as being a document to which the Council had regard in making the Directive ) clearly did not think the proposal was limited as suggested by Mr Howe .
It said tersely :
' There is no dispute that ' ideas and principles ' are outside the protection of the law of copyright . ' "
" 48 . Mr Howe attacked that .
I quote his skeleton argument :
' this analogy is a poor one .
The reason is that the first chef has deployed two quite distinct types of skill and labour .
The first is the skill of devising a recipe , a skill which on no view forms part of the skill and labour protected by copyright in literary works .
The second is skill and labour in reducing the recipe he has devised to written form .
A copyist who copies from his pudding rather than from his recipe book may appropriate the former skill and labour but none of the latter .
By contrast , a copyist who copies the function of a computer program to write his own program to achieve the same results is clearly appropriating part of the skill and labour expended in designing the program . '
49 .
He further developed the argument basing himself on the recital 7 of the Directive .
He asked us to suppose a case where there are two clear stages in the making of a programa first stage where the designer sets out all the things he wants the program to be able do and a second stage ( which may be by a different person ) where the actual program code is written .
Mr Howe contended that the first stage was intended to be protected as such , even if it consisted only of ideas as to what the program should do .
Going back to the analogy , the ' preparatory work ; for the program is like the skill of devising the recipe and the actual program writing like the reduction of the recipe to written form .
The difference , he submitted , is that for computer programs , unlike the recipe , the preparatory work is to be protected .
50 . I reject the argument .
The reason is simple .
The Directive does not say that mere ideas by way of preparatory design work are to be protected .
As I have said it makes it clear that for computer programs as a whole ( which includes their preparatory design work ) ideas are not to be protected .
What is protected by way of preparatory design work is that work as a literary work the expression of the designs which are to go into the ultimate program , not the ideas themselves .
51 . So , for example , if Mr Jones had actually written a description of the pulsing , rotating cue , and synchronised power meter his description would ( if not too trivial at least ) be protected as a literary work .
People could not copy that .
But they could use the same idea .
Similarly and more generally , a written work consisting of a specification of the functions of an intended computer program will attract protection as a literary work .
But the functions themselves do not .
Of course to someone familiar with the prior English law it is self - evident that copyright could subsist in such a description .
The fact that a work can get copyright even if mundane , is old and familiar to an English lawyer .
But the Directive needed to say that protection as a literary work should be provided for preparatory design work because not all member states under their existing laws necessarily provided that .
That is the whole point of the Directive and the clear reason for it is recited in article 1 .
52 . So I think Mr Howe 's attack on the Navitaire case [ 2006 ] RPC 111 fails .
The reasoning in the Navitaire case provides a second reason for dismissing this appeal .
Pumfrey J was quite right to say that merely making a program which will emulate another but which in no way involves copying the program code or any of the program 's graphics is legitimate .
53 . Finally Mr Howe suggested the law was sufficiently uncertain as to warrant a reference being made to the European Court of Justice .
No less than six elaborate draft questions were supplied .
I do not think it is necessary to make any reference to resolve this case .
It is wholly unrealistic to suppose that the European Court of Justice would hold that copyright protection was to be given to ideas at such a high level of abstraction as those in this case . "
Domestic case law on fair dealing for the purposes of criticism or review
" 9 - 23 Approach to construction .
As to the various expressions , ' criticism or review ' and ' reporting current events ' , these are expressions which should be interpreted liberally and their precise boundaries cannot be plotted : the nearer any use comes to the boundaries , unplotted as they are , the less likely is the use to be fair .
[ Pro Sieben Media AG v Carlton UK Television Ltd [ 1999 ] 1 WLR 605 ; [ 1999 ] F.S.R. 610
The same is no doubt true of the expressions ' non- commercial research ' and ' private study ' . ]
All the fair dealing provisions use the words ' for the purpose of ' .
As to whether this expression imports an objective or subjective test , it is important to construe the composite phrases ' for the purpose of non-commercial research ' and ' for the purpose of private study ' , etc. rather than each single word .
When this is done , the precise mental element on the part of the user ceases to be of great importance .
The words ' in the context of ' or 'as part of an exercise in ' could be substituted for ' for the purpose of ' without any significant change of meaning .
The task of the court is to consider the use made of the work and then ascertain what was the perceived purpose of that use .
9 -30 Form of acknowledgment .
The acknowledgment of the work may take the form of identification of its title or some other description of it .
[ CDPA 1988 , s.178 .]
Identification of the author need not by reference to his proper name , particularly if this would be unlikely to have any particular significance or would be meaningless to the bulk of the intended audience .
[ Pro Sieben Media AG v Carlton UK Television Ltd [ 1999 ] 1 WLR 605 ; [ 1999 ] F.S.R. 610 ; Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd v Marks and Spencer plc [ 1999 ] R.P.C. 536 ( CA ) . ]
Use of a pseudonym by which an author is known to the public will therefore be sufficient . ] .
9 -38 For the purposes of criticism or review .
The proper approach to the construction of these expressions has already been considered .
[ ]
In Australia , the words ' criticism ' and ' review ' have both been given their dictionary definitions .
Thus ' criticism ' has been defined as : ( 1 ) The act or art of analysing and judging the quality of a literary or artistic work , etc. ( as in literary criticism ) .
( 2 ) The act of passing judgment as to the merits of something .
( 3 ) A critical comment , article or essay .
[ De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd ( 1990 ) 18 I.P.R. 292 at 299 . ]
' Review ' has been defined as : 'a critical article or report , as in a periodical , on some literary work , commonly some work of recent appearance ; a critique ' .
[ De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd ( 1990 ) 18 I.P.R. 292. ] ' Criticism ' can thus be seen as describing the ' critical application of the mental faculties ' , whilst ' review ' describes the results of such a process .
[ De Garis v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd ( 1990 ) 18 I.P.R. 292 . ]
Criticism may be strongly expressed and unbalanced , the issue then usually being whether the use is fair dealing .
[ Pro Sieben Media AG v Carlton UK Television Ltd [ 1999 ] 1 WLR 605 , [ 1999 ] F.S.R. 610 , CA .
An author 's remedy for unbalanced criticism which still amounts to fair dealing will lie , if anywhere , in the law of defamation : Pro Sieben . ]
9 -55 Relevant considerations .
Relevant factors to be taken into account in judging whether the dealing was fair have been identified in various cases .
None is determinative and the weight to be attached to them will vary from case to case .
In particular , the various factors will carry different weight according to the type of dealing .
Cases of fair dealing for purposes of criticism , review and the reporting of current events usually raise more difficult problems than cases of non-commercial research and private study .
The three most important factors have been identified to be : [ Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd [ 2001 ] EWCA Civ 1142 ; [ 2002 ] Ch.149 ]
(1) The degree to which the alleged infringing use competes with exploitation of the copyright work by the owner .
This is likely to be a most important factor .
(2) Whether the work has been published or not .
(3) The extent of the use and the importance of what has been taken .
In many cases this will be a highly important factor "
European Union case law on copyright in literary works
" 31 .
It is clear that Directive 2001 / 29 does not define the concept of either ' reproduction ' or ' reproduction in part ' .
32 . In those circumstances , those concepts must be defined having regard to the wording and context of Article 2 of Directive 2001 / 29 , where the reference to them is to be found and in the light of both the overall objectives of that directive and international law ( see , to that effect , SGAE , paragraphs 34 and 35 and case - law cited ) .
33 . Article 2 ( a ) of Directive 2001 / 29 provides that authors have the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit reproduction , in whole or in part , of their works .
It follows that protection of the author 's right to authorise or prohibit reproduction is intended to cover ' work ' .
34 .
It is , moreover , apparent from the general scheme of the Berne Convention , in particular Article 2 ( 5 ) and ( 8 ) , that the protection of certain subject - matters as artistic or literary works presupposes that they are intellectual creations .
35 . Similarly , under Articles 1 ( 3 ) of Directive 91/250 , 3 ( 1 ) of Directive 96/9 and 6 of Directive 2006 / 116 , works such as computer programs , databases or photographs are protected by copyright only if they are original in the sense that they are their author 's own intellectual creation .
36 .
In establishing a harmonised legal framework for copyright , Directive 2001 / 29 is based on the same principle , as evidenced by recitals 4 , 9 to 11 and 20 in the preamble thereto .
37 .
In those circumstances , copyright within the meaning of Article 2 ( a ) of Directive 2001 / 29 is liable to apply only in relation to a subject - matter which is original in the sense that it is its author 's own intellectual creation .
38 .
As regards the parts of a work , it should be borne in mind that there is nothing in Directive 2001 / 29 or any other relevant directive indicating that those parts are to be treated any differently from the work as a whole .
It follows that they are protected by copyright since , as such , they share the originality of the whole work .
39 .
In the light of the considerations referred to in paragraph 37 of this judgment , the various parts of a work thus enjoy protection under Article 2 ( a ) of Directive 2001 / 29 , provided that they contain elements which are the expression of the intellectual creation of the author of the work .
45 . Regarding the elements of such works covered by the protection , it should be observed that they consist of words which , considered in isolation , are not as such an intellectual creation of the author who employs them .
It is only through the choice , sequence and combination of those words that the author may express his creativity in an original manner and achieve a result which is an intellectual creation .
46 . Words as such do not , therefore , constitute elements covered by the protection .
47 .
That being so , given the requirement of a broad interpretation of the scope of the protection conferred by Article 2 of Directive 2001 / 29 , the possibility may not be ruled out that certain isolated sentences , or even certain parts of sentences in the text in question , may be suitable for conveying to the reader the originality of a publication such as a newspaper article , by communicating to that reader an element which is , in itself , the expression of the intellectual creation of the author of that article .
Such sentences or parts of sentences are , therefore , liable to come within the scope of the protection provided for in Article 2 ( a ) of that directive .
48 .
In the light of those considerations , the reproduction of an extract of a protected work which , like those at issue in the main proceedings , comprises 11 consecutive words thereof , is such as to constitute reproduction in part within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive 2001 / 29 , if that extract contains an element of the work which , as such , expresses the author 's own intellectual creation ; it is for the national court to make this determination .
49 .
It must be remembered also that the data capture process used by Infopaq allows for the reproduction of multiple extracts of protected works .
That process reproduces an extract of 11 words each time a search word appears in the relevant work and , moreover , often operates using a number of search words because some clients ask Infopaq to draw up summaries based on a number of criteria .
50 .
In so doing , that process increases the likelihood that Infopaq will make reproductions in part within the meaning of Article 2 ( a ) of Directive 2001 / 29 because the cumulative effect of those extracts may lead to the reconstitution of lengthy fragments which are liable to reflect the originality of the work in question , with the result that they contain a number of elements which are such as to express the intellectual creation of the author of that work . "
" 56 .
For the interpretation of each of those conditions in turn , it should be borne in mind that , according to settled case - law , the provisions of a directive which derogate from a general principle established by that directive must be interpreted strictly ( Case C-476/01 Kapper [ 2004 ] ECR I -5205 , paragraph 72 , and Case C-36/05 Commission v Spain [ 2006 ] ECR I - 10313 , paragraph 31 ) .
57 .
This holds true for the exemption provided for in Article 5 ( 1 ) of Directive 2001 / 29 , which is a derogation from the general principle established by that directive , namely the requirement of authorisation from the rightholder for any reproduction of a protected work .
58 .
This is all the more so given that the exemption must be interpreted in the light of Article 5 ( 5 ) of Directive 2001 / 29 , under which that exemption is to be applied only in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject - matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder .

SAS Institute 's claim that WPS infringes the copyrights in the SAS Components
Computer programs as literary works
Ideas , procedures , methods of operation and mathematical concepts
" In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea , procedure , process , system , method of operation , concept , principle , or discovery , regardless of the form in which it is described , explained , illustrated , or embodied in such work . "
At that time there was nothing to require the United Kingdom courts to distinguish between " expressions " and " ideas , procedures , methods of operation and mathematical concepts as such " , since , even if they had recognised that Article 2 of the Berne Convention should be interpreted in that manner , the principle of statutory construction articulated by Lord Diplock in The Jade did not require them to interpret the 1988 Act in the same way .
For the reasons given above , the 1988 Act must now be interpreted in conformity with Article 9 ( 2 ) of TRIPS and Article 2 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty .
As a result , the United Kingdom courts must now interpret the 1988 Act so as to protect " expressions " and not " ideas , procedures , methods of operation and mathematical concepts as such " .
Copyright protection for programming languages , interfaces and functionality
" Protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program but shall not extend to the ideas , principles , logic , algorithms or programming languages underlying the program .
Where the specification of interfaces constitutes ideas and principles which underlie the program , those ideas and principles are not copyrightable subject matter . "
" Protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program .
Ideas and principles which underlie any aspect of a program , including its interfaces , shall not be protected by copyright under this Directive . "
" As regard the scope of protection given by the application of copyright to computer programs , the original proposal has been abridged and simplified as proposed by the European Parliament to make clear the basic doctrine of copyright law which the Directive seeks to apply .
That doctrine , widely applied in the jurisprudence of the Member States even if not always articulated explicitly in each national legislation , is that copyright protection only applies to the expression of an idea or principle , and not to the idea or principle itself . "
" The Commission has accepted the amendment of the Parliament to the text of article 1.3 of the original proposal which re-states , in a simplified form , the general principle of copyright law on which the scope of protection of this proposal is based .
That principle is the following : copyright protects the way in which an idea is expressed , but does not give a monopoly in the idea itself .
A second author may take up an idea which he has found in an existing work and re-formulate it , using a different expression , and acquiring his own copyright in that new expression .
The text proposed by the Parliament makes clear that this copyright principle is to be applied to every part of a program : it is therefore a formulation capable of being interpreted by national courts across a broad range of situations "
" 3.11 .
In order to produce interoperative systems it is necessary to replicate the ideas , rules or principles by which interfaces between systems are specified , but not necessarily to reproduce the code which implements them .
Ideas , rules or principles are not copyrightable subject matter .
Such ideas , rules or principles may be used by any programmer in the creation of an independent implementation of them in an interoperative program .
3.12 Competitors are therefore free , once they establish through independent analysis which ideas , rules or principles are being used , to create their own implementation of the ideas , rules or principles in order to make compatible products .
They may build on the identical idea , but may not use the same expression as that of other protected programs .
There is thus no monopoly on the information itself , but only a protection of the form of expression of that information .
3.13
If similarities in the code which implements the ideas , rules or principles occur as between interoperative programs , due to the inevitability of certain forms of expression , where the constraints of the interface are such that in the circumstances no different implementation is possible , then no copyright infringement will normally occur , because in these circumstances it is generally said that idea and expression have merged .
3.14 Although it is technically possible to decompile a program in order to find out information concerning access protocols and interfaces this is a lengthy , costly and inefficient procedure .
It is usually more efficient for the parties concerned to agree on the terms under which the information will made available .
Problems of access to information may have to be addressed by other means which are outside the scope of this Directive . "
" In response to concerns expressed by the European Parliament and by part of the industry , a further exception to the author 's exclusive rights for the purpose of creating an interoperable program has been accepted .
Computer programs have to interoperate with hardware and other software in order to perform their functions and in order to form systems and networks .
If a manufacturer wishes to interconnect his products with others supplied by a different manufacturer he may need information from the manufacturer about how his products are designed to interconnect .
Such information may be at the present time usually available through materials supplied by manufacturers or by the growing move towards the use of publicly available open standards where the means to interconnect have been standardised and described and documented by international standards bodies .
However if information is not forthcoming or if the design of the means of interconnection is a non-standard proprietary one , manufacturers could find themselves unable to derive sufficient detailed information without committing acts which technically violate the author 's exclusive rights to prevent the reproduction and translation of his program .
These acts of reproducing and translating the object code version of the program , which is the version normally supplied the public , back into a language representing something more like the original source code in which the programmer devised a programme are often referred to loosely as ' reverse engineering ' the program .
Although a dominant supplier who refused to make information available to provide for interoperability between programs or between programs and hardware could be subject to the application of the competition rules under Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC treaty , the Commission has been persuaded that the original proposal , which left the matter of ' reverse engineering ' not explicitly regulated , lacked sufficient clarity .
It is therefore proposed that an additional Article 5 bis dealing with a derogation allowing ' reverse engineering ' of programs for the purposes of interoperability of the programme should be added .
Nothing in this Directive should prevent however the ' reverse engineering ' of a program , whether incorporated into hardware or not , under the conditions of Article 5 bis for the purpose of independently creating an interoperable program , wherever it may be incorporated . "
" The problem which this article addresses stems from the nature of the computer program highlighted in the context of Article 5 paragraph 5 above , that is to say , the fact that it cannot be easily ' read ' by a human user .
However , a computer program may be required to interconnect and interact with other computer programs , for example , an applications program with an operating system .
In order for the creators of computer programs to understand how their creations can interconnect and interact with those of others , they must be able to perceive in detail how the first manufacturer has provided for the exchange of data between his program and other programs .
In many instances the creator of the original program will have made available through published manuals or on request , sufficient information about the parts of his program whose function is to provide for its interoperation with other programs .
In other instances , the design of those parts of the program will be standardized and publicly documented for all creators of programs to work to a common agreed interface specification .
In a certain number of cases it may be that information is not forthcoming by either of these means .
In such cases the creator of the original program , by withholding information from competitors , can ensure that only he can supply the range of other programs which will interoperate with his original program .
Article 5 paragraph 5 is intended to permit much of the information required for the purpose of interoperability to be derived from observation , study or testing of the program without committing infringements of the author 's exclusive rights .
These techniques will be adequate in many circumstances .
However , where their use does not produce sufficient information and where other non-infringing means such as the use of publicly available material or published documentation is also inadequate , the Commission 's amended proposal ensures , that as a last resort , a person having a right to use a copy of the program may commit acts of reproduction and translation of the machine - readable form of the code in which the copy has been supplied without the authorization of the right holder , subject to certain limitations .
In this way , the amended proposal provides a safety mechanism by which an independently created program can be made to be interoperable with an existing program , even when the creator of the existing program has chosen not to reveal to third parties the specification of the interfaces whose function is to provide a means of interconnection with other elements of a computer system . "
" 2.2 As far as the property right is concerned , a computer program , in common with other works protected by intellectual property legislation , is the result of a creative intellectual human activity .
While its mode of expression or fixation may still be unfamiliar to many , the degree of creativity , skill and inventiveness required to devise a program make it no less deserving of protection than other works protected by copyright .
The fact that computer programs have utilitarian function does not change this .
2.3
These elements of creativity , skill and inventiveness manifest themselves in the way in which the program is elaborated .
The tasks to be performed by a computer program need to be defined and an analysis of the possible ways to achieve these results must be carried out .
A selection has been made of the various solutions and the steps to achieve the end result must be listed .
The way in which these steps are expressed gives the program its particular characteristics of speed , efficiency and even style .
A program has a structure , with sections and subsections , through which information flows .
In common with other literary works , the computer program also has an underlying logic in the presentation of the various steps .
2.4
These steps , the algorithms , from which the program is built up , should not be protected as such against unauthorized reproduction .
They are the equivalent of the words by which the poet or the novelist creates a work of literature , or the brushstrokes of the artist or the musical scales of the composer .
2.5
As with literary works in general , protection can only be envisaged for a computer program from the point at which the selection and compilation of these elements indicate the creativity and skill of the author , and set his work apart from that of other authors .
2.7
In practice , computer programs are rarely of such simplicity that authors will arrive at totally identical programs , independently of each other .
On the other hand many sub-routines which programmers habitually use in order to build up programs are in themselves commonplace in the industry and the originality of the program may lie in the selection and compilation of these otherwise commonplace programs .
2.8
The success of the program in terms of its ability to perform the task which is required will to a large extent be conditioned by these choices made by the author of the program at every step along the way .
This success will manifest itself in a program which is quicker , easier , more reliable , more comprehensive , more productive to use than its predecessors or its competitors . "
" 1.3 Copyright protects the expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves .
Therefore the protection given to computer programs will extend to the program as a whole , and to its constituent parts , in so far as they represent a sufficient degree of creativity to qualify as ' works ' in themselves .
The only criterion which should be applied to determine eligibility for protection is that of originality , that is , that the work has not been copied .
No other aesthetic or qualitative test should be applied .
Sub-routines and routines which go together to form modules which in turn form programs may all qualify for protection independently of the protection given to the program as a whole , that is , as a compilation of such elements .
The algorithms which go to make up the sub- routines are not normally in themselves capable of receiving protection under copyright insofar as they are similar in nature to mathematical formulae .
They may in exceptional circumstances attract patent protection .
Similarly , the ideas , principles , or logic which underlie the program will not be copyrightable .
1.4a Many algorithms and many sub-routines are commonplace in the industry .
They may have been placed or have fallen into the public domain or they may be de facto standard routines or algorithms .
Where a program is composed wholly or in part of such commonplace or unprotected algorithms and routines , it should nevertheless be protected as a compilation , provided that it is original in the above mentioned sense and that the creator demonstrated skill and labour in the creation of the compilation . "
" The proposal also takes up the clarification proposed by Parliament that preparatory design work leading to the development of a computer program is protected as a computer program provided the nature of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a later stage . "
This commentary formed the basis for recital [ 7 ] of the Software Directive .
Reproduction of a substantial part
" The first question to be determined is whether or to what extent copyright attaches to these coupons .
The respondents say that a coupon must be regarded as a single work and that as such it is protected by copyright .
The appellants seek to dissect the coupon .
They would not only dissect it into the 16 lists , but they would further dissect each list into heading , selection of matches , and statement of odds offered for the various kinds of bets .
They admit that there is copyright in the selection and in the statements of odds offered : they can safely do that because there they did not copy .
But they deny any copyright as regards the rest of the coupon .
The Copyright Act , 1956 , provides , by section 2 , that copyright shall subsist in every original literary work and , by section 48 , that literary work includes any written table or compilation .
I have no doubt that the coupon must be treated as a single compilation .
The appellants ' dissection theory is derived from some statements in infringement cases and I must , therefore , examine at this point the law regarding infringement .
Copyright gives the exclusive right to do certain things including ' reproducing the work in any material form ' ( section 2 ( 5 ) ) , and reproduction includes reproduction of a substantial part of the work ( section 49 ( 1 ) ) .
Broadly , reproduction means copying , and does not include cases where an author or compiler produces a substantially similar result by independent work without copying .
And , if he does copy , the question whether he has copied a substantial part depends much more on the quality than on the quantity of what he has taken .
One test may be whether the part which he has taken is novel or striking , or is merely a commonplace arrangement of ordinary words or well - known data .
So it may sometimes be a convenient short cut to ask whether the part taken could by itself be the subject of copyright .
But , in my view , that is only a short cut , and the more correct approach is first to determine whether the plaintiffs ' work as a whole is ' original ' and protected by copyright , and then to inquire whether the part taken by the defendant is substantial .
A wrong result can easily be reached if one begins by dissecting the plaintiffs ' work and asking , could section A be the subject of copyright if it stood by itself , could section B be protected if it stood by itself , and so on .
To my mind , it does not follow that , because the fragments taken separately would not be copyright , therefore the whole can not be .
Indeed , it has often been recognised that if sufficient skill and judgment have been exercised in devising the arrangements of the whole work , that can be an important or even decisive element in deciding whether the work as a whole is protected by copyright . "
" The exercise in dissection also , as it seems to me , involved two errors .
First , it ignored substantial parts of the judge 's findings on what had been copied and , secondly , it dealt with the copied features piece - meal instead of considering , as the judge had done , their cumulative effect . "
" The House of Lords decided in Ladbroke ( Football ) Ltd v William Hill ( Football ) Ltd [ 1964 ]
1 WLR 273 that the question of substantiality is a matter of quality rather than quantity .
The relevant passages are too well known to require citation : see Lord Reid , at p 276 , Lord Evershed , at p 283 , Lord Hodson , at p 288 and Lord Pearce , at p 293 .
But what quality is one looking for ?
That question , as it seems to me , must be answered by reference to the reason why the work is given copyright protection .
In literary copyright , for example , copyright is conferred ( irrespective of literary merit ) upon an original literary work .

Before you make your next impulse buy , you might ask yourself , “ Will this make me feel better or will it make me feel worse ? ”
Anytime we overspend , we succumb to a desire in the same way addicts do to their fix of choice .
Bold statement , but not if you think deeply about the way your purchases make you feel .
What was the last purchase you made that was n’t a necessity ?
How did it make you feel to buy it ?

Sexy and confident in that new pair of shoes ?
Sated for a moment by the Starbuck ’s latte ?
No one makes a purchase that is n’t a necessity unless it ’s something that makes him or her feel a certain way .
Problem is , the feeling never lasts .
When you give into emotions around an object , you find yourself right back at the Nordstrom ’s counter .
HALT : Hungry , Angry , Lonely and Tired
We can move past the feeling state to a state of action by stopping , taking a deep breath and taking a page from a twelve step program .
In this 12 step programs , participants adhere to the acronym HALT : Hungry , Angry , Lonely and Tired , whenever they feel an urge to use .
Have you ever bought a new outfit after a bad day at the office with the hope that it might put you in a better mood ?
Try HALT before you even walk in the store .
If I feel the urge to buy something outside of my budget , the first thing I think is , “ When was the last time I ate ? ”
If you ’re hungry , eat something .
If you ’re angry , let it out to a friend .
If you ’re lonely , reconnect with your people .
Make a call .
Or walk to your neighbor’s .
Take a nap if you ’re tired .
If you address basic needs first , you will be less apt to “ use ” your wallet .
Whenever I ’m invited to a party and I think I want a new outfit for it , I go through HALT .
Sometimes it requires reaching out to a girlfriend for a chat , or laying down on the couch and reading my People magazine .
Whatever it takes , I stop and take a breather until the desire passes .
Slowing down and replenishing my actual desires usually satisfies the urge I had to feel great by buying a new outfit .
When you perceive life is n’t going your way , saving and sticking to a budget can seem like an oppression you just want to escape .
But by noticing the desire behind your impulse , and putting it into action to meet actual your needs , you ’ll feel less apt to buy things you do n’t need or ca n’t afford .
Coffee with a girlfriend or taking a luxurious midday power nap can make you feel more restored than a new dress ever could .

( CNN ) -- Police in a Dallas , Texas , suburb indicated Wednesday that the town 's mayor likely killed her daughter before turning the weapon on herself .
The Dallas County Medical Examiner 's Officer ruled Wednesday that the mayor 's death was a suicide and her daughter 's a homicide .
Coppell Mayor Jayne Peters , 55 , and her daughter Mary Corinne Peters , 19 , were found dead Tuesday evening by officers who had been sent to check on the family 's welfare .
The officers had gone to the home at the request of the city manager 's office after the mayor did not show up for a scheduled council meeting .
" Earlier this afternoon , we received word from the Dallas County Medical Examiner 's Office that they had made a ruling in the deaths involving Mayor Peters and her daughter Corinne , " said Coppell Deputy Chief Steve Thomas .
" The pathologist advised that their ruling was that this was a homicide - suicide , which will change the focus of our investigation . "
CNN affiliate KTXA reported from a police briefing that officers found an envelope containing a note and a key to the two - story house on the front door and three other notes inside the house .
Thomas said that " it appeared to me there had been some thought behind all of this . "
The Dallas Morning News said the outside note warned officers of what they would find inside .
Police told the News the notes gave no clues as to what led to the shooting but rather provided instructions on , among other things , how to care for the family 's pets .
Two dogs were found in the house , the newspaper reported .
Friends and relatives told the News that Corinne was planning to attend the University of Texas in Austin .
Officers found Corinne Peters on the first floor of the house and the mayor upstairs , KTXA reported .
" This [ medical examiner 's ruling ] is obviously an important part of the investigation , but certainly it is not complete until the detectives here at the police department have the opportunity to go ahead and follow up any and all investigative leads they come across , " Thomas said .
The house 's front porch became a makeshift memorial of flowers and notes .
The medical examiner 's office said that Mayor Peters died of a " contact gunshot wound to the head , " and her daughter died of a " gunshot wound to the neck and head . "
Peters was elected mayor in May 2009 and had been a member of the city council since 1998 .
Her husband died of cancer in January 2008 .
Logan said that Peters ' death is a " tremendous loss both personally and professionally . "
" She was very pleasant , very professional , one of the most wonderful people I had ever encountered , " she told KTXA .
Coppell , 16 miles northwest of Dallas , has a population of 39,000 .
CNN 's Tracy Sabo contributed to this report .
Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff has launched a scathing attack on Netherlands ' display in the World Cup final , deriding it as " anti-football " .
The Dutch received nine yellow cards , and a red card for Johnny Heitinga , as they lost 1 - 0 to Spain in South Africa .
" Sadly , they played very dirty , " Cruyff told Spanish newspaper El Periodico .
" This ugly , vulgar , hard , hermetic , hardly eye - catching , hardly football style ...
If with this they got satisfaction , fine , but they lost . "
Cruyff was the symbol of ' Total Football ' , which earned the Dutch successive World Cup final appearances in 1974 and 1978 .
Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk appeared to opt for pragmatism over style as he led the Oranje to a third final in South Africa , but the result was the same , as Andres Iniesta scored an extra - time winner for Spain .
PAUL FLETCHER BLOG
There was a definite niggle between the two sets of players - and plenty of theatrics
But Sunday 's game was also notable for Netherlands ' surprisingly aggressive approach .
Cruyff , along with many others , believed Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong were lucky not to be sent off before half - time , Van Bommel for a tackle from behind on Iniesta and De Jong for kicking Xabi Alonso in the chest .
" They should have been down to nine immediately , then they made two [ such ] ugly and hard tackles that even I felt the damage , " said the 63 - year - old Cruyff .
" It hurts me that Holland chose an ugly path to aim for the title . "
Cruyff brought his footballing philosophy to Barcelona in an eight - year spell as manager , and he is widely credited with the one - touch passing style still employed by the Catalan club , who provided the backbone of Spain 's World Cup - winning squad .
However , in the Champions League semi-final last season , Pep Guardiola 's side were upset by a defence - minded Inter Milan , coached by Jose Mourinho - a fact not lost on Cruyff .
" On Thursday they asked me from Holland ' Can we play like Inter ?
Can we stop Spain in the same way Mourinho eliminated Barca ? '
" I said no , no way at all .
I said no , not because I hate this style , I said no because I thought that my country would n't dare to and would never renounce their style .
I said no because , without having great players like those of the past , the team has its own style .
" I was wrong .
Of course I 'm not hanging all 11 of them by the same rope , but almost .
They did n't want the ball . "
Cruyff also joined in the criticism of English referee Howard Webb , accusing him of being too soft with the players .
" A World Cup final deserves great refereeing and , above all , deserves a referee who dares to do everything it means to be a judge , " he said .

Olympische Winterspiele forcieren den Klimawandel – und kosten SEHR VIEL GELD
Unmittelbar vor dem Klimagipfel in Kopenhagen hatte Kanzlerin Merkel noch 1,26 Milliarden Euro für den Klimaschutz in Entwicklungsländern zugesagt .
Je 420 Mio. Euro sollten in den Jahren 2010 bis 2012 zusätzlich aufgebracht werden , um Entwicklungsländer bei der Anpassung an den Klimawandel zu unterstützen .
Nach den Haushaltsverhandlungen im März 2010 blieben davon nur noch drei mal 70 Mio. Euro übrig – jetzt werden wohl auch die den Sparmaßnahmen zum Opfer fallen .
Der Haushaltstitel „ Klimaschutzmaßnahmen in Entwicklungsländern “ soll für die kommenden zwei Jahre auf null gesetzt werden .
Kein Geld für Klimaschutz , aber für Olympische Winterspiele 2018 ? : Willy Bogner , der Geschäftsführer der Bewerbungsgesellschaft „ München 2018 “ für die Olympischen Winterspiele 2018 , droht mit seinem Rücktritt und fordert von der Politik mehr Geld für die Bewerbung : 20 Millionen hat diese Bewerbung schon gekostet – 30 Millionen Euro waren geplant , aber Sponsoren wollten nicht mehr zahlen .
Inzwischen ist schon von mehr als 40 Millionen die Rede .
Sollen die „ fehlenden “ 20 Millionen aus Steuergeldern kommen ?
Wohlgemerkt : Hier geht es nur um die Bewerbungskosten für „ München 2018 “ – mit München , Garmisch - Partenkirchen , Ohlstadt und Schönau am Königssee als umstrittene Austragungsorte .
Olympische Winterspiele forcieren den Klimawandel und kosten erst recht in ihrer Durchführung SEHR VIEL GELD :
Der Internationale Währungsfonds IMF warnt die Austragungsorte vor den Risiken 2018 .
Der amerikanische Wirtschaftsprofessor Andrew Zimbalist veröffentlichte im März 2010 in der IMF - Zeitschrift Finance & Development unter dem bezeichnenden Titel „ Ist es das wert ? “ eine Warnung an die Austragungsorte .
Er schilderte darin die vielfältigen Risiken für Olympische Sommer - und Winterspiele .
So mussten jeweils viele zusätzliche Milliarden Dollar an öffentlichen Geldern eingesetzt werden :
Defizitär waren die Spiele in Seoul ( 1988 ) , Barcelona ( 1992 : vier Mrd. Dollar Defizit ) ; Nagano ( 1998 : 11 Mrd. Dollar Defizit ) ; Sydney ( 2000 ) ; Athen ( 2004 : geschätzte Kosten 1,6 Mrd. Dollar , tatsächliche Kosten 16 Mrd. Dollar ; allein die Kosten für Sicherheit stiegen auf 1,4 Mrd. Dollar ) und Peking ( 2008 : geschätzte Kosten 1,6 Mrd. Dollar , tatsächliche Kosten mehr als 40 Mrd. Dollar ) .
Sotschi ( 2014 ) wurde zunächst mit 12 Mrd. Dollar angesetzt ; 2010 lag die Schätzung schon bei 33 Mrd. Dollar .
Für London ( 2012 ) waren ursprünglich weniger als 4 Mrd. Dollar angesetzt : Nun rechnet man mit 19 Mrd. Dollar .
Die zuständige Ministerin Tessa Jowell sagte bereits 2008 : „ Wenn wir gewusst hätten , was wir heute wissen , hätten wir uns dann um die Spiele beworben ?
Mit Sicherheit nicht . “
Zimbalist verwies noch auf die „ White Elephants “ , also Sportstätten , die für knapp drei Wochen Olympische Spiele plus Paralympics benötigt werden und danach nicht mehr – aber über Jahrzehnte hohe Unterhaltskosten verursachen .
So kostete die Bobbahn in Turin 108 Mill .
Dollar und verursacht jährlich hohe laufende Kosten für den Unterhalt ; sie ist seit den Spielen 2006 außer Betrieb .
Zimbalist kam zu dem Schluss : „ Denkt , bevor ihr euch bewerbt ! “
Die Bewerber für 2018 – Annecy , München und Pyeongchang – „ würden gut daran tun , sich vom unvermeidlichen olympischen Hype fernzuhalten und einen langen , harten und nüchternen Blick auf die langfristigen Entwicklungsziele ihrer Region zu richten “ .
As of this writing , one of the hot items on Reddit is a link to this image of a cover for an old book , Forth on the Atari : Learning by Using Forth …
( I ’ve been excited about programming languages , but the guy on the cover , judging by his shorts , takes excitement about Forth to a whole new level .
Or perhaps he ’s excited about his new pair programming partner . )
The Reddit entry was subtitled “ You ai n’t gonna find a Java book with a cover like this ” , which led me to ask “ What if more computer books had Boris Vallejo / Julie Bell - style paintings on their covers ? ”
In this article , I show some of my best guesses .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N was sued on Wednesday by a New Jersey company that accused it of stealing and using its trade secrets to make replacement laser printer cartridges , and threatening its survival .
In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court , Turbon International Inc alleged that Hewlett - Packard had promised in December 2008 to give it lucrative contracts to manufacture replacement cartridges , and later awarded it some contracts .
But the world ’s largest maker of personal computers and printers shelved these plans in January 2010 , after Turbon had “ methodically disclosed every intricate detail of its business , ” the complaint said .
Turbon said Hewlett - Packard gained a “ unique understanding ” of the importance of the availability of empty printer cartridges to its business , and further damaged it by pushing customers to instead recycle their cartridges .
“ Hewlett - Packard has sought to effectively crush Turbon , ” the complaint said .
“ Turbon ’s business is in peril and any further actions by Hewlett - Packard to use or disclose Turbon ’s confidential trade secret information would be fatal for Turbon and the remanufacturing industry as a whole . ”
Turbon is based in Cinnaminson , New Jersey , a suburb of Philadelphia .
According to its website , it is a unit of Germany 's Turbon AG TURG.DE , whose sales totaled 85.9 million euros ( $ 102.9 million ) in 2009 .
The lawsuit seeks damages for fraudulent inducement , misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition , a ban on the use of improperly obtained secrets , and other remedies .
Hewlett - Packard is based in Palo Alto , California , and did not immediately return requests for comment .
A lawyer for Turbon declined to elaborate on the complaint , including on the potential damages sought .
Shares of Hewlett - Packard closed Wednesday down 47 cents at $ 45.41 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The case is Turbon International Inc v. Hewlett - Packard Co , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York , No. 10-04540 .

Review articles Memory Models : A Case For Rethinking Parallel Languages and Hardware
IllustratIon by Gwen Vanhee
Most parallel programs today are written using threads and shared variables .
Although there is no consensus on parallel programming models , there are a number of reasons why threads remain popular .
Threads were already widely supported by mainstream operating systems well before the dominance of multicore , largely because they are also useful for other purposes .
Direct hardware support for shared - memory potentially provides a performance advantage ; for example , by implicitly sharing read - mostly data without the space overhead of complete replication .
The ability to pass memory references among threads makes it easier to share complex data structures .
Finally , shared - memory makes it far easier to selectively parallelize application hot spots without complete redesign of data structures .
The memory model , or memory consistency model , is at the heart of the concurrency semantics of a shared - memory program or system .
It defines the set of values that a read in a program is allowed to return , thereby defining the basic semantics of shared variables .
It answers questions such as : Is there enough synchronization to ensure a thread 's write will occur before another 's read ?
Can two threads write to adjacent fields in a memory location at the same time ?
Must the final value of a location always be one of those written to it ?
The memory model defines an interface between a program and any hardware or software that may transform that program ( for example , the compiler , the virtual machine , or any dynamic optimizer ) .
It is not possible to meaningfully reason about either a program ( written in a high - level , byte code , assembly , or machine language ) or any part of the language implementation ( including hardware ) without an unambiguous memory model .
A complex memory model makes parallel programs difficult to write , and parallel programming difficult to teach .
An overly constraining one may limit hardware and compiler optimization , severely reducing performance .
Since it is an interface property , the memory model decision has a long - lasting impact , affecting portability and maintainability of programs .
Thus , a hardware architecture committed to a strong memory model cannot later forsake it for a weaker model without breaking binary compatibility , and a new compiler release with a weaker memory model may require rewriting source code .
Finally , memory - model - related decisions for a single component must consider implications for the rest of the system .
A processor vendor cannot guarantee a strong hardware model if the memory system designer provides a weaker model ; a strong hardware model is not very useful to programmers using languages and compilers that provide only a weak guarantee .
Nonetheless , the central role of the memory model has often been downplayed .
This is partly because formally specifying a model that balances all desirable properties of programmability , performance , and portability has proven surprisingly complex .
At the same time , informal , machine - specific descriptions proved mostly adequate in an era where parallel programming was the domain of experts and achieving the highest possible performance trumped programmability or portability arguments .
In the late 1980s and 1990s , the area received attention primarily in the hardware community , which explored many approaches , with little consensus .
2
Commercial hardware memory model descriptions varied greatly in precision , including cases of complete omission of the topic and some reflecting vendors ' reluctance to make commitments with unclear future implications .
Although the memory model affects the meaning of every load instruction in every multithreaded application , it is still sometimes relegated to the " systems programming " section of the architecture manual .
Part of the challenge for hardware architects was the lack of clear memory models at the programming language level .
It was unclear what programmers expected hardware to do .
Although hardware researchers proposed approaches to bridge this gap, 3 widespread adoption required consensus from the software community .
Before 2000 , there were a few programming environments that addressed the issue with relative clarity , 40 but the most widely used environments had unclear and questionable specifications .
9,32
Even when specifications were relatively clear , they were often violated to obtain sufficient performance , 9 tended to be misunderstood even by experts , and were difficult to teach .
Since 2000 , we have been involved in efforts to cleanly specify programming - language - level memory models , first for Java and then C++ , with efforts now under way to adopt similar models for C and other languages .
In the process , we had to address issues created by hardware that had evolved without the benefit of a clear programming model .
This often made it difficult to reconcile the need for a simple and usable programming model with that for adequate performance on existing hardware .
Today , these languages and most hardware vendors have published ( or plan to publish ) compatible memory model specifications .
Although this convergence is a dramatic improvement over the past , it has exposed fundamental shortcomings in our parallel languages and their interplay with hardware .
After decades of research , it is still unacceptably difficult to describe what value a load can return without compromising modern safety guarantees or implementation methodologies .
To us , this experience has made it clear that solving the memory model problem will require a significantly new and cross - disciplinary research direction for parallel computing languages , hardware , and environments as a whole .
This article discusses the path that led to the current convergence in memory models , the fundamental shortcomings it exposed , and the implications for future research .
The central role of the memory model in parallel computing makes this article relevant to many computer science subdisciplines , including algorithms , applications , languages , compilers , formal methods , software engineering , virtual machines , runtime systems , and hardware .
For practitioners and educators , we provide a succinct summary of the state of the art of this often - ignored and poorly understood topic .
For researchers , we outline an ambitious , cross- disciplinary agenda toward resolving a fundamental problem in parallel computing todaywhat value can a shared variable have and how to implement it ?

Sequential Consistency
A natural view of the execution of a multithreaded program operating on shared variables is as follows .
Each step in the execution consists of choosing one of the threads to execute , and then performing the next step in that thread 's execution ( as dictated by the thread 's program text , or program order ) .
This process is repeated until the program as a whole terminates .
Effectively , the execution can be viewed as taking all the steps executed by each thread , and interleaving them in some way .
Whenever an object ( that is , variable , field , or array element ) is accessed , the last value stored to the object by this interleaved sequence is retrieved .
For example , consider Figure 1 , which gives the core of Dekker 's mutual exclusion algorithm .
The program can be executed by interleaving the steps from the two threads in many ways .
Formally , each of these interleavings is a total order over all the steps performed by all the threads , consistent with the program order of each thread .
Each access to a shared variable " sees " the last prior value stored to that variable in the interleaving .
Figure 2 gives three possible executions that together illustrate all possible final values of the non-shared variables r1 and r2 .
Although many other inter-leavings are also possible , it is not possible that both r1 and r2 are 0 at the end of an execution ; any execution must start with the first statement of one of the two threads , and the variable assigned there will later be read as one .
Following Lamport , 26 an execution that can be understood as such an interleaving is referred to as sequentially consistent .
Sequential consistency gives us the simplest possible meaning for shared variables , but suffers from several related flaws .
First , sequential consistency can be expensive to implement .
For Figure 1 , a compiler might , for example , reorder the two independent assignments in the red thread , since scheduling loads early tends to hide the load latency .
In addition , modern processors almost always use a store buffer to avoid waiting for stores to complete , also effectively reordering instructions in each thread .
Both the compiler and hardware optimization make an outcome of r1 == 0 and r2 == 0 possible , and hence may result in a non-sequentially consistent execution .
Overall , reordering any pair of accesses , reading values from write buffers , register promotion , common subexpression elimination , redundant read elimination , and many other hardware and compiler optimizations commonly used in uniprocessors can potentially violate sequential consistency .
2
There is some work on compiler analysis to determine when such transformations are unsafe ( for example , Shasha and Snir37 ) .
Compilers , however , often have little information about sharing between threads , making it expensive to forego the optimizations , since we would have to forego them everywhere .
There is also much work on speculatively performing these optimizations in hardware , with rollback on detection of an actual sequential consistency violation ( for example , Ceze et al.14 and Gharachorloo et al.21 ) .
However , these ideas are tied to specific implementation techniques ( for example , aggressive speculation support ) , and vendors have generally been unwilling to commit to those for the long term ( especially , given non-sequentially consistent compilers ) .
Thus , most hardware and compilers today do not provide sequential consistency .
Second , while sequential consistency may seem to be the simplest model , it is not sufficiently simple and a much less useful programming model than commonly imagined .
For example , it only makes sense to reason about interleaving steps if we know what those steps are .
In this case , they are typically individual memory accesses , a very low - level notion .
Consider two threads concurrently assigning values of 100,000 and 60,000 to the shared variable X on a machine that accesses memory 16 bits at a time .
The final value of X in a " sequentially consistent " execution may be 125,536 if the assignment of 60,000 occurred between the bottom and top half of the assignment of 100,000 .
At a somewhat higher level , this implies the meaning of even simple library operations depends on the granularity at which the library carries out those operations .
More generally , programmers do not reason about correctness of parallel code in terms of interleavings of individual memory accesses , and sequential consistency does not prevent common sources of concurrency bugs arising from simultaneous access to the same shared data ( for example , data races ) .
Even with sequential consistency , such simultaneous accesses can remain dangerous , and should be avoided , or at least explicitly highlighted .
Relying on sequential consistency without such highlighting both obscures the code , and greatly complicates the implementation 's job .
Back to Top
Data - Race - Free
We can avoid both of the problems mentioned here by observing that :
The problematic transformations ( for example , reordering accesses to unrelated variables in Figure 1 ) never change the meaning of single - threaded programs , but do affect multithreaded programs ( for example , by allowing both r1 and r2 to be 0 in Figure 1 ) .
These transformations are detectable only by code that allows two threads to access the same data simultaneously in conflicting ways ; for example , one thread writes the data and another reads it .
Programming languages generally already provide synchronization mechanisms , such as locks , or possibly transactional memory , for limiting simultaneous access to variables by different threads .
If we require that these be used correctly , and guarantee sequential consistency only if no undesirable concurrent accesses are present , we avoid the above issues .
We can make this more precise as follows .
We assume the language allows distinguishing between synchronization and ordinary ( non-synchronization or data ) operations ( see below ) .
We say that two memory operations conflict if they access the same memory location ( for example , variable or array element ) , and at least one is a write .
We say that a program ( on a particular input ) allows a data race if it has a sequentially consistent execution ( that is , a program - ordered interleaving of operations of the individual threads ) in which two conflicting ordinary operations execute " simultaneously . "
For our purposes , two operations execute " simultaneously " if they occur next to each other in the interleaving and correspond to different threads .
Since these operations occur adjacently in the interleaving , we know that they could equally well have occurred in the opposite order ; there are no intervening operations to enforce the order .
To ensure that two conflicting ordinary operations do not happen simultaneously , they must be ordered by intervening synchronization operations .
For example , one thread must release a lock after accessing a shared variable , and the other thread must acquire the lock before its access .
Thus , it is also possible to define data races as conflicting accesses not ordered by synchronization , as is done in Java .
These definitions are essentially equivalent .
1,12
A program that does not allow a data race is said to be data - race - free .
The data - race - free model guarantees sequential consistency only for data - race - free programs .
1,3
For programs that allow data races , the model does not provide any guarantees .
The restriction on data races is not onerous .
In addition to locks for avoiding data races , modern programming languages generally also provide a mechanism , such as Java 's volatile variables , for declaring that certain variables or fields are to be used for synchronization between threads .
Conflicting accesses to such variables may occur simultaneouslysince they are explicitly identified as synchronization ( vs. ordinary ) , they do not create a data race .
To write Figure 1 correctly under data - race - free , we need simply identify the shared variables X and Y as synchronization variables .
This would require the implementation to do whatever is necessary to ensure sequential consistency , in spite of those simultaneous accesses .
It would also obligate the implementation to ensure that these synchronization accesses are performed indivisibly ; if a 32 - bit integer is used for synchronization purposes , it should not be visibly accessed as two 16 - bit halves .
This " sequential consistency for data - race - free programs " approach alleviates the problems discussed with pure sequential consistency .
Most important hardware and compiler optimizations continue to be allowed for ordinary accessescare must be taken primarily at the explicitly identified ( infrequent ) synchronization accesses since these are the only ones through which such optimizations and granularity considerations affect program outcome .
Further , synchronization - free sections of the code appear to execute atomically and the requirement to explicitly identify concurrent accesses makes it easier for humans and compilers to understand the code .
( For more detail , see our technical report .
11 )
Data - race - free does not give the implementation a blanket license to perform single - threaded program optimizations .
In particular , optimizations that amount to copying a shared variable to itself ; such as , introducing the assignment x = x , where x might not otherwise have been written , generally remain illegal .
These are commonly performed in certain contexts , 9 but should not be .
Although data - race - free was formally proposed in 1990,3 it did not see widespread adoption as a formal model in industry until recently .
We next describe the evolution of industry models to a convergent path centered around data - race - free , the emergent shortcomings of data - race - free , and their implications for the future .

Industry Practice and Evolution
Hardware memory models .
Most hardware supports relaxed models that are weaker than sequential consistency .
These models take an implementation - or performance - centric views , where the desirable hardware optimizations drive the model specification .
1,2,20 Typical driving optimizations relax the program order requirement of sequential consistency .
For example , Sparc 's TSO guarantees that a thread 's memory accesses will become visible to other threads in program order , except for the case of a write followed by a read .
Such models additionally provide fence instructions to enable programmers to explicitly impose orderings that are otherwise not guaranteed ; for example , TSO programmers may insert a fence between a thread 's write and read to ensure the execution preserves that order .
Such a program - orderings + fences style of specification is simple , but many subtleties make it inadequate .
1,2 First , this style implies that a write is an atomic or indivisible operation that becomes visible to all threads at once .
As Figure 3 illustrates , however , hardware may make writes visible to different threads at different times through write buffers and shared caches .
Incorporating such optimizations increases the complexity of the memory model specification .
Thus , the full TSO specification , which incorporates one of the simplest atomicity optimizations , is much more involved than the simple description here .
PowerPC implements more aggressive forms of the optimization , with a specification that is complex and difficult to interpret even for experts .
The x86 documentation from both AMD and Intel was ambiguous on this issue ; recent updates now clarify the intent , but remain informal .
Second , in well - written software , a thread usually relies on synchronization interactions to reason about the ordering or visibility of memory accesses on other threads .
Thus , it is usually overkill to require that two program - ordered accesses always become visible to all threads in the same order or a write appears atomic to all threads regardless of the synchronization among the threads .
Instead , it is sufficient to preserve ordering and atomicity only among mutually synchronizing threads .
Some hardware implementations attempt to exploit this insight , albeit often through ad hoc techniques , thereby further complicating the memory model .
Third , modern processors perform various forms of speculation ( for example , on branches and addresses ) which can result in subtle and complex interactions with data and control dependences , as illustrated in Figure 4.1,29 Incorporating these considerations in a precise way adds another source of complexity to program - order + fence style specifications .
As we discuss later , precise formalization of data and control dependences is a fundamental obstacle to providing clean high - level memory model specifications today .
In summary , hardware memory model specifications have often been incomplete , excessively complex , and / or ambiguous enough to be misinterpreted even by experts .
Further , since hardware models have largely been driven by hardware optimizations , they have often not been well - matched to software requirements , resulting in incorrect code or unnecessary loss in performance , as discussed later .
High - level language memory models .
Ada was perhaps the first widely used high - level programming language to provide first - class support for shared - memory parallel programming .
Although Ada 's approach to thread synchronization was initially quite different from both that of the earlier Mesa design and most later language designs , it was remarkably advanced in its treatment of memory semantics .
40
It used a style similar to data - race - free , requiring legal programs to be well - synchronized ; however , it did not fully formalize the notion of well - synchronized and left uncertain the behavior of such programs .
Subsequently , until the introduction of Java , mainstream programming languages did not provide first - class support for threads , and shared - memory programming was mostly enabled through libraries and APIs such as Posix threads and OpenMP .
Previous work describes why the approach of an add - on threads library is not entirely satisfactory .
9
Without a real definition of the programming language in the context of threads , it is unclear what compiler transformations are legal , and hence what the programmer is allowed to assume .
Nevertheless , the Posix threads specification indicates a model similar to data - race - free , although there are several inconsistent aspects , with widely varying interpretations even among experts participating in standards committee discussions .
The OpenMP model is also unclear and largely based on a flush instruction that is analogous to fence instructions in hardware models , with related shortcomings .
Hardware memory model specifications have often been incomplete , excessively complex , and / or ambiguous enough to be misinterpreted even by experts .
The Java memory model .
Java provided first - class support for threads with a chapter specifically devoted to its memory model .
Pugh showed that this model was difficult to interpret and badly brokencommon compiler optimizations were prohibited and in many cases the model gave ambiguous or unexpected behavior .
32
In 2000 , Sun appointed an expert group to revise the model through the Java community process .
33
The effort was coordinated through an open mailing list that attracted a variety of participants , representing hardware and software and researchers and practitioners .
It was quickly decided that the Java memory model must provide sequential consistency for data - race - free programs , where volatile accesses ( and locks from synchronized methods and monitors ) were deemed synchronization .
However , data - race - free is inadequate for Java .
Since Java is meant to be a safe and secure language , it cannot allow arbitrary behavior for data races .
Specifically , Java must support untrusted code running as part of a trusted application and hence must limit damage done by a data race in the untrusted code .
Unfortunately , the notions of safety , security , and " limited damage " in a multithreaded context were not clearly defined .
The challenge with defining the Java model was to formalize these notions in a way that minimally affected system flexibility .
Figure 4 ( b ) illustrates these issues .
The program has a data race and is buggy .
However , Java cannot allow its reads to return values out - of - thin - air ( for example , 42 ) since this could clearly compromise safety and security .
It would , for example , make it impossible to guarantee that similar untrusted code cannot return a password that it should not have access to .
Such a scenario appears to violate any reasonable causality expectation and no current processor produces it .
Nevertheless , the memory model must formally prohibit such behavior so that future speculative processors also avoid it .
Prohibiting such causality violations in a way that does not also prohibit other desired optimizations turned out to be surprisingly difficult .
Figure 5 illustrates an example that also appears to violate causality , but is allowed by the common compiler optimization of redundant read elimination .
29
After many proposals and five years of spirited debate , the current model was approved as the best compromise .
This model allows the outcome of Figure 5 , but not that of Figure 4 ( b ) .
Unfortunately , this model is very complex , was known to have some surprising behaviors , and has recently been shown to have a bug .
We provide intuition for the model below and refer the reader to Manson et al.26 for a full description .
Common to both Figure 4 ( b ) and Figure 5 are writes that are executed earlier than they would be with sequential consistency .
The examples differ in that for the speculative write in the latter ( Y=1 ) , there is some sequentially consistent execution where it is executed ( the execution where both reads of X return 0 ) .
For Figure 4 ( b ) , there is no sequentially consistent execution where Y=42 could occur .
This notion of whether a speculative write could occur in some well - behaved execution is the basis of causality in the Java model , and the definition of well - behaved is the key source of complexity .
The Java model tests for the legality of an execution by " committing " one or more of its memory accesses at a timelegality requires all accesses to commit ( in any order ) .
Committing a write early ( before its turn in program order ) requires it to occur in a well - behaved execution where ( informally ) the already committed accesses have similar synchronization and data race relationships in all previously used wellbehaved executions , and the to - be committed write is not dependent on a read that returns its value from a data race .
These conditions ensure that a future data race will never be used to justify a speculative write that could then later justify that future data race .
A key reason for the complexity in the Java model is that it is not operationalan access in the future can determine whether the current access is legal .
Further , many possible future executions must be examined to determine this legality .
The choice of future ( well - behaved ) executions also gives some surprising results .
In particular , as discussed in Manson29 if the code of one thread is " inlined " in ( concatenated with ) another thread , then the inlined code can produce more behaviors than the original .
Thus , thread inlining is generally illegal under the Java model ( even if there are no synchronization - and deadlock - related considerations ) .
In practice , the prohibited optimizations are difficult to implement and this is not a significant performance limitation .
The behavior , however , is nonintuitive , with other implicationsit occurs because some data races in the original code may no longer be data races in the inlined code .
This means that when determining whether to commit a write early , a read in a well - behaved execution has more choices to return values than before ( since there are fewer data races ) , resulting in new behaviors .
More generally , increasing synchronization in the Java model can actually result in new behaviors , even though more synchronization conventionally constrains possible executions .
Recently , it has been shown that , for similar reasons , adding seemingly irrelevant reads or removing redundant reads sometimes can also add new behaviors , and that all these properties have more serious implications than previously thought .
36
In particular , some optimizations that were intended to be allowed by the Java model are in fact prohibited by the current specification .
It is unclear if current hardware or JVMs implement the problematic optimizations noted here and therefore violate the current Java model .
Certainly the current specification is much improved over the original .
Regardless , the situation is still far from satisfactory .
First , clearly , the current specification does not meet its desired intent of having certain common optimizing transformations preserve program meaning .
Second , its inherent complexity and the new observations make it difficult to prove the correctness of any real system .
Third , the specification methodology is inherently fragilesmall changes usually result in hard - to - detect unintended consequences .
The Java model was largely guided by an emergent set of test cases ,33 based on informal code transformations that were or were not deemed desirable .
While it may be possible to fix the Java model , it seems undesirable that our specification of multithreaded program behavior would rest on such a complex and fragile foundation .
Instead , the section entitled " Implications for Languages " advocates a fundamental rethinking of our approach .
The C++ memory model .
The situation in C++ was significantly different from Java .
The language itself provided no support for threads .
Nonetheless , they were already in widespread use , typically with the addition of a library - based threads implementation , such as pthreads22 or the corresponding Microsoft Windows facilities .
Unfortunately the relevant specifications , for example the combination of the C or C++ standard with the Posix standard , left significant uncertainties about the rules governing shared variables .
9
This made it unclear to compiler writers precisely what they needed to implement , resulted in very occasional failures for which it was difficult to assign blame to any specific piece of the implementation and , most importantly , made it difficult to teach parallel programming since even the experts were unable to agree on some of the basic rules , such as whether Figure 4 ( a ) constitutes a data race .
( Correct answer : No. )
Motivated by these observations , we began an effort in 2005 to develop a proper memory model for C ++.
The resulting effort eventually expanded to include the definition of atomic ( synchronization , analogous to Java volatile ) operations , and the threads API itself .
It is part of the current Committee Draft24 for the next C++ revision .
The next C standard is expected to contain a very similar memory model , with very similar atomic operations .
This development took place in the face of increasing doubt that a Java - like memory model relying on sequential consistency for data - race - free programs was efficiently implementable on mainstream architectures , at least given the specifications available at the time .
Largely as a result , much of the early discussion focused on the tension between the following two observations , both of which we still believe to be correct given existing hardware :
A programming language model weaker than data - race - free is probably unusable by a large fraction of the programming community .
Earlier work 10 points out , for example , that even thread library implementors often get confused when it comes to dealing explicitly with memory ordering issues .
Substantial effort was invested in attempts to develop weaker , but comparably simple and usable models .
We do not feel these were successful .
points out , for example , that even thread library implementors often get confused when it comes to dealing explicitly with memory ordering issues .
Substantial effort was invested in attempts to develop weaker , but comparably simple and usable models .
We do not feel these were successful .
On some architectures , notably on some PowerPC implementations , data - race - free involves substantial implementation cost .
( In light of modern ( 2009 ) specifications , the cost on others , notably x86 , is modest , and limited largely to atomic ( C++ ) or volatile ( Java ) store operations . )
This resulted in a compromise memory model that supports data - race - free for nearly all of the language .
However , atomic data types also provide low - level operations with explicit memory ordering constraints that blatantly violate sequential consistency , even in the absence of data races .
The low - level operations are easily identified and can be easily avoided by non-expert programmers .
( They require an explicit memory_order_ argument . )
But they do give expert programmers a way to write very carefully crafted , but portable , synchronization code that approaches the performance of assembly code .
Since C++ does not support sandboxed code execution , the C++ draft standard can and does leave the semantics of a program with data races completely undefined , effectively making it erroneous to write such programs .
As we point out in Boehm and Adve12 this has a number of ( mostly ) performance - related advantages , and better reflects existing compiler implementations .
In addition to the issues raised in the " Lessons Learned " section , it should be noted that this really only pushes Java 's issues with causality into a much smaller and darker corner of the specification ; exactly the same issues arise if we rewrite Figure 4 ( b ) with C++ atomic variables and use low - level memory_order_relaxed operations .
Our current solution to this problem is simpler , but as inelegant as the Java one .
Unlike Java , it affects a small number of fairly esoteric library calls , not all memory accesses .
As with the Java model , we feel that although this solution involves compromises , it is an important step forward .
It clearly establishes data - race - free as the core guarantee that every programmer should understand .
It defines precisely what constitutes a data race .
It finally resolves simple questions such as : If x.a and x.b are assigned simultaneously , is that a data race ?
( No , unless they are part of the same contiguous sequence of bit- fields . )
By doing so , it clearly identifies shortcomings of existing compilers that we can now begin to remedy .
Reconciling language and hardware models .
Throughout this process , it repeatedly became clear that current hardware models and supporting fence instructions are often at best a marginal match for programming language memory models , particularly in the presence of Java volatile fields or C++ atomic objects .
It is always possible to implement such synchronization variables by mapping each one to a lock , and acquiring and releasing the corresponding lock around all accesses .
However , this typically adds an overhead of hundreds of cycles to each access , particularly since the lock accesses are likely to result in coherence cache misses , even when only read accesses are involved .
Volatile and atomic variables are typically used to avoid locks for exactly these reasons .
A typical use is a flag that indicates a read - only data structure has been lazily initialized .
Since the initialization has to happen only once , nearly all accesses simply read the atomic / volatile flag and avoid lock acquisitions .
Acquiring a lock to access the flag defeats the purpose .
On hardware that relaxes write atomicity ( see Figure 3 ) , however , it is often unclear that more efficient mappings ( than the use of locks ) are possible ; even the fully fenced implementation may not be sequentially consistent .
Even on other hardware , there are apparent mismatches , most probably caused by the lack of a well - understood programming language model when the hardware was designed .
On x86 , it is almost sufficient to map synchronization loads and stores directly to ordinary load and store instructions .
The hardware provides sufficient guarantees to ensure that ordinary memory operations are not visibly reordered with synchronization operations .
However it fails to prevent reordering of a synchronization store followed by a synchronization load ; thus this implementation does not prevent the incorrect outcome for Figure 1 .
This may be addressed by translating a synchronization store to an ordinary store instruction followed by an expensive fence .
The sole purpose of this fence is to prevent reordering of the synchronization store with a subsequent synchronization load .
In practice , such a synchronization load is unlikely to follow closely enough ( Dekker 's algorithm is not commonly used ) to really constrain the hardware .
But the only available fence instruction constrains all memory reordering around it , including that involving ordinary data accesses , and thus overly constrains the hardware .
A better solution would involve distinguishing between two flavors of loads and stores ( ordinary and synchronization ) , roughly along the lines of Itanium 's ld.acq and st.rel .23
This , however , requires a change to the instruction set architecture , usually a difficult proposition .
We suspect the current situation makes the fence instruction more expensive than necessary , in turn motivating additional language - level complexity such as C++ low - level atomics or lazy Set ( ) in Java .

Data - race - free provides a simple and consistent model for threads and shared variables .
We are convinced it is the best model today to target during initial software development .
Unfortunately , its lack of any guarantees in the presence of data races and mismatch with current hardware implies three significant weaknesses :
Debugging .
Accidental introduction of a data race results in " undefined behavior , " which often takes the form of surprising results later during program execution , possibly long after the data race has resulted in corrupted data .
Although the usual immediate result of a data race is that an unexpected , and perhaps incomplete value is read , or that an inconsistent value is written , we point out in prior work 12 that other results , such as wild branches , are also possible as a result of compiler optimizations that mistakenly assume the absence of data races .
Since such races are difficult to reproduce , the root cause of such misbehavior is often difficult to identify , and such bugs may easily take weeks to track down .
Many tools to aid such debugging ( for example , CHESS30 and RaceFuzzer35 ) also assume sequential consistency , somewhat limiting their utility .
Synchronization variable performance on current hardware .
As discussed , ensuring sequential consistency in the presence of Java volatile or C++ atomic on current hardware can be expensive .
As a result , both C++ , and to a lesser extent Java , have had to provide less expensive alternatives that greatly complicate the model for experts trying to use them .
Untrusted code .
There is no way to ensure data - race - freedom in untrusted code .
Thus , this model is insufficient for languages like Java .
An unequivocal lesson from our experiences is that for programs with data races , it is very difficult to define semantics that are easy to understand and yet retain desired system flexibility .
While the Java memory model came a long way , its complexity , and subsequent discoveries of its surprising behaviors , are far from satisfying .
Unfortunately , we know of no alternative specification that is sufficiently simple to be considered practical .
Second , rules to weaken the data - race - free guarantee to better match current hardware , as through C++ low - level atomics , are also more complex than we would like .
The only clear path to improvement here seems to be to eliminate the need for going beyond the data - race - free guarantee by :
Eliminating the performance motivations for going beyond it , and
Ensuring that data races are never actually executed at runtime , thus both avoiding the need to specify their behavior and greatly simplifying or eliminating the debugging issues associated with data races .
Unfortunately , these both take us to active research areas , with no clear off - the - shelf solutions .
We discuss some possible approaches here .

Implications for Languages
In spite of the dramatic convergence in the debate on memory models , the state of the art imposes a difficult choice : a language that supposedly has strong safety and security properties , but no clear definition of what value a shared - memory read may return ( the Java case ) , versus a language with clear semantics , but that requires abandoning security properties promised by languages such as Java ( the C++ case ) .
Unfortunately , modern software needs to be both parallel and secure , and requiring a choice between the two should not be acceptable .
A pessimistic view would be to abandon shared - memory altogether .
However , the intrinsic advantages of a global address space are , at least anecdotally , supported by the widespread use of threads despite the inherent challenges .
We believe the fault lies not in the global address space paradigm , but in the use of undisciplined or " wild shared - memory , " permitted by current systems .
Data - race - free was a first attempt to formalize a shared - memory discipline via a memory model .
It proved inadequate because the responsibility for following this discipline was left to the programmer .
Further , data - race - free by itself is , arguably , insufficient as a discipline for writing correct , easily debuggable , and maintainable shared - memory code ; for example , it does not completely eliminate atomicity violations or non-deterministic behavior .
Moving forward , we believe a critical research agenda to enable " parallelism for the masses " is to develop and promote disciplined shared - memory models that :
are simple enough to be easily teachable to undergraduates ; that is , minimally provide sequential consistency to programs that obey the required discipline ;
enough to be easily teachable to undergraduates ; that is , minimally provide sequential consistency to programs that obey the required discipline ; enable the enforcement of the discipline ; that is , violations of the discipline should not have undefined or horrendously complex semantics , but should be caught and returned back to the programmer as illegal ;
of the discipline ; that is , violations of the discipline should not have undefined or horrendously complex semantics , but should be caught and returned back to the programmer as illegal ; are general - purpose enough to express important parallel algorithms and patterns ; and
important parallel algorithms and patterns ; and enable high and scalable performance .
Many previous programmer - productivity - driven efforts have sought to raise the level of abstraction with threads ; for example , Cilk , 19 TBB,25 OpenMP,39 the recent HPCS languages , 28 other highlevel libraries , frameworks , and APIs such as java.util.concurrent and the C++ boost libraries , as well as more domain - specific ones .
While these solutions go a long way toward easing the pain of orchestrating parallelism , our memory - models driven argument deeperwe argue that , at least so far , it is not possible to provide reasonable semantics for a language that allows data races , an arguably more fundamental problem .
In fact , all of these examples either provide unclear models or suffer from the same limitations as C++/ Java .
These approaches , therefore , do not meet our enforcement requirement .
Similarly , transactional memory provides a high - level mechanism for atomicity , but the memory model in the presence of non-transactional code faces the same issues as described here .
38
At the heart of our agenda of disciplined models are the questions :
What is the appropriate discipline ?
How to enforce it ?
A near - term transition path is to continue with data - race - free and focus research on its enforcement .
The ideal solution is for the language to eliminate data races by design ( for example , Boyapati13 ) ; however , our semantics difficulties are avoided even with dynamic techniques ( for example , Elmas et al. ,17 Flanagan and Freund , 18 or Lucia et al.27 ) that replace all data races with exceptions .
( There are other dynamic data race detection techniques , primarily for debugging , but they do not guarantee complete accuracy , as required here . )
A longer - term direction concerns both the appropriate discipline and its enforcement .
A fundamental challenge in debugging , testing , and reasoning about threaded programs arises from their inherent non-determinisman execution may exhibit one of many possible interleavings of its memory accesses .
In contrast , many applications written for performance have deterministic outcomes and can be expressed with deterministic algorithms .
Writing such programs using a deterministic environment allows reasoning with sequential semantics ( a memory model much simpler than sequential consistency with threads ) .
Data - race - free provides a simple and consistent model for threads and shared variables .
We are convinced that it is the best model today to target during initial software development .
A valuable discipline , therefore , is to provide a guarantee of determinism by default ; when non-determinism is inherently required , it should be requested explicitly and should not interfere with the deterministic guarantees for the remaining program .
7
There is much prior work in deterministic data parallel , functional , and actor languages .
Our focus is on general - purpose efforts that continue use of widespread programming practices ; for example , global address space , imperative languages , object - oriented programming , and complex , pointer - based data structures .
Language - based approaches with such goals include Jade34 and the recent Deterministic Parallel Java ( DPJ ) .8
In particular , DPJ proposes a region - based type and effect system for deterministic - by - default semantics " regions " name disjoint partitions of the heap and per-method effect annotations summarize which regions are read and written by each method .
Coupled with a disciplined parallel control structure , the compiler can easily use the effect summaries to ensure that there are no unordered conflicting accesses and the program is deterministic .
Recent results show that DPJ is applicable to a range of applications and complex data structures and provides performance comparable to threads code .
8
There has also been much recent progress in runtime methods for determinism .
4,5,16,31
Both language and runtime approaches have pros and cons and still require research before mainstream adoption .
A language - based approach must establish that it is expressive enough and does not incur undue programmer burden .
For the former , the new techniques are promising , but the jury is still out .
For the latter , DPJ is attempting to alleviate the burden by using a familiar base language ( currently Java ) and providing semiautomatic tools to infer the required programmer annotations .
41 Further , language annotations such as DPJ 's read / write effect summaries are valuable documentation in their own rightthey promote lifetime benefits for modularity and maintainability , arguably compensating for upfront programmer effort .
Finally , a static approach benefits from no overhead or surprises at runtime .
In contrast , the purely runtime approaches impose less burden on the programmer , but a disadvantage is that the overheads in some cases may still be too high .
Further , inherently , a runtime approach does not provide the guarantees of a static approach before shipping and is susceptible to surprises in the field .
We are optimistic that the recent approaches have opened up many promising new avenues for disciplined shared - memory that can overcome the problems described here .
It is likely that a final solution will consist of a judicious combination of language and runtime features , and will derive from a rich line of future research .

Implications for Hardware
As discussed earlier , current hardware memory models are an imperfect match for even current software ( data - race - free ) memory models .
ISA changes to identify individual loads and stores as synchronization can alleviate some short - term problems .
An established ISA , however , is difficult to change , especially when existing code works mostly adequately and there is not enough experience to document the benefits of the change .
Academic researchers have taken an alternate path that uses complex mechanisms ( for example , Blundell et al.6 ) to speculatively remove the constraints imposed by fences , rolling back the speculation when it is detected that the constraints were actually needed .
While these techniques have been shown to work well , they come at an implementation cost and do not directly confront the root of the problem of mismatched hardware / software views of concurrency semantics .
Taking a longer - term perspective , we believe a more fundamental solution to the problem will emerge with a co-designed approach , where future multicore hardware research evolves in concert with the software models research discussed in " Implications for Languages . "
The current state of hardware technology makes this a particularly opportune time to embark on such an agenda .
Power and complexity constraints have led industry to bet that future single - chip performance increases will largely come from increasing numbers of cores .
Today 's hardware cache - coherent multicore designs , however , are optimized for few corespower - efficient , performance scaling to several hundreds or a thousand cores without consideration of software requirements will be difficult .
We believe that hardware that takes advantage of the emerging disciplined software programming models is likely to be more efficient than a software oblivious approach .
We view this challenge as an opportunity to not only resolve the problems discussed in this article , but in doing so , we expect to build more effective hardware and software .
First , we believe that hardware that takes advantage of the emerging disciplined software programming models is likely to be more efficient than a software - oblivious approach .
This observation already underlies the work on relaxed hardware consistency modelswe hope the difference this time around will be that the software and hardware models will evolve together rather than as retrofits for each other , providing more effective solutions .
Second , hardware research to support the emerging disciplined software models is also likely to be critical .
Hardware support can be used for efficient enforcement of the required discipline when static approaches fall short ; for example , through directly detecting violations of the discipline and / or through effective strategies to sandbox untrusted code .
Along these lines , we have recently begun the DeNovo hardware project at Illinois15 in concert with DPJ .
We are exploiting DPJ - like region and effect annotations to design more power - and complexity - efficient , software - driven communication and coherence protocols and task scheduling mechanisms .
We also plan to provide hardware and runtime support to deal with cases where DPJ 's static information and analysis might fall short .
As such co-designed models emerge , ultimately , we expect them to drive the future hardware - software interface including the ISA .

Conclusion
This article gives a perspective based on work collectively spanning approximately 30 years .
We have been repeatedly surprised at how difficult it is to formalize the seemingly simple and fundamental property of " what value a read should return in a multithreaded program . "
Sequential consistency for data - race - free programs appears to be the best we can do at present , but it is insufficient .
The inability to define reasonable semantics for programs with data races is not just a theoretical shortcoming , but a fundamental hole in the foundation of our languages and systems .
It is well accepted that most shipped software has bugs and it is likely that much commercial multithreaded software has data races .
Debugging tools and safe languages that seek to sandbox untrusted code must deal with such races , and must be given semantics that reasonable computer science graduates and developers can understand .
We believe it is time to rethink how we design our languages and systems .
Minimally , the system , and preferably the language , must enforce the absence of data races .
A longer term , potentially more rewarding strategy is to rethink higher - level disciplines that make it much easier to write parallel programs and that can be enforced by our languages and systems .
We also believe some of the messiness of memory models today could have been averted with closer cooperation between hardware and software .
As we move toward more disciplined programming models , there is also a new opportunity for a hardware / software co-designed approach that rethinks the hardware / software interface and the hardware implementations of all concurrency mechanisms .
These views embody a rich research agenda that will need the involvement of many computer science sub - disciplines , including languages , compilers , formal methods , software engineering , algorithms , runtime systems , and hardware .

Sidebar : key insights Memory models , which describe the semantics of shared variables , are crucial to both correct multithreaded applications and the entire underlying implementation stack .
It is difficult to teach multithreaded programming without clarity on memory models .
After much prior confusion , major programming languages are converging on a model that guarantees simple interleaving - based semantics for " data - race - free " programs and most hardware vendors have committed to support this model .
This process has exposed fundamental shortcomings in our languages and a hardware - software mismatch .
Semantics for programs that contain data races seem fundamentally difficult , but are necessary for concurrency safety and debuggability .
We call upon software and hardware communities to develop languages and systems that enforce data - race - freedom , and co-designed hardware that exploits and supports such semantics .

Review
It has been three long years to the day since we last looked at that unusual distribution called Windows .
Although at that time it was considered by many to be little else than a bizarre joke ( who on earth would design an operating system that does n't provide a way to grep files ? ) , a recent rumour about a new release has piqued our curiosity .
Developed by a large group of programmers who , believe it or not , all work in one building , the new version is predicted by some journalists to be one of the most secure operating systems ever created .
Robert Storey , our ardent distribution reviewer , could n't hold on any longer and downloaded the most recent beta version of Windows Vista from a nearby mirror to take a look .
Introduction Greetings to all !
As some of you may recall , it 's been a long three years since I last occupied this space , writing a review of Windows XP - An Operating System You Can Trust .
Sadly , I must confess that the reason for my prolonged absence from this web site is that I was in trouble with the law once again .
As my former readers will no doubt remember , I was previously under the influence of evil Linux hackers .
During that time , I committed several serious crimes - in particular , I violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) and infringed several software patents .
Fortunately , that crime spree was brought to an ignominious end when the Intellectual Property Police raided our Linux Users Group meeting .
Being a first - time offender , I was paroled after only eight months in prison .
I have since gone on to lead a clean and productive life using only safe and secure Microsoft software installed on my computer .
Linux Users Group Meeting
Alas , I must confess to backsliding .
My downfall came in the form of a computer magazine .
Inside the magazine jacket was a CD containing the evil Linux operating system !
I foolishly installed the software , and - just like an alcoholic who claims he 's only going to have " one drink " - I was hooked again !
Fortunately , Windows XP was still installed on my hard drive .
Windows correctly detected the presence of a Linux partition , and the built - in Microsoft Snitchware immediately reported the situation to the Department of Homeland Security .
Since installing Linux was a violation of my parole , I was arrested by the FBI and sentenced to a further two years in a federal penitentiary .
All this might sound tragic , but really , it 's not .
In the end , things worked out for the best .
After only one year in prison , I became eligible for a new experimental rehabilitation program .
I am happy to report that it 's been a great success !
After receiving counselling , medication , electroshock therapy and a prefrontal lobotomy , I am once again a happy Windows user .
As a condition of my early release from custody , the parole board has ordered me to perform 300 hours of community service .
This I have gladly done .
Working in close cooperation with the Business Software Alliance , I have been visiting public schools , lecturing students on the evils of open source software .
I can't begin to describe the satisfaction this work gives me , saving impressionable young minds from the temptation of so - called " free software . "
At the end of my talk , our team hands out T - shirts emblazoned with the motto , " Linux - Just say No ! "
As a further public service , we then audit the students ' computers for pirated software .
Just last week we caught three students with unlicensed video games installed on their machines .
Since they were minors , the students were not arrested - rather , they were put in foster care and their parents were fined US $ 150,000 for each pirated program .
Considering the seriousness of the crime , this was a mere slap on the wrist .
However , since these were first - time offenders , it 's understandable that the authorities should be so lenient .
Installation
This is supposed to be an operating system review , so I apologize for the above digression .
Sometimes I just get carried away with my personal issues - it 's probably just a side effect of the lobotomy .
So let 's get back on topic .
Today , I am reviewing Microsoft 's greatest operating system ever , Windows Hasta La Vista , or WHLV ( which is also the name of a talk radio station in Hattiesburg , Mississippi - Microsoft is now suing them for trademark infringement ) .
But to simplify things , we 'll just call this OS " Windows Vista " or " Vista " from now on .
Those who have been following the latest tech news are well aware of the fact that Vista will not , in fact , be released to the public until early 2007 .
Fortunately , for techies who just can't wait to get their hands on the latest and greatest offerings from Microsoft , there are two simple solutions - pay the Earth to become a Windows developer , or volunteer to be a beta tester .
I chose to do the latter .
The beta version of Windows Vista - officially known as the Community Technology Preview ( CTP ) - can be downloaded through Microsoft 's developers ' site .
Please note that the CTP is a time - limited copy which will self - destruct ( along with your data ) at a secret predetermined date .
I enthusiastically downloaded my copy and began the installation procedure .
This might be a good time to mention that the Vista installation program differs from the Windows XP installer in several significant ways .
For example , when XP installs , it merely wipes out any Linux partitions on the hard drive .
Windows Vista , on the other hand , will go much further - it will mount any Linux partitions it finds and then plant viruses and root kits in /usr / bin .
After all , Linux hackers have been doing stuff like this for years to Window users - now it 's time for some payback .
Just as when you install XP , at the very end of the installation process , Vista insists that you need to type in a user 's registration key .
However , XP requires a mere 25 - digit alpha- numeric key which is not even case - sensitive .
Vista , which is far more secure , requires a 250 - digit key which is case - sensitive and also includes spaces and various symbols .
For example , a valid registration key might look something like this :
5|_4!C|@W/#\r$cw3 r\/1=|\xV|Zb0+aR
t3qh h^0w ilE |r_1 ]
n\/x-( pY ) 5 \C 3k&| \
|3*j[%=G(.
Mx^G$ Hd : " 7{OK4 " GDe:E &y $ C[;}4!s3C|@W/O8@#\r$Uc~w3 r\`/1=|\xV|Z " b>,0 + ]{*$ 4%f_b+a@Q=-^.>c#wC|@=}4!+sG$ ]
Hd:C ) |@W/0+& ] { qC h=G ? ( >,0 + ]
\/1?+n]e{f *^ j0w@~>n V^ " |k\E $
If you make a mistake when typing the key , the installation program will abort and you have to start over from the beginning .
Furthermore , users will be required to retype the key every time they restart Windows .
Leave it to Microsoft to come up with such a clever method to protect us from the evils of software piracy !
Windows Hasta La Vista , baby !
All About Security
As you can see from the foregoing process , Microsoft is very concerned about security .
Indeed , the 250 - digit registration key is only the first step in protecting users from depraved software pirates .
Microsoft has incorporated many other exciting features to ensure that Vista is the most secure OS ever !
Vista comes with built - in support for Microsoft 's Software Quality Assurance program .
The way it works is that if users inadvertently attempt to install a dangerous open source program such as the notorious OpenOffice , Vista will intervene .
The fiendish program wo n't be installed , and Vista will instead download the equivalent closed source program ( in this example , Microsoft Office ) and automatically bill the customer 's credit card .
I can't but express my admiration on this innovative approach to protecting customers , as well as Microsoft 's profits .
Microsoft 's award winning browser , Internet Explorer , has also been beefed up with new security features .
For example , attempting to download illicit MP3 files will result in a security alert being emailed to the RIAA .
Similarly , any attempt to share movies will be reported to the MPAA .
Software pirates will have their activities reported to the Business Software Alliance .
All other suspicious activities will be reported to the Department of Homeland Security and Interpol .
Only through such diligent cooperative efforts between Microsoft and the relevant authorities can we protect our cherished free society .
One frequently requested feature by users is the ability to encrypt the filesystem , and Vista supports this .
However , the filesystem is not encrypted by default - the user has to set this up .
When you enable this feature , Vista sends an email to inform the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) that you have done so .
Then , using the NSA Back Door , FBI agents can periodically check your computer to ensure that your machine contains no terrorist messages , pornography or open source software .
Users might be concerned about having such a back door on their system , but they really should n't be .
The FBI has assured everybody that they will not abuse this power , and only concentrate on catching terrorists and other miscreants .
I see no reason not to believe them .
After all , if you can't trust the FBI , who can you trust ?
Project Cyborg
One of Microsoft 's most innovative projects yet involves the use of Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags .
These " tags " - a chip smaller than a grain of rice - have generated much discussion lately .
Large supermarkets and department stores are very interested in placing RFIDs inside of products - then a tag reader at the cash register would automatically ring up the purchase without the need to physically handle the merchandise .
RFIDs have also been used for electronic toll collection .
The chips have also been placed under the skin of dogs and cats in order to identify lost pets .
Most recently , several countries have decided to put RFIDs into " biometric passports " - this makes it much easier for criminals and terrorists to identify wealthy foreign tourists in a crowd , which helps facilitate mugging and kidnapping .
Further expanding on this great new technology , Microsoft plans to use RFIDs with Window Vista in order to facilitate payment .
Here 's how it would work .
First , Vista users would get the tag surgically implanted in a convenient location , most likely the back of the neck .
The RFID would contain an individual 's Windows product registration key , so " chipped " users would no longer need to type it .
Furthermore , customers with the embedded tag would be able to enjoy online shopping without the need to type credit card numbers - a tag reader on their computer would do all the work .
This system is destined to replace Microsoft Passport .
Other uses for the embedded RFID tag would be to alert authorities if users attempt to access forbidden web sites , or send emails to shady individuals on a government watch list .
Furthermore , thanks to Microsoft 's cooperative agreement with with Wal - Mart , chipped customers would no longer need to pay cash or show their credit cards at the checkout stand .
Consumers are going to love these great new convenience features .
Nevertheless , some whiny so - called " privacy advocates " have made a big fuss over Project Cyborg .
Without a doubt , they are a bunch of left - wing Linux loonies who can be counted upon to always oppose the advancement of technology .
Needless to say , it 's a waste of time trying to argue with these Luddites - it 's just best to ignore them .
Special Edition
As you may have read elsewhere , Microsoft plans to release several editions of Windows Vista , thus catering to specialized markets .
For example , several high - ranking government officials and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates would like a special edition that lacks a registration key , does not monitor online activity , and does n't support Project Cyborg .
Microsoft will generously cater to these customers ' needs by producing a version that meets their requirements - however , it will only run a rare computer based on a CPU called an Itanium , affectionately known to geeks as the Itanic .
Literally dozens of Itanics have been sold so far , and market analysts predict that nearly 100 will be in circulation by year 2010 .
Conclusion
Clearly , with Windows Hasta La Vista , Microsoft has another winner on its hands .
With valuable built - in convenience features and ironclad security , Microsoft has definitely responded to customers ' needs .
Furthermore , erh ... ahh , what 's this ?
Sorry everybody , somebody is at the door .
Just a moment ...
It 's the Intellectual Property Police .
Hmm ... they 've got a warrant .
It seems that by writing this review , I violated the Non-Disclosure Agreement which I clicked on when I downloaded the beta .
Damn , I really need to read those 150 - page End User License Agreements before clicking on " I Agree . "
Oh well , you 've got hand it to Windows Vista - just look at how efficient it was at reporting my illegal activities to the authorities !
What an amazing operating system !
I 'm about to be arrested , so I guess it might be a few more years before you 'll be hearing from me .
Given the circumstances , I can't think of a more appropriate thing to say except , Hasta la vista !
