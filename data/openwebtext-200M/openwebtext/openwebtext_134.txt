When Tony Snow made the rounds of talk shows this week , some might have been surprised at his message .
Snow to CNN : " There 's another principle , which is Congress does n't have the legislative -- I mean oversight authority over the White House . "
Snow to NBC : " Congress does n't have any legitimate oversight and responsibilities to the White House . "
Snow to NBC : " First , the White House is under no compulsion to do anything .
The legislative branch does n't have oversight . "
Snow to ABC : " The executive branch is under no compulsion to testify to Congress , because Congress in fact does n't have oversight ability . "
Just in case you missed it the first time , Snow repeated himself to make sure the public gets the message : the White House has declared itself , a law unto itself , beholden to no other authority .
This goes quite a bit beyond the already massive expansions of " executive privilege " previously claimed by this administration .
Congress has the enumerated authority under the constitution to pass laws , to raise a military , to declare war , and to impeach and remove members of the executive branch .
Does the word " oversight " appear ?
It does n't , but it 's so clearly implied in the powers designated to Congress that there 's been really little doubt of this power since 1787 .
The Supreme Court has agreed with Congress ' role in overseeing the White House on any number of occasions .
After all , how can Congress have impeachment authority over the executive if any investigation can be stonewalled by an uncooperative administration ?
The judicial equivalent would be making a defendant the judge at his own trial .
Under the Snow interpretation , the executive could get away with anything .
Anything at all .
Absolutely anything .
Like
Tony , I wanted to repeat so you would be sure I meant what I said .
A lack of congressional oversight would not just place the White House above the law , but completely beyond it .
Though it may have passed as just another incidence of Snow being trotted forth to distribute the day 's right wing talking points , what was said on Friday should not go without notice .
This is the single more amazing declaration in an administration that has already produced more extraordinary claims than the fountain at Lourdes .
For the last forty years , there has been only a single Republican administration .
That may seem an odd idea .
After all , at least a couple of Republicans have been elected over that period -- and a couple more have found their way to the White House through other means .
No matter the name on the Oval Office door , the philosophy promoted by the White House has remained .
This the Imperial Presidency of Richard M. Nixon , now brought to inglorious summer by the ( adopted ) son of Crawford .
It was under Nixon that the philosophy of a supreme executive was gestated .
It was under Nixon that the men who populate the current administration were taught their love for tyranny over justice .
From Watergate , to Iran - Contra , to Iraq , Nixon 's heirs have worked to chisel away the rule of law .
With Snow 's blunt declaration of independence , any remaining illusion that the executive branch continues to act as part of the government is removed .
If this interpretation holds , if the congress can not exert authority over the executive , then we are a democracy in name only .
In a high school history book , the fall of the Roman Republic is usually dated to the point were Julius Caesar , in defiance of Senate " micromanagement , " ordered his legions across the Rubicon to end effective representative oversight .
However , at the time , the Romans did n't see it that way .
They continued to call themselves a republic for years .
Decades .
Long after Caesar , they kept up the hollow pretense of a senate , marching in each day to pass laws that the executive of their day did not follow , and direct armies that moved only at the emperor 's command .
The Bush administration is waist deep in the Rubicon .
The only question now is whether we will drive them back to the bank , or admit that we are only play - acting at democracy .

Another 20 hospitals will soon be linked to the network
Nearby , a doctor watches , as the image appears on a computer screen in front of him .
It 's a scene that can be found in hospitals worldwide .
But what is special about this consulting room is that as the image appears here , it appears simultaneously on a similar computer screen at the Care Hospital , a specialist hospital in Hyderabad in southern India .
And in two windows to the right of the screen the doctors at each end can see each other , and confer about their patient .
Indian aid
Using a light pen they can point out features on the scan to each other .
The two doctors can see each other and confer about the patient
And they can show each other X - rays , cardiograms showing the patient 's heartbeat , the results of her laboratory tests - whatever they need to share .
This is just the pilot for a scheme which will eventually be rolled out all over Africa , set up by Indian technicians and paid for by Indian aid .
At the moment three hospitals are linked by fast internet connection - the Care Hospital , Black Lion , and a provincial Ethiopian hospital in Nekemte , 300 km ( 188 miles ) to the west of Addis Ababa .
The project was officially inaugurated by the Indian Foreign Minister , Pranab Mukherjee , on his visit to Ethiopia earlier this month , but even before the official inauguration some 40 patients had benefited from the new facilities .
Sharing expertise
The next stage is to link a total of 20 hospitals round Ethiopia into the network , so health workers in rural centres can have access to the best possible advice for their patients .
In a country where transportation is often slow and difficult it should mean that very sick patients can be treated by the best doctors in the country without having to be moved from where they are .
Although a hospital in India is part of the initial hook - up , Ratan Singh , the enthusiastic project manager stresses that this is not about providing Indian medical expertise to Africa .
What he is doing , he says , is to provide a technical platform , a means of sharing expertise , which African health services can use however they think best .
India will set up the project and run it free of charge for the first five years .
A sister project will link university students and teachers across the continent .
Twenty - three African countries have already signed up to the project , which was originally agreed between India and the African Union .
Eventually it will have its own dedicated satellite and five regional super - specialist hospitals in different parts of Africa will provide the best available medical expertise .
Aurora , a word you might not heard of .
It 's form when the solar wind from the Sun collides with the atmosphere of the earth and react violently .
But , here is a masterpiece to illustrate Aurora Australis - the Southern Lights .
Aurora Australis
Aurora Borealis
Aurora happens all year round , 24 hours a day at irregular intervals .
We only get to see them when it is dark though .
Because it is dark all the time in the middle of winter here , we get to see quite a few .
An Aurora Australis
Simply stunning phenomenon .
I 'd love to see it in real life .

U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last week reiterated his desire for increased ISP data retention to help combat crime .
In a speech to the National Association of Attorneys General summer meeting in Atlanta , Gonzales gave his audience a graphic , stomach - turning look into the world of online pedophilia .
He described a visit he made to to the Justice Department 's child exploitation and obscenity section and some of the images and online videos he 'd seen .
" It changed me , " Gonzales said .
" It was an orientation I will never forget . "
Then he argued that not enough is being done to combat child exploitation and that law enforcement tools need to be bolstered , particularly by increasing data retention .
" We have heard time and time again from state and local investigators and prosecutors that investigations of these crimes would be greatly aided by increased data retention by Internet Service Providers .
That ’s why I asked a working group within the Department to look at this issue , and we 're working hard on ways to remedy this problem .
I appreciate your support on the issue of data retention ; I hope we can continue to make significant strides in investigative practices in the future . "

NYT : Even as Congress pushes ' green ' legislation , they back coal as ' alternative fuel '
RAW STORY
Published : Monday May 28 , 2007 Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) led a delegation to Greenland over the weekend to witness " firsthand evidence that climate change is a reality . "
She said Monday that she hoped President Bush would consider a " different way " on global warming .
" There is just no denying " the reality of climate change , she said .
" It was n't caused by the people of Greenland  it was caused by the behavior of the rest of the world , " Pelosi told reporters .
However , many of her colleagues in Congress continue to push coal as an ' alternative fuel ' and a green way to cut US dependence on foreign oil , despite concerns from environmental watchdogs .
Both Democrats and Republicans are " pushing to subsidize coal as the king of ' alternative fuels , ' " reports the New York Times .
" Environmental groups are adamantly opposed , " writes Edmund Andrews , " saying that coal - based diesel fuels produce at least as much in greenhouse gases as gasoline and about twice as much if it is produced without special measures to capture and store carbon dioxide . "
However , the powerful coal lobby spends millions of dollars each year pushing coal as a clean , alternative fuel .
President Bush has even " stressed the importance of coal as an alternative to oil and deliberately referred to the need for ' alternative fuels ' rather than simply ' renewable fuels . '
Administration officials say that was specifically to make room for coal . "
Excerpts from the New York Times piece follow : # The political momentum to subsidize coal - based fuels is in odd juxtaposition to simultaneous efforts by Democrats , who are also drafting bills to address global warming that would place new restrictions on coal - fired electric power plants .
The move reflects a tension , which many lawmakers gloss over , between slowing global warming and reducing dependence on foreign oil .
Many analysts say the United States ' huge coal reserves could indeed provide a substitute for foreign oil .
But most say that greater use of coal would do little or nothing to slow global warming and could speed it up .
...
Coal industry executives insist that their fuel can actually be cleaner than oil , because the production plants would capture and store the gas created during production and use renewable " biomass " fuels for part of the process .
But none of that has been done at commercial volumes , and many analysts say the economic issues are far from settled .

Oil refineries across the country have been plagued by a record number of fires , power failures , leaks , spills and breakdowns this year , causing dozens of them to shut down temporarily or trim production .
The disruptions are helping to drive gasoline prices to highs not seen since last summer ’s records .
These mechanical breakdowns , which one analyst likened to an “ invisible hurricane , ” have created a bottleneck in domestic energy supplies , helping to push up gasoline prices 50 cents this year to well above $ 3 a gallon .
A third of the country ’s 150 refineries have reported disruptions to their operations since the beginning of the year , a record according to analysts .
There have been blazes at refineries in Louisiana , Texas , Indiana and California , some of them caused by lightning strikes .
Plants have suffered power losses that disrupted operations ; a midsize refinery in Kansas was flooded by torrential rains last month .
American refiners are running roughly 5 percent below their normal levels at this time of the year .
“ You have a system that is taxed to the limit , ” said Adam Robinson , an energy research analyst at Lehman Brothers .
“ This is what happens when spare capacity is eroded . ”
ABOUT ARKANOID
Arkanoid was one of the first " Breakout " - style games , to the best of my knowledge .
It was very popular in the 80's , and I remember playing it when I was younger .
The arcade game was pretty hard to play too , because you had to use a paddle to control the .. paddle .. or maybe it was just because I was around 6 years old at the time ;)
Some time in 1988 my family got an 8 - MHz 8088 PC , and I got a copy of " Arkanoid : Revenge Of DOH " on a 5 1/ 4 " floppy from a friend .. ah , the good old says of casual floppy - based file sharing .
Anyways , needless to say I logged my fair share of time playing that game .
It had all the features I remembered from the arcade game , and also included a level editor .
When I started working on this DHTML rendition of Arkanoid , I remembered how cool the editor feature was and made a point of adding one in .
One thing I do remember omitting is the ability to select which bricks hold power - ups ( the PC version let you do this ) , but I figured it was minor enough that it would n't be missed if left out ;)
Aside from that , almost everything else is there .
BASICS
HOW TO PLAY : Click to launch the ball , then keep it alive by bouncing it back at the bricks .
Destroy bricks for points and power - ups .
To pass the level , you must eliminate all " destroyable " bricks .
BRICK TYPES
Arkanoid has various types of bricks which make up the levels ; each brick has an associated hit count and point value .
These have been recreated from the original game as closely as possible .
Some bricks have special behaviors associated with them ( for example , the " not destroyable " condition - where the brick does not need to be destroyed in order to finish the level . )
These behaviors are listed in the " special notes " section of the description .
GOLD
Hits : Unlimited
Point value : 500
SPECIAL NOTES
- Not counted as a " destroyable " brick
- Indestructible ( with the exception of the Mega ball )
Hits : UnlimitedPoint value : 500 - Not counted as a " destroyable " brick - Indestructible ( with the exception of the Mega ball ) FUNKY
Hits : 2
Point value : 50
SPECIAL NOTES
- Not counted as a " destroyable " brick
- Respawns 3 seconds after being destroyed
- Hit count increases to 3 at level 10 , then to 4 at level 20
- I could n't think of a very good name for this one , hence " Funky " :)
Hits : 2 Point value : 50 - Not counted as a " destroyable " brick - Respawns 3 seconds after being destroyed -

POWER -UPS
Note :
The capsule styles are derived from the original game , but the names may be slightly different .
( I had to guess what the full name was . )
The " Frequency " rating is a percentage of how often you can expect to get that particular capsule .
It is based on Math.random ( ) however , so expect mixed results .
Power -ups are mutually exclusive , meaning that you can only have one power - up effect at a time - they can not be combined .
BYPASS : Allows you to exit the current level without having to destroy all of the usual bricks .
You can choose to keep playing also , and you wo n't die if all balls are lost .
Frequency : Low - 2 % : Allows you to exit the current level without having to destroy all of the usual bricks .
You can choose to keep playing also , and you wo n't die if all balls are lost .
CATCH : Makes balls " stick " to the paddle on contact , and release ( all at once ) on the next mouse click .
Frequency : Average - 2 % : Makes balls " stick " to the paddle on contact , and release ( all at once ) on the next mouse click .
DISRUPT : Spawns eight additional balls .
The spawn occurs from the highest ball on the screen at the time .
Frequency : Average - 10 % : Spawns eight additional balls .
The spawn occurs from the highest ball on the screen at the time .
EXTEND : Extends the paddle by 50 % , making it easier to hit balls .
Unlike some versions of Arkanoid , Extend only works once ( ie. getting an Extend 2 or more times in a row will not make the paddle larger )
Frequency : Average - 10 % : Extends the paddle by 50 % , making it easier to hit balls .
Unlike some versions of Arkanoid , Extend only works once ( ie. getting an Extend 2 or more times in a row will not make the paddle larger ) INTELLIGENT SHADOW :
Officially named T for " Tail " in the original , this was renamed to avoid confusion .
This power - up creates a trailing " shadow " that follows the paddle , and can bounce balls just the same as the paddle .
The refraction is different though , so beware !

LASER : Gives the paddle laser - firing ability .
Two " turrets " appear on the paddle with this power - up , and lasers are fired on every mouse click .
A laser does the same amount of brick damage that a ball does , but you have the advantage of aim - and - fire with the lasers .

MEGA : Transforms all active balls to blue " Mega " balls , which rip through any and all bricks without bouncing .
They do speed up as through they bounced every time they hit a brick though , so be ready for some fast - moving balls if you get this power - up .
Frequency : Low - 3 % : Transforms all active balls to blue " Mega " balls , which rip through any and all bricks without bouncing .
They do speed up as through they bounced every time they hit a brick though , so be ready for some fast - moving balls if you get this power - up .
NODE : Similar to Disrupt , but creates three respawning balls .
That is , the highest ball respawns ( creating " nodes " ) until there are three balls on the screen .
Keep at least one alive , and it will spawn two more to bring the total back to three .
Watch out for quick speeding up though , as the spawned balls inherit the speed of their parent !

PLAYER : " Free life " by any other name .
This power - up does not give the paddle any special powers , but as it is a power - up it will reset any other power - up effect - although a free life may be more important than a temporary power - up anyways , depending on how you play :)

This power - up has both a good and a bad side to it .
On the upside , any points you earn will be doubled before being added to your total score .
On the downside , the paddle is reduced to 2/3 of its original size , making it harder to keep the ball going .
( This power - up capsule is noticeably smaller as a reminder , also . )
Definitely handy if you 're going for a highscore , although you might not live as long !

SLOW : Slows down all active balls by 33 % of their current speed or to a predefined minimum speed , whichever is higher .
Frequency : Average - 10 % : Slows down all active balls by 33 % of their current speed or to a predefined minimum speed , whichever is higher .
TWIN : Splits the paddle into two slightly - smaller twin paddles - overall slightly larger than the Extend power - up , but there is a risk of losing the ball in the gap through the middle .
The angle at which the twin paddles reflect is also slightly different than the others .

MISCELLANEOUS
Three of four witnesses who testified at trial that Davis shot the officer have signed statements contradicting their identification of the gunman .
Two other witnesses -- a fellow inmate and a neighborhood acquaintance who told police that Davis had confessed to the shooting -- have said they made it up .
Other witnesses point the finger not at Davis but at another man .
Yet none has testified during his appeals because federal courts barred their testimony .
AEDPA , the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Death Penalty Enforcement Act , signed into law by then President Clinton in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City Bombing and intended for Timothy McVeigh , is the culprit .
Before the law , the federal courts intervened to provide " relief " to death row inmates -- that is , a new trial , new sentencing hearing or a commutation of the sentence to life imprisonment -- in about 45 percent of cases , though the rate was declining .
But between 2000 and 2007 , federal courts intervened to provide such relief to the death row inmate in about 10 percent of cases , according to a forthcoming study .
The law has prevented the Courts from considering new evidence in Troy Davis 's case .
As I 've opined many times here , we should never enact laws as an emotional response to a single tragedy , no matter how horrific .
Cooler heads are needed .
In 1895 , the United States Supreme Court decided Coffin v. United States , in which it traced the presumption of innocence and the phrase “ It is better that X number of guilty men go free than one innocent person be put to death ” past England , Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome , and according to one scholar , Greenleaf , to Deuteronomy .
It 's time to reconsider the harshness of the habeas restrictions in AEDPA and its one - year limitation period for filing a state prisoner ’s federal habeas corpus petition .
For a blog devoted to AEDPA issues , check out the AEDPA Law and Policy Blog .
Scotus Blog discusses the current state of AEDPA constitutional challenges here .
Mike King , in an Atlanta Journal Constitution op - ed this week urging intervention for Troy Davis , reminds us ,
Over the years , 124 death row inmates have been released from state prisons after evidence proved their innocence .
Police , prosecutors , judges , witnesses and juries make mistakes , but those mistakes can never be reversed once a death sentence is carried out .
As to how Troy Davis is faring as the executioner 's clock keeps ticking :
Activist Sheehan arrested in House gallery GOP congressman says his wife was also ordered to leave A House security officer takes Cindy Sheehan out of the chamber gallery before President Bush 's speech .
RELATED WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Peace activist Cindy Sheehan was arrested Tuesday in the House gallery after refusing to cover up a T - shirt bearing an anti-war slogan before President Bush 's State of the Union address .
According to a blog post on Michael Moore 's Web site attributed to Sheehan , the T - shirt said , " 2,245 Dead .
How many more ? " -- a reference to the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq .
" She was asked to cover it up .
She did not , " said Sgt. Kimberly Schneider , U.S. Capitol Police spokeswoman .
House rules bar demonstrations in the galleries .
On Wednesday , U.S. Rep. Bill Young , R - Florida , spoke on the House floor saying his wife , Beverly , had been " ordered to leave " the gallery during the speech for wearing a shirt that said , " Support Our Troops . "
Young , an 18 - term congressman , held up his wife 's shirt during his remarks , speaking with anger and emotion about her treatment .
" She has a real passion for our troops , and she shows it in many , many ways , " Young said .
" And most members in this House know that , but because she had on a shirt , that someone did n't like , that said , ' Support Our Troops , ' she was kicked out of this gallery while the president was speaking and encouraging Americans to support our troops .
Shame .
Shame . "
Sheehan held 4 hours Sheehan was arrested around 8:30 p.m. ET
Tuesday on charges of unlawful conduct , a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail , Capitol Police said .
She was handcuffed and held in the Capitol building until she was driven to the Capitol Police headquarters for booking .
According to her blog , she was released about four hours after her arrest .
Sheehan , who became a vocal war opponent after her son was killed in Iraq , was an invited guest of Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D - California .
Woolsey has called for a withdrawal of troops in Iraq and supports legislation for the creation of a Department of Peace .
Sheehan gained national attention in August when she and hundreds of other protesters camped outside Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , and demanded an audience with the president .
She also recently penned a book , " Not One More Mother 's Child . "
In April 2004 , Sheehan and other relatives of troops killed in Iraq met with Bush during a visit to Fort Lewis , Washington , shortly after the death of her son , Army Spc. Casey Sheehan , 24 .
Sheehan later said that the president would n't look at pictures of her son and " did n't even know Casey 's name . "
The Vacaville , California , resident has said she 'd like to meet with Bush again to discuss her opposition to the war .
The president has declined another meeting and has taken issue with Sheehan 's calls for a withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
" She expressed her opinion ; I disagree with it , " Bush said in August .
" I think immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake . "

A recent analysis shows that In 2006 , the percentage of newly constructed single family homes earning the governmentâ€™s Energy Star label for superior energy efficiency exceeded 12 percent in 15 states , with three New England states at the forefront of that list .
Connecticut , New Hampshire and Vermont are among the leaders which host the greatest percent of Energy Star certified homes , alongside Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Hawaii , Iowa , Nevada , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Texas and Utah .
“ New England is once again leading the nation on energy conservation and environmental issues , â€ said Robert Varney , regional administrator of EPAâ€™s New England office .
â€ œConsumers donâ€™t have to limit their smart energy choices to energy efficient cars and appliances , but more and more can choose high - efficiency , low - emission systems in their homes . ”
Homes that earn the Energy Star offer homeowners all the features they want in a new home , plus energy - efficiency improvements that deliver better performance , greater comfort , and lower utility bills , all while helping to protect the environment .
To earn the Energy Star , homes must be independently verified as meeting EPAâ€™s strict guidelines for energy efficiency .
Once these standards are met , homes are at least 15 percent more efficient than homes built to the 2004 International Residential Code and typically , they include energy - saving features which make them 20 to 30 percent more efficient than standard homes .
As a percentage of new home construction in 2006 , the three New England states show impressive amounts of energy efficient Energy Star certified homes : Connecticut – 23 % ; New Hampshire – 17 % ; and Vermont 24 percent .
Elsewhere in New England , both Massachusetts and Rhode Island had between three and 11 percent of new homes constructed according to Energy Star standards , and Maine had less than three percent .
Nearly 200,000 new homes nationwide earned the Energy Star in 2006 , bringing the total number of Energy Star qualified homes across the nation to almost 750,000 .
To date , these homes have locked in annual savings of more than $ 180 million for homeowners by saving over 1 billion kWh of electricity and 100 million therms of natural gas .
EPA started the Energy Star program in 1992 as market based approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency .
In 2006 , Americans , with the help of Energy Star , saved $ 14 billion and prevented greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from 25 million vehicles .
Home energy use accounts for nearly 17 percent of the total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and 21 percent of energy consumption nationwide .
Today , more than 3,500 builders are committed to building Energy Star qualified homes and there are Energy Star qualified homes in every state across the country .
State 2006 ENERGY STAR
Qualified New Homes ¹ 2006 One - Unit
Housing Permits2 2006 ENERGY STAR
Market Penetration Alaska 1,024 1,612 64 % Arizona 20,101 55,633 36 % California 18,105 107,714 17 % Connecticut 1,606 7,107 23 % Delaware 1,217 5,015 24 % Hawaii 2,086 5,597 37 % Iowa 5,866 10,250 57 % Nevada 18,891 26,722 71 % New Hampshire 820 4,826 17 % New Jersey 5,351 17,113 31 % New York 2,569 19,981 13 % Ohio 3,462 27,514 13 % Texas 60,839 162,750 37 % Utah 3,554 22,595 16 % Vermont 501 2,071 24 %
As you can see some states such as Alaska and Texas are leading the way in energy efficient home building .
Mostly because of the large amount of energy used to heat or cool these homes .
New england , while make great strides , has a long way to go to catch up with these sates .
I do find it interesting that these very red states are leading in what is considered a very liberal issue .
Perhaps because it makes good financial sense to have an efficient home .
The next step will be to create homes that not only use energy efficiently but also create clean renewable energy on site .
These efficient homes are the perfect site to install solar panels , small scale wind turbines , and geothermal systems .
Use less energy , create your own , feed the rest into the grid for everyone else .

What gets my goat about Wikipedia is the darn " citation needed " tag .
Some Wikipedia readers seem to love going through articles on topics they know little about and adding " citation needed " after every second statement , when to anyone who knows the subject in question it 's common knowledge that it is ludicrous to call into question :
Banana plants are of the family Musaceae [ citation needed ] .
They are cultivated primarily for their fruit , and to a lesser extent for the production of fibre and as ornamental plants [ citation needed ] .
They are native to tropical southeastern Asia but are widely cultivated in tropical regions [ citation needed ] .
Queen Victoria subsisted on a diet of nothing but bananas[ citation needed ] .
About the only thing more annoying than this is when someone finds a statement in a page that is completely and blatantly false , obviously been added by some vandal or something , and rather than justit they add " citation needed " :
As if some editor will go through and try to find a citation to support this " fact " and add it to the article .
Ugh ...
I have no further words for the pain this causes .
I 'm just trying to work out what those elliptical things behind the Allosaurus are .
They looked a bit like fingerprints when I first glanced at them now .
Or maybe air traffic control radar screens .
Or an astronomical map of intergalactic radio sources .
I think they 're ceiling lights .
I suppose that makes sense , as the press photographer shot this photo of the President looking almost straight up at his towering height .
Iran fired several missiles with a range of more than 1,000 miles during a military maneuver today , apparently to send a message to the United States and several of its allies in the Persian Gulf after they conducted naval exercises in the same area this week .
Iranian state television reported that “ dozens ” of missiles were fired , including the Shahab - 3 , which has a range of about 1,000 miles and is capable of carrying cluster warheads of 1,400 bomblets , and the shorter range Shahab - 2 .
The Iranian news agency ISNA posted photographs of what it said were the missiles , shown billowing smoke as they were launched , in the so - called “ Great Prophet ” exercises involving air , naval and ground forces .
The news agency quoted a senior official as saying that the launchings were not linked to any developments in the Iranian nuclear program .
But it said the launchings showed that Iran had reached an international level of achievement in its ballistic missile program .
“ The first and main goal of this exercise is to demonstrate power and national determination to defend the country against any possible threat , and show Iran ’s missile capability which has increased the country ’s defense capability , ” the ISNA report said .
Beth Hammer has turned her gated Wheat Ridge community upside down with her upside - down display of the U.S. flag .
On March 19 – the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq – Hammer decided to hang her flag upside down , which under the federal flag code is a signal of distress .
The 64 - year - old retired banker said flying the flag with the white - starred blue field – called the union – on the bottom is her silent protest .
“ I think the war in Iraq has put this country in distress , ” Hammer said .
“ We are losing lives , liberty and our honor . ”
Hammer contends displaying the U.S. flag upside down is her First Amendment right of free speech .
She has hired a Denver civil rights lawyer , Mari Newman .
“ Just because she lives in a covenant - controlled community does n’t mean she gives up her rights to free speech , ” Newman said .
The Cambridge Park Homeowners Association , which represents owners of 107 patio homes , does n’t agree with Hammer ’s perspective .
On Wednesday night , the association ’s board met to hear her response to its notice of noncompliance .
The board took no action , and board members refused to comment .
The board was minus one member : Hammer ’s husband , Doug , a board member who did not participate in the meeting but supports her .
The association board notified Beth Hammer in an April 24 letter that the flag display is against federal flag code and is in violation of the association ’s “ patriotic and political expression policy . ”
The letter gave her a week to right the flag or face fines that appear to range from $ 25 to $ 500 .
“ Living in a community association offers many advantages to the homeowner , but at the same time , imposes some restrictions , ” said the letter signed by association manager Melissa Keithly .
“ These restrictions are not meant as an inconvenience or an invasion of your freedom , but rather as a means of maintaining harmony in your community , ” the letter continued .
Most of her neighbors are unhappy , Hammer said .
She does have supporters , although Hammer said , “ I do n’t think they are enough to make a football team . ”
This is n’t the first time Hammer has flown the flag this way .
When she lived in a Lakewood neighborhood with no covenants , some neighbors expressed their opposition to her upside - down display .
“ There were threats and whatever , ” she said .
When she moved to her current home in 2004 , Hammer decided not to put up her flag “ until our neighbors got to know us for who we are and not to judge us on how we hung our flag . ”
Then the Iraq war anniversary arose .
“ I do n’t think of myself as a rabble - rouser , ” Hammer said .
“ To me , it ’s my personal protest as a First Amendment right to free speech . ”

BBC News , Maasbommel , the Netherlands
The Dutch have found a new way to cope with excess water
Small and densely populated , the Netherlands is one of the countries most at risk from climate change and rising sea levels .
But in one village in the south of the country , they are trying out a new way of living with an increased risk of floods .
A small ferry shuttles back and forth from one bank of the River Maas to the other .
This is the only way of reaching Maasbommel , in Gelderland province , from the south .
The landscape is saturated with water , criss - crossed by rivers and the network of dykes which are supposed to protect the area from flooding .
Sustainable buildings which have no adverse impact on the environment
Chris Zevenbergen of Dura Vermeer
But the dykes are not always enough .
In 1993 and again in 1995 , floods forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes .
Rising sea levels
Now , with climate change , floods are likely to be more frequent and more severe .
Dutch scientists predict a rise in sea levels of up to 110 cm ( 43 inches ) by the year 2100 .
At the same time , there is growing pressure on land .
The Dutch government estimates 500,000 new homes will be needed in the next two decades .
Most of the land suitable for conventional building has already been snapped up .
So Dutch housebuilders are experimenting with new solutions .
Floating alternative
A row of amphibious houses lines the waterfront at Maasbommel , panelled in blue , yellow and green .
They have a hollow concrete cube at the base to give them buoyancy .
The houses ' new occupants say they barely notice the floods
Electricity and water are pumped in through flexible pipes .
In all , the houses can withstand a rise in the water table of up to four metres ( 13ft ) .
" We are trying to develop new types of more sustainable buildings which have no adverse impacts on the environment , " says Chris Zevenbergen of Dura Vermeer , the company which developed the floating houses .
At a starting price of 260,000 euros ( £ 180,000 or $ 310,000 ) , the houses are not a cheap option .
But Mr Zevenbergen says demand is high .
" We have to make our first steps , " he says .
" It 's a long process , but the transition to a more flood - resilient country is a prerequisite in the near future . "
Growing popularity
The houses have attracted international attention .
Officials from New Orleans , which was devastated by flooding in August 2005 , have visited Maasbommel to see how the floating houses work .
The new homes moored to the shore present a tranquil picture
" You can build it very big , you can build it small , but I think for a lot of countries with the same problems as here , it is a good solution , " he says .
He does caution that the floating houses are no replacement for conventional flood defences , including the dykes , a crucial failing in New Orleans .
But while the floating houses may be radical enough for some , others think the Netherlands should go much further .
Pressure on land
Frits Schoute runs a sustainable development project called Ecoboot .
In collaboration with engineering and architecture students , mainly from Delft Technical University , he is working on pilot projects to build whole cities at sea .
" Our traditional way of just fighting the sea with dykes has to give way to alternatives , like going with the water , " Mr Schoute predicts .
The floating city is a long - term project , he admits .
But the houses at Maasbommel are a good first step .
" ( Change ) should come from the bottom up , not just from the top down , " he says .
" If you also have the support of the government , realising how necessary it is to find alternatives for mankind , then sometime it will happen . "
Perhaps not surprisingly , Chris Zevenbergen believes the floating houses have a bright future .
" We have many deltas in the world which have problems with competing land claims for economic activity , " he explains .
" So when you can create a community which coexists with water , then you have a very sustainable solution . "
In a conversation with Jack Welch earlier this week , he raved about Rich Kaarlgard ’s recent column in Forbes on “ World ’s Worst Disease ” .
No , Rich is not talking about cancer , AIDS or avian flu – he is talking about “ zero - sum thinking ” – the belief that if one person gains , other people must inevitably lose .
Rich focuses on a significant rift in our society .
In fact , this is perhaps the most fundamental rift in any society .
It ultimately determines whether the society is progressive and dynamic or stagnant and conflict - prone .
Unfortunately , both of our political parties appear to be captives to zero sum thinking .
Rich asks :
Why do so many opinion makers promote the zero-sum view ?
I think that politicians , even the best and brightest , become zero -sum thinkers because they occupy a zero-sum world .
Only one person can be President of this country ; only 50 can be governors ; only 100 can be senators .
. . .
Politicians live in a world in which one person ’s gain is another ’s loss .
Rich goes on to target economists and journalists as being particularly prone to this disease .
Now , I agree with all of this , but I wonder why Rich leaves out business leaders in his discussion of this disease .
My concern is that many senior executives of our largest companies have fallen prey to this disease .
As JSB and I wrote in the opening pages of The Only Sustainable Edge :
We believe that a new opportunity and a new imperative – the acceleration of capability building – will shift our institutional and collective mind - sets from a worldview that focuses on static , zero - sum relationships to one that emphasizes dynamic non -zero - sum relationships .
As we adopt these different perspectives , we will find that most of our institutions today are fundamentally lacking .
Static , zero - sum worldviews generally arise when people focus on the allocation of existing resources .
Existing resources have a fixed quantity , and with relatively modest exceptions , if one party acquires a resource , other parties are deprived of that resource .
This worldview is a natural orientation for large , well - established players – they become more concerned with defending existing resources because they have a lot to lose on this front , compared with the opportunity to create more resources .
I spend a lot of time with senior executives and I am struck by the inroads made by this disease in corporate boardrooms .
Here are just a few of the areas where zero - sum thinking rears its ugly head in our business arena :
Squeezing suppliers .
In our quest for cost - cutting , we have focused on squeezing the prices of our suppliers as much as possible .
The result has been deteriorating trust and relationships with key business partners .
Too many executives under -estimate the opportunity of working together to make both parties stronger and deliver even more value to the marketplace .
Growing focus on intellectual property protection .
There are certainly valid concerns here , but too often executives seek to protect their existing stocks of knowledge at the expense of the opportunity to participate in broader relationships that could significantly refresh these stocks .
The militarization of marketing .
Military metaphors abound in our marketing efforts – campaigns , blitzes , targeting – yet war is perhaps one of the most extreme examples of zero - sum games .
What new value could we create if we focused instead on how we could be more helpful to customers so that they will make the effort to seek us out , rather than having us search for them ?
The marginalization of innovation .
With some obvious exceptions , large enterprises have generally become consumed with the quest for cost - cutting – again , for understandable reasons .
In the process , though , the opportunity to create new forms of value through innovation has been shunted aside .
Innovation has been compartmentalized into R&D departments that have been squeezed for cost - savings along with everyone else .
Rather than assigning innovation to the ghetto of R&D , why not liberate innovation and view it as an activity that everyone in the enterprise should be pursuing every day ?
Of course , that means breaking the mindset that innovation is about product development .
After all , innovation is ultimately about finding ways to deliver new value to the marketplace from existing resources , whether this value is in the form of products , new work practices , improved business processes , new management techniques or new business models .
Innovation is the antidote to zero - sum thinking .
Rich also does n’t talk about this disease in a global context .
Certainly every society has it to some degree .
But I think the story of the rapid growth of China and India in the past decade hinges on the ability of significant segments of the population to find an antidote to this disease and to embrace a positive - sum view of the world .
I fear that the disease is more pervasive than Rich acknowledges .
We need to identify the symptoms in all areas of our life and work hard to find appropriate antidotes .
Our continued growth and prosperity depend upon it .
Although Bush administration officials have frequently lashed out at Syria and Iran , accusing it of helping insurgents and militias here , the largest number of foreign fighters and suicide bombers in Iraq come from a third neighbor , Saudi Arabia , according to a senior U.S. military officer and Iraqi lawmakers .
About 45 % of all foreign militants targeting U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia ; 15 % are from Syria and Lebanon ; and 10 % are from North Africa , according to official U.S. military figures made available to The Times by the senior officer .
Nearly half of the 135 foreigners in U.S. detention facilities in Iraq are Saudis , he said .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Wednesday July 18 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 58 words Type of Material : Correction
Saudi fighters :
An article in Sunday ’s Section A about Saudi insurgents in Iraq said the U.S. military had 135 foreigners in detention facilities in Iraq .
The number of detainees is 130 .
The article also said that 15 % of foreign militants targeting U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians and security forces were from Syria or Lebanon .
That figure is 20 % .
Fighters from Saudi Arabia are thought to have carried out more suicide bombings than those of any other nationality , said the senior U.S. officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the subject ’s sensitivity .
It is apparently the first time a U.S. official has given such a breakdown on the role played by Saudi nationals in Iraq ’s Sunni Arab insurgency .
He said 50 % of all Saudi fighters in Iraq come here as suicide bombers .
In the last six months , such bombings have killed or injured 4,000 Iraqis .

The situation has left the U.S. military in the awkward position of battling an enemy whose top source of foreign fighters is a key ally that at best has not been able to prevent its citizens from undertaking bloody attacks in Iraq , and at worst shares complicity in sending extremists to commit attacks against U.S. forces , Iraqi civilians and the Shiite - led government in Baghdad .
The problem casts a spotlight on the tangled web of alliances and enmities that underlie the political relations between Muslim nations and the U.S .
Complicated past
In the 1980s , the Saudi intelligence service sponsored Sunni Muslim fighters for the U.S. - backed Afghan mujahedin battling Soviet troops in Afghanistan .
At the time , Saudi intelligence cultivated another man helping the Afghan fighters , Osama bin Laden , the future leader of Al Qaeda who would one day turn against the Saudi royal family and mastermind the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon .
Indeed , Saudi Arabia has long been a source of a good portion of the money and manpower for Al Qaeda : 15 of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks were Saudi .

Now , a group that calls itself Al Qaeda in Iraq is the greatest short - term threat to Iraq ’s security , U.S. military spokesman Brig .
Gen. Kevin Bergner said Wednesday .
The group , one of several Sunni Muslim insurgent groups operating in Baghdad and beyond , relies on foreigners to carry out suicide attacks because Iraqis are less likely to undertake such strikes , which the movement hopes will provoke sectarian violence , Bergner said .
Despite its name , the extent of the group ’s links to Bin Laden ’s network , based along the Afghan - Pakistani frontier , is unclear .
The Saudi government does not dispute that some of its youths are ending up as suicide bombers in Iraq , but says it has done everything it can to stop the bloodshed .
“ Saudis are actually being misused .
Someone is helping them come to Iraq .
Someone is helping them inside Iraq .
Someone is recruiting them to be suicide bombers .
We have no idea who these people are .
We are n’t getting any formal information from the Iraqi government , ” said Gen. Mansour Turki , spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry .
Advertisement
“ If we get good feedback from the Iraqi government about Saudis being arrested in Iraq , probably we can help , ” he said .
Defenders of Saudi Arabia pointed out that it has sought to control its lengthy border with Iraq and has fought a bruising domestic war against Al Qaeda since Sept. 11 .
“ To suggest they ’ve done nothing to stem the flow of people into Iraq is wrong , ” said a U.S. intelligence official in Washington , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ People do get across that border .
You can always ask , ‘ Could more be done ? ’
But what are they supposed to do , post a guard every 15 or 20 paces ? ”
Deep suspicions

Others contend that Saudi Arabia is allowing fighters sympathetic to Al Qaeda to go to Iraq so they wo n’t create havoc at home .
Iraqi Shiite lawmaker Sami Askari , an advisor to Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , accused Saudi officials of a deliberate policy to sow chaos in Baghdad .
“ The fact of the matter is that Saudi Arabia has strong intelligence resources , and it would be hard to think that they are not aware of what is going on , ” he said .
Askari also alleged that imams at Saudi mosques call for jihad , or holy war , against Iraq ’s Shiites and that the government had funded groups causing unrest in Iraq ’s largely Shiite south .
Sunni extremists regard Shiites as unbelievers .

Other Iraqi officials said that though they believed Saudi Arabia , a Sunni fundamentalist regime , had no interest in helping Shiite - ruled Iraq , it was not helping militants either .
But some Iraqi Shiite leaders say the Saudi royal family sees the Baghdad government as a proxy for its regional rival , Shiite - ruled Iran , and wants to unseat it .
With its own border with Iraq largely closed , Saudi fighters take what is now an established route by bus or plane to Syria , where they meet handlers who help them cross into Iraq ’s western deserts , the senior U.S. military officer said .
He suggested it was here that Saudi Arabia could do more , by implementing rigorous travel screenings for young Saudi males .
Iraqi officials agreed .
“ Are the Saudis using all means possible ?
Of course not ....
And we think they need to do more , as does Syria , as does Iran , as does Jordan , ” the senior officer said .
An estimated 60 to 80 foreign fighters cross into Iraq each month , according to the U.S. military .

“ It needs to be addressed by the government of Iraq head on .
They have every right to stand up to a country like Saudi Arabia and say , ‘ Hey , you are killing thousands of people by allowing your young jihadists to come here and associate themselves with an illegal worldwide network called Al Qaeda . ”
Both the White House and State Department declined to comment for this article .
Turki , the Saudi spokesman , defended the right of his citizens to travel without restriction .
“ If you leave Saudi Arabia and go to other places and find somebody who drags them to Iraq , that is a problem we ca n’t do anything about , ” Turki said .
He added that security officials could stop people from leaving the kingdom only if they had information on them .

U.S. officials had not shared with Iraqi officials information gleaned from Saudi detainees , but this has started to change , said an Iraqi source , who asked not to be identified .
For example , U.S. officials provided information about Saudi fighters and suicide bombers to Iraqi security officials who traveled to Saudi Arabia last week .
Iraqi advisor Askari asserted that Vice President Dick Cheney , in a visit to Saudi Arabia in May , pressured officials to crack down on militant traffic to Iraq .
But that message has not yet produced results , Askari said .
The close relationship between the U.S. and oil - rich Saudi Arabia has become increasingly difficult .
Saudi leaders in early February undercut U.S. diplomacy in the Israeli - Palestinian dispute by brokering , in Mecca , an agreement to form a Fatah - Hamas “ unity ” government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
And King Abdullah took Americans by surprise by declaring at an Arab League gathering that the U.S. presence in Iraq was illegitimate .
Advertisement
U.S. officials remain sensitive about the relationship .
Asked why U.S. officials in Iraq had not publicly criticized Saudi Arabia the way they had Iran or Syria , the senior military officer said , “ Ask the State Department .
This is a political juggernaut . ”
Last week when U.S. military spokesman Bergner declared Al Qaeda in Iraq the country ’s No. 1 threat , he released a profile of a thwarted suicide bomber , but said he had not received clearance to reveal his nationality .
The bomber was a Saudi national , the senior military officer said Saturday .
Would - be suicide bomber
The fighter , a young college graduate whose mother was a teacher and father a professor , had been recruited in a mosque to join Al Qaeda in Iraq .
He was given money for a bus ticket and a phone number to call in Syria to contact a handler who would smuggle him into Iraq .

Once the young Saudi made it in , he was under the care of Iraqis who gave him his final training and indoctrination .
At the very last minute , the bomber decided he did n’t want to blow himself up .
He was supposed to have been one of two truck bombers on a bridge outside Ramadi .
When the first truck exploded , he panicked and chose not to trigger his own detonator , and Iraqi police arrested him .
Al Qaeda in Iraq and its affiliate groups number anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 individuals , the senior U.S. military officer said .
Iraqis make up the majority of members , facilitating attacks , indoctrinating , fighting , but generally not blowing themselves up .
Iraqis account for roughly 10 % of suicide bombers , according to the U.S. military .

Times staff writers Paul Richter and Greg Miller in Washington contributed to this report .
What do you think is the # 1 determinant of a personâ€™s success or failure in any given activity ?
Do you think itâ€™s money ?
How about intelligence ?
Natural disposition ?
Supporting relationships ?
All of these have an impact , no doubt .
But the # 1 determinant ( and most accurate predictor ) of success or failure is a concept many people have never heard of : self - efficacy .
Self - Efficacy vs. Self - Esteem
Self - efficacy is defined as confidence in your ability to achieve a desired outcome , whereas self - esteem is a general feeling about your self - worth .
Self - esteem asks , “ How do I feel about myself ? ”
Self - efficacy asks , “ Can I do this ? ”
Why is Self - Efficacy Important ?
As I already mentioned , self - efficacy is the single greatest determinant of your success or failure .
If you have high self - efficacy , you are one step ahead of everyone else because you are willing to put your plans into motion .
Â Â Â Â
Maybe youâ€™ve always wanted to start your own business or go back to school â€ ”
So why havenâ€™t you ?
Because you think you will fail ?
Some people are so afraid of failure they never follow their heart .
When asked why they never went to college , pursued the career of their dreams , or attempted to find more satisfying relationships , they respond by saying , “ Oh , I couldnâ€™t do that . ”
This attitude is self - defeating .
Even if youÂ lack the skills to be successful at something today , you might develop the skillsÂ tomorrow if youÂ start trying .
Â Â
I am reminded of a quote from the movie Batman Begins , when Alfred says , “ Why do we fall , Master Wayne ?
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up . ”
We learn from our failures .
Just think about how many times you fellÂ before youÂ walked , how many meaningless sounds you made before you talked .
If you wo n’t risk failure , Â you ’llÂ never grow .
The sad irony is that the people with the greatest certainty of success ( as determined by a high self - efficacy ) are the ones most willing to risk failure .
This says something about human nature :
Even though failure is essential to growth , no one likes to fail .
Certainty of success breeds action .
FearÂ of failure breeds inaction and ineptitude .
Itâ€™s a vicious cycle .
If you lack self - efficacy , you will fear failure .
Â Â
If you fear failure , Â you will never act .
If you never act , you willÂ never succeed .
And if you never succeed , youÂ will never develop self - efficacy .
Developing Self - Efficacy
You canÂ build self - efficacy by accomplishing something .
Â AccomplishmentÂ helps youÂ learn to trust your skills .
Spend a few minutes thinking of something you have always wanted to do .
Pick something challenging , yet achievable .
NowÂ create a plan , writing down eachÂ step requiredÂ to obtain your goal . Â
Once you have your plan , work it .
Â Â
The first step you completeÂ is the most important because it signals commitment to action .
Â Â Youâ€ ™re probably going to fail , butÂ as Alfred so eloquently said , we fall soÂ we can learn to pick ourselves up .
Instead of fearing failure , embrace it .
Failure is your friend !
As long as your failures are a natural product of working your plan and are moving you closer to your desired end - state , they are good .
When you fail , Â figure out why and be determined to learn from it .
What can you do to improve your chances of success next time ?
Find someone who has accomplished what you are trying to do and ask for her advice .
As you workÂ your plan , be tenacious .
Â Â Success breeds self - efficacy , which breeds more success .
Â
Pretty soon you ’ll be wondering what all the fuss was about .
SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - Scientists have discovered a potentially marketable contraceptive in the venom of Chile ’s black widow spider , whose bite is fatal to many but can also cause prolonged , painful and involuntary erections in men .

Scientists have discovered a potentially marketable contraceptive in the venom of Chile 's black widow spider , whose bite is fatal to many but can also cause prolonged , painful and involuntary erections in men .
REUTERS / Carlos Barria CB
The venom of the Latrodectus mactans , a variety of black widow found only in the south of Chile , has spermicidal properties not found in black widows in other regions of the world , Chilean Dr Fernando Romero said .
Romero heads a research team that has studied the spider ’s venom for seven years , prompted by tales of Chilean farmers who acquired superhuman virility after being bitten by the black widow .
Initial studies focused on taking extracts from the venom to treat erectile dysfunction , but they soon discovered it had a molecule that also made it an effective contraceptive .
“ This is a great business opportunity , we are the creators of the spermicide , ” Romero told Reuters by telephone .
He said he believes the molecule ’s natural properties are superior to those of synthetic spermicides currently on the market .
“ For us in Chile , this has opened a window of opportunity to an incredible market , since currently there are no naturally based spermicides that have the properties of this discovered molecule , ” Romero said .
Romero , based at the Universidad de la Frontera in the southern city of Temuco , has already applied for a patent for his erectile dysfunction medicine .
His team discovered the property after looking into Chilean folklore that describes a virile man , one known to have spectacular sexual energy or many sexual partners , as being “ spider - bitten . ”
The Chilean black widow is also known as the wheat spider for the wheat fields it inhabits and where its farmer - victims receive their often fatal bite .
The spider ’s bite can kill children and the elderly , but among strong young farmers it leads to erections that can last for days and involve involuntary ejaculations .
At the end of the ordeal , the man is left sexually energized and feels physically stronger , the saying goes .
Romero said he was confident his research would be complete in a couple of years and the spermicide would become available to world markets .
“ We have to make sure there are no side effects ... so that it can be used as a gel in combination with condoms , or as suppositories for women . ”
The research is being supported by Chilean pharmaceuticals company Andromaco .
A " family values " media watchdog group called the Dove Foundation hopes to clean up Hollywood by making vaguely sinister computerized phone calls to millions of people all around the country .
In recent months Dove has muscled its way to the very top of the whocalled .us annoyance call list with nearly 900 complaints from coast to coast .
It turns out the non-profit is conducting a nationwide " survey " targeted determinedly at mothers and grandmothers , which it aims to present to those godless heathens running the entertainment industry .
" Never before has an opinion poll been taken of such a large number of people , " Dove explains on its website .
" We will present our findings to the studio heads , and to the national media .
This is sure to make headlines in the news .
That is why your participation is so important ! "
And the best part is , to participate , all you have to do is answer your phone !
And if you miss the call , Dove 's computer will call over and over again !
Several times a week !
At 8:00 in the morning !
It 'll call your mobile phone !
It 'll call you if you 're on the Do Not Call List !
The calls are characterized by someone asking for the " lady of the house , " and inquiring whether there are any young children or grandchildren at home .
( Nothing creepy about that ) .
The caller is reportedly prone to hanging up on people who ask too many questions , or who complain .
The Dove Foundation is a Michigan - based non-profit with a half - a- million dollar budget and a slew of conservative celebrities on its advisory board , including radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger , movie critic Michael Medved , and Lisa Whelchel , who played Blair on the Facts of Life .
It 's known for reviewing movies and TV shows , and issuing a seal of approval to the few that meet its cleanliness standards .
( Example , Rocky Balboa almost passed , " however , there is one GD uttered by Paulie in a fit of anger , " the reviewer laments .
" While many people might consider that term to accurately express the passion of the moment , Dove always draws the line at " ' Biblical profanity . ' " )
Dove is also known for a lawsuit filed last year by Missouri 's attorney general accusing the org of using its non-profit status to evade the state 's no - call list while shilling for a for - profit DVD - seller .
Non-profits can call anyone they want , you see , but businesses can't , and the Dove Foundation 's not - so - scientific survey ends with an invitation to a follow up call from Feature Films For Families Inc. about the many quality , family - friendly DVDs it sells .
In August , Dove and Feature Films paid $ 70,000 to settle the lawsuit , without admitting any wrongdoing .
Dove says it 's stopped calling numbers in the Show Me State .
The rest of the country is still ringing .
The big mystery of the Dove Foundation campaign is the identity of the eerily - calm " Cammie " – the voice behind many of the calls .
Is she a sophisticated computer with voice - recognition capabilities , or a real woman whose fembot ease derives from the blissful certitude of the righteous ?
Dove Foundation co-founder Richard Rolfe cleared it up for me .
The caller is a digitized voice , controlled by push - button by human operators who each handle several calls at once and do n't talk .
Rolfe also apologized for the reported hang - ups and unwanted repeat calls .
" Certainly , the system that ’s being used is an electronic system , and it is subject to error , and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that we are causing people . "
But not everyone finds the calls unwelcome , he points out .
" Over seven million households have participated in this survey , " Rolfe told me .
" Willingly .
I would even say enthusiastically . "
Rolfe referred me to the organization 's FAQ on the survey .
Incidentally , yesterday the title of the FAQ page , and others on Dove Foundation 's site , was " Hacked by Foreverislam . "
Today it 's back to normal .
As promised , here ’s the post about the development process of the BeerRiot Facebook app .
Aside :
Wow , rereading that last post about the Walled Gardens , I ca n’t believe I posted it .
Totally fluffy lameness .
Forgive me – this post will not be as bad .
I could very easily make this another post like others out there right now .
Many people are upset about how unfinished the Facebook API is .
Documentation is lacking ( and only available online ) , specifications are weak , and test environments could be more feature - rich .
But , except for that little digression above , I promise , this is not one of those posts .
Instead , I ’d really like to remark about how great it is developing this app in Erlang and Erlyweb !
There are nearly a dozen different Facebook API implementations – every object - oriented web language you can name .
Facebook ’s own official one is PHP5 .
I could have used the PHP version – Yaws comes complete with the ability to run PHP scripts .
But , since the rest of BeerRiot is already in Erlyweb …
I rewrote the Facebook client in Erlang .
And truthfully , it really was n’t that bad at all .
Erlang comes with very simple HTTP - communciation and XML - munging code .
Hell , there ’s even a simple way to compute an md5 sum .
Once I figured out how to actually put together a proper POST and walk a rather verbose XML tree , the rest was just mimicking as closely as possible the official PHP scripts .
All this is not to say the process was n’t without difficulties .
Yaws ’ standard url_encode proceedure does n’t like nested io_lists very much , so I ’m doing some ugly string / binary flattening .
And , Facebook ’s errors are nearly meaningless … but this is n’t about Facebook complaints . 😉
There are yet more benefits .
Rather than dealing with cron firing up processes periodically , I have fully - supervised Erlang gen_servers up to date constantly with what data needs to be pushed out to Facebook .
I can log into the running server and examine the current active sessions , monitor profile data pushes , etc .
Extending my existing Erlyweb application to handle new Facebook requests from the canvas page was even pretty simple ( once I finally – I think – understood the Facebook session rules ) .
Another controller , another view – bam !
One of my few real pains was source control .
I may need to finally bite the bullet and leave CVS .
I ’m hearing good things about SVN .
But that ’s another topic .
So , chalk up one more win for Erlang / Erlyweb .
Fantastic existing libraries .
Quick development environment .
Crazy server flexibility .
I ’m staying as long as I can .

George W. Bush went to Cleveland today and spoke about a number of issues .
One was health care .
How badly does this man need a reality check ?
Here 's what he said :
" I mean , people have access to health care in America .
After all , you just go to an emergency room . "
Would someone PLEASE send this man a copy of Sicko ?
Talk about being clueless !
First of all why does he think people wait eight hours or more in emergency rooms ?
Because morons like him say that 's all they need do to get quality health care .
BS .
You 're lucky if you do n't die in the waiting room these days .
Afterwards the hospital 's bill collectors will sue you for payment .
That 's if you get anything close to adequate care .
What if you have a serious illness like those in Sicko who HAD insurance and still could n't get treatment ?
Thousands of people die every year because the private insurance industry puts profit before care .
Eighteen thousand people die each year because they do n't have insurance .
They die because they have no doctors or primary care .
They die because they get substandard care when they get any at all and they die because , by the time they seek care it 's often too late .
They put off getting medical care because they 're uninsured or underinsured .
But President Bush says all they need to do is go to the emergency room .
Just what we need , longer waits there ...
He followed up that first insane moment with this one :
" I believe the best way to do so is to enable more people to have private insurance .
And the reason I emphasize private insurance , the best health care plan -- the best health care policy is one that emphasizes private health .
In other words , the opposite of that would be government control of health care . "
Of course he thinks that .
The health insurance industry has paid him big money to say things like that .
In fact , Michael Moore tells us in Sicko how many hundreds of thousands of dollars it took them to buy George W. Bush .
The man has been bought and paid for by the private insurance industry .
First of all the statement that private health insurance is the best plan is a lie .
All the facts prove otherwise .
Go read the horror stories on the Sicko website and see if you believe that sentence .
Then he simply states an out and out lie about S - CHIP :
" I 'm for it .
It came in when I was the governor of Texas ; I supported that . "
The fact is he fought that bill tooth and nail .
It passed over his dead body .
Then he lied about Medicaid :
" My position is , we ought to help the poor -- and we do , through Medicaid . "
The fact is his Administration has slashed funding for Medicaid .
Is that how we define " support " these days ?
George W. Bush , the face of cluelessness , the face of lies .

In order to promote the ribbon design as a replacement for menus and toolbars , Microsoft has decided to license the Office 2007 User Interface including the new " ribbon paradigm " .
One of the primary reasons is to promote a consistent look and feel across all Windows applications that want to use the ribbon paradigm .
What made the menu and toolbar paradigm so effective is that it is familiar to all users .
No matter what application one used , the menus and toolbars essentially worked the same .
In order for the ribbon paradigm to be effective , it needs to be just as consistent and ubiquitous .
Currently the only way for developers to use the ribbon paradigm is to hand roll their own version .
Microsoft fears that this will result in several inconsistent variants , so they have decided to share the user interface by publishing a publish design guidelines for developers .
The guidelines will require a license agreement , though it is royalty free .
Any application , even ones not running on Windows will be able to use the ribbon paradigm without fear of IP lawsuits .
The exception is applications that directly compete with the core Office products , namely Microsoft Word , Excel , PowerPoint , Outlook , and Access .
Impressions from the Channel 9 interview , suggest that Microsoft is n't really concerned about the ribbon paradigm as a revenue source .
Rather , they want to take over from Apple as the thought leaders for the next generation of user interfaces .
Expecting that other companies are going to copy the ribbon design anyways , and that bad copies will hurt the reputation of Microsoft Office , they decided the best course of action is to just make it easy to copy it the right way .
When asked if developers can implement ribbon - like interfaces that work differently but have the same underlying concept , Microsoft has said no .
Microsoft has never before been this serious about enforcing this level of consistency before .
Unlike past guidelines , mandatory requirements are legally mandatory according to the license agreement .
While they are there specifically to ensure a minimum level of user experience , some developers are certain to dislike the idea of being forced to abide by the guidelines .
To reiterate , this license agreement does have teeth .
If Microsoft finds a company not in compliance with the guidelines , they will be given the latter of 6 months or their next release to correct the issue .
Microsoft will not be directly providing the controls needed to fulfill the guidelines .
They are working with control vendors to fill this gap in the offering .
A list of vendors is not currently available .
The latest NBC / Wall Street Journal national poll results vividly show a population incredibly dissatisfied with their nation ’s political system .
In other countries in other times such a depressing level of confidence in government would send a signal to those running the government that a major upheaval is imminent .
But not here in the USA .
Why ?
First , here are the highlights of the poll that surveyed 1,008 adults from June 8 - 11 , with a margin of error of plus - minus 3.1 percentage points .
A whopping 68 percent think the country is on the wrong track .
Just 19 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction - the lowest number on that question in nearly 15 years .
And most of those with the positive view are probably in the Upper Class .
Bush ’s approval rating is at just 29 percent , his lowest mark ever in the survey .
Only 62 percent of Republicans approve , versus 32 percent who disapprove .
Take Republicans out of the picture and a fifth or less of Americans have a positive view of Bush .
Even worse , only 23 percent approve of the job that Congress is doing .
So much for that wonderful new Democratic control of Congress .
Bipartisan incompetence is alive and well .
On the economic front , nearly twice as many people think the U.S. is more hurt than helped by the global economy ( 48 to 25 percent ) .
Globalization does not spread wealth ; it channels it to the wealthy , making billionaires out of millionaires .
I have long asserted that Americans live in a delusional democracy with delusional prosperity and these and loads of other data support this view .
There is a super wealthy and politically powerful Upper Class that is literally raping the nation .
Meanwhile , the huge Lower Class continues to lose economic ground while their elected representatives sell them out to benefit the Upper Class .
Yet no rational person thinks that a large fraction of the population is ready to rise up in revolt against the evil status quo political - economic system that so clearly is not serving the interests of the overwhelming majority of Americans .
Why not ?
For a nation that was built on a revolt against oppressive governance by the British , something has been lost from our political DNA .
We apparently no longer have the gene for political rebellion .
It has been bred out of most of us .
And those of us that urge a Second American Revolution are seen as fringe , nutty subversives .
Part of the genius of our contemporary ruling class elites is that they have engineering a state of political and economic oppression that paradoxically is still embraced by the Lower Class .
The rational way to understand this is that ordinary , oppressed Americans are in a deep psychological state of self - delusion .
Despite all the empirical , objective evidence of a failed government , they fail to see rebellion opportunities .
Many still believe they live in the world ’s best democracy .
But across all elections considerably less than half the citizens even bother to vote anymore .
Yet , as the new NBC / Journal poll results show , people are cognitively aware of just how awful the political - economic system is .
Yet they are not feeling enough pain to seriously consider rebellion .
And it is visceral pain that must drive people to the daring act of rebellion .
Why is there insufficient pain for revolution ?
This is a deadly serious issue .
What is historically unique about America is that even the most oppressed and unfairly treated people are distracted by affordable materialism , entertainment , sports , gambling , and myriad other aspects of our frivolous , self - absorbed culture .
Even failed school and health care systems do not drive people , paying enormous sums to fill up their SUVs , to rebellion .
So , Americans are aware of their oppression , but the power elites have successfully drugged them with a plethora of pleasure - producing distractions sufficient to keep them under control .
We are free to b*tch , but too weak to revolt .
The Internet has provided a release valve for some pent up anger and frustration .
But it too has mostly become another source of distraction , rather than an effective tool for rebellion .
Though these new poll statistics make news , those in control of the political - economic system are not afraid that the population is on the verge of retaking their constitutionally guaranteed sovereign power and take back their nation .
Thousands of people like me keep writing books and articles and creating protest groups and events .
Those in power just find new , ingenious ways to keep the population distracted – if not through pleasure , then certainly through fear of terrorism .
Growing economic insecurity also contributes to self - paralysis , as do never - ending political lies .
What a system .
Even as the population has growing awareness of the dire condition of their nation , the move by the politically powerful on the right and left continues to seek a new immigration law that will solidify the selling out of America .
Business interests want more of those fleeing Mexico and other nations to keep wages low .
Instead of Mexicans rising up in rebellion against their oppressive government and economic system they escape to the USA .
But Americans have no such viable escape solution .
Though global warming will certainly make Canada increasingly attractive .
So what do Americans have – other than a terribly bleak future ?
Where is hope in our dismal world ?
In a bizarre twist of history that further illustrates just how impotent Americans have become , virtually all citizens are either unaware of or unreceptive to the ultimate escape route that the Framers of our Constitution gave us .
They anticipated that Americans could become quite dissatisfied with the federal government .
They feared that the political system could become incredibly corrupted by moneyed interests .
They were right .
So here we sit over 200 years after our nation was created unwilling to use what is explicitly given to us in Article V of the Constitution – the option to have a convention outside the control of Congress , the President and the Supreme Court to make proposals for constitutional amendments .
Do we really believe in the rule of law ?
If so , then we should understand that the supreme law of the land – what is in our Constitution – is the ultimate way to obtain the deep political and government reforms to restore true democracy and economic fairness to our society .

The White House is having trouble coming up with a credible explanation for the now infamous missing e-mails .
According to a White House spokesman :
I guess the bottom line is that our policy at the White House was not clear enough for employees .
And what does the White House e-mail policy say ?
" Federal law requires the preservation of electronic communications sent or received by White House staff , " says the handbook that all staffers are given and expected to read and comply with . [...]
As a result , personnel working on behalf of the EOP [ Executive Office of the President ] are expected to only use government - provided e-mail services for all official communication .
Law requires , sent or received , only use ... sounds pretty clear to me .
Teenage drinking is a major public health problem
The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £ 10 a week .
The study , led by Liverpool John Moores University , was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16 - year - olds .
Almost 90 % admitted to drinking alcohol , of which 38 % binged , 24 % drank frequently and 50 % drank in public .
Drinking in the home environment , if it is done properly , can teach young people respect for alcohol
Dr Mark Bellis
Liverpool John Moores University
The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol , and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public , and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them .
Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13 - year - olds .
Call for clampdown
But the latest study , published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention , and Policy , questions this approach .
Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75 % of 14 - year - olds had tried alcohol .
" The question is : are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment , or are they learning behind some bushes in the park , or in a bar where they should not be in the first place ?
" The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink , they are hiding their drinking , they can't talk to their parents about it .
" Drinking in the home environment , if it is done properly , can teach young people respect for alcohol , and how to consume in moderation . "
Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family .
Frank Soodeen , campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern , said the charity had taken its lead from the law , which prohibits under - 15s from being served alcohol in public places .
He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity 's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink .
He said : " We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers . "
The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol , and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem .
But mammoths rarely die in the controlled - temperature conditions necessary to preserve eggs without harm .
Intact organs are seldom found .
To retrieve viable sperm or eggs “ seems an even more remote chance , ” said Alex Greenwood , a biologist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk , Va. , who has worked on mammoth DNA .

The alternative , far more laborious , would be to analyze the sequence of DNA units in the mammoth ’s genome , make a copy of the DNA , and have it take over an elephant ’s egg .
Each of those steps has long seemed impossible .
But advances in the last few months have made each seem slightly less daunting .
Analyzing the DNA sequence is complicated by the fact that ancient DNA , when it can be retrieved at all from fossil bones , is always highly degraded .
The genome in every cell breaks down after death into thousands of small fragments of DNA .
But a new kind of DNA decoding machine happens to use such fragments as its starting material .
At McMaster University in Canada , Hendrik Poinar and Régis Debruyne plan to use of one the machines , from 454 Life Sciences , to reconstruct a mammoth genome .
The remaining obstacle is money .
If they had $ 1 million , they could generate a rough draft of a mammoth genome in about a month , Dr. Debruyne said .
The reconstructed sequence of DNA units would then need to be turned into an actual mammoth genome .
Mammalian genomes are made up of chromosomes of about 100 million DNA units in length and are beyond the capacity of current synthesis .
Still , researchers at the Venter Institute in Rockville , Md. , say they are close to synthesizing the genome of a bacterium that is 500,000 units long .

Interview : Richard Gere ’s role as a fraudster is a far cry from his sincerity in real life
By Lesley o’toole
“ We have a President now who is clearly a liar .
The Vice - President lies constantly .
We have a Secretary of State who lies , a Secretary of Defense who lies and an Attorney General who lies .
This is insane .
The secret government that they have put together is worse than most anything in the former Soviet Union .
It ’s unthinkable . ”

$ 300,000 Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 Destroyed
This marks the 2nd time the next - generation supercar has been totalled on public roads - and it's not even available on the market yet !
Monday , June 19 , 2006 Lamborghini officially unveiled the next generation Murcielago , known as the LP640 , at the Geneva Motor Show this past March .
Originally projected to hit the streets in spring , the date had been pushed back to September , which means this exotic is not yet available for consumers .
Lamborghini is on schedule to produce a total of 300 units this year , all of which have already been sold out .
Although the LP640 is not yet available to the public , there are a handful currently being driven on public roads usually with automotive journalists or Lamborghini drivers behind the wheel .
That 's why it comes as a shock that not only one , but two of these pre-production models has already been wrecked on public roads .
The most recent being in St. Andrae , Austria on June 15 , 2006 .
According to witnesses , the Lamborghini lost control and crashed into a tree after attempting to pass another vehicle .
The car burst into flames - the driver had to be flown to a nearby hospital after suffering severe burns .
The Lamborghini was on its way to a press event at the time of the accident .
Although it 's not unusual for exotic cars to be wrecked on test tracks prior to full production , it is rare to see wrecks piling up on public roads when there are only a handful of the cars available .
The question begs , is the LP640 more difficult to handle than its predecessor or is this simply a case of bad luck ?
The LP640 certainly has more power , adding 6 mph to the Murcielago 's top speed and slashing the 0 - 60 mph acceleration from 3.8 seconds down to 3.4 seconds .
But more power does n't necessarily make a car harder to handle .
The LP640 is still very similar to the older Murcielago which is not without controversy .
There is at least one case of an owner who claims the car simply veered off the road by itself , causing a terrible rollover accident .
The owner even created a web site documenting the accident and his concern over the safety of the Murcielago .
On the site , he writes :
" The car suddenly turns right on the Autobahn which is straight , dry and in quite good condition with hardly any traffic , and after a very fast 90 degree turn goes through the guard rail and then lands with the top down in a forest about 150 meters from the place where the guard rail was broken through .
The possibility of a tire failure is being eliminated by experts , also the road was in good condition and no hindrances . "
First LP640 Wreck
The first accident involving the LP640 occurred a few months ago .
Details on the crash are sketchy , but the car was apparently being tested on public roads when it lost control , hit a guardrail on the highway and rolled over .
Obviously , it 's always a concern when a high - performance vehicle is wrecked during pre-production .
On the brighter side , engineers do get an opportunity to fine - tune and correct any issues that might be responsible for the accidents .
Safety has become a big issue for exotic car manufacturers lately , especially after a recent lawsuit was filed against Porsche for " selling an unsafe car " .
The suit claims the Porsche Carrera GT has design defects that make it a poor - handling car , mainly that the rear end can lose traction easily .
The suit also claims that the car is too difficult to handle at high speeds for the average driver without instruction .
The suit was filed by the wife of Cory Rudl , an internet marketing superstar who was killed when the Carrera GT he was riding in crashed at a track .
Many people feel drivers of exotic cars should realize that getting into a high performance vehicle has inherent risks that you wo n't find with your average car .
Whether or not the manufacturers should be held liable for inexperienced drivers is a matter of debate we 'll see played out with the Porsche lawsuit .
As for the LP640 , only time will tell whether or not the car has any handling issues .
Out of the 300 that will be produced this year , keep an eye out on how many end up on WreckedExotics .

The House Judiciary Committee will vote today on whether to recommend to the full House that Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten be held in contempt of Congress .
The committee is expected to recommend that they be charged with statutory contempt .
The vote count on the committee is unclear , though it 's expected to pass .
The question is whether Republicans will agree to stand up for their own prerogatives against the overreaching executive branch , and if so , in what numbers .
Does a successful vote today mean Miers and Bolten go to prison ?
No .
It is essentially a recommendation that the full House consider the question , and a majority vote of the House is necessary before the process can move forward .
If the full House votes to hold Miers and Bolten in contempt , is that enough ?
Not anymore .
These days ( really , since 1982 if you 're keeping score at home ) the executive branch claims the House can't have contempt of Congress charges prosecuted , because it controls the U.S. Attorneys , and that 's who the law says is supposed to handle the case if the Congress votes for contempt .
Keep in mind that the contempt charges are being voted on because the executive branch refuses to testify on whether or not it 's exerting improper political control over their U.S. Attorneys .
So if the full House votes to hold Miers and Bolten in contempt and the White House refuses to allow a prosecution to go forward , what happens ?
Well , nothing .
The " administration " laughs in your face and rides off into the sunset .
Does that mean the Congress has no other options ?
No .
It may opt to use " inherent contempt " procedures , in which the aggrieved house orders the detainment of non-compliant witnesses , and tries them directly before the body , without reliance on any other branch of government .
Arrests are made under the authority of the Sergeant at Arms , and contemnors are detained on Congressional authority , most likely in the D.C. Capitol Jail , a facility maintained by the municipal government of the District of Columbia .
Are there other options ?
Yes .
The House may file suit in federal court , seeking an order compelling the U.S. Attorney to act , perhaps seeking an injunction against White House interference , or a declaratory judgment of some sort reinforcing the validity of Congress ' right to have charges brought .
But the last time such an impasse came about ( 1982 , in the case of EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch ) , the Reagan administration actually filed suit first , seeking to block enforcement of the Congressional subpoenas , and to have the contempt case against Gorsuch dismissed , because she was acting under presidential orders to assert executive privilege .
By the way , the White House counsel who coordinated the 1982 strategy was none other than Fred Fielding , who -- coincidentally , no doubt -- is the current White House counsel coordinating the strategy today .
( His assistant at the time : now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , John Roberts . )
The case was dismissed by the court , with an admonition to both parties to work out their differences on their own .
So the lawsuit route is a crap shoot , at best .
And almost certainly will cost valuable time and momentum .
Is impeachment an option ?
Yes .
Eventually , the Congress may find itself unable to compel compliance through either contempt mechanism or through the courts .
If so , and if the need to reject executive overreaching becomes compelling enough , they may opt to impeach , on grounds similar to those cited in the third article of impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee in the case of Richard M. Nixon .
Are there any other options ?
Yes , again .
One , of course , is give up and go home , conceding that the Congress ultimately has no power to enforce its subpoena power -- either forever after , or at least until such time as the composition of the Congress is such that an impeachment vote against some future intransigent administration becomes feasible , or the composition of the federal courts changes sufficiently .
Another option would be to legislatively devise some sort of middle ground , and establish new ground rules from scratch that would allow the Congress a better shot at vindicating its rights in court .
But that has n't happened yet , and time is running short .
In sum , the options ( in no particular order ) are these :
Try to negotiate a settlement acceptable to both the Congrses and the White House Roll the dice on statutory contempt and see what the U.S. Attorney does
Use the inherent contempt procedure , either after statutory contempt has failed , or as a concurrent threat to encourage the U.S. Attorney to move Create some new procedure legislatively , and hope it stands up to court challenges from the " administration " when Congress actually tries to use it Move to impeach , whether the target be Gonzales ( as the U.S. Attorney 's boss ) , Bush ( for misapplying executive privilege claims ) , or Cheney ( if Congress believes it has established a connection between him and this particular obstruction , which to this point they apparently do not , despite Senator Whitehouse 's revelations yesterday )
Do nothing , and hope some future administration does the same thing but is in an even weaker position politically when it does so , and can be brought to heel
One potential downside to keep in mind regarding the above options , particularly numbers 2 - 4 : the Bush " administration " may also attempt to claim the president has the right to pardon anyone charged with contempt .
Will that work ?
For statutory contempt , most likely yes .
For inherent contempt , most likely no -- though you can expect the opposite to be asserted , too , if it comes to it .
For some new procedure ?
Well , we 'll have to wait and see , though a smart approach would be to define any jail time involved as being analogous to that involved in civil ( i.e. , coercive ) contempt .
And for those who would rather take the word of some actual experts , there 's this newly - revised report from the Congressional Research Service : Congress 's Contempt Power : Law , History , Practice and Procedure .

Teh intarwebs are a funny series of tubes .
By now , everyone who even remotely cares ( and millions who do n’t ) know that Viacom have launched a US $ 1 billion lawsuit against YouTube .
The legal heavy hitting is all handled by Google lawyers who have been preparing for this battle for years – well before they bought YouTube .
It seems that one of Google ’s lawyers has a bit of a thing for foreskins .
And as I ’m one of the web ’s renowned experts on the subject of foreskins he became a reader of my blog .
And now he ’s passed me some very interesting information .
“ Hey , ” he emailed me , “ you ’re a heavy YouTube user and you hate the maximalist approach to copyright enforcement , right ?
Well , you ’ll be interested in this : we record all our negotiations without the other party knowing .
Here ’s the audio from our final discussion with Viacom before they launched their lawsuit . ”
And what a revelation that piece of audio was .
Because not everyone is able to listen to audio , I ’m posting a transcript here .
That , and the fact that it ’s way easier for me to make up a transcript than it would be for me to fake the audio .
The transcript starts at a pivotal point of the negotiation , when dollar amounts are being discussed .

But you ’re making money .
And we ’re not getting any of it .
You HAVE to give us money .
GL : We do n’t think that argument holds up legally .
Plus , it ’s really gross the way you drool every time you mention money .
VL : You smug bastards !
Do you know how much it pisses people off when you act like you can do whatever you want without asking ?
Even when you ’re right ?
Our legal opinion is that when you make ad revenue from a page that displays our content you owe us money .
We think our argument is right because we make more money that way !
GL : Why do you not understand that this grows your audience , it does n’t take away from you ?
Some of your highest profile creators like the makers of The Daily Show , The Colbert Report and South Park are on record as saying more distribution is better for them even when there ’s no direct remuneration .
The bigger their audience , the more opportunities they have .
VL : Creators ?
Who gives a fuck what they think ?
We ’re the owners !
Those bitches are bought and paid for .
It ’s just as well they do n’t want any money from you because we are n’t planning on giving them any .
This is about VIACOM not those fuckers .

I ’m about to show you a confidential document .

If your content is really as valuable as you think then you ’ll make a packet from the ads that will feature on the same pages as your content .

You take that or you take nothing .

It ’s your arrogance that pisses us off as much as our content being stolen .

We ’re going to prove you make your money by stealing from us .

Our arrogance is commensurate with our intelligence .
Your aggressiveness is commensurate with your greed .
We ’re going to defend ourselves based on law , not a sense of entitlement .
Try actually reading the DMCA – we respond to any and all takedown requests and we ’re protected .
It ’s there in black and white and it ’s backed up by legal precedents .
VL : You ’d have nothing without all the copyrighted material on YouTube !
GL : That ’s a matter of opinion .
Here ’s a statement of fact : you work with us on our terms or you get nothing .
VL : ( walking out the door )
We ’ll see you in court .
GL : Yeah , and we ’ll see you begging on the street in ten years after your company collapses into ruin because you could n’t adapt .
And you know what ?
I ’m going to piss in your begging bowl .
VL : ( response not clearly audible – sounds like “ you bitch ” )
GL : ( shouting after departing Viacom lawyers )
Here ’s a business plan you can have for free : develop a site more compelling than YouTube and you wo n’t have to worry .
Everyone will abandon YouTube and come to you instead .
Good luck wrapping your head around that , you chump !

It ’s something we ’re all looking for – the perfect solution that will minimize our work life while still getting the stuff done that we need to get done .
Well , that one solution does n’t exist , but with a combination of strategies , you can get to where you want to be .
Now , none of these tips will turn your life around .
But they can make a big difference , and when used together , your work life might just be enjoyable , productive , low - stress and high fun .
And these tips wo n’t work for everyone .
They ’re not meant to be used as a step - by - step guide .
It ’s a list of strategies that work — choose your favorites and give them a try .
One goal .
Set a single goal that you want to accomplish this year —
I know that we probably want to do 12 goals , but it ’s too difficult to maintain your focus on more than one goal , and it diffuses your energy .
Pick one goal for the next 12 months , and then a single 3 - 6 month goal that will lead to your 12 - month goal .
Then choose something you can accomplish within the next 1 - 2 weeks that will lead to the 3 - 6 month goal .
Now focus on that short - term goal , giving it all your energy , and when it ’s achieved , set your next short - term goal until you ’ve accomplished your medium - term goal .
Find your passion .
All the rest of these tips are just window dressing if you find work you ’re passionate about .
If you ’re not in a job you love , start your quest to find that job now .
You do n’t need to quit your current job right away , but start doing some research on the web , think about what you ’re really interested in , talk to others who are doing what you want to do .
Make this your one goal for this year , and it could turn out to be your best year ever .
Work from home .
This is not a miracle solution , but it ’s something many people would love to do .
And it ’s completely possible — more people are doing it every day .
Is it something you want to do ?
Give it some thought , and find a solution that works for you .
You could telecommute for your current job — plan your pitch to your boss today , making sure to focus on how it will benefit your company .
Or you could find another job that allows you to work from home — even if the pay is a little less at first , you will have reduced costs from not having to commute or eat lunch at work or buy expensive work clothes , and you will also have increased satisfaction .
Come in early .
If telecommuting is n’t your thing , try getting to work 30 - 60 minutes before the rest of the crowd .
Or even more .
This might require you to learn to wake up early , but the benefits are many : you skip the morning traffic , you can work without distractions until the rest of your coworkers come in , you can get a jump start on your day , you can be ahead of the crowd and get more done .
Getting an early start is a great way to start your work day and to become more productive .
Work 4 days .
If you can control your work schedule ( or can convince your boss to change it ) , try working fewer days .
Working four days a week not only gives you an additional day off , but it forces you to be more productive in the days you do work .
Think about it : if you knew that you had to get your work done by the end of Thursday , you will focus more on what really needs to get done , and goof off less too .
What would you do less ?
Email ?
Read stuff on the Internet ?
Chat ?
Play solitaire ?
Those unimportant things fade away when your time is limited .
Work 6 - hour days .
Same concept as above , but reconfigured .
Personally , I ’d choose the 4 - day workweek , but that ca n’t work for everyone .
Get in early and leave even earlier — imagine the 7 a.m. - 1 p.m. work day .
With focus , it can be done .
Work 20 hours .
This might sound impossible .
And if you are a full - time employee somewhere , it might be .
But you could either 1 ) telecommute , and get your work done in fewer hours ; or 2 ) work for yourself .
Now , I ’ll admit that these options wo n’t work for everyone , but they can be done .
And I ’ll also admit that in working for yourself , you tend to work more hours , not fewer .
But if you limit your hours to 20 , it will force you to focus in the same what that working four days a week does .
And if you focus on only those tasks that are truly important ( see next item ) , you can get a lot done in 20 hours a week .
MITs .
Each day , make a list with only three items : the three Most Important Tasks you want to accomplish today .
Make at least one of them related to your One Goal .
The others might be something you ’ve been procrastinating on , or a big project that ’s due today , or something similar .
Ideally , these MITs are really important tasks — ones that will gain you longer - term recognition or income .
Now focus on these , making sure to accomplish them .
It ’s best to do your MITs first thing in the morning , before you get interrupted by a bunch of other things .
If you do only three things today ( you could choose more or less than three MITs , but I ’ve found that three works for me ) , make it your MITs .
Batch process .
There are usually a bunch of smaller tasks that we have to do that are n’t that important .
Email , paperwork , phone calls , things like that .
Instead of doing those little things throughout the day , giving you busywork to interrupt and distract you from your important tasks , batch them together and do them at one set time each day .
Write these tasks down on a small list , and with an hour left in your work day ( or whatever works for you ) , start processing them as quickly as possible , ticking them off your list .
Telecommute 1 day a week .
If you ca n’t convince your boss to let you work completely from home , try one day a week .
You could start out by calling in sick , but still getting a lot done from home .
Or tell him you want to give it a try , just for one day this week , because you think it will make you more productive .
Freelance as a 2nd job .
This is something I do , and I earn an extra $ 2,000 a month doing it .
It ’s extra work , but it helps me to pay the bills ( and pay off debt and save ) .
Eventually , if you get good at the freelancing gig , you could make it your full - time work .
To do this as a second job , set aside some time each day for freelance work .
I ’ve used early mornings ( I get up an hour earlier and do one assignment ) , my lunch hour , work time ( with permission ) , or evenings .
If you could do 1 - 2 assignments a day , you will be making a decent extra income , and starting yourself down the road to working for yourself .
Brown bag it .
This is n’t life - changing , but I take my lunch to work every day — leftovers or a sandwich , usually , with snacks such as fruits on the side .
How does this help ?
Well , it saves me a lot of money ( a few thousand a year ) and it allows me to work through lunch , giving me time for that freelancing gig I talked about above or perhaps allowing you to leave work early .
Cycle to work .
Again , not necessarily life - changing , but if you can commute even just a couple times a week by bike , you will save money on gas , reduce the stress of rush - hour traffic , and get your daily exercise done at the same time .
A shower at work ( or at a nearby gym ) helps make this easier .
Take high - profile projects .
If you just take the grunt work , your boss might or might not appreciate it , but it certainly wo n’t make you a star and you wo n’t go very far .
Instead , volunteer for the big projects , the ones that will make a name for both you and your company .
If there are n’t any available , make your own .
Be sure you can do them well , but if you do , these projects will have a huge impact on your life .
The tasks on these projects should be your MITs every day .
If you take on high - impact projects , you can be more productive working a half day than if you worked 10 hours a day on tasks that wo n’t matter next week .
Automate your business .
If you have your own business , or set one up on the side , find ways to make it automated as much as possible .
Everything can be outsourced , from manufacturing to mailing to advertising to taking orders to customer support to credit card processing .
Put your business front online , with online ordering , and give your outsourcers the ability to make decisions ( with certain limits , following rules you set ) without your approval , removing yourself from the bottleneck .
If it ’s completely automated , your business will require minimal work from you once you ’ve got it set up .
Now all you have to do is check now and then to make sure things are running smoothly , and make sure your money is being deposited in your bank account .
Nice .
Bank your raise .
If you get a raise ( and if you have n’t in awhile , you need to make it happen by taking on high - profile projects and then asking for the raise ) , do n’t increase your spending .
Take the raise and put the entire amount in the bank , making it automatically deducted from your paycheck or checking account and sent to a high - interest online savings account .
Does n’t increase your productivity , but it can increase your financial stability .
Clear your desk .
A messy desk might be the sign of a creative mind , but in my experience ( I ’ve tried both messy and now clean desks ) , having a desk that ’s clean is much more calming , much more productive , and more organized .
Most importantly , it reduces visual clutter and allows you to focus on the task at hand , increasing your productivity .
Clearing your desk can take a chunk of time , but it ’s worth it : take all your papers ( everything ! ) and put them in your inbox , or in a pile if they do n’t fit .
Now process through them , one at a time , from top to bottom , filing , acting upon , delegating , trashing each document or noting tasks on a to - do list for later ( and filing the to - be - acted - upon documents in an action folder ) .
Remove other knick knacks and put any office supplies or tools in a drawer ( and empty out your drawers while you ’re at it ) .
From here on out , everything goes in your inbox , and you process it to empty every day using the steps outlined here .
Granularize .
If a project or task seems too intimidating , split it into smaller tasks , and just focus on the first task you need to do .
For example , instead of “ Research report ” , just find three sources on the Internet .
You can read each of these sources and take notes after that .
Delegate .
Get out of the habit of thinking you need to do everything yourself .
Relinquish control and learn to trust others .
If you do n’t think a person can handle a task , take the time to train him to do so .
It will save you tons of time and headaches later .
And by delegating , you empower others while shrinking your to - do list , leaving you to focus on what ’s really important .
Eliminate .
Your to - do list is a mile long .
You ’ll never be able to do all those things .
Cut it in half by crossing out stuff that does n’t really need to be done , or delegating others .
And from that list , just choose the three most important things that you need to do today .
Get in the habit of eliminating as many of the tasks and processes you normally do as possible , and your work life will be greatly simplified .
Clear distractions .
In addition to clearing your desk , you can allow yourself to focus more by eliminating all distractions : email or IM alerts , Twitter , other websites ( in fact , turn off the Internet ) , phones , visual clutter around you or on your walls .
Wear headphones so your coworkers interrupt you less , or let them know that you ’re not available right now .
Focus more , and you ’ll get more done .
Kill meetings .
One of the biggest time - wasters in our work lives .
Most of the time , a meeting could have been accomplished with an email or a phone call .
Beg out of meetings ( or if you ’re the boss , eliminate them ) by claiming you have a project due that you need to work on .
Then be very productive during the time you would be at the meeting , and show your boss how much you got done .
Email once a day .
Do n’t do email throughout the day .
Set one time during the day to process email , then crank through it , getting your inbox to empty ( use the same steps in “ clear your desk ” above ) .
If you check email throughout the day , you are allowing yourself to be distracted and at the mercy of anyone who sends you a request .
And by sending out emails all day , you are generating even more responses in return , compounding the problem .
Batch process , and you will get a lot more done .
Same applies to reading your RSS feeds and checking your blog stats and reading your forums .
Astronomers at the WM Keck Observatory have identified a moon orbiting Xena , a body they argue is the 10th planet in our solar system .
They have called the moon Gabrielle , after Xena 's sidekick in the TV series Xena : Warrior Princess .
Regular readers may remember that Xena 's ( formally 2003 UB313 ) discovery reignited an old debate about what exactly ought to be classified as a planet .
There is also some debate over who found the planet first , but we will not revisit that here because for astronomers , the important question has always been whether or not Xena has a moon .
The California Institute of Technology 's Michael Brown explains that although observations can show that Xena is physically larger than Pluto , without a companion body , it would be impossible to tell whether or not it is more massive .
" Finding a moon ... allows us to precisely measure the mass of the planet .
A more massive planet will pull on the moon tightly and it will circle the planet more quickly , " he writes .
" A less massive planet will allow the moon to have a slow lazy orbit around the planet .
We do n't yet know the speed of the moon , but when we do we will suddenly have new insight into the size and even composition of the 10th planet . "
The discovery could also shed new light on the history of the solar system .
Several of the larger Kuiper belt objects , of which Xena is one , have moons , but how they acquired them is an open question .
The astronomical community has also yet to settle the question of whether Xena is a planet , and indeed , whether or not Pluto should be given that status .
Many astronomers feel that Pluto ought more properly to be classed as a minor planet , or even just as a large Kuiper belt object .
Xena 's discovery has prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider its definition of a planet .
Currently it considers both Pluto and Xena to be trans -Neptunian objects , and says that until it has drawn up its new definition , that is what they will remain . ®
Oscar winner Robert De Niro has filed a motion against Fireman 's Fund Insurance to dismiss a suit the company filed against him in 2006 .
De Niro 's rep Stan Rosenfield tells TMZ " This was filed in response to Fireman 's Fund 's decision to sue Robert De Niro because he was diagnosed with cancer . "
According to the motion , filed today in a U.S. federal court , De Niro was diagnosed with prostate cancer in October 2003 .
The documents say that when he was diagnosed , De Niro was days away from starting work on the film " Hide and Seek . "
Because of De Niro 's diagnosis and subsequent treatment for his illness , he was unavailable to start working on the movie as scheduled , and shooting was held up almost 60 days .
Due to this delay , Fireman 's Fund , the insurance carrier on the film , paid over $ 1.8 million to reimburse the studio for its lost costs .
In October of 2006 , Fireman 's Fund filed suit against De Niro , claiming he misrepresented the state of his health on a medical certificate they issued him for the film .
De Niro claims that he was diagnosed on October 15 , 2003 after undergoing a prostate biopsy on the 10th .
The medical certificate filed with the insurance company was dated two days earlier , on October 13 .
Fireman 's
Fund acknowledges in their suit against the actor that he had not yet " been diagnosed with or treated for " prostate cancer , but they decided to sue him anyway .
De Niro , in today 's motion , says there was no way he misrepresented his health on the certificate because he had n't yet been diagnosed with cancer .
De Niro is asking the court to immediately dismiss the lawsuit against him .
A call to Fireman 's Fund was not immediately returned .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If your boss wants to transfer you to Moscow this year , he 'd better offer you a fair sum to do so - or even a downright handsome one depending on where you live now .
That 's because Moscow has just been designated the world 's most expensive city for the second year in a row by Mercer Human Resource Consulting .
Using the cost of living in New York as a base , Mercer determined Moscow is 34.4 percent more expensive after taking into account the cost of housing , transportation , food , clothing , household goods and entertainment .
Moscow tops the list as the most expensive city for the second year in a row .
World 's most expensive cities 2007 1 . Moscow 2 . London 3 . Seoul 4 . Tokyo 5 . Hong Kong 6 . Copenhagen 7 . Geneva 8 . Osaka 9 . Zurich 10 .

" The appreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar , combined with ever - increasing accommodation charges , has driven up costs for expatriates in Moscow , " Mercer research manager Nathalie Constantin - Metral said in a statement .
A luxury two - bedroom in Moscow now rents for $ 4,000 a month ; a CD costs $ 24.83 , and an international newspaper , $ 6.30 , according to Mercer .
By comparison , a fast food meal with a burger is a steal at $ 4.80 .
London takes the No. 2 spot , up from No. 5 a year ago , thanks to higher rents and a stronger British pound relative to the dollar .
Mercer estimates London is 26 percent more expensive than Gotham these days .
Following closely on London 's heels are Seoul and Tokyo -- Nos. 3 and 4 , respectively -- both of which are 22 percent more expensive than New York , while No. 5 Hong Kong is 19 percent more costly .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , Asuncion in Paraguay is ranked as the world 's least expensive city for the fifth year running .
Mercer estimates that to live in Asuncion costs half as much as it does to live in New York .
Among North American cities , New York and Los Angeles are the most expensive and are the only two to rank in the top 50 of the world 's most expensive cities .
But both have fallen in their rankings since last year 's survey -- New York came in 15th , down from 10th place , while Los Angeles fell to 42nd from 29th place a year ago .
San Francisco came in a distant third at No. 54 , down 20 places from a year earlier .
Toronto , meanwhile , ranks as Canada 's most expensive city but fell 35 places to take 82nd place worldwide .
In Latin America , Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are still the most expensive cities , coming in at Nos. 62 and 64 worldwide .
In Australia , Sydney is the priciest place to live and ranks No. 21 worldwide .
In the Middle East , Tel Aviv takes the cake , coming in at No. 17 globally , while in Africa , Accra in Ghana will cost you the most .
It ranks No. 76 worldwide .
Hello , How Are You Doing ?
Groundbreaking research with apes that understand English words .
May 29 , 2007  --
The Great Ape Trust in Des Moines , Iowa , is home to seven bonobos -- a close relative of the chimpanzee -- and three orangutans .
But if you think Iowa might be a strange place for them to live , do n't say it out loud … these apes understand English .
Really .
No kidding .
Watch more on this story tonight on ' Nightline ' tonight at 11:35 p.m. EDT .
You can talk to the apes , and they know what you are saying .
The residents of the Great Ape Trust are part of groundbreaking language research where the apes are being taught to communicate with humans by pressing 350 lexigrams -- symbols that appear on a screen and represent thoughts and objects .
The superstar is 26 - year - old Kanzi , whom Bill Fields has been working with for years .
To communicate , Fields speaks to Kanzi , who then points to the lexigrams to respond and demonstrate a level of understanding .
" Qualitatively , there is no difference between Kanzi 's language and my language , " Fields said .
" It 's a matter of degree . "
The key to ensuring they grasp the language , the researchers said , is to start teaching them when they are young , just like you would with human babies .
" Language is culturally acquired .
Its not learned , " said Fields .
" It 's acquired in the immediate postnatal antogyny of the organisms life .
The only organism capable of learning language are babies . "
They 've been communicating with bonobos through the keyboard for almost three years , relying on a technique developed in 1971 and also used at the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University and other facilities .
At the Great Ape Trust , researchers said the apes would likely never be able to vocalize words like humans ; they are limited by the range of their vocal chords among other things .
However , Fields swears he has heard Kanzi try to say " thank you . "
' Surprise ' From an Interview With an Ape
When they begin to work with the apes , some pick up the vocabulary quickly while others never acquire the language .
Rob Shumaker has known
Azy , a majestic , huge male orangutan , for more than 20 years .
He talks to Azy , just like he would speak to one of his children , or a longtime friend .
" When I 'm around them we just kind of talk normally , " he explained .
" I use my normal vocabulary , my normal voice my normal gestures . "
Sound beyond belief ?
During a visit to the Great Ape Trust , I sat down with Kanzi the Bonobo -- the first Ape I have ever interviewed .
I read Kanzi a series of words , and then without fail , he hit the corresponding lexigram symbol on a touch screen .
I said " Egg . "
He pressed " Egg . "
I said , " M and M . "
He pressed " M and M . "
Then Kanzi took control of the conversation and pressed the symbol for " Surprise ! "
Needless to say , I was quite surprised , having never actually spoken to an ape before .
But Kanzi was pointing to a box of candy that I was sitting near .
That is the surprise that he wanted .
Moments like this are proof that these conversations help scientists learn about apes , from the apes themselves .
" If we have some common means of communicating with each other , " said Shumaker , " we suddenly have exponentially large number of topics that we can explore . "
" It allows Kanzi to tell me if his stomach hurts , his head hurts or if he'd like to be alone or if he 's afraid or scared , " Fields added .
Speaking Up for Their Survival
There 's another possible impact of the communication with these apes :
These celebrity apes may help raise awareness of the plight of apes in the wild .
Shumaker said there is an estimated 10,000 to 50,000 bonobos left in the wild , and 50 - 55,000 orangutans in the wild , so raising awareness of just how smart these creatures are might encourage the public to take their problems more seriously .
" The research we conduct here powerfully informs people about the nature of great ape intelligence , " Shumaker said .
" We know that humans and great apes share far more than they differ .
I think we have to recognize that .
If that does not compel us to preserve great apes in the wild , I do n't know what can . "
The insight into ape learning might also give some insight into human development .
" It tells us about how we learn everything , " said Fields , " what the antecedents are to the kind of powerful learning that could occur in humans . "
Sometimes the similarities to humans are downright eerie .
When I asked Kanzi if he wanted coffee , he enthusiastically shook his head up and down .
Bonobos share 98 percent of their DNA with humans -- they also apparently share a love of decaf caramel machiatos .

DES MOINES —
The world according to Rudolph W. Giuliani is a very , very scary place .
Just listen to the former mayor of New York City in a hotel ballroom in the scorching Midwest , two minutes and 14 seconds into a speech on “ Restoring Fiscal Discipline and Cutting Wasteful Washington Spending . ”
“ I will continue to keep America on offense in the terrorist war against us , because I think that ’s the overriding issue of our day , ” he declared .
Then he leaped into a detailed discussion that wound its way through earmarks and out - of - control federal budgets to the threat of Democratic tax increases and — as always — back to terrorism .
While talking taxes , Giuliani spoke of listening to a Democratic presidential debate .
“ They never mentioned the word ‘ Islamic terrorist ’ during the debate .
Maybe they think they ’re going to be insulting somebody if they say it .
I ’m trying to figure out who would be insulted — other than Islamic terrorists . ”
The man who has been billed as “ America ’s Mayor ” and who wants deeply to become America ’s next president hewed most closely to his core campaign message last week as the days wore on , and the twin towers rose into high relief .
An arid hour on fiscal responsibility in Des Moines on Wednesday was followed by 12 minutes of terrorism and Fidel Castro in Hialeah , Fla. , on Thursday .
But a silent appearance at Friday ’s memorial service for nine firefighters killed in the line of duty in Charleston , S.C. , distilled Giuliani ’s message better than anything he could actually say .
Bagpipes keened “ Amazing Grace . ”
The eulogies were all about danger and heroism ; about brave souls who race toward the inferno , while everyone else heads for safety ; about “ the largest loss in the firefighting community since 9/11 . ”
And there he was , head bowed , the man whose candidacy is built on the rubble of the World Trade Center , the constant threat of future attack and the need to stay vigilant .
On Friday morning , he did n’t have to say a word to get that point across .
Giuliani ’s run for the White House is not based on the simple fact of Sept. 11 , 2001 , but who he was and what he did in the terrifying hours and days that followed .
While President Bush disappeared to the safety of an airplane , the lame duck mayor of New York City headed to ground zero .
He scoped out the damage firsthand , saw terrified people jump to their deaths from the burning skyscrapers , gave news conferences and planned ahead .
In “ Leadership , ” his 2002 business book - cum - autobiography , he wrote : “ After September 11 , people would tell me that it was brave to go to the scene of the attacks .
It was actually just carrying out my usual practice for any significant emergency of seeing things with your own eyes and of setting an example . ”
That insouciant aside for chief executives translates on the campaign trail into an argument that Giuliani ’s experience is as close to presidential as it is possible to get without storing your BlackBerry in the Oval Office .
In other words : Vote for me , I ’ve almost been there .
Sure , he has been blasted as an autocrat .
His multiple marriages and estranged children make family - values types cringe , and his stands on abortion and gun control offend hard - line social conservatives .
It took Sept. 11 to boost his popularity at home , at least temporarily .
But “ I ’ve had to run things that I guess are the most similar to running the federal government , ” he told the polite audience in Des Moines on June 20 .
“ Nothing is like being president of the United States .
But I had a job in running what really is the third - largest government in the country , and the second - or third - most complex . ”
Not only that , he said , but he had the duty during very tough times : “ When it was going through a crime crisis and fiscal crisis , and I had to change it , and , of course , on Sept. 11 , when we were part of the worst attack in the history of the country . ”
Good message , but he may not be the only one using it .
Just the day before , New York City ’s current mayor announced that he was leaving the Republican Party , fueling widespread speculation that he would run for president as an independent in 2008 .
And so the spirit of Michael R. Bloomberg followed Giuliani from Iowa to Florida .
Reporter : “ You talked a lot today about how your experience as mayor of New York is sort of comparable to being president .
Given Mayor Bloomberg ’s decision “
Giuliani interrupts , laughing : “ So now we ’ve got two people with that experience .
Mayor Bloomberg is a friend of mine .
I like Mike a lot .
As a New Yorker , I ’m happy that he ’s been a good mayor .
But I ’m really happy that he carried on a lot of the things that I thought [ up ] . ”
All of which raises the age - old question : How many New York mayors does it take to run for president ?
“ Apparently , a lot more than one , ” said Mario Stecco , a 22 - year - old high school chemistry teacher who had come to La Carreta restaurant in Hialeah on June 21 to hear Giuliani talk about fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense .
“ But [ Giuliani ] will be strong enough to take it . ”
And the reason was clear in Hialeah , where the prosecutor - turned - politician was introduced by Miami - Dade County Commissioner Rebeca Sosa as the man who healed the wounds of 9/11 and stood up to Castro , telling him , “ Usted es una persona non grata en Nueva York ! ”
This being the heart of Cuban South Florida and a deeply Republican bastion to boot , the 250 or so supporters who had lined up to nibble pan dulce and listen to the candidate cheered wildly at the image of the strong - jawed mayor telling the dictator that he ’s not welcome in the Big Apple .
It was a story they already knew by heart , and the candidate repeated it on this day for good measure :
In 1995 , during the 50th anniversary of the United Nations , Giuliani forbade Castro to attend a banquet of world leaders .
“ Castro is a murderer , ” Giuliani boomed through La Carreta ’s packed banquet hall .
“ I know it .
I will never forget .
So is his brother .
I know it .
I will never forget it . ”
Others might “ romanticize ” Castro and his ilk , but Cuban Americans know better than anyone else , he said , how important it is “ to be strong in the face of dictators and terrorists .
America ca n’t show weaknesses to these Islamic terrorists .
Because , if we do , we ’re going to be in a lot greater danger . ”
Giuliani has probably visited Florida more than any other state since confirming in February that he would seek the Republican nomination for president .
The state gave the White House to Bush in 2000 .
( “ Thank God ! ” he told his Hialeah audience . )
And it will be key again in 2008 , he said , both in its January primary and in November .
Most primary candidates tend to focus scarce resources on a small handful of early voting states .
They will practically take up residence in , say , Iowa or New Hampshire , and pull 16 - hour days with half a dozen public events in as many cities .
But Giuliani ’s public schedule generally holds to a more regal pace ; it is the luxury of being national front - runner .
Giuliani often has just one public campaign event per day , although he often schedules multiple private fundraisers .
In the last four months , he has visited at least 21 states .
He plans to be in Sacramento today and Irvine on Friday .
National campaign manager Michael DuHaime acknowledges that Giuliani has n’t “ done the 14 stops in three days in Iowa yet ” but insists that the candidate keeps to “ an incredibly fast pace ” and is serious about Iowa and all of the early voting states .
“ But the reality is , no one ’s ever run this race before , ” DuHaime said in an interview .
“ We have n’t had a Republican presidential primary since Sept. 11 .
The old way of doing things has to be rethought . ”
If 9/11 really did change politics as usual , then there was no better place for Giuliani to be Friday than the North Charleston Coliseum , where the region remembered “ our nine heroes , ” firefighters killed while battling a furniture store blaze .
Giuliani was supposed to fly from South Florida to Jacksonville , Fla. , for a town hall meeting at a junior college .
But then the campaign got a call from Lewis Hayes , chairman of South Carolina Firefighters for Rudy , inviting the candidate to the memorial service .
So Jacksonville was out , and the candidate flew north to pay his respects .
His staff stressed that the trip was just that , not an official campaign event .
Giuliani was n’t the only man who stepped off the trail Friday .
Republican Mike Huckabee and Democrats Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Christopher J. Dodd and John Edwards were all present .
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama had called Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. to express their sympathy .
However , Giuliani is the only one who has written a book on leadership with a chapter called “ Weddings Discretionary , Funerals Mandatory . ”
The only one whose city lost 343 firefighters and 60 police officers on one horrible day in 2001 .
He ’s the only one who inspires both wrath and respect in firefighters for his actions in response to Sept. 11 .
And he is the only one who can sit in a cavernous auditorium amid thousands of uniformed first responders and give a campaign speech without saying a word .

YES !
It appears that Sony have done it again .
In their zeal to make their DVD movies copyproof ( yeah right ) they have in fact made their latest releases unplayable on some DVD players , including my Sony DVP - CX995V DVD player .
I recently rented “ Stranger than Fiction ” ( 2 copies ) and “ The Holiday ” ( please no comments on my choice of movies ) both by Sony Pictures .
Both load up to the splash title screen and then load no further , then after about 60 secs the player turns itself off !
ALL my other DVD ’s and new releases from other movie companies play perfectly
I called Sony Electronics help line and they said to call Sony Pictures which I did .
The following is a compression of our discussion :
Sony Tech :
We know about this problem .
Its our new copy protection that ’s making these discs unplayable in some players including our own , we do not intend to change the copy protection .
The only correction to this problem is a firmware update to your player .
The electronics division know about this and should have given you this information .
Me : OK send me the firmware update .
Sony Tech :
We do not have one as yet .
Me : OK ( a bit frustrated ) when will it be available ?
Sony Tech :
It could be 2 weeks it could be a month , we do n’t know .
He then took my phone number and said “ they ” would let me know when the firmware update is available , but declined to take my address saying that they would get that when the update was available .
I will say that I got a live person on both support lines within 30 secs .
Here are my questions to Sony :
After spending $ 350 on a Sony DVD player 3 months ago am I now supposed to avoid Sony Pictures products ?
You are still advertising the Sony DVP - CX995V prominently on the Sony USA website but I notice there is no disclaimer that it may not play some new Sony Pictures DVD’s .
Would it not be a good idea to test changes you intend to make on your DVD ’s at least on your own equipment so that if you find a problem you could have the firmware update available instead of not only inconveniencing , but alienating your own customers .
I believe this problem is happening on other manufacturers devices , are they working feverishly on firmware updates to accommodate you ?
Well thats my rant ( yeah I feel a bit better now )

There were security officers standing outside the area doing nothing , but the footage of the murder was taken � by more than one phone � from the front row .
Which means whoever shot it did so not to record the horror of the event , but to commemorate it .
To share it .
Because it was cool .
I could start a rant about the level to which we have become desensitized to violence , about the evils of the voyeuristic digital world in which everything is shown and everything is game , but honestly , it�s been said .
And I certainly have no jingoistic cultural agenda .
I like to think that in America this would be considered unbearably appalling , that Kitty Genovese is still remembered , that we are more evolved .
But coincidentally , right before I stumbled on this vid I watched the trailer for � Captivity � .
A few of you may know that I took public exception to the billboard campaign for this film , which showed a concise narrative of the kidnapping , torture and murder of a sexy young woman .
I wanted to see if the film was perhaps more substantial ( especially given the fact that it was directed by � The Killing Fields � Roland Joffe ) than the exploitive ad campaign had painted it .
The trailer resembles nothing so much as the CNN story on Dua Khalil .
Pretty much all you learn is that Elisha Cuthbert is beautiful , then kidnapped , inventively , repeatedly and horrifically tortured , and that the first thing she screams is � I �m sorry � .
� I�m sorry . �
What is wrong with women ?
I mean wrong .
Physically .
Spiritually .
Something unnatural , something destructive , something that needs to be corrected .
How did more than half the people in the world come out incorrectly ?
I have spent a good part of my life trying to do that math , and I �m no closer to a viable equation .
And I have yet to find a culture that doesn�t buy into it .
Women�s inferiority � in fact , their malevolence -- is as ingrained in American popular culture as it is anywhere they �re sporting burkhas .
I find it in movies , I hear it in the jokes of colleagues , I see it plastered on billboards , and not just the ones for horror movies .
Women are weak .
Women are manipulative .
Women are somehow morally unfinished .
( Objectification : another tangential rant avoided . )
And the logical extension of this line of thinking is that women are , at the very least , expendable .
I try to think how we got here .
The theory I developed in college ( shared by many I �m sure ) is one I have yet to beat : Womb Envy .
Biology : women are generally smaller and weaker than men .
But they �re also much tougher .
Put simply , men are strong enough to overpower a woman and propagate .
Women are tough enough to have and nurture children , with or without the aid of a man .
Oh , and they�ve also got the equipment to do that , to be part of the life cycle , to create and bond in a way no man ever really will .
Somewhere a long time ago a bunch of men got together and said , � If all we do is hunt and gather , let�s make hunting and gathering the awesomest achievement , and let�s make childbirth kinda weak and shameful .�
It �s a rather silly simplification , but I believe on a mass , unconscious level , it �s entirely true .
How else to explain the fact that cultures who would die to eradicate each other have always agreed on one issue ?
That every popular religion puts restrictions on women�s behavior that are practically untenable ?
That the act of being a free , attractive , self - assertive woman is punishable by torture and death ?
In the case of this upcoming torture - porn , fictional .
In the case of Dua Khalil , mundanely , unthinkably real .
And both available for your viewing pleasure .
It �s safe to say that I�ve snapped .
That something broke , like one of those robots you can conquer with a logical conundrum .
All my life I�ve looked at this faulty equation , trying to understand , and I�ve shorted out .
I don�t pretend to be a great guy ; I know really really well about objectification , trust me .
And I�m not for a second going down the �women are saints � route � that just leads to more stone - throwing ( and occasional Joan - burning ) .
I just think there is the staggering imbalance in the world that we all just take for granted .
If we were all told the sky was evil , or at best a little embarrassing , and we ought not look at it , wouldn�t that tradition eventually fall apart ?
( I was going to use �trees � as my example , but at the rate we�re getting rid of them I �m pretty sure we really do think they �re evil .
See how all rants become one ? )
Now those of you who frequent this site are , in my wildly biased opinion , fairly evolved .
You may hear nothing new here .
You may be way ahead of me .
But I can�t contain my despair , for Dua Khalil , for humanity , for the world we�re shaping .
Those of you who have followed the link I set up know that it doesn�t bring you to a video of a murder .
It brings you to a place of sanity , of people who have never stopped asking the question of what is wrong with this world and have set about trying to change the answer .
Because it�s no longer enough to be a decent person .
It �s no longer enough to shake our heads and make concerned grimaces at the news .
True enlightened activism is the only thing that can save humanity from itself .
I�ve always had a bent towards apocalyptic fiction , and I �m beginning to understand why .
I look and I see the earth in flames .
Her face was nothing but red .
All I ask is this : Do something .
Try something .
Speaking out , showing up , writing a letter , a check , a strongly worded e-mail .
Pick a cause � there are few unworthy ones .
And nudge yourself past the brink of tacit support to action .
Once a month , once a year , or just once .
If you can�t think of what to do , there is this handy link .
Even just learning enough about a subject so you can speak against an opponent eloquently makes you an unusual personage .
Start with that .
Any one of you would have cried out , would have intervened , had you been in that crowd in Bashiqa .
Well thanks to digital technology , you �re all in it now .
I have never had any faith in humanity .
But I will give us props on this : if we can evolve , invent and theorize our way into the technologically magical , culturally diverse and artistically magnificent race we are and still get people to buy the idiotic idea that half of us are inferior , we�re pretty amazing .
Let our next sleight of hand be to make that myth disappear .
The sky is n�t evil .
Try looking up .
Let 's Watch A Girl Get Beaten To Death .
This is not my blog , but I don�t have a blog , or a space , and I�d like to be heard for a bit .
Last month seventeen year old Dua Khalil was pulled into a crowd of young men , some of them ( the instigators ) family , who then kicked and stoned her to death .
This is an example of the breath - taking oxymoron �honor killing� , in which a family member ( almost always female ) is murdered for some religious or ethical transgression .
Dua Khalil , who was of the Yazidi faith , had been seen in the company of a Sunni Muslim , and possibly suspected of having married him or converted .
That she was torturously murdered for this is not , in fact , a particularly uncommon story .
But now you can watch the action up close on CNN .
Because as the girl was on the ground trying to get up , her face nothing but red , the few in the group of more than twenty men who were not busy kicking her and hurling stones at her were filming the event with their camera - phones .
There were security officers standing outside the area doing nothing , but the footage of the murder was taken � by more than one phone � from the front row .
Which means whoever shot it did so not to record the horror of the event , but to commemorate it .
To share it .
Because it was cool .

Keyword rich domain
Domain Names play a huge role in search engine optimization for obtaining high search engine ranking .
Type in any keyword into Google for example , and the chances are high that you will find that more than 80 % of the first 10 sites contain that particular keyword in their domain names .
Thus , a domain name is one area that can be fully utilized ( obviously taking into consideration that you are optimizing a brand new site from scratch and not an existing one ) .
Domain Names play a huge role in search engine optimization for obtaining high search engine ranking .
Type in any keyword into Google for example , and the chances are high that you will find that more than 80 % of the first 10 sites contain that particular keyword in their domain names .
Thus , a domain name is one area that can be fully utilized ( obviously taking into consideration that you are optimizing a brand new site from scratch and not an existing one ) .
It is also a good idea to include hyphens ( -) between each of the keywords within your domain name .
This tells a search engine spider that each word is a separate word , not one continuous word .
The search engines which use keywords in the domain name as a part of their ranking formula will not be able to recognize keywords unless they are separated by a hyphen ( or a slash or underscore for sub- directories ) .
Search Engines prefer the use of hyphens in domain names because they can produce more accurate search results by being able to recognize specified keywords in your URL .
Keep in mind that a domain with words separated by hyphens will be harder for users to remember ( and may also decrease the value of the domain ) .
However , if keywords are used with hyphens the keywords may be interpreted as such by search engines thereby helping rank a site higher .
Domain name registration is one of the most important things to consider when you are designing a site for high search engine placement .
Here are some dos and don'ts of domain name registration .
Some Webmasters use shared domains or sub - domains available for free from popular Web hosting services , or some kind of free domain name redirect service .
Keyword rich domain might be cheap , but if you want a good search engine placement , it 's not an option .
Some search engines do ban free Web hosts because search engine spammers frequently use them for hosting duplicate sites ( mirrors ) and doorway pages .
Sharing domains or IP addresses with spammers can get your search engine position penalized or your entire site banned .
Note this statement from AltaVista : “ You could wind up being penalized or excluded simply because the underlying IP address for that service is the same for all the virtual domains it includes . ”
Most search engines limit the number of submissions or number of listings for each domain .
This will make it very hard to get your site indexed .
Other sites on the same domain might already take all the available spots .
If you do manage to get your site indexed , the search engine will have a hard time finding the “ theme ” for your site if you are sharing a domain with other sites on many different subjects .
Pages are no longer ranked one by one , all content within the domain is considered .
Without your own domain , you will be forced to start working from scratch again if the host goes out of business or if he decides to change your URL .
Many Webmasters have lost their search engine positions , link popularity and Web traffic because of this .
Keywords in the domain name are crucial .
It makes sense to put your primary keywords into your domain name .
Keywords in the domain name are crucial .
It makes sense to put your primary keywords into your domain name .
Separate multiple keywords like my - keywords - phrase.com instead of typing it all in one word : mykeywordphrase.com .
This will make it possible for the search engines to understand your keyword phrases correctly .
Keep in mind that Yahoo and some other search engines reject domain submissions with URL in excess of 54 characters .
You would be wise to stay under the 55 character limit when choosing a domain name .
Directories like Yahoo , LookSmart , and ODP will not look for keywords in the text of your page , and editors will often edit keywords out of your title and description .
This leaves your internet domain name as the single most important place to put keywords for your site .
Too many dashes in a domain name might trigger the spam filters of some search engines .
Yet another benefit of keyword rich domain names is in reciprocal linking .
If the domain name keywords appear within the text of incoming links , you will get a major boost in ranking , especially in Google .
Taking advantage of Alphanumeric Search Engine listings – Keyword rich domain
To have a good website marketing plan , you must realize alphabetical priority of domain names is still used by some search engines as a key factor in their ranking formula .
Alphabetical hierarchy is even more important to website marketing because this method is used by directories , which strictly list sites in alphabetical order based on the results of the keyword ( s ) search .
prefer to use Yahoo !
because each site submitted to Yahoo ! is human - reviewed , delivering more accurate search results for their visitors .
Your website marketing plan must acknowledge Yahoo !.
Yahoo !
is the number one directory and search site with 52.7 million different visitors each month , accounting for 69.1 percent of all Internet surfers .
An astounding 53.4 percent of all search - related traffic comes from Yahoo ! , or as much as half the traffic received too many sites .
Many
To include alphabetical hierarchy in your website marketing strategy , realize that alphabetical priority does not only consist of letters , it includes numbers that can rank higher than an “ A ” .
This is the order : -0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
This means that the domain “ www.l-800-ABC-NEWS.com” will rank higher with the search sites that use alphabetical priority in their ranking formula , than just “ www.ABC.com”
Domain Crawling
Domain crawling is probably the best solution for maintaining both the main site and a regional version .
With domain crawling the regional listing is far more comprehensive as compared to the other mechanisms explained above .
Some pages , although regional may be listed in the main listing as well .
Domain Filtering
Domain Filtering automatically segregates websites from different countries into their respective regional editions .
This segregation is done on the basis of domain names .
For instance , a website from Australia would generally have a domain .au .
The Domain filtering mechanism looks at the domains of all websites and creates a country - specific edition listing .
Some Search Engines also have region - specific editions which contain listings from the whole of that region .
As an example : A French edition of Google may also return German or Spanish websites in some cases .
Domain Filtering has a drawback though .
This mechanism can only filter out websites based on the domain name , and hence .com is always considered to be a United States website .
This is obviously not true .
Many websites from other countries also have .com domains .

When the Republicans held their first debate two weeks ago , I was disturbed by the facile interpretations of Islamic terror that they presented .
I wrote :
It has always bugged me that these guys misunderstand or understand and then deliberately misrepresent the reasons why certain factions of the Muslim world hate the United States .
They do n’t hate our freedoms .
Okay , maybe a tiny number of al Qaeda types do , but the 70 percent of the Islamic world ( rough estimate ) that currently tells pollsters that they ca n’t stand the U.S. do n’t hate our freedoms ; they hate that we have supported pro-Western dictatorships in their region , they hate that we reliably and sometimes unthinkingly support Israel , and they hate that we invaded a country that posed no threat to us and completely destroyed it .
The more insidious cousin of the “ they hate our freedoms ” explanation is the “ it ’s in their religion ” explanation .
When Republicans argue vaguely that Islam orders followers to kill infidels , it amounts to saying the West is at war with Islam , and that our fights in Iraq , in Afghanistan , and in the global war on terror really are a clash of civilizations .
( One might even call them a “ crusade . ” )
Worse than that , though , is that we lump all Muslims together — in with Osama bin Laden and his henchmen , we throw millions and millions of peace - loving Muslims who might be convinced that the United States and not their violent , extremist enemies hold the keys to freedom and prosperity .
So when Tom Tancredo said yesterday that al Qaeda is trying to kill us “ because it is a dictate of their religion , ” he needs to know he is doing far more harm than good to our interests .
Fueling the sense in the Muslim world that their religion is our enemy — and not its most wackjob adherents — makes the prospect of peace in the region all the more dim .

Could this be the fuel of the future ?
The fuel , made from fructose , contains far more energy than ethanol , the scientists write in the journal Nature .
Separately , a British report on biofuels says all types of waste products , including plastic bags , can be used to make biodiesel fuel .
Critics of biofuels made from food crops say they drive up prices .
In both the European Union and the United States , politicians have heartily embraced biofuels as a way of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and dependency on imported oil .
' Waste ' fuel
Critics say that the current biofuels - both diesel made from palm oil and ethanol made from corn - encourage farmers to switch land to fuel production , driving up the price of food in the process .
Now scientists at the University of Wisconsin - Madison say that a simple sugar called fructose can be converted into a fuel that has many advantages over ethanol .
The impact on society we 're hoping will be far wider than simply 'we can give you a fuel now with a tenfold reduction in its carbon footprint '
Jeremy Tomkinson
The scientists say that fructose can be obtained directly from fruits and plants or made from glucose - but more work needs to be done to assess the environmental impact of this new fuel .
In Britain , researchers say that the technology now exists to create diesel fuel not just from palm oil but from a range of materials including wood , weeds and even plastic bags .
This process is called biomass to liquid and experts say that within six years up to 30 % of Britain 's diesel requirements could be met from this source .
Jeremy Tomkinson of the UK's National Non-Food Crops Centre said this next generation of biofuels could meet many needs beyond powering cars .
" The impact on society we 're hoping will be far wider than simply 'we can give you a fuel now with a tenfold reduction in its carbon footprint ' .
" Imagine now if chemicals that we use in the chemical industry also came from the same feed stock ; [ and that ] the aircraft we fly to New York in also run on this ?
There 's the big potential , " he said .
The biggest drawback to this process is cost .
Setting up new production facilities is estimated to be 10 times higher than for current biofuel refineries .

Laser tool for next Mars rover ready for testing
LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY NEWS RELEASE
Posted : June 25 , 2007
LOS ALAMOS , N.M. - Mars mission Job One : Get there .
Job Two : Find rocks and zap them with your laser tool .
Now learn the nature of the debris by spectrographically analyzing the ensuing dust and fragments .
It 's every kid 's dream , vaporizing pebbles on other planets , and thanks to a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory , it 's going to happen .
When the JPL - NASA Mars Science Laboratory rover launches in 2009 , it will carry this combination laser - telescope unit and enable the gadget - packed rover to know a great deal about rocks in its general vicinity .
The ChemCam package includes a mast unit , projecting above the rover with a laser and telescope , and a body unit , the brains of the beast , with three spectrographs and the instrument controls .
The engineering model of ChemCam 's mast unit , fresh from Thales Laser and Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements ( CESR ) in France , is undergoing rigorous testing at Los Alamos .
A team of six French experts is checking out the mast unit this week and making sure that it is properly connected with the rest of the instrument , built at Los Alamos .
This fall the entire instrument will be shipped to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , where more tests will take place and additional equipment will be added .
" We 're pioneering a new technique for exploring Mars .
It 's really exciting to see the whole thing come together , " said Roger Wiens , project lead and a Los Alamos scientist .
The ChemCam laser emits very short pulses of 7 nanoseconds , through a small telescope that focuses the beam to a spot where the power density exceeds 10 megawatts per square millimeter , producing a plasma of vaporized material from the target rock .
The unit operates on targets at distances between 4 and 30 feet .
The unit also contains a camera to take extreme close - up pictures of the targets to show geologic context for each sample .
The telescope and electronics were built by CESR , a research institute in Toulouse , France .
The mast unit was funded by CNES , the French Space Agency .
The full ChemCam flight model will be delivered to JPL in Spring of 2008 .
Scheduled to launch in the fall of 2009 , Mars Science Laboratory is part of NASA 's Mars Exploration Program , a long - term effort of robotic exploration of the red planet .
Mars Science Laboratory is a rover that will assess whether Mars ever was , or is still today , an environment able to support microbial life .
In other words , its mission is to determine the planet 's habitability .

Los Alamos enhances national security by ensuring the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile , developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction , and solving problems related to energy , environment , infrastructure , health , and global security concerns .
It is an old question : how does light make its way through all the retinal layers to finally strike the light sensitive cells at the back of the eye ?
A group of researchers at the Paul - Flechsig - Institute of Brain Research , Universität Leipzig in Germany , thinks it has the answer .
They have demonstrated that light is collected and funnelled through long cells called Müller cells .
These work almost exactly like a fibre optic plate : a " zero - length window " that optical engineers can use to transmit an image without using a lens .
" Light has to go through all retinal layers to get to the photosensitive cells .
This is not a problem for the octopus or the starfish which both have different eye structures .
But it is a problem for all vertebrates , " explains Andreas Reichenbach , who worked on the research .
" The layers in front of the rods and cones act as a diffusing screen .
They have a half micron diameter which is roughly the same as the incoming light , so there must be lots of scattering .
So we thought , could there be a way round this ?
" We put unstained , living tissue on a microscope and focused through the layers .
We found lots of light reflecting in synaptic and nerve layers , but with regular patterns of empty holes with no scattering . "
The team then built up a cross section of the eye and found that the holes were in fact tubes , running all the way through .
They were able to confirm that these were the Müller cells by running tests with lasers .
" Everyone thinks lasers are perfectly parallel , but this is not so , " Reichenbach continues .
" They do diverge .
The Müller cells behave as a lens , and collect all the light without any loss , just like an optical plate . "
But normal optical plates have simple bundles of optical fibres that collect and transmit the light .
The researchers have discovered that the vertebrate eye has gone one step further and created a funnel shaped cell that allows more light to be collected at the surface of the eye .
The discovery does n't have any direct medical applications , but it could pave the way for dramatic improvements in various pieces of sensing equipment .
" Nature is so clever , " Reichenbach says .
" This means there is enough room in the eye for all the neurons and synapses and so on , but still the müller cells can capture and transmit as much light as possible . "
If the technique could be replicated with optical plates , it could mean engineers would be able to fit more into delicate sensors .
" They could include lots of other things - computing elements for example , " he adds .
The research , entitled " Müller cells are living optical fibers in the vertebrate retina " is published in the 30 April edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) . ®

I really need to go through all of my Erlang documentation so people like petekaz can stop making me feel small .
I had an issue with some poor Erlang code I was running where it performed a file : open but not the appropriate file : close .
Not wanting to restart my application I wanted to know how I could fix this problem without shutting it down .
Erlang , of course , provides a solution .
One thing that made this workable in the first place was the fact that I had no other open files besides those that needed to be closed .
So imagine for a second you have opened a number of files and lost the reference to them .
For example : file : open causes a process to be created ( this is Erlang afterall ) .
In the shell you can simply type i( ) .
and get output like :
This list goes on for awhile longer , depending on what you have done .
As you scan through this output you should see something like :
All of those file_io_server 's are the open files .
And the Pid associated with it is the file handle .
So to close all these files all you have to do is call file : close on those pids .
You can create a pid give 3 numbers in the shell by using the pid function :
Now , call i( ) again and you 'll notice all of those pesky file 's have been closed .
You can also do all of this from a remote machine if you have run your erl properly .
For example my remote application is run on a machine called ' blong ' and the node name is ' ort_bot ' .
I am on ' ooter ' on a machine called ' osx ' .
So from ' osx '
I can do this : Connecting to a remote shell is easy and we now have a shell on that node and can do anything from here we want ( infact I 've done halt ( ) .
quite a few times by accident not thinking oi ! ) .
Alternativly , you can also use pman , which provides an interface much like i( ) but does more interesting stuff too .
For instance you can see linked processes and kill various processe through pman .
In order to use pman , on your local node simply run : pman:start ( ) .
This provide you with a window that looks like :
This looks just like i( ) .
And from the ' node ' menu you can switch nodes to view the processes on .
As you can see from this screenshot I am viewing the processes on ort_bot@blong , which is a remote node .
As you can see , Erlang provides a very powerful set of tools to keep your application stable and perform various operations .
It is things like this that make me glad to run code in a shell rather than a stand alone appliction .
For situations like this , the power of the erlang shell is unparalleled .
Update : Well in his infinite wisdom , after a bit of playing around petekaz came up with two functions that makes solving this particular problem all of the easier .
My goal was mainy to show how to interact with the shell to get useful information about processes , but petekaz has shown me how to actually close a specific file .
It seems file : open drops some useful information into ets .
Where " /tmp/test.erl " is the file you are trying to close .
This makes use of two useful functinos .
processes for starters evaluates to a list of all current proceses runninging in the node , and file : pid2 name takes a pid and tells you what file it is associated with .
If the pid is not a file it returns undefined .
So it seems Erlang has a complete solution to this problem .
Thanks petekaz for figuring this one out completely .
Winnie Madikileza - Mandela is a controversial figure
The ex-wife of Nelson Mandela was to attend the premiere of an opera about her life - called The Passion of Winnie - in the city of Toronto .
In 1991 she was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to murder .
Canadian authorities can refuse entry into the country on the grounds of a criminal record , although it is not clear that has happened in this case .
Her application was turned down a day before she was to arrive in Toronto , for a gala fundraising dinner .
The organisers , the arts group MusicaNoir , said they were devastated and do not know why her visa was withheld .
They said Mrs Madikizela - Mandela 's daughter and two security guards did receive visas .
The decision was made by the Canadian High Commission in South Africa .
Canadian immigration officials in Ottawa have not given any reason why the visa application was denied .
MusicaNoir pointed out that Mrs Madikizela - Mandela was permitted to visit the United States two weeks ago to receive an award for her work with Aids organisations .
Known as one of South Africa 's most famous anti-apartheid activists , Winnie Madikizela - Mandela is also a controversial figure .
A six - year prison sentence for kidnapping a young activist who was later murdered was suspended on appeal .
In 2003 she was found guilty on charges of fraud and theft .
Madam 's favorite senator not making friends in return to Capitol Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 27 , 2007
Print This Email This Sen. David Vitter does n't seem troubled by his recent exposure as a onetime client of the so - called DC Madam .
His brash return to the Capitol is apparently rankling lawmakers of both parties .
After lecturing GOP senators about " rebranding " the party earlier this week , the Louisiana Republican annoyed Democrats on the Senate floor Thursday when he tied up legislative business .
Although neither came right out and said it , Sen. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) and Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) essentially accused Vitter of lying to them when he arranged to introduce an amendment on a Homeland Security funding bill .
" My disappointment with what 's happened the last few minutes is it appears ... somebody did n't keep their word , " Reid said , referring to Vitter .
Thursday 's Senate floor dustup followed Vitter 's appearance at a Republican luncheon earlier in the week that caused consternation among some GOP lawmakers .
Vitter lectured his committee about " rebranding " the party by reclaiming the fiscal conservative mantle , " The Hill 's Under The Dome blog reported Thursday .
The blog suggested that Vitter , who just a few weeks ago acknowledged a " serious sin " in hiring call girls from the alleged " DC Madam , " would not be the best to offer advice " on improving the Republican image . "
Blogger Cliff Schecter joked that Vitter perhaps " only mentally perused ' branding ' in masochism fantasies containing ladies of the avenue . "
" Yes , this is a man you want to listen to on public perception , oh GOP miscreants .
In fact , please listen to him guys .
PLEASE , " begged Schecter in a blog post Friday .
A source familiar with the remarks tells RAW STORY that Vitter 's comments were " taken out of context , " and he was not trying to offer broad advice to the GOP .
Rather , the Louisiana Republican was speaking specifically about taking a fiscally conservative approach to State Children 's Health Insurance Program legislation , and he spoke for less than a minute .
On Thursday , senators were sparring over Vitter 's attempt to amend the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to ease hurdles to importing cheap prescription drugs from Canada .
After Vitter introduced the amendment and agreed with Reid and Murray over its terms , he sought to modify the amendment on the Senate floor .
The move rankled Murray and Reid , and held up Senate business for at least a half - hour .
" If we can't come to an agreement and trust each other ... we 're not going to be able to get through these bills , " Murray said on the Senate floor .
" Because this Senate really is based on trust . "
Later in the session , Senators calmed down .
Reid clarified that no one was accusing Vitter of doing anything " illegal or unethical , " and he dialed back his earlier frustration at the delay caused by Vitter 's amendment , which eventually was adopted by the Senate .
" Maybe I have been around here a long time and just accept things for the way they appear to be and not sometimes the way they are , " Reid said .
" Senator Vitter has said there was nothing nefarious in what he did . "

" Batman is kind of against killing people in this series . "
True enough ( though he does n't seem to mind leaving people to certain self inflicted doom ) , but in the very early years of the Batman comic , he DID use guns .
As he grew in skill as a detective and prowess as a fighter and tactician he began eschewing them , partly because a gun had been used to murder his parents , and partly because he could get the job done without one .
Keep in mind too that batman originated in an era before Industrial Light and Magic .
The rules were different back then .
Using wits and skill to overcome a ' stronger ' foe or foes could still make a man BAD@ $ $ enough to be worth reading about .
Nowadays he that hath the largest BOOM / FLASH wins the day ...
As for the batcycle ... meh .
I 'd take Kanedas bike any day over this ( the laser rifle too ) .
As for the guns on it , they could be 3 - 6 round revolvers with small cannon shells ( maybe .50 cal or 20 mm ) or maybe grenades .
But I think they 're more likely anti-vehicle tasers .
I was pleasently surprised by Batman Begins , so I 'll probably go see this next film when it drops and find out then for sure with the rest of ya'll :)

Hackers are the Internet equivalent of Richard Reid , the shoe - bomber who did n't manage to hurt anyone on his airplane but has been annoying travelers ever since .
When I join the line of passengers taking off their shoes at the airport , I get little satisfaction in thinking that the man responsible for this ritual is sitting somewhere by himself in a prison cell , probably with his shoes on .
He ought to spend his days within smelling range of all those socks at the airport .
In an exclusive poll I once conducted among fellow passengers , I found that 80 percent favored forcing Mr. Reid to sit next to the metal detector , helping small children put their sneakers back on .
The remaining 20 percent in the poll ( meaning one guy ) said that was n't harsh enough .
He advocated requiring Mr. Reid to change the Odor - Eaters insoles of runners at the end of the New York City Marathon .
What would be the equivalent public service for Internet sociopaths ?
Maybe convicted spammers could be sentenced to community service testing all their own wares .
The number of organ - enlargement offers would decline if a spammer thought he'd have to appear in a public - service television commercial explaining that he'd tried them all and they just did n't work for him .
Convicted hackers like Mr. Jaschan could be sentenced to a lifetime of removing worms and viruses , but the computer experts I consulted said there would be too big a risk that the hackers would enjoy the job .
After all , Mr. Jaschan is now doing just that for a software security firm .
The experts were n't sure that any punishment could fit the crime , but they had several suggestions :
Make the hacker spend 16 hours a day fielding help - desk inquiries in an AOL chat room for computer novices .
Force him to do this with a user name at least as uncool as KoolDude and to work on a vintage IBM PC with a 2400 - baud dial - up connection .
Most painful of all for any geek , make him use Windows 95 for the rest of his life .
I realize that this may not be enough .
If you have any better ideas , send them along .

Secretary of State Rice may face subpoena threat Wednesday Michael Roston
Published : Monday April 16 , 2007 Print This Email This Depending on the State Department 's response to a request for information prior to a Wednesday meeting , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice could face a subpoena from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , RAW STORY has learned .
The move could compel Rice to testify on the intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq and other issues .
" On the 18th , we may hold a business meeting , but that is contingent on whether or not we receive requested information from her , " an Oversight Committee staff member told RAW STORY .
The committee staff member added , " If we do not get the information from the State Department prior to Wednesday , the business meeting may take up the question of issuing a subpoena . "
Secretary of State Rice had been asked to testify before the committee on Wednesday , but her office informed Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the committee 's chair , that she was not available .
On April 9 , Rep. Waxman sent a letter to Rice saying that the State Department 's response to a request for information from his committee had been " insufficient . "
Waxman said that the State Department 's Office of Legislative Affairs ' response to his earlier request for the Secretary to testify " does not answer many of the Committee 's questions , nor does it provide most of the information and documents the Committee requested . "
The Committee had sought Rice 's testimony on President Bush 's claims that Iraq attempted to procure uranium from Niger , as well as on other subjects .
The State Department 's spokesman , Sean McCormack , said in an April 12 press briefing that they were trying to respond sufficiently to the committee 's request .
" I know there is a second letter from Chairman Waxman and we 're in the process of formulating a lengthy reply that we would hope answers all of his questions , " he said .
" There are several questions in here that might require a little bit of type space in order to answer it .
But -- so we want to be responsive . "
Story Highlights • Google Earth highlights atrocities in Darfur region of Sudan
• Google official : Tool can be " catalyst for education and action "
• Google Earth has 200 million users
• Official : Technology will make it harder to ignore genocide
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
If you Google the word Darfur , you will find about 13 million references to the atrocities in the western Darfur region of Sudan -- what the United States has said is this century 's first genocide .
As of today , when the 200 million users of Google Earth log onto the site , they will be able to view the horrific details of what 's happening in Darfur for themselves .
In an effort to bring more attention to the ongoing crisis in Darfur , the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has teamed up with Google 's mapping service literally to map out the carnage in the Darfur region .
Experts estimate that 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million more have been displaced since the conflict flared in 2003 , when rebels took up arms against the central Sudanese government .
The new initiative , called " Crisis in Darfur , " enables Google Earth users to visualize the details in the region , including the destruction of villages and the location of displaced persons in refugee camps .
( Interactive : See how the new technology works )
Elliot Schrage , Google 's vice president of global communications and public affairs , joined museum director Sara J. Bloomfield to make the official announcement about the new feature .
" At Google , we believe technology can be a catalyst for education and action , " Schrage said .
" ' Crisis in Darfur ' will enable Google Earth users to visualize and learn about the destruction in Darfur as never before and join the museum 's efforts in responding to this continuing international catastrophe . "
The Google Earth mapping service combines 3 - D satellite imagery , aerial and ground - level maps and the power of Google , one of the Internet 's most widely used search engines , to make the world 's geographic information user friendly .
Since its inception in June 2005 , nearly 200 million people have downloaded the free program .
Using the high - resolution imagery of Google Earth , users will be able to zoom into the Darfur region for a better understanding of the scope of the destruction .
( Interactive : See where Darfur is located )
More than 1,600 damaged and destroyed villages will be visible , as will the remnants of more than 100,000 homes , schools , mosques and other structures destroyed by the Janjaweed militia and Sudanese forces .
The Holocaust museum also has compiled a collection of photos , data and eyewitness testimony from its archives and number of sources , including the U.S. State Department , nongovernmental organizations , the United Nations and individual photographers .
That material also will be available when Google Earth users visit the Darfur site .
The " Crisis in Darfur " initiative is the first of what is expected to be several collaborations between the museum and Google Earth to highlight the dangers of genocide around the world .
The museum also announced Tuesday the creation of a mapping project with Google Earth on the Holocaust , when Nazis killed 6 million Jews during World War II .
That project will use Google Earth to map key Holocaust sites , such as Auschwitz , Dachau , Bergen - Belsen , Treblinka , Warsaw and Lodz with historic content from its collections to illustrate the enormous scope and impact of the Holocaust .
Each place links to a featured article with related historical photographs , testimony clips , maps , artifacts and film footage .
" Educating today 's generation about the atrocities of the past and present can be enhanced by technologies such as Google Earth , " Bloomfield said .
" When it comes to responding to genocide , the world 's record is terrible .
We hope this important initiative with Google will make it that much harder for the world to ignore those who need us the most . "
T he latest banner ad on the homepages of Myspace users is for a Fox News program called ‘ The ½ Hour News Hour . ’
The show is obviously intended as a Daily Show spoof , but from what I gather from the clip ’s content ( footage that plays on racist stereotypes and implies out of the blue that Obama is basically some sort of ‘ stinky negro ’ ) and the timing of its debut ( ramping up for the upcoming presidential election ) , it seems to be a thinly - veiled Republican propaganda device .
Not convinced ?
Here ’s a video of an introduction to the show … with sociopaths Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter .
As you hopefully already know , Myspace is owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp .
News Corp. and its subsidiary Fox News are infamous for spreading across - the - board conservative propaganda ( e.g. in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , all 175 Murdoch - owned newspapers worldwide editorialized in favor of the war ) .
Additionally , Roger Ailes , chairman of Fox News Channel , is the only head of a major news - gathering organization in the United States with a background as a paid political consultant .
Namely , Ailes ’s political work has included :
working as a media adviser to Richard M. Nixon Presidential Campaign in 1967 - 68
working as a consultant in 1984 to Ronald Reagan
working on George H. W. Bush ’s 1988 Presidential campaign
It goes deeper than that , and you should keep poking around the internet if you ’re curious .
I just thought you should know , or remind you , that — money aside — this is exactly why Murdoch bought Myspace .
A captive audience .
And for the record on Obama ’s drug use , here is a clip of him on 60 Minutes candidly addressing his own past in his own words .
This in contrast to Bush ’s continued alcohol and cocaine abuse throughout his 40s , which to this day he refuses to directly acknowledge .

Mr. Sampson , who played a central role in the dismissals , has agreed to testify next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
He resigned this month because of what he later said was a failure to prepare Mr. Gonzales for questions about the ousters .
In another development , Brian Roehrkasse , a Justice Department spokesman , said Friday that the department would begin an internal review of the conduct of lawyers involved in the dismissals .
The inquiry will be conducted jointly by the inspector general , Glenn Fine , and the Office of Professional Responsibility , a department watchdog unit .
The dismissals have created the gravest crisis of Mr. Gonzales ’s time in office , with calls for his ouster from Republicans and Democrats , even as President Bush has offered the attorney general his firm public support .
Mr. Gonzales has sent reassuring signals to the ranks of prosecutors , but the strength of his support within the Justice Department is difficult to gauge .
Department officials said there had not been an intentional effort to delay the release of the new material .
Instead , they said , the e-mail messages were overlooked in past searches of office files and computers .
Many , they said , were copies of e-mail that had already been disclosed .
The latest batch of documents shows just how completely the department misjudged what the reaction would be to the dismissals .
“ I think most of them will resign quietly , ” said Ms. Scolinos , the department ’s chief spokeswoman , in a Nov. 17 e-mail message , a few weeks before the dismissals .
“ It ’s only six U.S. attorneys ( there are 94 ) and they do n’t get anything out of making it public they were asked to leave in terms of future job prospects .
I do n’t see it as being a national story — especially if it phases in over a few months . ”
Speaking with reporters on Friday evening , Ms. Scolinos said that when she sent that message she had only a fragmentary understanding of the plan to dismiss the prosecutors .
At a news conference this month , Mr. Gonzales was repeatedly questioned about the extent of his participation in the ousters .
He said he was aware that his staff had been evaluating the performance of different prosecutors , but on several occasions he said that it was not a matter that he had been following closely .
A woman who sought help after her six - year - old son was throttled by an older student was told by an education official that bullying " builds character " , a court heard today .
Benjamin
Cox is suing the NSW government , claiming not enough was done to protect him from playground abuse that allegedly began when he was five years old .
His mother Angela Cox , from Raymond Terrace near Newcastle , today told the NSW Supreme Court that the bullying , which started nearly 13 years ago , had had a lasting impact on her son .

Turned off Mochiads and reformatted this page .
7-29-10
Fixed a bug that was making the game reset to the beginning if the player failed at any point on the last level .
The game 's supposed to be tough , but not THAT tough !
7-29-10 A flattering review of the complete game from JayIsGames !
Thanks , guys !
7-24-10 I took the game offline for a bit while I looked for a sponsor .
After three weeks , I still had no sponsor , but the placeholder " coming soon " animation I 'd put up here had gotten over 10,000 hits (!! ) , so I decided that I was doing it wrong , and instead of trying to find a sponsor I should just leave it up here , where everyone is used to finding it , and add some Mochi ads .
I hope the ads are n't too obnoxious ; I actually think they make the loading screen prettier than it used to be .
Anyway !
Hooray !
Here is the final version of Dungeon Escape !
Completely done after seven years of working on it off and on !
ENJOY ! :)
Huge thanks to JayIsGames for hosting the game for me for three years after it got so popular that it crashed my host 's server !
7 -1-10 Wow .
Seven years in the making , I 've finally finished the last room of Dungeon Escape !!!
( Flood )
6-30 - 10
One more room done !
Only one left to go !
( Library )
6-21-10 I finished the Final Boss room and the ending tonight , and about a week ago I finished the Snake room .
However , I 'm not going to post an updated version yet , because at this point I 'm going to keep going until I completely finish the game and then try to sell it , so you wo n't see any more updates until it 's sold .
Thanks to everyone who 's played Dungeon Escape over the years for your support , and I hope to finally give you a finished game very very soon !
Only two more rooms to go !!
( Final Boss , Snake )
9-11-07 Holy crap !
It 's been over a year since the last update , and I did n't even add any rooms then !
Fortunately , this update MORE than makes up for it , because it includes four and a half new rooms , a cinematic intro , and a whole bunch of other minor tweaks !
I actually made the Zipline and Yellow Ninjas rooms several months ago , but did n't want to do an update with just two rooms , so I waited to add them with this update .
Also , I was n't happy with the Mallet room , so I changed it to the Sleeping Skeleton , although it 's only half changed ... you 'll see when you play it .
Last but not least , the game progresses to the next room even if you fail , forcing you to replay failed rooms at the end a'la Dragon 's Lair , which is something I 've been wanting to implement for a long time .
Only four more rooms left !
Maybe I 'll be extra ambitious and get the whole game finished by the end of the year , or maybe I 'll get distracted as usual and take another four years to finish it !
( Zipline , Yellow Ninjas , Bedroom , Red Ninja , Sleeping Skeleton )
7-18-06
Oh no !
Too much love !!
Somehow , even though it's not even finished yet , Dungeon Escape has become obscenely popular , and my host went squish last night when apparently ALL of Korea tried to access it at once .
I 'm overjoyed that people like it so much , and I 've now moved it to JayIsGames 's server to take the strain off of my host .
Thanks to Jay for helping out , and to my host for not killing me ! :) X
To everyone else , I promise more rooms soon !
1-22-06 Woohoo !
Another year , another room !
At this rate , I 'll be done right after I 'm dead .
This last room has been a real sticking point , though ; every time I thought " I 'll take a break and work on Dungeon Escape ... " for the past year I 've opened it up , taken a look at this room , considered how much work it would take to finish it , and promptly closed it again .
Now that I 've finally buckled down and finished it it will no longer be staring me in the face , so maybe I 'll be able to get more done now .
( Rolling Room )
1-2-05 Added two new rooms , and also made it shuffle rooms 1 - 9 and 11 - 19 every time you play .
One of the new rooms is kind of goofy , so I 'm not sure if it 'll stay in the game .
( Crusher , Mallet )
12-28-04 Holy crap !
Has it really been over a year ?
Oh well .
I get distracted easily , and apparently it 's been about 14 months since the last time I was interested in laserdisc games .
Two more rooms , for anyone who checks this page these days , and / or for posterity once I finally finish this . :) X
I think that makes 20 rooms total .
I have a lot more rooms that will be much quicker to make than these last two were , so hopefully I wo n't get too distracted again and they 'll be up shortly .
( Magnet Mage , Face )
10 -2-03
Two more rooms !
Also moved the Chess room to a later point in the game , since people were complaining about its difficulty .
I 'm worried that the new Collapsing Floor room is too much like the Vestibule room ; let me know if you think so too , and I 'll add some more to it .
If you do n't know which rooms I 'm talking about then I guess they 're not too similar after all .
:) X ( Crumbling Floor , Mummy )
9-21-03
Only one more room , but it 's one of the best .
Also cleaned up a few details that were bothering me about other rooms , and added a feature that lets you start playing once the first set of rooms is loaded , instead of having to wait for everything to load .
( Shield )
9-16-03
After an incredibly long series of distractions , including but not limited to Wind Waker , Metroid Prime , DDR , The Chronicles of Amber , and a few colds , I 've finally gotten back to working on Dungeon Escape !
Four more rooms have been added , including the dreaded " Dragon " room , which is incredibly difficult , but no more difficult than it 's supposed to be .
As you 'll notice if and when you reach that room , you get something there that you 'll be able to use in all of the remaining rooms .
Also , in case you care , the dragon room will mark the 2/3rds point of the game ( the wand room is at 1/3rd ) .
Good luck !
( Dragon , Grates , Topiary , Rising Muck )
4-8-03 Added 2 more rooms , and a fake loading screen ( that just loops until the game is loaded ) , after spending an hour trying to make a working loading screen when I badly need to go to bed .
2 rooms in one night , and that was after going to a birthday party right after work !
Scary .
Current room count is 11 .
1/3 finished !!
( Crushing Walls , Pendulums )
Later : Finally created a decent loading screen , after lots and lots of hair - pulling .
Sorry it loads the whole thing before playing , that 'll be fixed in future versions .
4-7-03 Added 3 more rooms .
Over 1/4 finished !
Any more rooms and I 'll need to break down and throw together a loading screen !
( Vestibule , Blue Ninja , Chess )
4-2-03 Added another 3 rooms , for a grand total of 6 .
Yay !
1/5th of the way to my goal of 30 rooms !
( The same number as Dragon 's Lair . ) ( Falling Rocks , Mine Cart , Giant Armor )
3-15-03
Put up first version , with only 3 rooms .

Die heftig umstrittene EU - Richtlinie zur Vorratsspeicherung von Telefon - und Internet - Verbindungsdaten hat noch vor ihrer Umsetzung in den Mitgliedsstaaten Begehrlichkeiten auf der anderen Seite des Atlantiks geweckt .
Laut einem Protokoll über ein informelles Treffen zur inneren Sicherheit zwischen hochrangigen EU - Vertretern und Mitgliedern der US - Regierung Anfang März in Wien zeigte die amerikanische Seite dabei Interesse daran , in den bald von Telekommunikationsanbietern in der EU vorzuhaltenden Datenbergen schürfen zu dürfen .
Die US - Teilnehmer hätten zu erkennen gegeben , heißt es in dem von der britischen Bürgerrechtsorganisation Statewatch veröffentlichten Papier ( PDF - Datei ) , dass man erwäge , " die einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten zu ersuchen , die auf der Basis der vor kurzem angenommen Richtlinie zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung gesammelten Daten auch für sie zugänglich zu machen " .
Das Ansinnen ist brisant , da in Mitgliedsstaaten wie Deutschland im Moment heftig über die Frage diskutiert wird , wer in welchen Fällen Zugriff auf die sensiblen Verbindungs - und Standortdaten haben soll .
Die EU - Datenschutzbeauftragten haben gerade gefordert , die Informationen nur Ermittlern zur Verfolgung schwerer Straftaten zur Verfügung zu stellen .
Generell gaben Kritiker der Befürchtung Ausdruck , dass sich die pauschale Überwachungsmaßnahme zu einem Fass ohne Boden entwickeln würde .
Die anwesenden Vertreter der EU - Kommission sowie der derzeitigen österreichischen und der kommenden finnischen Ratspräsidentschaft hatten dem Plan der US - Seite jedoch wenig entgegen zu setzen .
Laut dem Protokoll antworteten sie , dass die auf Vorrat gehaltenen Telekommunikationsverbindungsdaten den USA im gleichen Rahmen zur Verfügung stehen würden wie alle von bestehenden multilateralen Strafverfolgungsabkommen erfassten Daten .
Die Kommission wolle zu diesem
Thema , das am Rande von Gesprächen über gemeinsame Strategien zur Bekämpfung der Nutzung des Internet durch Terroristen und andere Extremisten zur Sprache kam , aber noch ein Expertentreffen durchführen .
In den USA selbst gibt es bislang keine Pflicht zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung .
Dortige Provider praktizieren stattdessen in Absprache mit Ermittlern das " Quick Freeze " - Verfahren , bei dem Verbindungsdaten nur in konkreten Verdachtfällen für einen bestimmten Zeitraum aufbewahrt werden .
Schwere Bedenken äußerten die US - Regierungsvertreter , die aus dem Außen- , Heimatschutz - und Justizministerium stammten , über mögliche negative Auswirkungen des geplanten EU - Rahmenbeschlusses über den Datenschutz im Bereich der inneren Sicherheit .
Mit dem Gesetzesvorhaben will Brüssel die Rechtmäßigkeit beim Austausch von Daten durch Strafverfolger gewährleisten .
Es soll sichergestellt werden , dass nur berechtigte internationale Stellen und Drittländer für spezielle rechtmäßige Zwecke auf vorhandene Informationen zugreifen können .
Diese müssen laut dem Entwurf selbst über einen " angemessenen Datenschutz " verfügen .
Dies geht den USA deutlich zu weit .
Die EU - Präsidentschaft versuchte die transatlantischen Gesprächspartner aber zu beruhigen , dass bestehende Abkommen nicht von der neuen Gesetzgebung betroffen wären .
Zudem seien sich die Mitgliedsstaaten noch nicht einig , ob der auch als Korrektiv für die Richtlinie zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung gedachte Rahmenbeschluss überhaupt erforderlich sei .
Mit zur Sprache kam auch das heftig umstrittene Abkommen zwischen der EU und den USA zur Übergabe von Flugpassagierdaten .
Hier lobte die US - Delegation , dass zumindest bereits drei europäische Fluglinien die begehrten Informationen über Reiseziele , verwendete Zahlungsformen oder Essensvorlieben von sich aus im so genannten Push - Verfahren an die US - Behörden weiterleiten .
Die EU - Seite schnitt zudem das heikle Thema an , dass der vom EU - Parlament angerufene Europäische Gerichtshof das Abkommen für rechtswidrig erklären oder zumindest einschränken könnte .
Auf derlei Spekulationen wollten sich die US - Gesandten nicht einlassen .
Man habe aber die Zoll - und Grenzschutzbehörde inzwischen darüber aufgeklärt , für welche Zwecke die Passagierdaten eigentlich verwendet werden dürfen .
Darüber hinaus erläuterten die EU - Vertreter Schutzmechanismen wie die " Basic " - und " Extended Access Control " - Techniken zur besseren Absicherung der auf den neuen E - Pässen gespeicherten biometrischen Daten .
Sie betonten , dass für das Auslesen der verwendeten RFID - Chips spezielle Gerätschaften erforderlich seien .
Gleichzeitig wollte die EU - Seite wissen , was es mit Plänen der USA zur Abnahme aller zehn Fingerabdrücke bei der Einreise in die USA im Rahmen des " US Visit " - Programms ( United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology ) oder der Aufnahme in Pass - und Visa - Dokumente auf sich habe .
Die US - Delegation bestätigte , dass diese Möglichkeit untersucht werde .
Sie ließ aber auch durchblicken , dass es sich dabei um ein Langzeitprojekt handle .
Zur Auseinandersetzung um die Vorratsspeicherung sämtlicher Verbindungs - und Standortdaten , die etwa beim Telefonieren im Fest - oder Mobilfunknetz und beim Internetzugang anfallen , siehe den Artikel auf c't aktuell ( mit Linkliste zu den wichtigsten Artikeln aus der Berichterstattung auf heise online ) :

Update : as I mentioned below , I 'm new at this ( only my third post ) , and it 's been several weeks since last post .. up till 3:30 am EST last night trying to insert sites , which kept coming up as " errors " .. finally gave up trying to do tags and had sites at very bottom of page , which people missed .
Since this blog is not a journalistic exercise , per se , and many people post thoughts , meanderings , and conjecture , I thought I 'd leave it till today to fix .
Thanks for the many wonderful comments and feedback , and I apologize for the seemingly sloppy cross-referencing until I fixed the problem .
Residentcynic
First thing 's first : in early 2005 Paraguay passed a law that allowed the country to harbor international criminals -- alright , the more diplomatic phrasing is that they
granted immunity to U.S. military , ( thus , including Commander - in - Chief Bush ) from the International Criminal Court if indicted for war crimes or crimes against humanity .
( Another link here concerning military moving in to Paraguay . )
This was around the same time ( May 2005 ) 400 US Marines were allowed to operate in the country in exchange for aid for 18 months .
Bush allegedly bought land in Paraguay in 2006 , a roughly 98,840 acre parcel in the Paso de Patria area called " Chaco " , close to the intersections of Paraguay , Bolivia , and Brazil .
Apparently , it 's a gorgeous spot .
The land is close to the Bolivian wetlands , is situated near natural gas reserves , and sits atop one of the largest aquifers in the world , the Guarani indigenous water region .
Part of the property has been designated an ecological reserve .
And wow , they think of everything , it 's close to the US Mariscal Estigarribia Military Base .
The U.S. officially denies having troops there except for " exercises " , and vigorously denies rumors of having its own base there .
Jenna Bush was sent on a " family mission " the first week of October ' 06 to seal the deal , accompanied by 10 security guards .
She met the President of Paraguay and the U.S. Ambassador and " officially " traveled with UNICEF to see a few of their projects , a " strictly private " tour .
Apparently , Bush Sr. owns roughly 173,000 acres in the same area , although there are no confirmed reports .
But , here is the strange part : none other than the Reverend Sun Myung Moon was the first to buy a huge chunk in 2000 , in that very area .
The Moonies have big plans : they want to develop ports , universities , an eco-tourism resort ( will his an Bush 's intersect ? ) , and reinvigorate the timber trade to Asia .
They are in Argentina already , but it seems they are branching out .
And it seems like the Bushes followed him .
Bush , Sr. is a big fan of Rev. Moon , and is quoted as calling Moon " the man with the vision , " in Argentina in 1996 while helping him hawk his news publication " Times of the World . "
As you know , Moon also owns the Washington Times .
It helps to be a sycophant to someone who donates significantly to one 's coiffers -- Bush made
$ 100,000 for the endorsement , and some sources say Moon has given the Bush family approximately $ 10 million dollars over the years .
I wo n't go into the implications of Bush II 's Faith Based Initiatives and how much money Moon has undoubtedly made from American tax dollars either directly or though tax credits .
But , it seems as if the entire Bush clan has a friendship , professional or otherwise , with Reverend Moon .
Okay , pretty obvious , ( soon to be , but not soon enough ) former dictator scopes out property , flees to a South American location to avoid prosecution for war crimes , and gets into business there .
Now , what businesses are the most profitable -- ie , the most volatile in the region ?
Oh yes .
Natural gas and water .
Where is Bush 's property ?
Oh yes , on the Bolivian border where there have been numerous coup d' etat's in the past 100 years , and several national incidents in the past ten years over said natural resources .
And , who is hanging out in the Washington , D.C. area as we speak , after fleeing Bolivia from prosecution ?
Ex -President " Goni " Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , friend of George W. Bush , who wishes to overthrow democratically elected Evo Morales and reinstate power despite the tremendous hate the majority indigenous population feel for him .
This is what gave me pause : the next year after the immunity deal was made , the Paraguayan government revoked U.S. military ( and Presidential ) immunity from the ICC , taking effect when their contract ended in December 2006 .
The U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay threatened to discontinue aid to the region unless immunity was reinstated -- then , for maybe just maybe a bro ' deal , Bush then signed a waiver that continued military aid in countries that have refused to sign immunity agreements with the US .
Bush 's waiver affects 21 countries , including Paraguay .
It seems as though Paraguay was forced into revoking immunity , as it is a member of the MercoSur trade block , which includes Venezuela , Chile , Brazil , Uruguay , and Argentina .
Paraguay 's President Nicano Duarte Frutos is center right , elected in 2003 , and his relationship with Bush is said to be a " good political marriage . "
( Another Marxist perspective of the U.S. military presence here ) .
Thing is , with a deft stroke of a pen , Bush effectively took protection away from U.S. soldiers in the region , but made sure his friends and business partners - in - crime contine to get what they need -- U.S. tax dollars .
You know some kind of deal was made to protect his rotten ass .

June 19th , 2007
Before we get to the Onion , let ’s look at a few excerpts from Constant Conflict , a 1997 Parameters ( U.S. Army War College ) essay that was written by then Major Ralph Peters .
In summary , the U.S. military is aware that “ American Culture ” is a strategic weapon that is capable of defeating an enemy , or entire populations , without necessarily having to kill them .
The U.S. military , however , must and will kill in order to allow “ American Culture ” into a society in order to repurpose it .
Military failures will result from failing to thrust , “ that bayonet into an enemy ’s heart . ”
Let ’s look at a few passages from Constant Conflict :
Information destroys traditional jobs and traditional cultures ; it seduces , betrays , yet remains invulnerable .
How can you counterattack the information others have turned upon you ?
There is no effective option other than competitive performance .
For those individuals and cultures that cannot join or compete with our information empire , there is only inevitable failure ( of note , the internet is to the techno - capable disaffected what the United Nations is to marginal states : it offers the illusion of empowerment and community ) .
The attempt of the Iranian mullahs to secede from modernity has failed , although a turbaned corpse still stumbles about the neighborhood .
Information , from the internet to rock videos , will not be contained , and fundamentalism cannot control its children .
Our victims volunteer . …
In this age of television - series franchising , videos , and satellite dishes , this young , embittered male gets his skewed view of us from reruns of Dynasty and Dallas , or from satellite links beaming down Baywatch , sources we dismiss too quickly as laughable and unworthy of serious consideration as factors influencing world affairs .
But their effect is destructive beyond the power of words to describe .
Hollywood goes where Harvard never penetrated , and the foreigner , unable to touch the reality of America , is touched by America ’s irresponsible fantasies of itself ; he sees a devilishly enchanting , bluntly sexual , terrifying world from which he is excluded , a world of wealth he can judge only in terms of his own poverty .
…
Contemporary American culture is the most powerful in history , and the most destructive of competitor cultures .
While some other cultures , such as those of East Asia , appear strong enough to survive the onslaught by adaptive behaviors , most are not .
The genius , the secret weapon , of American culture is the essence that the elites despise : ours is the first genuine people ’s culture .
It stresses comfort and convenience –ease–and it generates pleasure for the masses .
…
Secular and religious revolutionaries in our century have made the identical mistake , imagining that the workers of the world or the faithful just ca n’t wait to go home at night to study Marx or the Koran .
Well , Joe Sixpack , Ivan Tipichni , and Ali Quat would rather “ Baywatch . ” America has figured it out , and we are brilliant at operationalizing our knowledge , and our cultural power will hinder even those cultures we do not undermine .
There is no “ peer competitor ” in the cultural ( or military ) department .
Our cultural empire has the addicted–men and women everywhere –clamoring for more .
And they pay for the privilege of their disillusionment . …
There will be no peace .
At any given moment for the rest of our lifetimes , there will be multiple conflicts in mutating forms around the globe .
Violent conflict will dominate the headlines , but cultural and economic struggles will be steadier and ultimately more decisive .
The de facto role of the US armed forces will be to keep the world safe for our economy and open to our cultural assault .
To those ends , we will do a fair amount of killing . …
The bayonet will still be relevant ; however , informational superiority incisively employed should both sharpen that bayonet and permit us to defeat some–but never all –of our enemies outside of bayonet range .
Our informational advantage over every other country and culture will be so enormous that our greatest battlefield challenge will be harnessing its power .
Our potential national weakness will be the failure to maintain the moral and raw physical strength to thrust that bayonet into an enemy ’s heart .
Now that we understand the strategic military nature of the “ American Culture ” bomb , here ’s the same lesson ( in the form of satire ) from the Onion .
After 5 Years In U.S. , Terrorist Cell Too Complacent To Carry Out Attack
Five years after settling in southern California and trying to blend into American society , a six - man terrorist cell connected to the militant Islamist organization Army of Martyrs has reportedly grown too complacent to conduct its suicide mission , an attack on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station .
According to cell leader and boat owner Jameel al - Sharif , the potentially devastating operation , which involves breaching the station ’s reactor core and triggering a meltdown that could rival the Chernobyl disaster , “ can wait . ”
“ We remain wholly committed to the destruction of America , the Great Satan , ” al - Sharif said .
“ But now is not a good time for us .
The season finale of Lost was such a cliff - hanger that we have to at least catch the first episode of the new season .
After that , though , death to the infidels . ”
“ Probably , ” added al - Sharif , who noted that his nearly $ 6,000 in credit - card debt from recent purchases of a 52 - inch HDTV and a backyard gas grill prevents him from buying needed materials for the attack .
Though the members of the cell said that they “ live only to spill the blood of crusaders who oppress Muslims , ” they cited additional reasons for the delay , including an unexpired free Netflix trial and nagging lower - back pain .
“ I think I ’m entitled to a little time to fully enjoy the in - dash MP3 adapter and heads - up display that Allah , in His infinite wisdom , has seen fit to provide me with , ” munitions expert Mohammed Akram said of the 2006 Mercury Mariner that is intended to be used as a car bomb during the attack .
“ Also , I have nine months left on the lease .
But after that , I am more than willing to load it with explosives and go to my glory in its all - leather interior and heated seats . ”
Cell member Sayyid al - Tantawi , a Cairo - born former physics professor who was able to obtain employment at San Onofre as a reactor technician , once routinely worked 18 - hour days so he could secretly obtain security codes and detailed schematics of the facility .
But since his promotion to senior project manager last November , al - Tantawi has grown accustomed to perks such as higher pay , mandatory vacation time , delegation of responsibilities , and long lunches with other managers .
“ Do n’t get me wrong , I totally wish swift and painful death to all American pigs , especially that jerk [ general manager ]
Dave [ Landis ] , ” al - Tantawi said .
“ But I ’m no longer the new guyâ € ” why bust my ass all day long anymore ?
When I get home after a day at work , I do n’t savor staying up all night designing dirty - bomb triggering mechanisms like I did when I first got here .
Sometimes I just want to pop in a CD by that soulful infidel Chris Daughtry and relax . ”
Al - Tantawi added that due to the sedentary nature of his job , he would have to “ lose a few pounds , Allah willing ” before being able to fulfill his most challenging task : infiltrating the reactor ’s spent fuel storage area and draining its coolant , thereby triggering a fire and releasing radioactive material .
Indeed , general preparedness appears to be the cell ’s greatest stumbling block .
“ Five a .m. is when the facility is most vulnerable to attack , when the morning shift security personnel replace the overnight crew , ” said Adib Dhakwan , the cell ’s second - in - command .
“ Unfortunately , Starbucks does n’t open until six , and I do n’t know about you , but if I do n’t have that first cup of coffee , forget it . ”
Despite the terrorists ’ successful assimilation into American society , the FBI has been monitoring the activities of the “ San Clemente Six ” since late 2005 .
According to declassified intelligence documents , the cell ’s status was recently downgraded to “ low risk , ” due in part to a near absence of cell phone chatter to parties other than Moviefone , and last month ’s online purchase of a hammock .

July 9 , 2007 -- Meditation is increasingly popular as a complementary treatment for high blood pressure , heart disease , and other health conditions , but its therapeutic value remains unproven , researchers say .
That is the finding from one of the largest and most comprehensive reviews of the research on meditation and health ever conducted .
Investigators from the University of Alberta Evidence - based Practice Center analyzed 813 English - language studies designed to assess the impact of meditation on health problems .
They found that the three most studied health conditions were high blood pressure , heart disease , and substance abuse .
Other conditions that had been studied included fibromyalgia , depression , anxiety disorders , chronic pain , cancer , and type 2 diabetes .
They concluded the studies were not of high enough quality to prove or disprove the value of meditation as a therapeutic treatment .
“ There is an enormous amount of interest in using meditation as a form of therapy to cope with a variety of modern - day health problems , especially hypertension , stress , and chronic pain , but the majority of evidence that seems to support this notion is anecdotal , or it comes from poor - quality studies , ” researchers Maria Ospina , MSc , and Kenneth Bond , MA , note in a news release .
Damn .
I took some advice from a guy and it just cost me a hard drive .
The drive in my PC seemed a little slow , so this guy on the intarweb said he knew this cool new way to speed it up .
He told me to take the drive out and clean the surface with Windex .
I did it , and now I can't get the thing to even boot .
That 'll teach me to take advice so openly .
I figured since this guy was on the intarweb he must 've known what he was talking about ... Maybe I should try some Pledge on it to get that nice sheen back . [

Teen boy held on suspicion of planting bombs outside S.F. General
2007-06-07 12:27:00 PDT
SAN FRANCISCO -- A 16 - year - old boy from Belmont was arrested Wednesday night after he allegedly placed two bombs outside San Francisco General Hospital .
The boy was found to be in possession of a third explosive when he was arrested , San Francisco police said .
They did not immediately describe the bombs .
The first bomb was found when police responded to a call of a suspicious device in front of a hospital building at 877 Potrero Ave. , police said .
After arresting the boy in Belmont , police found a similar bomb hidden in the bushes behind the hospital , authorities said .
The explosives were rendered safe by the Police Department 's bomb squad .
The boy was arrested on suspicion of four counts of possession of an explosive device and " similar charges , " police said .
His name was not released .
Arguing that censorship is a " virus " affecting the health of the Internet , Amnesty International UK yesterday sponsored a conference called " Some People Think the Internet Is a Bad Thing : The Struggle for Freedom of Expression in Cyberspace . "
Unless something is done , and soon , Amnesty warns that the Internet " could change beyond all recognition . "
The conference , which featured Jimmy Wales , Richard Stallman , and recently - jailed US blogger Josh Wolf , highlighted the growing issue of government - mandated filtering , which is now conducted by 25 countries .
Azerbaijan , Burma , India , South Korea , and Thailand all made the list ; a complete , worldwide Internet filtering map is also available from the OpenNet Initiative .
For those who missed the conference , an archived webcast is available .
" The virus of Internet repression is spreading , " said Tim Hancock , Amnesty UK 's campaigns director .
" The ' Chinese model ' — of an Internet that allows economic growth but not free speech or privacy — is growing in popularity , from a handful of countries five years ago to dozens of governments today who block sites and arrest bloggers . "
Amnesty reserves particular criticism for the firms — often American — that go along with censorship or actively contribute to it .
The group has attacked Yahoo , Microsoft , and Google especially for their dealings in China , where all three countries have been involved in censorship or turned over pro-democracy e-mails to the Chinese government .
Not all bad
But even Amnesty admits that not all censorship is bad , making the entire debate more murky .
For instance , European countries often censor " hate speech " or anything that appears designed to incite racial hatred — something that Amnesty supports .
British historian David Irving was jailed in Austria in early 2006 over remarks he made doubting the extent of the Holocaust ; his defenders decried the decision in the same terms that anti-censorship groups now use to talk about the Internet .
Academic Deborah Lipstadt told the BBC at the time , " I am not happy when censorship wins , and I do n't believe in winning battles via censorship ...
The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with truth . "
The US generally does not attempt to impose such limits on speech , even when it is racially hateful , but it does have laws against child pornography and even libel ( both of which apply to the Internet as well as to the offline world ) .
Internet regulation is not a binary option — a country either has it or it does n't .
Instead , it 's a continuum of practices , with heavy - handed state - run filtering and censorship ( China , for instance ) on one end and hands - off regulation that uses the court system to handle only certain online crimes ( the US system ) .
Countries do n't tend to be terribly consistent on all of this , either .
The US , for instance , allows fascist organizations to set up web sites , use the swastika , and incite all the hate they want so long as they do n't do anything violent , but it bans online gambling and has arrested several UK executives who run gambling web sites .
And this happens despite the widespread presence of offline casinos .
By no means does this complexity indicate that we simply throw up our hands and say that everything is relative , but the issue is more complicated than " censorship is bad . "
Should multinational corporations be forced to make moral decisions about censorship every time they enter a new market ?
The companies tend to say no and argue that even the limited services they are able to provide are more helpful than no services at all .
Their accusers argue that the " we 're just following local laws " defense is becoming the equivalent of the " just following orders " defense that has been used to justify some of the most heinous crimes on the planet .

Recursion drives science
The co-founding editor of “ Wired ” magazine and author of OUT OF CONTROL is working on a new book on “ what technology wants . ”
His research led to the first - ever history of scientific methodology .
Starting from this long - term view of science ’s past transformation , he speculates on how the practice of science will change in the future .
Science , says Kevin Kelly , is the process of changing how we know things .
It is the foundation our culture and society .
While civilizations come and go , science grows steadily onward .
It does this by watching itself …

Click to viewI 'm told that tonight , at 12:01 am EST ( okay , so tomorrow ) , the division of Microsoft that launched the Xbox and the Zune will unveil something very special .
What it is , we do not know for sure , but it 's " something totally new coming out of the Entertainment and Devices division , and it 's going to change the way people interact with technology . "
The email ( which was not a tip but rather was mistakenly sent to me through official channels ) also stated that " you really have to see it to believe it . "
How tantalizing .

The timing is good , since tomorrow is when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs get to point fingers at each other under the grandfatherly gaze of Grand Vizier Walt Mossberg , and in these heady iPhone days , Gates needs all the ammo he can get .
But what the heck is it ?
We 're convinced Zune 2.0 is still a ways off , but then again , what else would this division be up to ?
Stay tuned , and we 'll get back to you with the details right around midnight .
China has invested heavily in African oil
Representing a record high , analysts said the surge was fuelled by China 's increased imports of African oil , most notably from Sudan .
Africa is also buying more Chinese - made goods , the figures show .
China is investing heavily in African oil exploration to help meet its rapidly - growing consumption .
In 2003 it overtook Japan to become the world 's second - biggest consumer of petroleum products after the US .
The US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) adds that China accounted for 40 % of the total growth in global oil demand over the past four years .
African investments
According to the figures for the first 10 months of last year , China 's exports to Africa totalled $ 15.25bn , while the country 's imports from Africa were $ 16.92bn .
Africa has become more important for China as a source of the raw materials needed by the Chinese manufacturing sector
Duncan Innes - Ker , Economist Intelligence Unit
Yu Yingfu , an official from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce , said China - Africa trade had increased since the start of a new era of cooperation that began with 2000's China - Africa Forum .
Since then China has scrapped tariffs on 190 kinds of imported goods from 28 of the least developed African countries , and Chinese firms have greatly increased investments in Africa - most notably in the oil sector .
In the first 10 months of 2005 alone , Chinese companies invested a total of $ 175 m in African countries , according to the official figures .
Chinese firms are also taking on significantly more construction projects in Africa , most notably infrastructure works .
Some analysts say China is doing this to aid trade and the movement of goods .
' Less constrained '
" Africa has become more important for China as a source of the raw materials needed by the Chinese manufacturing sector , " said Duncan Innes - Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit .
" Oil is central to this , primarily Sudanese oil and trying to develop new oil sources in West Africa .
" In terms of Sudan , it is needs to be seen as the biggest producer of African oil outside of Nigeria . "
Mr Innes - Ker added that China was well ahead of Western nations regarding Sudanese oil contracts .
In light of the ongoing violence and human rights concerns in Sudan , he speculated that " Chinese firms are a little less ethically constrained " than their Western counterparts .
Mr Innes - Ker added that Chinese textiles and clothing firms were also investing heavily in Africa at the moment as a way to get around US and European Union limits on Chinese exports in this sector .
Oh man , I wish you did n't look so happy .
It 's not that I want you to be sad , it 's just that you look so ugly when you smile .
Your smile , frankly , sucks .
Fortunately , it 's a solvable problem .
Simply stick this piece of rubber in your mouth that forces you to smile , and in a matter of days you 're sure to have a smile that wo n't be so revolting to those around you .
It 's the Beauty Smile Trainer , yet another device that could only come out of Japan .
Thanks again , Japan ! [ TokyoMango ]

Austrian police have defended their decision to shoot a " crazed " hare which savaged a Linz pensioner before laying into her husband and subsequently battling with officers called to the scene .
According to Spiegel Online , the elderly target of the assault was hanging out her washing in her garden on Monday when the leporine assassin bit her foot , causing her to fall .
Mercifully , she escaped into the house , where hubby called in the SWAT team .
Before the hare - supression unit arrived , however , the 78 - year - old man ill - advisedly decided to tackle the animal with a stick , an uneven struggle he was losing when officers arrived .
Police ordered the battling septuagenarian inside and , when the hare refused to cease and desist , shot the animal .
Linz police defended their shoot - to - kill policy by pointing out that the hare could have escaped at any time .
A statement said : " The animal always had the possibility of retreat because the garden was not closed off by a fence or other objects . "
The dead hare has been sent to Vienna to be tested for rabies .
The creature 's female victim was treated in hospital for minor ankle injuries . ®

Now a new biography of Walt Disney has cast a fresh light on one of the most elusive characters of modern American history .
The picture that has emerged is far from the genial figure of legend .
Disney has emerged as a troubled man , a lonely and reclusive depressive .
He also notoriously ill - treated his staff and close friends and was a ferociously right - wing anti-communist during the Forties and Fifties .
The book , Walt Disney : The Triumph of the American Imagination , was written by Neal Gabler , who received unprecedented access to records about Disney .
He is the first author to get the Disney family 's permission to examine fully the complete Disney archives .
Gabler portrays Disney as the emotionally driven son of a cold father who sought to create a fantasy world for himself in which he would feel loved and safe , and ended up spreading that invention to the world .
' During a peripatetic childhood of material and emotional deprivation , at least as he remembered it , he began drawing and retreating into these imaginative worlds , ' Gabler writes .
Yet those personal worlds would shape much of modern America and far beyond through characters such as Mickey Mouse , films such as Snow White and eventually theme parks .
The figures alone show the astonishing reach of Disney .
By the time he died in 1966 more than 240 million people had seen a Disney film , 80 million had read a Disney book and 100 million had watched a Disney TV show .
Pop culture experts see Disney 's influence as unrivalled .
' He was the dominant culture of childhood for such a long time .
He was making a product on a massive industrial scale .
It just happened that this product was part of the culture industry , ' says Professor Bob Thompson of Syracuse University in upstate New York .
Thompson says it is unrealistic to imagine that the real Disney would match the public image he created .
Certainly Gabler 's book dispels many of the kindly old man images .
He details an at times tragic life .
Disney 's father ended up resenting his son and their relationship fell apart .
Disney refused to cut short a business trip when his father died and missed his funeral .
He also had a mental breakdown in 1931 as he and his wife struggled to have children and she suffered several miscarriages .
Disney was also cruel and controlling to employees , terrorising them with humiliating dressing - downs .
It included even his brother Roy , who kept the company afloat with a financial acumen
Walt did not appear to possess .
Yet that did not stop Disney from ridiculing Roy in public .
At one meeting , discussing the film Fantasia 's soundtrack , Roy suggested using some more popular music .
Disney kicked him out of the room , saying : ' Go back down and keep the books . '
Disney had a ferocious temper , especially against people he saw as left - wing .
He testified enthusiastically before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and detailed what he saw as communist plots to take over Hollywood .
He branded some former animators communists , said the Screen Actors Guild was a communist front and labelled a 1941 strike that hit his studio a communist plot .
He even contacted the FBI about alleged communist infiltration .
When his cartoonists tried to form a union , he brought in armed guards .
He fired organisers , cut wages and slashed the opening hours of the studio coffee shop .
At one point , faced with a strike picket , Disney had to be physically restrained from attacking the leader of the industrial action .
But it was in his private life that the most disturbing images of Disney emerge .
In fact , Disney himself felt trapped by his creation and public image .
' I 'm not Walt Disney any more .
Walt Disney is a thing .
It 's grown to be a whole different meaning than just one man , ' he once complained .
He was in effect married to his studio , ignoring his long - suffering wife .
He would retreat into his mansion and play with a huge toy train set with a track that ran for an astonishing half a mile in length , including a 90 ft - long tunnel .
He also associated with a group of anti-semitic members of the Motion Picture Alliance and frowned on the idea of hiring black people to work in Disneyland .
But Gabler says his prejudices were no different from those of many of his contemporaries and also explodes the urban myth that Disney was cryogenically frozen on his death .
In fact , he was cremated and his ashes buried in a private garden .
But there is little doubt that his cultural legacy has achieved immortality in a way that the real - life cantankerous and lonely man could not .

House Intelligence Chairman : Bush administration withholds key information on surveillance Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday July 25 , 2007 Print This Email This As House Republicans and officials in the administration of President George W. Bush aggressively promoted reforms of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said the executive branch had refused for almost two months to turn over key information on spying activities to Congress .
" It has been 54 days since Ranking Member [ Pete ] Hoekstra and I sent a bipartisan letter requesting information from the Administration about its surveillance activities , " said the Rep. Silvestre Reyes ( D - TX ) , Intelligence Committee Chairman , in a statement released to RAW STORY late on Tuesday .
" Specifically , we asked for copies of the Presidential Authorizations and legal opinions for surveillance outside of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . "
Reyes warned that failure to turn over the information could hold up the legislative changes sought by the White House and the Director of National Intelligence .
" As we noted in our letter , the Committee cannot begin a serious evaluation of legislative proposals to alter the FISA system unless we have facts regarding legal authorities , " Rep .
Reyes added .
" If the Administration is serious about the need for legislation in this area , the President will insist that Congress be given all of the facts . "
Reyes ' remarks came in response to a major Tuesday push by House Republicans to advance FISA reform legislation they insist is necessary .
Rep. Heather Wilson ( R- NM ) , ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence , introduced a FISA reform package on Tuesday .
The Ranking Republican on the whole committee , Rep. Hoekstra , described the need for Wilson 's legislation in stark terms .
" Terrorists are using the FISA law to shield their activities , while Congress continues to let the Intelligence Community be hamstrung by a 1978 law written for rotary telephones and the Cold War ,  the Michigan Republican said in a statement .
" Al - Qaeda is not going to take August off we need to pass this bill before Congress recesses . "
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales also added to those warnings in his Tuesday appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" There have been sweeping changes in the way that we communicate since FISA became law , and these changes have had unintended consequences on FISA 's operation , " Gonzales told the committee Tuesday morning .
" For example , without any change in FISA , technological advancements have actually made it more difficult to conduct surveillance on suspected terrorists and other subjects of foreign intelligence surveillance overseas . "
But Rep.
Reyes was dismissive of the idea that full reform of FISA was required to permit monitoring of terrorists .
" Rep. Wilsons legislative approach is based on several faulty assumptions , " the Congressman argued , pointing to a letter he wrote to her .
The Reyes letter argued that FISA has been amended with modernization in mind on several occasions , and that the administration has failed to devote sufficient resources to the problems .
in a July 20 letter to the House Intelligence Committee , Attorney General Gonzales responded in kind to part of Reyes ' remarks .
" ( M ) erely adding resources without amending FISA will not resolve the problem , " Gonzales wrote in remarks circulated by House Republicans .
" FISA currently requires ... the Department of Justice to expend critical time and effort to provide privacy protections to foreign targets overseas  including terrorist targets  who are not entitled to them . "
While the administration and House Republicans made their push for rapid action on FISA modernization , the issue might be overshadowed by another pending matter .
At the end of June , the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed the White House for various information relating to its warrantless wiretapping through the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Last week , the White House wrote to Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , the committee 's chairman , and requested an extension of the deadline for the subpoena , which was subsequently granted .
But throughout Tuesday 's hearing with Gonzales , the administration 's counterterrorism surveillance operations were a constant point of discussion , which indicates that any future legislative changes will most likely not come easy for the White House .
A search engine that knows exactly what you are looking for , that can understand the question you are asking even better than you do , and find exactly the right information for you , instantly - that was the future predicted by Google yesterday .
Speaking at a conference for Google 's European partners , entitled Zeitgeist ' 06 , on the outskirts of London last night Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and co-founder Larry Page gave an insight into perhaps the most ambitious project the Californian business is undertaking - artificial intelligence ( AI ) .
" The ultimate search engine would understand everything in the world .
It would understand everything that you asked it and give you back the exact right thing instantly , " Mr Page told an audience of the digerati representing firms from Warner Music and AOL to BSkyB and the BBC .
" You could ask ' what should I ask Larry ? ' and it would tell you . "
Speaking after what was tabled an end of day ' fireside chat ' , Mr Page said one thing that he had learned since Google launched eight years ago was that technology can change faster than expected , and that AI could be a reality within a few years .
Certainly in that short period of time , Google has gone from a start - up in Mountain View to one of the most recognised brands in the world .
As evidence of its meteoric rise , the Hertfordshire hotel in which the conference took place was also home to the England football team .
The post - conference press roundtable was briefly interrupted by assistant manager Steve McLaren who had evidently got the wrong room .
Google 's executives were also forced to defend their tactics .
While suggesting the business could one day capture a 20 % share of the $ 800 bn ( £ 424bn ) global advertising market , Mr Schmidt explained that the apparently scatter - gun approach to research that lets engineers spend a fifth of their time working on pet projects , also allows the company to innovate faster than any rival .
While this has created some products ( such as shopping service Froogle ) that have not been a great success , it also led to the Gmail email service which despite still being only in test form is rapidly catching up with market leaders such as Hotmail .
But Mr Schmidt admitted that the company is spending more energy than perhaps it has in the past on integrating some of these seemingly random ventures back into its core revenue - generating search tool , something that could be seen as a sea change within the business , though Google executives maintain it is not going through a major consolidation phase .
But the lack of a visible pipeline of development from Google - which never gives a clear indication of what it is working on until it is released - infuriates some of its stockholders , who would rather it concentrated on a few lucrative services .
" We are very clear and I want to be clear and on the record , " said Mr Schmidt .
" We run the company for the benefit of our end - users globally . "
Looking at the current court case in Houston where Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , former executives of collapsed energy giant Enron , await the outcome of their trial for fraud , he added : " Speaking as an American company chief executive , when the management team starts focusing on the stock price rather than focusing on its business and customers you get a really bad outcome .
We are focused on doing the right thing for the long - term "
Mr Schmidt also attacked suggestions from some major US cable companies that providers of capacity - hungry internet services - such as video and TV - should be charged to run their services over the web .
This presents a challenge to what is generally seen as the internet 's neutrality , that everyone should be able to get on to it .
" We believe this violates one of the founding principles that built the internet today and it could stifle the next wave of innovation , " he said .
In fact Google is currently working on its own video tool .
While adamant that the company is not looking to get into the provision of content itself , it is looking to produce a video tool that will allow broadband TV viewers to find the shows they want from the hundreds that are available across the world .
It is looking for media partners interested in using such a tool .
Mr Schmidt also had a few consoling words for the traditional media business which sees its profitability being utterly eroded by online rivals .
He said usage of traditional media placed online is rising rapidly , but circulations - the revenue generator - are declining .
" You do n't have a lack of audience problem , you have a business model problem , " he said .

Have you ever had that weird feeling that you are a giant , controllable , seeker missile flying down a long tunnel avoiding obstacles ?
What ?!
You say you have n't ?
Then you must not have played The Missile Game 3D by Damien of DX Interactive .
The gameplay is very simple , as I alluded before , you play a giant , controllable , seeker missile flying down a tunnel avoiding objects in your path .
These objects consist of different rotating circular discs with shapes cut out of them .
As you play you go through 9 levels which increase in difficulty as you progress .
By the later levels , if you 're like me , you 'll actually be moving your body , dodging and ducking , trying to avoid those rotating doors .
The game also has several interface features that show you your speed , progress , and the like .
However , if you do n't want to blow up you 'd best be watching the road .
WARNING : This game is known to cause seizures in patients suseptible to them .
Please use caution if you have a similar health condition .
Analysis :
For a fun and simple game that 's taken a simple concept of " avoid the object " and infused some life into it , look no further .
The Missile Game 3D is something you 'll be able to jump right into and enjoy — perfect for a work break .
But a bit of warning , you 'll be coming back later to take more stabs at getting through the levels .
I 'd also advise not playing this game at work , because you 'll look like a fool as your body convulses as you try to dodge the discs by moving your body with the mouse .
Overall , great game !
( Wear a helmet ! )
Bonus :
Wow , another review with a bonus !
( I spoil you guys . )
I got in touch with Damien and asked him about any possible sequels .
He had this to say :
" This game was always just a side project , it went from start to completed in about a month and the point of it was to eventually learn how to code full 3D in flash .
I have almost finished the full 3D code now , ready for a space age 3D police chase style racing game that will eventually get done .
Which I suppose could sort of be counted as a sequel , although the only thing they 'll have in common is the black - and - white visuals and very fast gameplay .
" A couple of people pointed out the similarities to another game called Tunnels of Armageddon .
I recommend playing that one too , if I knew about this game before I finished the missile game , I would 've added in some motion blur because that looks sweet ! "
I 'd personally love to see a space age 3D chase game !
My only wish though is that the game has a little more color instead of just black and white , and some more details would be nice as well .
A pause button and ability to turn off the music would be nice as well .

LOS ANGELES —
When Steven Udvar - Hazy was a teenager in New York City , he would often head after school to Idlewild Airport , as Kennedy International was known then , to watch planes take off and land .
Airplanes symbolized freedom to the young Mr. Hazy , whose family moved from Hungary when he was 12 .
For hours , he would spot different aircraft and pore over timetables to figure out where they were coming from , or headed to .
Today , if anyone were to watch planes taking off at Kennedy — or at most airports around the world — they probably would be looking at planes owned by Mr. Hazy , a billionaire three times over and one of the most powerful players in commercial aviation .
As founder and chief executive of the Los Angeles - based International Lease Finance Corporation , Mr. Hazy has a fleet of 824 Boeings and Airbuses , with 254 more on order , that dwarfs any airline ’s in the world .
He owns more planes than the industry leader , American Airlines , which has 679 , and more than the combined holdings of Air France ( 265 ) , Lufthansa ( 245 ) and British Airways ( 239 ) .
Firefox has made huge inroads in Europe over the past year , to the point where Internet Explorer is in danger of losing its market share lead in some countries .
According to French web metrics firm XiTiMonitor , Firefox 's overall market share in the 32 European countries it measures has grown to 27.8 percent , up from just over 20 percent in January 2006 .
XiTi 's statistics reflected usage for the week of July 2 - 8 , unlike the 2006 measurements , which covered weekend use only ( and therefore may not have been an accurate representation of weekday , corporate websurfing ) .
The numbers also show significant growth during the past four months , with Firefox usage having jumped 2.3 percentage points since the beginning of March .
Firefox is most popular in central and eastern Europe , with 47.9 percent of Slovenian surfers using Firefox during the first week in July .
Finland is in second place with 45.4 percent while Slovakia rounds out the 40 percent club with 40.4 percent of its residents using Firefox .
Firefox has passed the 30 percent barrier in 11 other countries , including Poland with 39.6 percent , Germany with 38.0 percent , and Austria with 30.7 percent .
Firefox market share ( percent ) ; data source : XiTiMonitor
Two countries showed double - digit growth over the past four months .
Ireland jumped from 24.9 percent to 38.6 percent , and Hungary went from 27.2 percent to 39.7 percent .
At the other end of the spectrum are the Netherlands and Denmark , both of which experienced growth of less than 1.5 percent , to 14.6 percent and 15.2 percent respectively .
There could be any combination of factors driving the growth : security vulnerabilities , anti-Microsoft sentiment , strong local support networks for Firefox , or even just a widespread feeling that Firefox 2.0 is a superior browser to the competition .
Whatever the reasons behind Firefox 's surge , it is clear that so far , the combination of Vista and Internet Explorer 7.0 have not been enough to keep European users away from the biggest open - source alternative .
Young Americans are more likely than the general public to favor a government - run universal health care insurance system , an open - door policy on immigration and the legalization of gay marriage , according to a New York Times / CBS News / MTV poll .
The poll also found that they are more likely to say the war in Iraq is heading to a successful conclusion .
In a snapshot of a group whose energy and idealism have always been as alluring to politicians as its scattered focus and shifting interests have been frustrating , the poll found that substantially more Americans between the ages of 17 and 29 than four years ago are paying attention to the presidential race .
But they appeared to be really familiar with only two of the candidates , Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton , both Democrats .
They have continued a long - term drift away from the Republican Party , and although they are just as worried as the general population about the outlook for the country and think their generation is likely to be worse off than that of their parents , they retain a belief that their votes can make a difference , the poll found .
More than half of Americans between 17 and 29 years old — 54 percent — say they intend to vote for a Democrat for president in 2008 .
They share with the public at large a negative view of President Bush , who has a 28 percent approval rating with this group , and of the Republican Party .
They hold a markedly more positive view of Democrats than they do of Republicans .

Twitter is the app that everyone loves to hate .
Odds are you 've noticed people — probably much younger than you — manically using Twitter , a tool that lets you post brief updates about your everyday thoughts and activities to the Web via browser , cell phone , or IM .
The messages are limited to 140 characters , so they lean toward pithy , haiku - like utterances .
When I dropped by the main Twitter page , people had posted notes like " Doing lunch and picking up father - in - law from senior center . "
Or " Checking out Ghost Whisperer " or simply " Thinking I 'm old . "
( Most users are between 18 and 27 . )
It might seem like blogging taken to a supremely banal extreme .
Productivity guru Tim Ferriss calls Twitter " pointless email on steroids . "
One Silicon Valley businessman
I met complained that his staff had become Twitter - obsessed .
" You ca n't say anything in such a short message , " he said , baffled .
" So why do it at all ? "
They 're precisely right : Individually , most Twitter messages are stupefyingly trivial .
But the true value of Twitter — and the similarly mundane Dodgeball , a tool for reporting your real - time location to friends — is cumulative .
The power is in the surprising effects that come from receiving thousands of pings from your posse .
And this , as it turns out , suggests where the Web is heading .
When I see that my friend Misha is " waiting at Genius Bar to send my MacBook to the shop , " that 's not much information .
But when I get such granular updates every day for a month , I know a lot more about her .
And when my four closest friends and worldmates send me dozens of updates a week for five months , I begin to develop an almost telepathic awareness of the people most important to me .
It 's like proprioception , your body 's ability to know where your limbs are .
That subliminal sense of orientation is crucial for coordination :
It keeps you from accidentally bumping into objects , and it makes possible amazing feats of balance and dexterity .
Twitter and other constant - contact media create * social * proprioception .
They give a group of people a sense of itself , making possible weird , fascinating feats of coordination .
For example , when I meet Misha for lunch after not having seen her for a month , I already know the wireframe outline of her life :
She was nervous about last week 's big presentation , got stuck in a rare spring snowstorm , and became addicted to salt bagels .
With Dodgeball , I never actually race out to meet a friend when they report their nearby location ; I just note it as something to talk about the next time we meet .
It 's almost like ESP , which can be incredibly useful when applied to your work life .
You know who 's overloaded — * better not bug Amanda today — * and who 's on a roll .
A buddy list is n't just a vehicle to chat with friends but a way to sense their presence .
Are they available to talk ?
Have they been away ?
This awareness is crucial when colleagues are spread around the office , the country , or the world .
Twitter substitutes for the glances and conversations we had before we became a nation of satellite employees .
So why has Twitter been so misunderstood ?
Because it 's experiential .
Scrolling through random Twitter messages can't explain the appeal .
You have to * do * it — and , more important , do it with friends .
( Monitoring the lives of total strangers is fun but does n't have the same addictive effect . )
Critics sneer at Twitter and Dodgeball as hipster narcissism , but the real appeal of Twitter is almost the inverse of narcissism .
It 's practically collectivist — you 're creating a shared understanding larger than yourself .
Mind you , quick - ping media can be a massive time - suck .
You also may not want more information pecking at your frayed attention span .
And who knows ?
Twitter 's rabid fans ( their numbers are doubling every three weeks ) may well abandon it for a shinier new toy .
It happened to Friendster .
But here 's my bet :
The animating genius behind Twitter will live on in future apps .
That tactile sense of your community is simply too much fun , too useful — and it makes the group more than the sum of its parts .

In this post I draw heavily on that website and restrict myself to talking about light water fission reactors .
There are a variety of different and more advanced reactor schemes that could be addressed in a future post .
There are more details on our website on all of the topics covered here .
In the middle of the last year it became clear to me that the Australian Government was interested in having a debate about Nuclear Energy for Australia .
I decided that we , in the School of Physics , could make a positive contribution to the debate and organized a study group to investigate this .
We constructed a wiki - based website ( http://nuclearinfo.net ) where we placed our findings .
We went live in December , 2005 and have updated the website as we 've learned more about energy issues and Nuclear Power .
[ editor 's note , by Prof. Goose ]
This is an updated / edited repost by Martin Sevior , Associate Professor , School of Physics , University of Melbourne .
We thought this a worthy topic for discussion as nuclear power keeps coming up in many of our threads .
The original post can be found here .
( Forget not the reddit and digg buttons ... )
Nuclear Fission Basics
A nuclear fission reaction occurs when a 235U or 239 Pu nucleus captures a neutron , splits into two smaller nuclei and releases 2 - 3 more neutrons .
These neutrons can be used to initiate further reactions .
From an energy standpoint , the significant feature is that the release is around 200 Million Electron Volts per reaction .
A typical chemical process such as the oxidation of hydrogen , emits 20 electron volts per reaction .
Thus nuclear fission provides around 10 million times more energy than chemical processes .
This factor of 10 million sets the scale of Nuclear Power .
Natural Uranium consists of 99.3 % 238U and 0.7 % 235U .
Conventional light water reactors utilize fuel with an initial 235U concentration enriched to at least 3.5 % .
The energy released from these reactors comes from the fission of 235U and 239Pu ( which is produced via neutron captures on 238U ) .
The heat from the reaction is used to drive steam turbines with a conversion efficiency of around 33 % .
Typically the fuel is loaded at 3.5 % 235U and replaced once the 235U concentration has fallen to 1.2 % .
A 1 GW light water Nuclear Power Plant consumes 30 tonnes of fuel per year .
A coal - fired plant of the same magnitude consumes 9000 tonnes of coal per day .
World Uranium supply
Given that this website is devoted to the study of peak oil , I think it 's appropriate to first look at the prospects for using Uranium as fuel source for at least the rest of the next century .
Uranium is not a particularly rare mineral .
It has an average crustal abundance of about 2.7 Parts Per Million ( PPM ) , which about the same as tin and zinc .
There is an estimated 40 trillion tonnes of Uranium in the Earth 's crust .
To date we have mined less than one ten- millionth of this ( as opposed to about half the world 's conventional crude Oil ) .
A typical 1 GW Nuclear reactor requires around 200 tonnes of natural Uranium per year .
Current world consumption of Uranium amounts to some 65,000 tonnes per annum .
Current world supply is around 40,000 tonnes per annum .
The mismatch is maintained by the drawn - down of stocks and the use of fissile material available from the reduction in Nuclear Weapons in the USA and ex-Soviet Union .
The combination caused a decade - long depression of World Uranium price .
These stocks and secondary sources will be exhausted by the middle of the next decade .
In early 2003 the price of Uranium was $ 23 per kg , it is currently at around $ 187 per kg .
This price increase has triggered a rapid increase in exploration activity around the world .
At $ 187 per kg , the price of Uranium Ore contributes about 0.37 cents per KW - HR to the price of Nuclear generated electricity .
Reasonably assured reserves ( or proven reserves ) refers to known commercial quantities of Uranium recoverable with current technology and for a specified price .
The terms additional and speculative reserves refer to extensions to well explored deposits or in new deposits that are thought to exist based on well defined geological data .
As of the beginning of 2003 World Uranium reserves were :
Reasonable Assured Reserves recoverable at less than $ US130 / kgU ( or $ US50 / lb U3O8 ) = 3.10 - 3.28 million tonnes .
Additional reserves recoverable at less than $ US130 / kgU ( or $ US50 / lb U3O8 ) = 10.690 million tonnes .
As of the beginning of 2005 World Uranium reserves were :
Reasonable Assured Reserves recoverable at less than $ US130 / kgU ( or $ US50 / lb U3O8 ) = 4.7 million tonnes .
Additional recoverable Uranium is estimated to be 35 million tonnes
The substantial increase ( almost 50 % ) from 2003 shows the results of the world - wide renewed exploration effort spurred by the increase in Uranium prices which commenced in 2004 .
This increase in activity has continued through to 2006 .
Thus , the provable uranium resources amount to approximately 85 years supply at the current level of consumption with current technology , with another 500 years of additional reserves .
It is worth noting that the numbers above do not reflect the considerable increase in Uranium exploration that has taken place in 2005 and 2006 .
It is interesting to speculate on the ultimate size of the world Uranium resource , if it were to power light water reactors .
This can be estimated by comparing the energy produced by a nuclear plant to the energy required to mine and refine the Ore .
As one moves to lower grade Ore , the energy cost the mining and refining increases .
However the total resource size increases at these higher dilutions .
If we assume the rate at which the energy cost increases is inversely proportional to the Uranium concentration in the Ore we can estimate the ultimate size of Uranium resource if consumed in light water reactors .
The Rossing mine in Nambia is a large , low grade Ore deposit .
It produces around 3000 tonnes of Uranium per year .
The energy cost of this process is 1 PetaJoule .
Now 3000 tonnes of Uranium provides 15 GigaWatt - years of power which is about 470 PetaJoules of energy .
So the energy gain from Rossing is close to a factor of 500 .
The grade of Uranium at Rossing is 0.035 % by weight ( about 350 ppm ) .
Deffeyes & MacGregor have estimated the distribution of Uranium in different types of rock and show that shales and phosphates contain 8000 times as much Uranium as current Uranium Ore bodies at a concentration of 10 - 20 PPM .
These rocks are potentially minable with an energy gain of 15 - 30 .
Consequently , unlike conventional Oil , Uranium resource exhaustion will not be an issue for the foreseeable future .
Energy Lifecycle of Nuclear Power
The performance of Nuclear Power can be compared to other energy sources by calculating the total energy required to build and run a Nuclear Power plant and comparing it to the total energy it produces .
The following set of calculations is also taken from the independently audited , Vattenfall Environmental Product Declaration for its 3090 MW Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden .
A more detailed description is here .
Vattenfall have also made available the aggregated data set as a spreadsheet .
You can download it from here .
Vattenfall is a large European Energy utility that operates a variety of energy generation technologies including Nuclear , Hydro , Natural gas , Coal , Oil , Peat , Biomass , Wind and Photovoltaic .
We chose this because it had been independently audited , and includes the entire lifecycle of the processes which includes the eventual long - term disposal of the waste .
Sweden and Finland have perhaps the most developed nuclear waste disposal plans of any country .
The following table displays the source and the amount of energy required to produce 1 KW - Hr of electricity .
The table includes the energy used in construction of the plant , mining the Uranium , enriching it , converting it to fuel , disposing the waste and decommissioning the plant .
The plant is assumed to run for 40 years .
There is an additional 0.026 grams of Uranium consumed in generating this one KW - Hr of electricity .
This 0.026 grams includes the Uranium used to generate power and the Uranium consumed by the French Nuclear Power plants that produced the electricity that enriched the Fuel .
So the Plant produces 93 times more energy than it consumes .
Or put another way , the non-nuclear energy investment required to generate electricity for 40 years is repaid in 5 months .
Normalized to 1 GigaWatt electrical capacity , the energy required to construct and decommission the plant , which amounts to 4 Peta - Joules ( PJ ) , is repaid in 1.5 months .
The energy required to dispose of the waste is also 4 PJ and repaid in 1.5 months .
In total this is less than 0.8 % of the all the electrical energy produced by the plant .
Greenhouse Gas emissions
Although the processes of running a Nuclear Power plant generates no CO2 , some CO2 emissions arise from the construction of the plant , the mining of the Uranium , the enrichment of the Uranium , its conversion into Nuclear Fuel , its final disposal and the final plant decommissioning .
The amount of CO2 generated by these secondary processes primarily depends on the method used to enrich the Uranium ( the gaseous diffusion enrichment process uses about 50 times more electricity than the gaseous centrifuge method ) and the source of electricity used for the enrichment process .
It has been the subject of some controversy .
To estimate the total CO2 emissions from Nuclear Power we also use the work of Vattenfall .
Vattenfall finds that averaged over the entire lifecycle of their Nuclear Plant including Uranium mining , milling , enrichment , plant construction , operating , decommissioning and waste disposal , the total CO2 emitted per KW - Hr of electricity produced is 3.3 grams per KW - Hr of produced power .
Vattenfall measures its CO2 output from Natural Gas to be 400 grams per KW - Hr and from coal to be 700 grams per KW - Hr .
Thus nuclear power generated by Vattenfall , emits less than one hundredth the CO2 of Fossil - Fuel based generation .
Back of the Envelope estimates
There is a meme that the energy cost and greenhouse emissions of Nuclear Power are such that they require 7 years of operation to become carbon neutral because of the embodied energy in construction and the energy cost of Uranium mining .
We find Nuclear to be much better than than that so I think it helps to do some back - of - the - envelope calculations to estimate the reasonableness of our calculations .
The Forsmark reactors , normalized to 1 GW output , have a total mass of about 1 million tonnes , most of which is steel and concrete .
If we assign the total mass to concrete and 1 carbon dioxide molecule per molecule of silicon - dioxide , ( a substantial over estimate , ) we get less than 2 million tones of CO2 emitted directly from construction .
A 1 GW coal - fired power station consumes 3 million tonnes of coal per year , emitting 10 million tonnes of CO2 .
This is over 5 times are much as the direct construction costs every year .
Regarding Uranium mining , Australia has a large mining industry , which consumed 232 PJ of primary energy in 2005 - 2006 .
It generates output worth around $ AUD 91 billion dollars in 2005 - 2006 .
Australia ’s Uranium output is around 10,000 tonnes per annum with a financial value less than 2 % of the total .
If we can assign the energy cost of Uranium mining in proportion to the value of product , we get 4 - 5 PJ of primary energy required for Australia 's Uranium production .
That 10,000 tonnes is sufficient for 50 one GW reactors for 1 year of operation .
This represents 1500 PJ of generated electrical energy .
So mining accounts for much less than 1 % of the energy output of Nuclear Power .
Nuclear Costs
The cost of generating power via nuclear energy can be separated into the following components :
The construction cost of building the plant .
The operating cost of running the plant and generating energy .
The cost of waste disposal from the plant .
The cost of decommissioning the plant
Quantifying some of these costs is difficult as it requires an extrapolation into the future .
Construction Costs
Construction costs are currently difficult to quantify but dominate the cost of Nuclear Power .
The problem is that third generation power plants currently proposed are claimed to be both substantially cheaper and faster to construct than the second generation power plants now in operation throughout the world .
The Nuclear Industry says its learned the lessons of economy - of - volume demonstrated by the French Nuclear Program , and that these will be employed for the new power plants .
For example Westinghouse claims its Advanced PWR reactor , the AP1000 , will cost USD $ 1500 - $ 1800 per KW for the first reactor and may fall to USD $ 1200 per KW for subsequent reactors .
They also claim these will be ready for electricity production 3 years after first pouring concrete .
This should be compared to second generation plants which , in the U.S.A. , had construction costs up to $ 6000 per KW and generally took more than five years to complete .
Meanwhile the Chinese Nuclear Power Industry has won contracts to build new plants of their own design at capital cost reported to be $ 1500 per KW and $ 1300 per KW at sites in South - East and North - East China .
The first Westinghouse AP1000 will be also be constructed in China .
Newspaper reports are that the cost for the 2 twin units with a total of 4.4 GW capacity is between 5.3 - 8 billion dollars .
That is in the range $ 1200 to $ 1800 per KW of capacity .
Operating , Waste Disposal and Decommissioning Costs
Operating costs are much easier to quantify and are independently verified as they relate directly to the profitability of the Utilities which operate them .
Since 1987 the cost of producing electricity from has decreased from 3.63 cents per KW - Hr to 1.68 cents per KW - Hour in 2004 and plant availability has increased from 67 % to over 90 % .
The operating cost includes a charge of 0.15 cents per KW - Hr to fund the disposal of radioactive waste and for decommissioning the reactor .
This fund is currently capitalized at $ 24 billion dollars .
The Swedish Nuclear Industry has charged 0.13 cents per KW - Hr for waste disposal and decommissioning .
Sweden has well developed plans for these which appear to be adequately covered by these charges .
The US plans for waste disposal at Yucca Mountain remain highly controversial .
It may be that the charges levied by the US NRC are insufficient .
Sensitivity Analysis of the cost of Nuclear Power
In our study we performed a sensitivity analysis of the cost of Nuclear Power .
We employed a simple model which gives a reasonable guideline to the cost in US cents of electricity per KW - Hr based on various assumptions for construction cost , operating costs , interest rates and construction time .
The plant is assumed to have a 1 GW capacity .
If we assume a 7 % interest rate and 4 year construction period , US operating costs in the second best quartile , the cost of electricity production for plants that cost $ 1.2 Billion , $ 1.5 Billion and $ 2.0 Billion US dollars would be 3.3 , 3.8 and 4.4 US cents per KW - Hr respectively .
If the AP1000 lives up to its promises of $ 1200 per KW construction cost and 3 year construction time , it will provide electricity fully cost competitive with Fossil Fuel based generating facilities .
Safety of Nuclear reactors
The chain reaction that provides the power - source of nuclear reactors , is controlled by adjusting the neutron multiplication factor , k .
The parameter k is the overall fraction of neutrons from one fission generation that initiate further fission reactions .
If k > 1 the number of neutrons grows with time and more power is generated .
If k < 1 , the reaction decays with time and less power is generated .
In a steady operation k is adjusted to be almost precisely 1 .
This is possible because round 1 % of the neutrons in a reactor are emitted after a delay of a several seconds even though the typical cycle time between succeeding generations in a light water reactor is of the order of 10 milliseconds ( these are initiated by prompt neutrons neutrons directly from the fission ) .
The multiplication factor is adjusted by changing the configuration of control rods which absorb neutrons within the reactor .
In addition to this active control two natural processes provide negative feedbacks which stablize the reactor .
The first of these is a negative temperature coefficient .
As the temperature of the fuel increases , the vibrational energy of the 238U increases which increases the rate of neutron absorption .
Thus k decreases and the reaction rate slows down .
The second is what is called a " negative void coefficient " .
What this means is that if the water that is used to cool and moderate the neutrons decreases in mass ( for example via steam bubbles forming voids ) , it no longer is an effective neutron moderator which also slows down the reaction rate .
So light water reactors are inherently stable to first order .
Of course things can and do go wrong over the course of time .
These are normally corrected by routine adjustments of the reactor parameters .
However the worst thing that can happen is for a massive loss of core coolant via a catastrophic accident .
If this happens the nuclear reaction will stop but the fuel itself will continue to generate heat from the radioactive decay of fission products .
Without the cooling water , the fuel elements will eventually melt .
Should this occur , the fuel is contained within the extremely strong shell of the containment vessel .
The melt - down will destroy the economic value of the reactor , however the public remains protected .
To prevent meltdowns , current second generation reactors employ multiple backup cooling circuits driven by active components like pumps and valves .
These are active safety systems and modern reactors are projected to have 1 major core damage incident per 100,000 years of reactor operation .
In contrast , new designs such as the Westinghouse AP1000 employ principles of physics such as phase change and gravity to maintain cooling water in the event of a catastrophic loss .
The design is simpler , smaller and safer and cheaper than current reactors .
The American NRC estimates 1 major core damage incident per 2 million years of reactor operation for the AP1000 .
There are been numerous reactor incidents over the years .
Some more serious than others and most recently at the Forsmark complex cited above .
However Three Mile Island and the Chernobyl catastrophe are the events that most people associate with Nuclear Power accidents .
The Three Mile Island accident resulted in a contained melt - down .
The Chernobyl event was the result of a fundamentally unsafe reactor design ( the graphite - moderated , water cooled reactor has a positive void coefficient at low power as well as no containment vessel ) together with a complete lack of safety culture .
The following links provide excellent descriptions of the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl events .
The Three Mile Island accident caused the US NRC to re-evaluate Nuclear Plant designs and in many cases ordered changes .
These changes were both expensive and time consuming to fix but have increased the safety of US plants .
It is a condition of entry to the EU that Chernobyl style plants be shutdown .
Nuclear Waste
Spent Nuclear Fuel ( SNF ) from a reactor is highly radioactive .
The activity can be broadly divided into two classes .
Fission products , ( nuclei created from the fission process ) and Trans - Uranics .
These are nuclei that are heavier than Uranium and are created when 238U captures a neutron .
Fission products are generally short lived while TransUranics can have half - lives in the range of tens of thousands of years .
Once the SNF has been removed from the nuclear reactor it is placed in interim storage at the reactor site .
Usually this consists of putting the nuclear waste into large pools of water .
The water cools the radioactive isotopes and shields the environment from the radiation .
Nuclear waste is typically stored in these supervised pools between 20 - 40 years , although this could be reduced to 5 years .
As the SNF ages the radioactivity decreases , reaching the point where can be placed in dry storage facilities .
Throughout this time there is a great reduction in heat and radioactivity and this makes handling of nuclear waste safer and easier .
However the TransUranic component of SNF must still be isolated from the environment for 100,000 years or more .
The fission products typically reach background levels after 500 years .
After this " cooling off " period the high level waste can be handled in different ways .
It can be reprocessed ( which invloves extracting the Uranium and Plutonium ) then disposed of permanently or directly disposed permanently in a geological repository .
There is also very active research into " burning " the TransUranic 's in either advanced reactors or accelerator driven subcritical assemblies .
However this technology has not yet been developed to work on a large scale .
Finally it could be left in dry casks for " interim storage " .
These are predicted to be safe and stable for at least 1 century .
The most advanced concepts of long - term disposal of Nuclear waste is for deep geological burial .
The Nordic countries , Sweden and Finland are perusing solutions which employ multiple barriers to provide isolation from slow - moving groundwater .
Finland has selected a site for disposal , Sweden is choosing between two locations for their facility .
The earliest start up date for the repositories is 2020 .
Nuclear Proliferation
The Uranium enrichment used for light water reactors is not sufficient for a Nuclear Weapon and while light water reactors produces hundreds of kilograms of plutonium during operations , the plutonium produced has too much 240 Pu for a useful Nuclear Weapon .
What happens is that the 240 Pu builds up in a reactor with operation .
In a light - water reactor , the 240 Pu exceeds useful concentration ( 7 % ) after 4 months of operation .
Nuclear fuel is normally left in place for over two years .
After this time the 240 Pu concentration is 25 % which is well beyond the militarily useful range .
For this reason , light water reactors are called proliferation resistant .
Normal operations preclude the production of militarily useful Plutonium .
Abnormal operations are easy to detect .
Conclusions
Technically , there appear to be no show stoppers for a considerable expansion of Nuclear Power throughout the world .
It is a low carbon energy source with abundant fuel supplies .
The technology works and has much potential for improvement .
Whether or not a large scale expansion eventuates depends on how it competes with Coal on economic grounds and with the public on political grounds .
This in turn will be determined by the performance of the nuclear industry over the next few years as these purportedly cheaper and safer plants are built .
I think it is worth showing the final graph from M. King Hubberts ' seminal paper " Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels " .
Mitt Romney spent nearly $ 2 K on makeup while governor Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 19 , 2007 Print This Email This
The perception that Mitt Romney is some sort of pretty - boy was burnished earlier this week when reports emerged that he spent $ 300 in campaign funds for makeup " consulting " this year .
It turns out Romney has maintained an expensive beauty regimen for years .
A RAW STORY analysis of Romney 's campaign finance records during his time as Massachusetts governor shows he spent nearly $ 2,000 on makeup artists over four years .
The personal - beautification spending was divided over six sessions to three separate companies .
Individual makeup jobs ranged in price from $ 180 to $ 690 .
After reports emerged in April that Democratic candidate John Edwards spent $ 400 for a haircut , the media jumped on the story .
It was mentioned twice as often as Romney 's makeup work in the days after each story was reported , according to a database search .
Romney himself was quick to join the Edwards - bashing bandwagon , telling Massachusetts reporters that he paid no more than $ 50 for a trim .
" You know I think John Edwards was right .
There are two Americas .
There is the America where people pay $ 400 for a haircut and then there is everybody else , " Romney said .
Romney 's first make - up expense dates back to April of 2002 , when he listed a $ 400 expenditure on " make up for convention . "
It 's an apparent reference to Romney 's speech that month to the Massachusetts Republican convention when he was formally anointed as the GOP 's gubernatorial candidate .
Three other makeup expenses were listed in early February of 2004 , 2005 and 2006 .
Those are likely related to Romney 's State of the Commonwealth addresses , which he delivered in January of each of those years .
Romney was elected Massachusetts governor in 2002 , and he served in office from January 2003 until January of this year .
Romney 's campaign finance records were accessed through a searchable database on the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance Web site .
During his time in Massachusetts , Romney spent $ 1,974 to have his makeup done by three companies based in the state -- Team , The Agency Inc. ; Phoebe Ramler , which is misspelled on the disclosures ; and Ingrid Cordeiro .
A Team representative told RAW STORY the company would not comment on its work with Romney ; representatives of Phoebe Ramler and Ingrid Cordeiro could not be reached for comment .
" A make - up person was sometimes used before the Governor 's major televised speeches , which is pretty much the standard for every elected official since Nixon 's five - o' clock shadow incident , " Romney spokesman Stephen Smith said in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
Smith was referring to the first televised presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960 .
Television viewers believed Kennedy won the debate , a perception historians attribute to Nixon 's unkempt appearance .
It is not uncommon for politicians to hire makeup artists before appearing beneath harsh television lights .
Indeed , Phoebe Ramler has made up politicians including President Bush , former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush , and Sen. John Kerry , according to the company 's Web site .
The company also has done makeup work for celebrities such as members of the rock band Aerosmith , Mario Lopez and Gene Wilder .
The Politico on Monday reported that Romney twice paid $ 150 to a California company that describes itself as " a mobile beauty team for hair , makeup and men's grooming and spa services . "
Campaign spokesman Kevin Madden told The Politico Romney had the company , Hidden Beauty of West Hills , Calif. , do his makeup before the May 3 Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley , Calif .
The campaign paid for a second makeup appointment but did n't utilize the company 's services , Madden said .
Unlike his presidential campaign 's financial disclosure , which listed the makeup services as " communications consulting , " Romney 's spending during his time as governor was clearly listed as " makeup " in five cases and " professional services " once .
Romney 's appearance has been on his advisers minds since at least December of last year , according to a campaign document the Boston Globe revealed in February .
The 77 - page PowerPoint presentation said campaign aides were worried that Romney 's hair looks too perfect and that he earned a reputation as " Slick Dancing Mitt , " the Globe reported .
The initial report on Romney 's makeup expenses generated substantial traffic in the blogosphere , with the Romney revelation garnering at least 135 blog posts .
But some bloggers do n't believe the Romney story will get as much play in the mainstream media as the reports of Edwards ' $ 400 haircut , which has been mentioned more than 800 times in media reports since April , according to a search of LexisNexis .
Edwards ' haircut was mentioned 44 times in the four days since it was first reported , April 16 ; Romney 's makeup job has only received 20 mentions since it was reported Monday , according to the news database .
" I 'm not going to hold my breath until the media over saturates this story to the point where close to a majority of Americans can identify Romney as the candidate vain enough to plunk down $ 300 for a makeover , as they have done with John Edwards and his haircut , " Jonathan Singer wrote on MyDD.com , citing a Fox News poll that found 44 percent of Americans knew Edwards spent $ 400 for his haircut .
Conservative bloggers dismissed the story as frivolous because it is common for candidates to wear makeup on television .
In a post titled , " Let He Who is Without Makeup Cast the First Stone , " National Review Online blogger Jim Geraghty explained that CNN provides him with a makeup specialist before he goes on TV .
" Just about every time she finishes , I 'm thinking , ' man , I wish I could have her doing this before I walk out the door every morning , ' " he writes .
" So I 'm not gonna throw any stones at Romney over this . "
Maybe this is why they ’re supporting a candidate that promises to bring them home ?

“ I challenge anybody in Congress to do my rotation , ” said Spc. Michael Vassell of Apache Company .
“ They do n’t have to do anything , they just come hang out with me and go home at the times I go home , and come stay here 15 months with me . ”
Apache Company was sent to Iraq in June 2006 for a 12 - month rotation which has since been extended to a 15 - month tour .
“ It ’s a joke .

“ Because we have people up there in Congress with the brain of a 2 - year - old who do n’t know what they are doing — they do n’t experience it .
I challenge the president or anyone who has us for 15 months to ride alongside me , ” Vassell said .
“ I [ would ] do another 15 months if he comes out here and rides along with me every day for 15 months .
I ’ll do 15 more months .
They do n’t even have to pay me extra . ”
When Are Macros Useful ?
Many of us are used to being told that macros are useful .
However few of us really understand why .
A large - ish , if gradually dwindling , number of people use C , and its preprocessor , on a regular basis .
This gives them access to a crude , dangerous , but surprisingly effective , macro system .
However the type of macro system we are told is most useful is that of a LISP - like language .
Commentaries , such as this article extolling the virtues of Scheme - like macros , continually reinforce the notion that macros are a programming nirvana .
Claims of an order of magnitude improvement in developer time when macros are used are not uncommon .
And because most of do not , and probably have never , used a language with a real macro system , we tend to be somewhat in awe of the programming intelligentsia who broadcast such messages .
For quite some time I have held a somewhat different opinion .
For modern - and I use that word very deliberately - programming languages , I believe that LISP - like macros in their raw form are n't hugely useful .
Some justification for this position is thus in order .
I designed the Converge language which is one of the few modern programming languages with a macro system .
Because its macro system is fairly directly inherited from Template Haskell , it 's rather more verbosely referred to as a compile - time meta - programming facility ; but really , it 's just a macro system .
From a practical point of view , there is only one substantive difference between Scheme - like macros and Converge macros .
Scheme explicitly identifies macros , and then function calls which reference that macro magically turn into macro calls .
In Converge , macros are just normal every - day functions , but the call site of the macro is explicitly identified .
From an expressivity perspective , the two approaches can be considered equivalent .
Adding a macro system into Converge was no small task .
I had to understand a lot of things that my lazy side would rather have glossed over and I had to make innumerable mistakes before I got to a reasonable design .
Fairly early on in this process I realised that there were only ever likely to be a few normal Converge programs that were likely to benefit from raw LISP - like macros .
To see why , we need to take another step back .
Compared to Converge , LISP in its purest form is almost unimaginably spartan .
In fact , most of the successful programming languages that date from around the early 70's or earlier , tend to lack features that most programmers now take for granted ( although at least LISP and its descendants feature automatic memory management ) .
As a general rule I am all for simplicity in life , being something of a simpleton myself .
However simplicity is not an end in itself .
Stone benches have an integrity , and air of stability about them , that no sofa can match ; but I 've not been to many houses with a stone chair in the front room .
Thus an inevitable side effect of spartan languages is that people need to encode extra functionality in order to make life somewhat more bearable .
Macros are an incredibly powerful way to encode such functionality in LISP - like languages .
For example , you want an object orientated style system on top of LISP ?
Use macros .
Thus macros are an integral part of the modern LISP experience : they allow users to raise the level of abstraction of the programming language .
The reason why raw macros are not especially useful for most Converge programs is that the base language itself is fairly feature rich .
This is one reason why I used the word modern earlier .
For example , no one in their right mind is likely to use macros to create an OO layer in Converge ; it already has a perfectly serviceable one .
In fact , for the majority of uses of macros in LISP , the chances are that it's not worth the effort to create an analogue in Converge .
The LISP community has traditionally thought that raw macros raise the level of abstraction of any programming language they 're inserted to ; in other words , they raise the level of abstraction relative to its starting point .
My experience on the other hand is that raw macros instead raise the level of abstraction to an absolute level .
Put crudely , if macros raise the abstraction level to X , and your language is abstraction level X - 1 , then macros will be a gain ; but if your language is already at abstraction level X you 're not going to notice much improvement .
Assuming you agree with me that raw macros are n't hugely useful for modern programming languages , you might reasonably ask : why did you continue implementing such a thing in Converge ?
Here we see why I 've used the term raw macros earlier .
Converge has raw macros because they are the lowest common denominator of compile - time meta- programming ( and thus far the shipping Converge system uses precisely one raw macro call , and it's not a particularly crucial one ) .
However Converge also contains a second feature , the DSL block which is a simple layer on top of raw macros which allows arbitrary syntaxes to be neatly embedded in a Converge file and compiled out , while still retaining excellent debugging support .
It 's too early to state with confidence whether DSL blocks are a successful or practical means of improving the level of abstraction of Converge .
However it does give some insight into the question posed at the beginning of this article .
Macros are useful when they give the user the ability to rise above the base programming language .
Thus raw macros are a boon to LISP , but offer little to Converge .
DSL blocks seem to confer an advantage to Converge , but the programming languages of the future may subsume such functionality .
I do not think that there is a fundamental law of the programming universe which says macros always increase the level of abstraction .
Macros are n't an end in themselves .
If programming languages incorporate macros in such a way that they help users raise the level of abstraction , then they are useful .
The way in which macros achieve that will evolve as programming languages evolve .
And if macro technology fails to keep up , or proves inadequate for the job , then macros will no longer be useful .
Already I think that LISP - style raw macros are gently heading towards obscurity .
Perhaps languages such as Converge and Metalua , as immature as they currently are , will point to a new chapter in macro technology and dissemination .

Moving quickly to implement the bill signed by President Bush this week that authorizes military trials of enemy combatants , the administration has formally notified the U.S. District Court here that it no longer has jurisdiction to consider hundreds of habeas corpus petitions filed by inmates at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba .
In a notice dated Wednesday , the Justice Department listed 196 pending habeas cases , some of which cover groups of detainees .
The new Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) , it said , provides that " no court , justice , or judge " can consider those petitions or other actions related to treatment or imprisonment filed by anyone designated as an enemy combatant , now or in the future .
Beyond those already imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay or elsewhere , the law applies to all non-U.S. citizens , including permanent U.S. residents .
The new law already has been challenged as unconstitutional by lawyers representing the petitioners .
The issue of detainee rights is likely to reach the Supreme Court for a third time .
Habeas corpus , a Latin term meaning " you have the body , " is one of the oldest principles of English and American law .
It requires the government to show a legal basis for holding a prisoner .
A series of unresolved federal court cases brought against the administration over the last several years by lawyers representing the detainees had left the question in limbo .
Two years ago , in Rasul v. Bush , which gave Guantanamo detainees the right to challenge their detention before a U.S. court , and in this year 's Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the Supreme Court appeared to settle the issue in favor of the detainees .
But the new legislation approved by Congress last month , which gives Bush the authority to try detainees before military commissions , included a provision removing judicial review for all habeas claims .
Immediately after Bush signed the act into law Tuesday , the Justice Department sent a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit asserting the new authorities and informing the court that it no longer had jurisdiction over a combined habeas case that had been under consideration since 2004 .
The U.S. District Court cases , which had been stayed pending the appeals court decision , were similarly invalid , the administration informed that court on Wednesday .
A number of legal scholars and members of Congress , including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , have said that the habeas provision of the new law violates a clause of the Constitution that says the right to challenge detention " shall not be suspended " except in cases of " rebellion or invasion . "
Historically , the Constitution has been interpreted to apply equally to citizens and noncitizens under U.S. jurisdiction .
The administration 's persistence on the issue " demonstrates how difficult it is for the courts to enforce [ the clause ] in the face of a resolute executive branch that is bound and determined to resist it , " said Joseph Margulies , a Northwestern University law professor involved in the detainee cases .
On Tuesday , the appeals court granted a petition by lawyers for the detainees to argue against the new law .
Vincent Warren , the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents many of the detainees , said yesterday that he expected the administration to file a motion for dismissal of all the cases before the defense challenge is heard .
" We and other habeas counsel are going to vigorously oppose dismissal of these cases , " Warren said .
" We are going to challenge that law as violating the Constitution on several grounds . "
Whichever side loses in the upcoming court battles , he said , will then appeal to the Supreme Court .

The AU will have day - to - day control in Darfur
Under the new plan , the AU will run day - to - day operations , while the UN is expected to have overall control of between 17,000 to 19,000 peacekeepers .
However , there remains some doubt as to whether Sudan would allow peacekeepers made up of non-African troops .
The current AU force of 7,000 has struggled to contain the violence .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has hailed the agreement and stressed the need for an immediate comprehensive ceasefire in the strife - torn region , AFP news agency reports , quoting a statement by UN spokeswoman Michele Montas .
' Fine print '
Sudan 's foreign minister said that Sudan would accept non-African troops in Darfur , but US officials are sceptical .
Sean McCormack , US State Department spokesman , said : " President Bashir has made promises before about accepting an AU / UN hybrid force , but there 's always the fine print " .
He said it would be difficult to get enough African troops to go to Darfur because " the assets simply are n't there " .
" So , to say that the force would be limited to only African troops is , in effect , to say that you are not agreeing to the full 17,000 to 19,000 troops , " he said .
More than 200,000 people have died in the four - year conflict and around two million have fled to refugee camps .
The AU and UN presented their revised peacekeeping plan at talks in Addis Ababa .
The new plan has been created to get round the objections of the Sudanese government , which does not want a solely UN force , which it says would be like a Western invasion of their country .
" In view of the explanation and clarification provided by the AU and the UN as contained in the presentation , the government of Sudan accepted the joint proposals on the hybrid operation , " AP news agency quotes Said Djinnit , the AU 's top peace and security official , as saying .
Vague
The BBC's Elizabeth Blunt in Addis Ababa says the mood was cheerful at the AU headquarters after the announcement was made .
A timetable for the deployment of the force was vague , she said , and will not be before next year .
" This is a unique situation of a hybrid operation and we are most likely going to face some difficulties on the ground , but with the spirit of co-operation we are confident , " Mr Djinnit told the BBC .
" We came a long way together not only as the AU and UN but also in working with the government of Sudan .
As far as possible the African character of the mission should be preserved , Mr Djinnit said .
Our correspondent says the actual composition of the force was not part of the agreement - this will be the next stage in the process .
But from Mr Djinnit 's comments it is expected that it will be made up mainly African or Asian soldiers , with possible Scandinavian expertise .
No US or UK soldiers are likely to be part of the operation , our reporter says .

We finally put the new web site of Seaside online .
The official announcement :
After too many delays the new Seaside web site has finally gone online .
Since we switched hosts it might take a moment until the DNS update propagates to you .
The first thing you ’ll notice is the updated look for which we no longer have to excuse .
We cleaned up the content and added a lot of new stuff .
Among others you ’ll find interactive examples , feed aggregation Monticello commit logs and the answers to often asked questions like ’ What is the best Swiss cheese ?’.
Under the hood we made a lot of technology upgrades .
We finally run on Seaside 2.8 and the Pier CMS with several plug-ins , we are also hosted at Seaside - Hosting .
The only way to eat more dog food would be running on SqueakNOS .
The page is not yet fully finished ( and probably never will be ) but we feel we ’re at the point where it ’s significantly better than the old one .
So if you have suggestions for improvements or want to help get in contact with us .
DIGG THIS
A few weeks ago , as I waited in a line about 25 people long in the largest post office in the section of town I happened to be in , I began to wonder :
What about the operation of this place would change if there was actually competition for their business ?
For those who do n't know , the post office has no competition , by virtue of government decree .
Ironically , just few weeks after that , I was interviewed at the same post office as part of a local TV station 's attempt to get people 's reactions about the increase in postal rates .
( Full disclosure : I had n't even noticed that the rate change was pending ! )
I told them simply , " It does n't matter what I think about the new rates , since I have n't a choice . "
The reporter who interviewed me admitted that she was surprised to have never considered that fact .
By law , we have to use the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) for delivery of first - class mail .
What possible benefit can we , the users of this service , derive from this law ?
What 's that you say ?
Did I hear someone scream out " none " ?
( Winner , winner , chicken dinner ! )
Lysander Spooner challenged the post office for the mail delivery business quite some time back , but Congress came to the rescue .
Given the historic facts of Spooner ’s challenge to the USPS , and basic Austrian economic reasoning , let 's brainstorm both the upside and the downside of open , free - market competition for the delivery of first - class mail , shall we ?
Let us also keep in mind that we really do n’t know how the post office would change , either for the better or the worse , under a truly free - market scenario .
But we know it would change .
The most basic aprioristic analysis would seem to indicate that it would change for the better .
One other point , before we begin our brainstormed list .
There are some people who might argue that the USPS is an example of a government service that actually does work .
The U.S. has the cheapest stamps of any country where the delivery of mail is ostensibly not subsidized .
( The USPS is supposedly not directly subsidized via tax revenue .
As such , one might argue that they actually have to be self - supporting in some sense . )
In the print version of the Rochester local article , the reporter says , " USPS is regulated by the federal government but is n't subsidized with tax money . "
Not quite .
Digging a little deeper provides the truth : the USPS is subsidized .
One need only refer to the 2005 annual report to get some illustrative numbers .
A line item showing as " U.S. government appropriations u2014 received " lists an amount of $ 503 million .
The 2003 annual report shows a similar line item with a similar heading .
That line item lists an amount of $ 762 million .
Call me a nitpicker , but those listings both sound suspiciously like , well , government appropriations , A.K.A. taxpayer investment , to me .
Looking further into the 2005 annual report we find this .
" We commenced operations on July 1 , 1971 , in accordance with the provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act ( the Act ) .
The equity that the U.S. government held in the former Post Office Department became our initial capital .
We valued the assets of the former Post Office Department at original cost less accumulated depreciation .
The initial transfer of assets , including property , equipment and cash , totaled $ 1.7 billion .
Subsequent cash contributions and transfers of assets between 1972 and 1982 totaled approximately $ 1.3 billion , resulting in total government contributions of approximately $ 3 billion . "
So even without the ( apparently ) semi-annual infusions of " government appropriations " the USPS received something like $ 3 billion in " start - up " capital .
That is about as far from " no taxpayer support " as one can get !
Additionally , these are economic benefits that private companies such as FedEx , UPS , and DHL do not receive and they are still kicking the Post Office ’s butt in the realm where the USPS is not protected by fiat .
( Have you seen the FedEx boxes placed outside the USPS recently ? )
Clearly the USPS benefits from government subsidy , no matter what they choose to call it .
Now back to the question at hand : how might things be different with competition ?
Benefits of Postal Competition
More Services
Business use of the post office would disappear almost completely , practically overnight if the USPS had to compete head - to - head with other vendors .
UPS and FedEx would likely offer incredible rates on first - class postage to existing customers who are already using their other services .
That would leave the USPS with the job of basically delivering personal letters and junk mail .
For a while , individuals would go with the name they trust , the USPS .
Over time , though , more and more people would start using the mailroom at work and employers would offer the corporate rate for personal packages in many places , as they do with UPS / FedEx now .
There would probably be discounts for sending from the UPS / FedEx store rather than having a pickup , too .
A lot of “ scan and send ” type operations would likely spring up , so people could send paperwork over the Internet .
Cheaper Rates
Spooner 's experience already proved this conclusively .
I found it interesting that Donna Hennessy , the spokesperson interviewed for that local story said , " 41 cents is still a good bargain ” when she talked about the rate increase .
My question here is pretty simple .
How does she know ?
If no one else can deliver the mail — no competition exists — how can anyone determine if the rate is good , bad , or indifferent ?
Shorter Lines
This one seems like a no - brainer .
Can you imagine any truly well - run private enterprise that seemed to not care about long lines ?
In fairness though , just because the post office does n’t have competition does n’t mean it lacks a plan to deal with long customer lines .
Just very recently they unveiled their plan :
At the end of last year , the Post Office did some research and was surprised to find that customers at the nation ’s 37,000 post offices were not happy about wait times in line .
In response , the Post Office came up with a brilliant idea , something that could probably only come from the federal government .
They removed the clocks from all 37,000 post offices .
Stephen Seewoester , a Postal Service spokesman said , apparently with a straight face , “ We want people to focus on postal service and not the clock . ”
Now if that ’s not the standard operating procedure ( SOP ) for a bureaucracy I do n’t know what is !
It also sounds oddly familiar to what was done in communist Russia , when they centrally planned and ordered the hospitals to have fewer deaths .
So the hospitals put the people who were in danger of dying on the streets and they did n’t accept people who were in danger of dying .
Who says the U.S. ca n’t learn a thing or two from the Soviets ?
Better Handling of Mailed Items
What we 're really talking about here is a clear recourse when items are damaged during shipment .
Is there anyone who has n't received a piece of mail that looks like it was dragged behind the truck like one of those cowboys behind his runaway horse ?
When this happens , what is your recourse ?
Nothing .
This means you have to be happy you at least got it ; even if does have to be repaired with Duct Tape before you can read it .
More Convenient Placement of Mailboxes
Currently the homeowner must place his mailbox at the convenience of the mail carrier .
This is why I can walk down a residential street and see all the mailboxes on one side of the street , placed at a point where the person receiving the mail might actually have to walk across the street ( or farther ) to get his mail !
In a system with ample competition the homeowner would very likely get to place that mailbox at his convenience versus the convenience of the mailman .
Risks of Postal Competition
Fewer Services and / or Mailing Options
Basic Austrian economic theory suggests that all services that are desired will be provided .
This is simple supply and demand .
The only situation where less services would be offered in a free - market post office scenario is if the current cadre of services includes some that are not useful , which is possible .
That said , this is not a legitimate worry .
Higher Rates
Some might argue that without the " economies of scale " available to an erstwhile government agency , rates would go up .
Of course this is fallacious .
First of all , we already pay for all the services we get .
Secondly , any government agency is rife with waste , almost by definition .
The example of Spooner , who effectively forced the USPS to reduce their rates , shows that is not a legitimate worry .
Longer Lines
No currently available example supports this risk .
Can you imagine a new pizza company entering the market and using the tag line , " we take longer than anyone else ! "
Unlikely , unless they offered something in trade , and then , the market would have " spoken " anyway .
This is not a legitimate worry .
Worse Handling of Mailed Items
As with the risk above , no currently available example supports this risk .
If FedEx begins to deliver packages days late , it wo n't be long before someone takes their place and all their customers .
Similarly , if any vendor provides damaged mail as a modus operandi , he will be replaced , unless people really do n't care about the condition of their magazines .
This is also not a legitimate worry .
More Than One Daily Delivery
Imagine if your e-mail worked like the post office .
You 'd get all your messages in one big bolus , and that would occur at some approximate time each day .
Currently , only one company delivers mail , so you get one daily delivery .
If the market was open , it might mean that several companies would enter it .
Some people might use Company A for their deliveries .
Others might use Company B .
If you received mail from both people , it might very well be delivered at different times during the day .
For example , one receives FedEx deliveries separately from UPS deliveries .
As such , this is a legitimate worry .
More Junk Mail
Again we return to the Internet motif .
Each of us currently receives a veritable mountain of junk e-mail .
In fact , a term has been invented for it : spam .
If companies were competing for market share , they might also feel that they could enhance their profits by selling your name to marketers .
These people could fill your ( snail ) mailbox with even more crap than is currently flowing into it .
However , few could argue that there is strong market demand for less junk mail , not more .
For that reason alone , this is not a legitimate worry .
Conclusion
So it seems that the ways we 'd likely benefit exceed the ways we might be hurt by true postal competition .
( Again , no one really knows what will happen in a free market , particularly in an area where there is no possibility of competition currently .
I feel good about our chances though ! )
Of course , this is no surprise , but let me offer a challenge .
If you think I 've missed anything , on either side of the equation , let me know .
Let 's have some fun with this one .
The Best of Wilton Alston
A Cornell study of genome sequences in African - Americans , European - Americans and Chinese suggests that natural selection has caused as much as 10 percent of the human genome to change in some populations in the last 15,000 to 100,000 years , when people began migrating from Africa .
The study , published in the June 1 issue of PLoS ( Public Library of Science ) Genetics , looked for areas where most members of a population showed the same genetic changes .
For example , the researchers found evidence of recent selection on skin pigmentation genes , providing the genetic data to support theories proposed by anthropologists for decades that as anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa and experienced different climates and sunlight levels , their skin colors adapted to the new environments .
However , the study found no evidence of differences in genes that control brain development among the various geographical groups , as some researchers have proposed in the past .
" We undertook a very careful study of genetic differences within and among major human groups , and aimed to explain why certain parts of the genome differed , " said Scott Williamson , the study 's lead author and a Cornell assistant professor of biological statistics and computational biology .
" We aimed to eliminate as many possible confounding variables as possible , and when all is said and done , we find that as much as 10 percent of the genome may have been affected by one of these bouts of recent selection . "
Previous studies at Cornell and elsewhere have searched for signs of selection -- the divergence of genes from a common ancestor millions of years ago -- by comparing an individual human to a chimpanzee or mouse , for example , or by comparing genetic variation in protein coding genes among humans to differences between humans and a chimpanzee .
But this study scanned genome sequences that compared many humans to each other throughout the entire genome , with new strict statistical methods that correct for many potential biases that creep into this kind of analysis .
In the latest study , the researchers identified 101 regions of the human genome with strong evidence of very recent selection .
These regions include genes that control proteins that help muscle cells attach to surrounding cells ( mutations of this gene lead to muscular dystrophy ) , receptors that relate to hearing , genes involved in nervous system function and development , immune system genes and heat shock genes .
The gene scan method also detected selection in a gene involved in digestion of lactose , an enzyme found in milk .
Prior to animal domestication , humans lost the ability to digest milk after infancy .
But , as humans migrated and domesticated animals , Europeans and other populations developed a gene for tolerating lactose ( and milk ) throughout their lives .
This finding has been well established in previous research , so arriving at similar results provided an internal validation for the accuracy of the new method .
Overall , close to 10 percent of the Chinese and European - American genomes and only 1 percent of the African - American genome were linked to areas with evidence of recent selection .
Since Africans have the greatest genetic diversity and the statistical method searched for areas where the majority of members within a population group have the same genetic changes , signs of evolution were much easier to detect in the less diverse European - American and Chinese genomes .
" It is important to emphasize that the research does not state that one group is more evolved or better adapted than another , " said co-author Carlos Bustamante , a Cornell assistant professor of biological statistics and computational biology .
" Rather as humans have populated the world , there has been strong selective pressure at the genetic level for fortuitous mutations that allow digestion of a new food source or tolerate infection by a pathogen that the population may not have faced in a previous environment . "
Rasmus Nielsen , an adjunct professor of biological statistics and computational biology at Cornell and now a professor at the University of Copenhagen , Denmark , is the paper 's senior author .
IDC has some data on PC shipments for the second quarter of 2007 , even though earnings reports have yet to be released for some of the companies involved .
Nonetheless , the speculation looks good for Apple , as the company more than tripled the overall growth rate of 7.5 percent in the US .
2Q07 Shipments Market Share 2Q06 Shipments Market Share Year - to - Year Change Dell 4,854,000 28.4 % 5,437,000 34.1 % - 10.7 % HP 4,023,000 23.6 % 3,193,000 20.0 % 26.0 % Gateway 965,000 5.6 % 1,039,000 6.5 % - 7.1 % Apple 960,000 5.6 % 761,000 4.8 % 26.2 % Toshiba 901,000 5.3 % 600,000 3.8 % 50.0 % Acer 888,000 5.2 % 337,000 2.1 % 163.8 % Others 4,492,000 26.3 % 4,569,000 28.7 % - 1.7 %
It looks like the Mac is on track to become the third most popular selling computer in the US , and in fact may already have .
If Apple exceeds expectations and / or beleaguered Gateway accelerates its downward spiral , then welcome to the podium Apple , even if it is on the lowest pedestal .
Of course , even if the Mac does take third place in shipments for the quarter , both Toshiba and Acer are moving product at a much faster rate , meaning any victory will likely be ephemeral .
Still , Apple is selling more Macs than ever in the US , and not doing too bad in the rest of the world .
On a global scale , Apple 's second quarter will likely yield in excess of 1,600,000 shipments this year , compared to 1,327,000 in the same quarter of 2006 .
That reflects a 20.5 percent year - over - year growth and an overall market share of 2.8 percent ( up from 2.5 percent ) .
2Q07 Shipments Market Share 2Q06 Shipments Market Share Year - to - Year Change HP 11,335,000 19.3 % 8,303,000 15.9 % 36.5 % Dell 9,491,000 16.1 % 9,978,000 19.1 % - 4.9 % Lenovo 4,879,000 8.3 % 3,989,000 7.6 % 22.3 % Acer 4,261,000 7.2 % 2,742,000 5.2 % 55.4 % Toshiba 2,407,000 4.1 % 1,981,000 3.8 % 21.5 % Apple 1,600,000 2.8 % 1,327,000 2.5 % 20.5 % Others 24,852,000 42.2 % 23,976,000 45.9 % 4.5 %
While IDC 's highlights did not include Apple , it 's not too hard to extrapolate some numbers , if not ranking .
Whether Apple will be the sixth - ranked PC maker in the world is left to those with deep pockets for the full report from IDC to know , and the rest of us to debate .
Assuming 1.6 million
Macs sold in the quarter , Apple would be keeping pace in terms of growth with some major manufacturers , and handily exceeding the overall rate of 12.5 percent .
Unfortunately , this is not enough to move worldwide market share , which remains flat .
Reasons for this might include a lack of enterprise presence , or possibly the fact that most of the world is poor as dirt .
It 's unlikely Apple will ever compete on price , but considering how well that 's working for Dell , one could argue that when it comes to market share , not every market is worth sharing .
The US still does not know where Osama bin Laden is
The Senate vote comes amid warnings that al - Qaeda has rebuilt its capacity to mount attacks and is trying to insert agents into the US .
" It has been six years , and al - Qaeda is now rebuilding its terrorist training camps , " said Senator Byron Dorgan .
Intelligence analysts told Congress on Wednesday that al - Qaeda had created a safe haven in remote parts of Pakistan .
A leaked draft of a new US intelligence report says al - Qaeda is at its strongest since just before the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US .
Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff said earlier this week that he had a " gut feeling " that the US would be at greater risk of attack over the next few months .
President George W Bush has played down the anxiety , however :
" There is a perception in the coverage that al - Qaeda may be as strong today as they were prior to September 11th , " he said on Thursday .
" That 's simply not the case . "
Bin Laden has not been heard from in more than a year , but his deputy Ayman al - Zawahiri has released a series of messages in recent weeks that have appeared on Islamist websites .
His most recent urged Pakistanis to rise up against President Pervez Musharraf in retaliation for the bloody storming of the militant Red Mosque in Islamabad .
Degradation and manhandling : Document reveals US interrogation techniques RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday July 17 , 2007 Print This Email This After conducting a 10 - month investigation that consisted of more than 70 interviews , as well as a detailed review of public and classified documents , Vanity Fair writer Katherine Eban delivers the fullest portrait yet of James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , the C.I.A. - contracted psychologists who were put in charge of designing the aggressive interrogation methods known as ' SERE school ' techniques ( Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ) that came to be used during the Iraq war , " states a press release sent to RAW STORY .
" Eban also reveals a never - before - seen memo that details how the U.S. military sought to treat detainees at Guantanamo Bay . "
Eban writes of the memo , " In a bizarre mixture of solicitude and sadism , the memo details how to calibrate the infliction of harm .
It dictates that the ' [ insult ] slap will be initiated no more than 12  14 inches ( or one shoulder width ) from the detainee 's face to preclude any tendency to wind up or uppercut . '
And interrogators are advised that , when stripping off a prisoner 's clothes , ' tearing motions shall be downward to prevent pulling the detainee off balance . '
In short , the sere - inspired interrogations would be violent .
And therefore , psychologists were needed to help make these more dangerous interrogations safer . "
The press release continues : # According to colleagues , Mitchell and Jessen , who were placed in charge of interrogations on the C.I.A.s network of black sites ,  had no real - world experience in questioning prisoners .
Their expertise was in training U.S. soldiers to endure Communist - style torture techniques the same tactics they are accused of reverse - engineering for use on detainees .
In response to a detailed list of questions regarding their involvement with the C.I.A. and their interrogation qualifications , Mitchell and Jessen responded :  We are proud of the work we have done for our country .
The advice we have provided , and the actions we have taken have been legal and ethical .
We resolutely oppose torture .
Under no circumstances have we ever endorsed , nor would we endorse , the use of interrogation methods designed to do physical or psychological harm .
We were not in any way involved with the scandal at Abu Ghraib or with the abuses alleged at Guantanamo .
We were appalled by reports from both places .
Eban reports on the interrogation of al - Qaeda lieutenant Abu Zubaydah , and asserts that contrary to George Bushs claim that it was " tough " interrogation that forced Zubaydah to reveal Khalid Shaikh Mohammed as the mastermind behind 9/11 , it was actually humane treatment at the hands of the F.B.I. they nursed his gunshot wounds and cleaned up after him that prompted his sharing of information .
Eban reports that when Mitchell and other members of the C.I.A. team got to Zubaydah in Thailand ( at the request of then C.I.A. director George Tenet , who was furious to learn of the F.B.I.s breakthroughs ) , they put a stop to the efforts at rapport building ( which also yielded the name of José Padilla , the accused al - Qaeda operative ) , and began using SERE school tactics .
According to Eban , the team explained that they were going to become Zubaydahs  God and that if he refused to cooperate he would lose his clothes and comforts one by one .
He was isolated and the interrogators would enter his room just once a day to say ,  You know what I want ,  then leave again .
Eban reports that as Zubaydah clammed up , Mitchell seemed to conclude that he would talk only when he had been reduced to complete helplessness and dependence , so the C.I.A. team began building a coffin in which they planned to bury the detainee alive .
Eban concludes that they probably did not put Zubaydah in the coffin , but soon after ( as was reported last year ) they employed more SERE school techniques , which included stripping Zubaydah naked and making his room so cold that his body turned blue .
Eban reveals a five - page , typo- ridden document , titled JTF GTMO SERE  Interrogation Standard Operating Procedure ,  that outlines how detainees should be treated .
 The premise behind this is that the interrogation tactics used at military SERE schools are appropriate for use in real - world interrogations ,  it states , and can be used to break real detainees . 
Eban reports that the document is divided into four categories :  Degradation ,   Physical Debilitation ,  Isolation and Monopoliztion [ sic ] of Perception ,  and  Demonstrated Omnipotence . 
The tactics include  slaps ,   forceful removal of detainees  clothing ,  stress positions ,  hooding ,  manhandling ,  and walling ,  which entails grabbing the detainee by his shirt and hoisting him against a specially constructed wall .
It is not clear whether the guidelines were ever formally adopted , Eban reports , but the instructions suggest that the military command wanted psychologists involved so they could lead interrogators up to the line , then stop them from crossing it .
Michael Rolince , section chief of the F.B.I.s International Terrorism Operations , tells Eban that what Mitchell and Jessen practice is voodoo science ,  and Steve Kleinman , an Air Force Reserve colonel and expert in human - intelligence operations , says he finds it astonishing that the C.I.A. chose two clinical psychologists who had no intelligence background whatsoever , who had never conducted an interrogation ... to do something that had never been proven in the real world .
Despite their questionable credentials , Eban reports that the principals at Mitchell , Jessen & Associates are raking in money .
According to people familiar with their compensation , they get paid more than $ 1,000 per day plus expenses , tax - free , for their overseas work .
 Taxpayers are paying at least half a million dollars a year for these two knuckleheads to do voodoo ,  says one of the people familiar with their pay arrangements .

Local media said the application stemmed from a personal dispute
The company applied last month to call its range of pesticides and poisons after Zheng Xiaoyu , the sacked head of the State Food and Drug Administration .
But the authorities ruled that Mr Zheng , although under investigation , had a right to protect his name .
The former top official is currently facing allegations of corruption .
China 's Xinhua news agency said that the national trademark administrator had rejected the application .
" It is against China 's trademark laws to use a name that has adverse effects on society as a trademark , " the agency quoted official sources as saying .
Xinhua suggested the application could have been caused by a personal dispute between the company - Shenyang Feilong Pharmaceutical Company - and Mr Zheng , who had reportedly ruled against one of its drugs in 1999 .
Mr Zheng is facing allegations he used his administration 's drug approval powers to obtain bribes .
Last week he was expelled from the Communist Party after a disciplinary committee ruled he should be " severely punished " .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York ’s famed Saks Fifth Avenue department store plans to open a shoe department so big it has been granted its own ZIP code , 10022 - SHOE , the company said on Thursday .
Saks said it plans to nearly double the number of shoes for sale and take over the entire eighth floor of its flagship store in Manhattan .
The expanded department will open in September under the name 10022 - SHOE .
“ 10022 - SHOE will also hold a place in U.S. history as the first floor to be granted its own designated ZIP code by the United States Post Office , ” Saks said in a statement .
The news may delight women with shoe obsessions to rival that of former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos .
“ Visitors to the new eighth floor will be greeted by a seemingly endless array of shoes , ” the statement said .
The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , to which Britain contributes 5,000 troops in southern Afghanistan , revealed that soldiers defused an explosive vest which had been placed on a six - year - old who had been told to attack Afghan army forces in the east of the country .
The boy was spotted after appearing confused at a checkpoint .
The vest was defused and no one was hurt .
The claim came only hours after the second report this week that civilians had been killed in Nato military operations .
Nine women , three babies and the mullah of a local mosque died alongside 20 suspected Taliban militants after an air strike , Helmand 's police chief , Mohammad Hussein Andiwal , said .
The air strike had been launched in response to an attack on Nato troops by militants near the town of Gereshk .
An estimated 120 people have been killed in recent weeks , including seven schoolboys who died in a US air strike on Sunday .
Yesterday ISAF said it was investigating reports from the Afghan authorities that civilians had been killed .
But it also accused the Taliban of using civilians as battleground cover , and said the incident with the boy signalled a new type of tactic .
The boy had been ordered to target a check point in Miri , in the Andar district of Ghazni province .
" They placed explosives on a six - year - old boy and told him to walk up to the Afghan police or army and push the button , " said Captain Michael Cormier , the company commander who intercepted the child , in a statement .
" Fortunately , the boy did not understand and asked patrolling officers why he had this vest on . "
Lieutenant Colonel David Accetta , ISAF eastern regional command spokesman , told the Guardian : " In the past we have not seen the Taliban sink that low , to use children as suicide bombers .
The personnel secured the vest to make sure the child was safe . "
Lt Col Accetta said the procedure for dealing with an armed minor had so far been untested in Afghanistan .
" It would have been difficult to know what to do considering it was a six - year - old boy and he was presumably going to push the button himself or someone was going to detonate it for him remotely , " Lt Col Accetta said .
The rules of military engagement are easily muddied when a child poses a direct threat , he explained .
" What we do if we identify the fact that an adult is wearing a suicide vest is we use whatever force we deem necessary to protect the lives of our soldiers and any civilians .
Of course it makes it more difficult - it's a six year - old child . "
The date of the incident , the boy 's name and information on what happened to him afterwards were not immediately available , Lt Col Accetta said .
The Guardian has been unable to independently corroborate the claim .
ISAF has accused the Taliban of intentionally living and fighting in residential areas , capitalising on the international forces ' reticence to put ordinary Afghans at risk .
" They will normally intermix with the civilian population with the thought that we wo n't engage them there , and it 's true , we wo n't do that , " Lt Col Accetta maintained .
" They are deliberately putting civilians - women and children - at risk by bringing the combat into close proximity with them . "
Coalition forces have struggled in recent days to pacify a swell of anger following repeated incidents where innocent civilians have apparently been killed in military operations .
Responding to reports that women and children had been killed in the latest airstrike , a spokesman , Lt Col Charlie Mayo , said : " If civilians had been identified in the area the air strike would not have gone ahead . "
He added : " ISAF has demonstrated this restraint on a number of occasions and goes to great lengths to minimise civilian casualties . "
Backstory
That the civilian toll in Afghanistan is on the rise is not in dispute .
At least 230 people have been killed already this year , including the 25 who died yesterday and seven children killed in an airstrike on Sunday .
What is more contentious is who is to blame .
Nato accused the Taliban of hiding behind civilians during attacks .
But protests against civilian deaths are growing and unsettling the government .
President Hamid Karzai has insisted that Afghan authorities be consulted on any airstrikes .
He said yesterday 's deaths were " difficult for us to accept " .

I drive into my local Shell station to fill up , and stick my card in the pump , but the pump refuses to dispense .
I walk into the office and ask the store manager why I can't get gasoline .
She checks my account , and says " Mr. Meyer , your Volvo fuel prescription has expired . "
I say , " Oh , well its OK , I am sure I am using the right gas . "
She replies , " I 'm sorry , but the law requires that you have to have a valid prescription from your dealership to refill your gas .
You can't make that determination yourself , and most car dealerships have their prescriptions expire each year to make sure you bring the car in for a checkup .
Regular checkups are important to the health of your car .
You will need to pay for a service visit to your dealership before we can sell you gas . "
I reply , " RRRRRRR . "
OK , so if this really happened we would all scream SCAM !
While we all recognize that it may be important to get our car checked out every once in a while , most of us would see this for what it was :
A government regulation intended mainly to increase the business of my Volvo dealership 's service department by forcing me to pay for regular visits .
So why do n't we cry foul when the exact same situation occurs every day with glasses and contact lenses ?
The parable above is nearly exactly the conversation I had the other day with the operator at 1 - 800 - CONTACTS , except with " gas " substituted for " contacts " .
I know that my contact lens prescription is a bit out of date , but I really needed them for a trip , and in terms of safety , a slightly out - of - date contact lens in my eye is much better than none ( My contacts are about - 6.5 , which means I am pretty blind without them ) .
No joy , though .
I did not have time to get to the doctor , so I wore - 5.0 contacts I found in a drawer just to have something .
The operator told me that doctors have the prescriptions expire each year so that I am forced to come see them .
Why with eye doctors do we consider this " for my own good " when in any other profession it would be called a scam ?
In fact , each year I know my eyes get about 0.25 worse on each lens .
I would really like to just self - medicate and order myself the next level up , but of course that is way out of bounds .
Ca n't trust people to figure out their own lens correction ( though we do allow this for reading glasses , go figure ) .

Goce 's gravity maps should achieve new levels of precision
Enlarge Image
A satellite that can measure tiny variations in the Earth 's gravity field will be one of Europe 's most challenging space missions to date .
Goce , due for launch next year , looks like a spyplane from a movie .
Its arrow shape , fins , and electric engine help keep the satellite stable as it flies through the wisps of air still present at an altitude of 260 km .
Goce data will have many uses , probing hazardous volcanic regions and bringing new insight into ocean behaviour .
The latter , in particular , is a major driver for the mission .
By combining the gravity data with information about sea-surface height gathered by other spacecraft , scientists will be able to track the direction and speed of ocean currents .
" If we want to improve our climate models then we need to improve our knowledge of how the oceans move , and Goce will help us do that , " mission scientist Dr Mark Drinkwater , from the European Space Agency ( Esa ) , told BBC News .
Rock and no roll
Most people are taught at school that the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth 's surface is 9.8 m per second squared - but , in truth , this figure varies around the planet depending on the nature of the material underfoot .
We 're smearing out the interpretation of the currents
Dr Mark Drinkwater , Esa
Goce 's unique data
The planet is far from a smooth sphere ; the radius of the globe at the equator is about 20 km longer than at the poles .
This ellipsoid is then marked by tall mountain ranges and cut by deep ocean trenches .
The Earth 's interior layers are also not composed of perfect shells of homogenous rock - some regions are thicker or denser .
Such factors will cause the gravitational force at the surface to deviate from place to place by very small but significant amounts .
The Gravity Field and Steady - State Ocean Circulation Explorer ( Goce ) will map these differences .
This information will then be used to fashion what is , in essence , an idealised globe .
Scientists call it the geoid .
GRAVITY - A MOVING TARGET
The ' standard ' acceleration due to gravity at the Earth 's surface is 9.8 m per second squared
In reality the figure varies from 9.78 ( minimum ) at the equator to 9.83 ( maximum ) at the poles
It is a critical reference .
The geoid defines the horizontal , tracing a surface on which , at any point , the pull of gravity would be perpendicular to it .
Put a ball on this hypothetical surface and it will not roll - even though it appears to have slopes .
The geoid is of paramount interest to oceanographers who study the causes of the " hills " and " valleys " on the sea surface .
If local gravity differences are not creating these features , then other factors such as currents , winds and tides must be responsible .
With the help of the Goce geoid , scientists will be able to tease out these details with a precision and at a resolution not obtainable with current satellite technology .
1 . Goce senses tiny variations in the pull of gravity over Earth 2 .
The data is used to construct an idealised surface , or geoid 3 .
It traces gravity of equal ' potential ' ; balls wo n't roll on its ' slopes ' 4 .
It is the shape the oceans would take without winds and currents 5 .
So , comparing sea level and geoid data reveals ocean behaviour 6 .
Gravity changes can betray magma movements under volcanoes 7 .
A precise geoid underpins a universal height system for the world 8 .
Gravity data can also reveal how much mass is lost by ice sheets
" At the moment we can see structures down to the size of 150 - 200 km , " explained Dr Jakob Flury , formerly of the Technical University Munich , Germany , and now with the University of Texas at Austin , US .
" That 's nice but the oceanographers want more detail .
Goce will have spatial resolution which is finer , down to 80 - 100 km .
There are ' fronts ' and currents in the oceans that are at width scales of 100 km . "
This will help scientists to characterise boundary currents , such as the Gulf Stream , which flow along the edges of deeply sloping continental shelves .
This is cruise control for a spacecraft , but at an unbelievable level of precision
Neil Wallace , QinetiQ
" The problem today is that we 're losing detail as a consequence of the fact that our geoids have a very poor resolution , " said Dr Drinkwater .
" We 're smearing out the interpretation of the currents , and , as a result , we vastly underestimate the amount of water , heat and salt that 's being transported around the ocean . "
To make its gravity map , Goce will use a gradiometer .
This unique instrument consists of three pairs of accelerometers that will sense the tiny variations in the tug of gravity over different parts of the Earth .
The instrument 's performance is phenomenal : it will register accelerations that are less than one millionth of a millionth of the g - force we experience when standing on the Earth .
But to make the most of this sensitivity , Goce has to fly so low it will flirt with the top of the atmosphere ; and that has proved to be a headache for the engineers because any buffeting on the spacecraft from air molecules will introduce noise into the data .
Qinetiq 's engine assembly about to go into a vacuum test chamber
The " test masses " that make up the accelerometers must be kept in perfect free fall all the time to produce reliable readings .
So , Goce uses an innovative drag - free propulsion system that throttles a special engine up and down to make compensations - to , in effect , fly the spacecraft around the test masses .
But again , the thrust levels required are tiny - a continuously variable force of anywhere between one and 20 milliNewtons during the science phase of the mission .
" This is cruise control for a spacecraft , but at an unbelievable level of precision , " explained Neil Wallace from the UK technology company QinetiQ , which has built the engine .
" If you imagine you are driving your car down the motorway at 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and a mosquito hits the windscreen - the amount of deceleration your car experiences , that 's what our engine has to compensate for . "
The long and short Goce is one of a growing number of spacecraft to employ an electric engine .
It draws power from solar panels stuck on one side of the satellite and uses this to charge xenon atoms which are then hurled out of nozzles on the rear of the tube - like body .
Goce will carry 40kg of xenon and this is the life - limiting factor on the mission .
Once all the xenon has been used up , the spacecraft will no longer be able to maintain fine control , and it will be allowed to fall back to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere .
Esa expects the mission to last 20 months - perhaps longer .
Even this short period , though , should be sufficient to gain the high - quality data needed to produce the most detailed Earth geoid ever constructed .
The existing Grace mission uses a pair of satellites
Mission weighs Africa 's water ' Potato ' Earth 's deep secrets
And it will be a powerful complement to the work already being undertaken by the US - German Grace mission .
Grace ( Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ) uses a pair of satellites to monitor how the gravity field changes over time - the evolving geoid .
It flies much higher - at about 500 km - and as a consequence cannot match the resolution promised by Goce ; but then the Grace twins are doing a different job .
" Grace is taking a movie and Goce is taking a high - resolution still " , is the analogy used by Dr Michael Watkins , the Grace project scientist at the US space agency 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" The two missions use different ways to measure the gravity field , so they have different errors that are great to cross-calibrate , " he told BBC News .
And increasingly science is about pulling together a broad range of datasets ; the full picture only emerges when different perspectives and disciplines interweave .
To get a proper handle on sea level rise , for example , demands that ocean height measurements from satellites be combined with gravity and tide gauge readings and even GPS .
" It is the combinations of data which are the future , " said Dr Drinkwater .
GRAVITY FIELD AND STEADY - STATE OCEAN CIRCULATION EXPLORER
1 . The 1,100kg Goce is built from rigid materials and carries fixed solar wings .
The gravity data must be clear of spacecraft ' noise '
2 . Solar cells produce 1,300W and cover the Sun- facing side of Goce ; the near side ( as shown ) radiates heat to keep it cool 3 .
The 5 m - by - 1 m frame incorporates fins to stabilise the spacecraft as it flies through the residual air in the thermosphere 4 .
Goce 's accelerometers measure accelerations that are as small as 1 part in 10,000,000,000,000 of the gravity experienced on Earth 5 .
The UK - built engine ejects xenon ions at velocities exceeding 40,000m /s ; Goce 's mission will end when the 40kg fuel tank empties 6 . S Band antenna : Data downloads to the Kiruna ( Sweden ) ground station .
Processing , archiving is done at Esa 's centre in Frascati , Italy 7 .
GPS antennas : Precise postioning of Goce is required , but GPS data in itself can also provide some gravity field information

OSCON
We went to OSCON , hoping to uncover some fresh details on Sun Microsystems ' " Project Indiana . "
We mostly failed in this endeavor .
Sun 's operating system chief and Debian author Ian Murdock was at the event , elaborating on Project Indiana .
He covered , for the most part , ground we 've already been over , which places Indiana as Sun 's quasi copy of Red Hat 's Fedora project .
The core of the new project revolves around Sun 's mission to release a fresh , supported version of OpenSolaris every six months .
Traditionally , Sun has pumped out a full - fledged version of its Solaris OS every three or so years .
Customers , however , have received early access to new features via a support service and can use those tools at their own risk .
Sun also dishes out periodic updates with bundles of new tools , as you 'd expect .
Now , Sun wants to give hardcore Solaris fans and developers quicker access to those tools via something resembling more of a proper , complete OS .
Sun is still working out the exact nature of its support ambitions , although it 's likely to provide support for each version of OpenSolaris for 18 months after its release , according to Murdock .
Sun hopes to dish out the first OpenSolaris release under the Project Indiana plan in the Spring of 2008 .
Many pundits have said that Sun hopes to make Solaris more " Linux - like " with Project Indiana , although we struggle to see how that 's accurate .
Sun is really just tweaking the Solaris release cycle in a way it should have done once the company committed to revitalizing Solaris x86 and to upping developer interest in the OS .
" It is not a Linux copy thing , " Murdock said .
" It 's a best of both worlds thing .
" We 're adopting a model that moves into a two - tier release cycle where one option will be a fast moving , community version of Solaris for the early adopters .
It 's meant to make Solaris appeal to a broader audience . "
Project Indiana will include a revamped package management system , which should prove popular with developers unaccustomed to Solaris .
The OS has some clunky , archaic aspects , and Murdock thinks the new package system will modernize Solaris .
Sun 's bold decision to open source Solaris and to pursue Solaris x86 with vigor has resulted in a cadre of Solaris bigots outside of Sun corporate .
Beyond the developer , you find added corporate support for the OS with HP , for example , bragging that it sells more servers running Solaris x86 than Sun.
HP also offers full support for the OS on its systems .
Few people would claim that Solaris enjoys the same , broad enthusiasm as Linux .
Sun , however , seems to be trying its best to improve on the situation .
Project Indiana will likely help in these efforts by providing more instant gratification to developers .
In addition , it could well give Sun an edge over IBM and HP , who have excluded the broader developer community from being able to help with their versions of Unix .
Murdock refused to say when Solaris 11 – code - named Nevada – will ship .
Given past trends , the OS should arrive sometime during 2008 , and we 're guessing that it will accompany Sun 's release of Rock - based servers near the end of the year .
Sun recently added support for 2048 - thread boxes to the Nevada source code , providing obvious links to the Rock - based systems .
Sun spent months and months hyping Solaris 10 ahead of its release in 2005 .
The OS included some ground - breaking features such as DTrace and ZFS that Sun continues to flaunt today .
The company has been unusually silent about the tools Solaris 11 will bring , making us wonder if OpenSolaris has n't been a distraction from the core OS .
You can see some of the discussed Nevada features here .
What 's that smell ?
Murdock also refused to talk about Sun's FISHworks project – billed as a NetApp killer .
Sun has put some of its top Solaris engineers in charge of a software / hardware effort meant to create a solid network attached storage ( NAS ) appliance .
The company demoed this project to analysts early this year , although it refuses to give reporters the same honor .
We did track down Adam Leventhal , one of the FISHworks leads and co-authors of DTrace , at OSCON .
He revealed that the product should ship early next year and that it includes some special sauce above Solaris for handling storage .
When pushed more , he went with -
" Ashlee , I 'm not going to talk to you . "
Why not just slap us in the face ? ®
Popularity contests increasingly decide what people see on the Web .
Features like most - viewed , most - popular and most - emailed lists democratize news and information , advocates say , letting consumers play a role in what 's deemed worthy of others ' attention , taking it out of the hands of an unseen editorial elite .
Now , though , a diverse group of actors -- ranging from spyware makers to a venture - backed start - up -- is helping push specific videos , articles and photos to the top of those lists .
Some of the Web sites targeted now are having to grapple with how to draw the line between user input and unacceptable manipulation .
News media and other Web sites traditionally have relied on editors to select which content to display on their home pages and feature prominently to users .
But lately , many sites are basing such selections at least partly on how popular a given piece of content is with users .
Google Inc.'s
YouTube video - sharing site lists the video clips that have been viewed the most times , or are the highest - rated by users .
Digg Inc. , a community
Web site that is the archetype for the popularity - contest model , relies on voting by users to help select which Web page links to feature in the lists for various media and subject areas that make up its site .
Spyware makers and others have taken notice , building software that tries to boost the prominence of specific items on some sites , by automatically clicking on them repeatedly or tricking unsuspecting users into doing so .
The rewards for such tactics : the items are prominently featured on the " most viewed " and " highest rated " pages of sites , generating more exposure .
" It 's paramount for sites that are publicly driven to think about this every day , this arms race against the manipulators , " says Jay Adelson , chief executive of Digg , which is based in San Francisco .
The latest to try to capitalize on the popularity - contest trend is start - up Collactive Inc. , which lets individuals create bulletins about specific online content that they can then blast out to other people .
Users can identify items such as articles or video clips from a number of different sites , and specify what actions -- such as emailing articles and giving videos a specific rating on YouTube 's five - star scale -- that they want Collactive to direct other people to take .
The users can then email a link to the Collactive bulletin to friends or post it on their Web sites .
Collactive , a Delaware - registered company that operates mainly out of Israel , then automatically walks the recipients through the process of viewing and emailing or rating the content .
While the service is free for individuals , the company plans to charge businesses , politicians and some nonprofits for usage .
E. Howard Hunt , the country 's most notorious spook who later served time for his role as one of the plumbers in the bungled burglary that later toppled Richard Nixon , gave a near - deathbed confession to his long - estranged son , naming then - Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and a handful of CIA spooks as the cabal behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy , according to a story in Rolling Stone .
That time in Miami , with Saint [ his son ] by his bed and disease eating away at him and him thinking he 's six months away from death , E . Howard finally put pen to paper and started writing .
Saint had been working toward this moment for a long while , and now it was going to happen .
He got his father an A &W diet root beer , then sat down in the old man 's wheelchair and waited .
E. Howard scribbled the initials " LBJ , " standing for Kennedy 's ambitious vice president , Lyndon Johnson .
Under " LBJ , " connected by a line , he wrote the name Cord Meyer .
Meyer was a CIA agent whose wife had an affair with JFK ; later she was murdered , a case that 's never been solved .
Next his father connected to Meyer 's name the name Bill Harvey , another CIA agent ; also connected to Meyer 's name was the name David Morales , yet another CIA man and a well - known , particularly vicious black - op specialist .
And then his father connected to Morales ' name , with a line , the framed words " French Gunman Grassy Knoll . "
So there it was , according to E. Howard Hunt .
LBJ had Kennedy killed .
It had long been speculated upon .
But now E. Howard was saying that 's the way it was .
And that Lee Harvey Oswald was n't the only shooter in Dallas .
There was also , on the grassy knoll , a French gunman , presumably the Corsican Mafia assassin Lucien Sarti , who has figured prominently in other assassination theories .
The full story , which includes the lines : " They sure do n't make White House bad guys the way they used to .
Today you 've got flabby - faced half - men like Karl Rove , with weakling names like " Scooter " Libby , blandly hacking their way through the constraints of the U.S. Constitution , while back then , in addition to Hunt , you had out - and - out thugs like G. Gordon Liddy , his Watergate co-conspirator and Nixon 's dirty - tricks chief , who would hold his own hand over an open flame to prove what a real tough guy he was , " is more than worth your time .
For the record , 27B clings to the single shooter , magical bullet , officially - approved story line .
To believe otherwise is to tumble into ontological uncertainty , so deep and dark , as to make us never believe another government press release again .
And we can't have that now , can we ?

Dear Mitch ,
I am so sorry about the loss of Jordan .
I did not know he was ill .
I wish I could attend the memorial service but please pass my condolences to Anne Riak , Jordan 's wife and also his family members .
He left such a legacy and has touched so many lives .
I do n't know where to start . . .
So sad , but will be ever so grateful that I met Jordan , first online , then in person .
I am grateful for his tireless work and his words of advice and his eloquent way with words .
I hope everyone that he touched can find a way to continue the message . . . from the prisoners who were about to be released to the school boards and legislators as well as the many parents and teachers who were real friends and supporters .
Thanks for all your help .
In sympathy ,
Isabelle Allgood - Neal

Dear American friends ,
With Alice Miller , Jordan Riak has been for me a model .
I have often been on his website Nospank and when he published the translation of my book Spanking , I felt very happy and proud .
He remains for me a beautiful person , always alive by his influence , and thanks to him the world will be less violent .

Dear Mitch
Sad , sad day , for many of us , around the world .
Jordan ’s tenacity and fire were unforgettable , he was destined to leave a big legacy .
I cherish my memories of discovering his tremendous nospank project , the comfort and courage it gave me in my work and hope for the future , and the powerful ways this hive of information wisdom and activism fed the work that I do .
I am not sure what my book would have been without Jordan ’s work .
It is sobering to reflect on this , as frankly I do n’t know if my book would have touched so many or resonated so solidly were it not for the service that Jordan ’s project provided .
It was a special moment , to meet and dine with Jordan at your apartment in SF .
All the more precious now that I see it will not be repeated .
Not every day do we encounter someone like Jordan .
I know you and he are good friends and comrades , and I am sorry for your loss , Mitch .
I think Jordan changed the rotation of the earth in his small and big way , he changed it enough that it will not go back to how it was prior .
I sure intend to keep walking and to remember him as I do ; to feel him walking alongside us in our revolutionary and child advocating work .
Adios , Jordan , I hope you are enjoying your freedom from a troubled and troubling body , in the knowledge that you used it so very very well .
Robin

Jordan was a legend when I began my work on physical punishment of children .
We eventually met , by phone .
During that warm and collegial conversation , I felt what so many others already knew about Jordan — his personable , principled and passionate commitment to the protection and well - being of children
I want to offer my condolences on Jordan ’s loss to his family and to all who depended on his clear , considered and constant voice that has made a difference in the lives of so many children .
Sincerely ,
Ron Ensom

Jordan was a pioneer in ending school corporal punishment , one of the first in our country to tackle the issue head - on , just as he had done in Australia before moving to California .
He was a passionate advocate who called me at all times of day or evening , sometimes forgetting that I was in the eastern time zone .
Well , on second thought , maybe he had n’t forgotten !
But what was on his mind was just very important and he wanted to reach me when he had a question or another brilliant thought in mind !
Jordan inspired , he led , he confronted – a real hero to children !
I will miss our brainstorming phone calls .

I am so sorry to hear about Jordan Riak .
He is a hero who may never get all the credit he deserves for his courageous accomplishments as he has battled and gained some hard earned ground for children 's rights , not always a popular subject .
Someone should write a book about him .
In my mind he is a legend .
I wish you the best ,
David

Jordan Riak ( 1935 - 2016 ) : In Memoriam
The Arctic 's untapped resources include huge reserves of fuel and minerals .
Now Moscow has raised tensions by dispatching an expedition to annex a vast expanse of the ocean .
In the darkest depths of the Arctic Ocean a new Cold War is brewing .
American and British nuclear submarines lurk in the shadows , preparing for company .
' Why has Britain been sending submarines into Arctic waters ? ' asked Rob Huebert , associate director of the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies in Calgary .
' Because it wants to retain its capability to deal with the Russian threat . '
Such talk is redolent of a Le Carré novel .
But the battle between the West and Russia over who owns the Arctic has been building for years .
Last week it entered a new phase when Russia announced it was sending a miniature submarine , equipped with a team of explorers , to claim a chunk of the Arctic Ocean the size of Western Europe .
The stakes are high .
The ocean is home to vast oil and mineral reserves as well as massive shoals of fish and strategically important shipping lanes .
' It could get very ugly , ' Huebert said .
' Nobody knows how much oil and gas is down there .
Shell , for example , is quite pessimistic , but the likes of Exxon are quite gung - ho .
I 've seen some people make the case that up to 18 per cent of the world 's oil reserves are there - that 's getting into Saudi Arabia 's league . '
To symbolise its claim , Russia will plant its flag on the sea bed before taking samples it believes will prove the Lomonosov Ridge , which runs underneath the Arctic Ocean , is an extension of the Siberian continental shelf and therefore Russian territory .
The expedition is led by Artur Chilingarov , Russia 's most famous explorer .
A sturdy 68 - year - old with a sweeping salt - and - pepper beard , last week he could be seen pacing the decks of his ship , the Akademik Fyodorov , followed by a posse of state television journalists who filed breathless accounts of the groundbreaking voyage .
' The Arctic is Russian , ' Chilingarov told the media scrum .
' We must prove the North Pole is an extension of the Russian coastal shelf .
Of course , [ the expedition ] is important in terms of science , but also in terms of geopolitics as well . '
There has never been a manned journey to the sea bed of the North Pole .
' Who knows , we may even discover some as yet unknown organism , ' said Valery Kuznetsov , head of the expedition 's oceanography team .
In 2001 , Russia made a similar claim to the Arctic Ocean but its evidence was disputed .
An official panel of experts backed by the UN has been established to consider claims and Russia is determined to prove its case .
A UN convention dictates that countries bordering the Arctic Ocean can exploit resources within a 200 - nautical - mile economic zone of their territory .
But this can be extended if a country can , as the Russians are attempting , prove the continental shelf beneath the ocean is connected to their land .
So far the US has refused to engage in the debate over extending exploitation rights , a policy throwback to the Eighties when the Reagan administration feared such an action would see large parts of the Arctic handed over to the Soviets .
Meanwhile , Canada and Denmark , through its sovereignty over Greenland , claim that the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to their territories and therefore the ocean is effectively their property .
In a sign of how tense the situation is becoming , the Canadian government recently placed a C$ 7bn ( £ 3.25 bn ) order for new naval patrol vessels , a move that Prime Minister Stephen Harper said was designed to ' defend its sovereignty over the Arctic ' .
But the battle for the Arctic is fast becoming a global issue .
Melting ice has meant the opening up of the North West Passage to commercial shipping is now possible in the summer months and , given rising temperatures , a possibility all year round in the future .
The opening up of the passage can shorten the distance ships have to travel between Europe and Asia by up to 2,000 nautical miles over the established trade route through the Panama Canal .
Given the area 's geopolitical importance , it is no surprise Britain is closely monitoring the situation as part of its commitment to Nato .
' Britain has been sending Trafalgar SSN - class submarines to the Arctic since 1986 because it wants to retain its under-ice capability , ' said Huebert , who predicted it would not be long before their sonar registers the presence of an old foe .
' The Russians are rebuilding their navy , ' Huebert said .
' They 've just launched a submarine for the first time since 1987 and they 've placed orders for three more . '
Soaring oil prices have created a new urgency among the countries competing to make their claim .
When oil prices were low it was considered uneconomic to tap into the Arctic Ocean 's reserves .
But with China and India now desperate for energy , oil prices are spiralling .
Experts say oil prices of around $ 70 a barrel makes drilling in the Arctic a viable proposition .
In 2004 , a joint Swedish and Russian venture proved it was possible to drill into the ocean 's floor from a rig secured by three ships .
Nor is oil the only resource that is ripe for exploitation in the thawing north .
There are also large mineral deposits and coal beds in the Arctic , for example .
In addition , there is the prospect of opening up vast new fish reserves as ice cover disappears over the Arctic Ocean .
For several years , British research vessels from Dunstaffnage Marine Research Station , near Oban , have been studying these stocks .
' There is strong evidence that there are still good reserves of fish such as cod and capelin in some regions of the Arctic , ' said Prof Graham Shimmield , Dunstaffnage 's director .
' However , these are probably the world 's last refuges .
We should restrain ourselves from catching them on an industrial scale until we learn more about how strong they are .
It remains to be seen whether that will happen , however . '
The rush to exploit the Arctic worries other scientists .
They point out that the region is important because the effects of climate change are more pronounced here , and arrive earlier , than in any other part of the world .
When things go wrong , they are first noticed in the Arctic .
But if oil companies and mining firms start pumping out carbon dioxide and other waste as they open up the region , the pristine conditions that have helped scientists make past observations will be destroyed , obscuring our view of our dangerously warming world .
This problem is already an issue in the archipelago of Svalbard where European scientists are studying glacier retreat , carbon emissions and other effects of pollution , but are having their work hampered by the emissions from coal mines dug by the Russians .
Tensions are already running high in the Arctic , it would seem .
Nevertheless , hopes remain that a diplomatic conclusion can be achieved to resolve what has been dubbed the ' battle for the North Pole ' .
' We must wake up to the fact that the Arctic is going to become a much busier area , ' Huebert said .
' And try to produce a solution that will provide an equitable , fair and safe division of resources .
We cannot just proceed with the old unilateral approach . '
Observers point to the Antarctic Treaty , which severely limits the exploitation of the land mass around the South Pole .
No waste disposal , no mining , no introduction of animal species and no commercial work have been allowed on the continent for more than 40 years .
Some diplomats have suggested that a similar set of rules could be agreed for the Arctic .
Such a plan is unlikely to succeed , however .
' Countries agreed to the Antarctic Treaty as a way to save money , ' said a senior UK official .
' The South Pole is an expensive place to exploit and it was realised that if everyone agreed not to touch it , they could all rest easy about pouring millions into the area .
This is not the issue with the Arctic .
It is becoming easier and easier to exploit .
Nations are n't going to give up on these rich pickings .
Hence the Russian expedition - although this has not gone totally smoothly so far .
Last week the Akademik Fyodorov was forced to send out a distress signal and then drifted for several hours because of an engine failure .
It has since made good progress towards the pole and the first research dives from the ship are expected to take place tomorrow .
During its journey last week a mysterious aircraft appeared above the Akademik Fyodorov , causing a ripple of excitement among the journalists on board .
Russian media widely reported the aircraft to be a Nato spy plane .
It may have been paranoia but in the frozen waters around the North Pole one thing is certain : the days of the Cold War are back .
Online - Untersuchungen von PCs sind illegal , berichtet die tageszeitung ( taz ) unter Berufung auf den Bundesgerichtshof .
Dies ergebe sich aus einem entsprechenden Beschluss , den Ulrich Hebenstreit , Ermittlungsrichter am Bundesgerichtshof ( BGH ) am 25 .
11 . gefällt hat .
Die Begründung zu dem noch nicht veröffentlichten Beschluss liegt der taz vor .
Danach seien Anträge der Bundesanwaltschaft auf Online - Durchsuchungen mit Hilfe von Trojanern nicht genehmigungsfähig , weil dem schweren Eingriff in das Recht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung " die notwendige gesetzliche Gestattung " fehle .
Die Argumentation der Anwaltschaft mit den Vorschriften zur Überwachung der E - Mail - Kommunikation genügten nach Auffassung des BGH nicht , weil " der Kommunikationsvorgang abgeschlossen ist " , sobald die E - Mail auf dem Rechner gespeichert sei .
Hinzu käme , dass bei einer Online - Durchsuchung nicht nur die E - Mail , sondern auch alle anderen Daten ausgespäht würden .
Das wiederum passe nicht zu den Vorschriften über Hausdurchsuchungen , die eine auf Offenheit angelegte Maßnahme seien , bei der der Wohnungsbesitzer und Zeugen anwesend sein müssten .
Das Bundesinnenministerium erklärte zum Urteil , dass bis auf weiteres Online - Durchsuchungen des Bundeskriminalamtes ( BKA ) gestoppt worden seien .
Ohnehin habe das BKA eine solche Maßnahme nur in einigen wenigen Fällen angewandt .
Da Online - Durchsuchungen mit dem von Innenminister Schäuble angetriebenen " Programm zur Stärkung der Inneren Sicherheit " einen erheblichen Stellenwert bekommen sollen , hat Generalbundesanwältin Monika Harms bereits eine Beschwerde gegen das Urteil von Richter Hebenstreit eingelegt .
Sollte dieser
Weg nicht greifen , will das Innenministerium auf eine Koalitionsentscheidung zur Änderung des BKA - Gesetzes hinarbeiten .
Als Vorbild gilt dabei Nordrhein - Westfalen , wo gerade die Genehmigung der Online - Durchsuchung durch den Verfassungsschutz in die dritte Lesung geht .
In einem taz - Kommentar zum Urteil des BGH hat der Verfasser keinen Zweifel daran , dass Schäuble die große Koalition von seinen Plänen überzeugen wird und eine " Chaos Computer Polizei " kommt , die Rechner knackt .
Die Hoffnung sei jedoch , dass diese Maßnahme nur bei schwerster Kriminalität und dringendem Tatverdacht zugelassen werde .
In allen anderen Fällen müssten die Polizeibehörden auf eine solche Maßnahme verzichten und wie bisher offen die Wohnung durchsuchen .
Dann könnten Betroffene mit der Polizei verhandeln , welche Teile der Festplatte für die Polizei tabu bleiben sollten .

Are American consumers willing to pay more in order to protect their privacy , or is online commerce all about the lowest possible price ?
That 's what researchers from Carnegie Mellon University set out to learn in a new study on privacy and commerce ( PDF ) that will be presented at a conference tomorrow .
They found that people will , in fact , pay more to purchase from sites with a solid privacy policy , but only if that policy is easy to see and understand .
To start the survey , researchers asked the participants if they would be comfortable buying certain items online with a personal credit card .
As you can see from the image below , people were less willing to purchase material that could be used for violence , while sexual objects were a bit less worrisome .
And some people in the study appeared to have had issues with buying even office supplies online .

Survey participants were then asked to make a serious of online purchases using personal credit cards for which they were reimbursed , and participants could keep any extra money that was saved by using the cheapest retailer .
The participants were divided into three groups .
One group was given no extra information about the shopping sites ( real sites like Amazon.com were used in the test ) .
The second group received information about the sites , but it was irrelevant and should have had no impact on purchasing decisions .
The third group was presented with privacy information using Privacy Finder , a search engine developed by Carnegie Mellon that looks at a site 's Platform for Privacy Preferences information to rank privacy policies .
When participants were asked to purchase both batteries and a vibrator , there was almost no difference in the price paid between the group that received no information and the group that received irrelevant information .
The group that received the privacy information did show quite a difference from the group with no information , however — participants in group 3 paid $ 0.59 more for the batteries and $ 0.62 more for the vibrator .
The researchers say that their experiment " shows that once privacy information is made more visible , people will tend to purchase from merchants that offer more privacy protection and even pay a premium to purchase from such merchants . "
They know that this result held true even when the item in question was not a " sensitive " item .
The news may be reassuring to privacy advocates , since it indicates that Americans do actually care about online privacy .
But the study also shows that they only care when privacy information is presented to them in an obvious and simple format ( in this case five colored rectangles showed each site 's level of privacy ) .
It could also be good news for retailers , who can use robust privacy policies as a selling point , though that also means giving up the revenue associated with selling mailing lists and other , less private uses of customer data .

CIA Abduction of El - Masri Suspected CIA Kidnappers Identified
The US intelligence agents involved in wrongly kidnapping a German citizen of Arab descent could soon face warrants for their arrest .
Clues to their identity have turned up from Spanish authorities and German TV journalists .
And in New York , when patients are discharged — typically after about five days — the needed transition to an outpatient treatment program often never occurs .
That is one reason many patients do not fully recover from their addictions and return to detox wards , experts say .
The system suits the most frequent patients — most of them homeless , mentally ill , or both — who see the programs as a source of shelter and food .
And the most expensive treatment , which usually involves some sedation , can reduce the discomfort of withdrawal better than other methods .
Some drug users , especially those on opiates , also set out to clean their systems so they can reduce the dose needed to get high , according to addicts and those who treat them .
For a homeless addict , the cost of each dose is a major concern .
But at its core , experts say , the overuse of costly inpatient programs is connected to the lack of housing for homeless people .
People are less likely to admit themselves to hospitals , and more likely to adhere to treatment programs , when they are not living on the streets .
For more than a decade , the city and state have invested in such housing , including some that accept residents who are not yet drug - free , but demand for housing still far exceeds supply .
“ For this small group of what are basically professional inpatient detoxification users , it ’s really a whole series of linked problems , and none of the parts of the system work very well , ” said Dr. Richard N. Rosenthal , an addiction specialist and chairman of psychiatry at St. Luke ’s - Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan .
“ There ’s been some progress on each element , but not enough . ”
The most intensive form of treatment , “ medically managed ” withdrawal takes place in a hospital , usually involves some sedation , and requires a great deal of care by doctors and nurses .
The next level , “ medically supervised withdrawal , ” can be done in a hospital , or sometimes on an outpatient basis , and requires less medical intervention and less staff .
In New York , Medicaid pays an average of more than $ 100 a day for outpatient medically supervised withdrawal , and close to $ 400 a day for the inpatient version .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush said on Wednesday that he was creating a special envoy to the largest grouping of Islamic nations and called on moderate Muslims to speak out against extremists who are Islam ’s “ true enemy . ”

In his latest bid to counter the tide of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world , Bush said appointing a special envoy would demonstrate to Muslim communities “ our interest in respectful dialogue and continued friendship . ”
Bush , in a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Islamic Center of Washington , made no mention of who would be named the first U.S. envoy to the 57 - nation Organization of the Islamic Conference .
Standing in stocking feet among the archways and green marble pillars of the small mosque , Bush said that while the principles of religious freedom have been expanding elsewhere in the world , in the Middle East there has been a rise of extremists .
“ This enemy falsely claims that America is at war with Muslims and the Muslim faith , when in fact it is these radicals who are Islam ’s true enemy , ” he said .
It was Bush ’s third visit to the Islamic Center during his presidency .
During his first trip , just days after the September 11 attacks , he denounced prejudice against Muslim Americans .
But nearly six years after the hijacked - plane attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon , a recent study found that Muslim Americans remain “ largely outside the U.S. mainstream ” and must meld into American society or face isolation .
“ We must encourage more Muslim leaders to add their voices , to speak out against radical extremists who infiltrate mosques , to denounce organizations that use the veneer of Islamic belief to support and fund acts of violence , ” Bush said .
Anti-American sentiment has increased overseas since the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , where sectarian violence has resulted in daily bloodshed .
Bush ’s past use of terms such as “ crusade ” and “ Islamo - fascists ” in referring to the war on terrorism and Iraq has angered many Muslims worldwide .
Karen Hughes , Bush ’s chief of public diplomacy at the State Department , has led a drive to improve America ’s image in the Islamic world , where there is strong opposition to the Iraq war and resentment over Washington ’s perceived pro-Israel bias .
But critics say the U.S. effort has had little success .

Abu Omar was allegedly kidnapped from a Milan street
The suspects are accused of abducting Osama Mustafa Hassan , also known as Abu Omar , without Italian permission , and flying him to Egypt for interrogation .
The new warrants allow for the suspects ' detention anywhere in the 25 - nation EU , a prosecutor said .
The authorities had already issued arrest orders within Italy .
The BBC 's defence correspondent , Rob Watson , describes the case as one of the best documented alleged cases of the CIA 's policy of extraordinary rendition .
Extradition unlikely
Italy says the alleged operation hindered Italian terrorism investigations .
No arrests have so far been made .
All 22 suspects are thought to have returned to the US , a formal Italian extradition request seems unlikely , our correspondent adds .
Italian Justice Minister Roberto Castelli has signed the warrants , a move officials described as a formality .
There was no word on whether Mr Castelli would seek extradition , but he has previously accused the judge involved of being a leftist militant and anti-American .
Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a close US ally and has said he can see no basis for the case .
' No knowledge '
The extraordinary rendition policy involves seizing suspects and taking them to third countries for questioning without court approval .
It has been the subject of controversy recently , with human rights groups alleging that suspects are tortured , and that the CIA has secret prisons where it keeps prisoners without reference to US or international law .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently defended the use of rendition , saying it was an established practice and suggesting it was often carried out with the knowledge , or participation , of European governments .
Mr Hassan , 42 , is believed to have been abducted on 17 February 2003 , and flown out of the country from a US base in Aviano , north of Venice .
He reportedly called his family last year , telling them he had been tortured with electric shocks during his detention .
The CIA has refused to comment on the case and the Italian government has said it had no prior knowledge of any kidnap plot .
Mr Hassan is believed to have arrived in Italy in 1997 , where he was granted refugee status .
The pressure on President George Bush over Iraq intensified yesterday , when two senior Republican senators put forward a bill challenging his Iraq strategy and setting out a route for withdrawal of US troops .
The draft bill by the Republicans , John Warner and Richard Lugar , proposes switching US troops from fighting the insurgency to a more narrow remit .
This role would involve protecting Iraq 's borders , fighting only al - Qaida of Mesopotamia rather than the bigger nationalist and tribal insurgents , and protecting US bases and other interests in the country .
The bill echoes one that has been put forward by the Democrats , which also includes a deadline for withdrawal of April 1 next year .
The Democrats have a majority in both the House and the Senate .
But a simple majority is not sufficient in the 100 - member Senate , and the Democrats have so far fallen short of the 60 votes they need to push through an anti-war bill .
Mr Bush now faces the dangerous prospect of an alliance between the Democrats and Republicans .
Congress could still push through a bill in the last three weeks before the August recess .
But the Republicans may prefer to wait until September to hear a progress report from the US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and the US ambassador to Baghdad , Ryan Crocker .
Earlier this year the Democrats tried to push through legislation to begin the withdrawal of US troops or face a cut in funding for the war .
But at the time it did not have Republican support .
But there has been a significant shift in recent weeks by the Republicans , who have become frustrated at the lack of progress in Iraq and are increasingly aware of public disenchantment with the war .
Many of the Republican dissidents face re-election next year .
Both Mr Warner , who is on the Senate armed services committee , and Mr Lugar , who is on the foreign affairs committee , are respected figures within the Senate and are likely to attract the support of many other Republicans .
Their bill says : " Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and few manifestations of political compromise among Iraq 's factions , the optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified , pluralist , democratic government that is able to police itself , protect its borders , and achieve economic development is not likely to be achieved in the near future . "
The political manoeuvring in Washington was going on as US forces killed 13 people during a clash with Iraqi police in a Shia district of Baghdad .
The shootout at a police checkpoint highlighted the extent of American distrust in the police force it helped establish .
In the Bush administration 's report on progress in Iraq , delivered to Congress on Thursday , the state of the Iraqi police was judged unsatisfactory .
The US military said in a statement that an Iraqi police lieutenant had been detained on suspicion of planning roadside bomb and mortar attacks on US forces and having links with Iranians allegedly stirring up violence .
In a separate incident , a New York Times reporter , Khalid Hassan , 23 , was shot dead to his way to work in Baghdad .
His death came fewer than 24 hours after two Reuters staff were killed in Baghdad .

However , it added that the BBC is " generally seen as impartial " and set out new guidelines for avoiding bias .

The corporation says they are needed because of social and technological changes which have led to a spread of opinion beyond the traditional " left - right " political divide .
Among them is the statement that impartiality is " not necessarily to be found on the centre ground " .
Other principles warn that impartiality should not lead to " political correctness " or " insipid programmes " and there must be room for controversial and passionate contributors .
' Comfort zone '
It notes that news programmes missed several emerging stories on Europe and immigration which it described as " off limits in terms of a liberal - minded comfort zone " .
But " the report does not say that the BBC is institutionally biased , " deputy director general Mark Byford told BBC News 24 .
Drama , comedy , music and children 's programmes are also expected to pay attention to impartiality , the document says .
The Vicar of Dibley featured shots of an anti-poverty website
Because of the way the maps were tilted , they appeared to suggest that northern Scotland was on the periphery .
Although the problem was quickly ironed out , the report warned that " the continuing practice of giving temperature forecasts for conurbations rather than rural areas may suggest a presumption that the bulk of the audience lives in large cities , whereas the opposite is in fact the case " .
The BBC 's coverage of Live 8 and the Make Poverty History campaign was also singled out for criticism .
The London Olympics will be a " serious test , " the report says
The sitcom showed Dawn French 's character urging parishioners to support the anti-poverty campaign and may have breached the BBC 's code , which prevents dramas from endorsing charities .
Olympic warning
The report went on to warn that the London Olympics will provide a similar test of the BBC 's impartiality .
" Coverage of international championships has sometimes drawn criticism that the British media are too preoccupied with British competitors , " it said .
" That pull will be all the greater when the Olympic flame reaches British soil in what is likely to be the year of the Queen 's diamond jubilee " .
Safeguarding impartiality is a big and challenging topic
Mark Byford , deputy director general , BBC
In compiling the report , the BBC commissioned a survey into its audience 's views on impartiality .
Sixty - one per cent of people questioned said broadcasters may think they give a fair and informed view but a lot of the time they do not .
A further 83 % agreed that broadcasters should report on all views and opinions , however unpopular or extreme some of them may be .
" BBC audiences believe that impartiality should not lead to political correctness , " said Richard Tait , the BBC Trust member in charge of the report .
" The BBC agrees and one of our new principles makes clear that impartiality is no excuse for insipid programme - making . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The problem is not whether the BBC is impartial or not , it 's that it thinks it 's impartial

こんにちは、はじめまして。まつもとゆきひろと申します。世間ではRubyというプログラミング言語の作者として知られ、職業はプログラマーで自称ハッカーでもあります。この連載ではわたしたち「ハッカー」の生態や心理について紹介できればと考えています。
ハッカーと は
「 ハッカー」といってもネットワーク経由でシステム侵入を行ったり、パスワードを破ったりするような悪者ではありません。そういえば、最近そういう誤用をあまり耳にしなくなりましたね。
ハッカー（Hacker）とは文字どおり「 Hackする人」という意味です。「 Hack」というのはもともとは「（斧などで）たたき切る」という意味ですが、転じて「（プログラムなどを）でっちあげる」というような意味で使われています。「でっちあげる」というとずさんな仕事に思えるかもしれませんが、実際には「素早い仕事」というニュアンスで、素晴らしくできの良いものも「ハック」ですし、その場限りの間に合わせのような仕事もやっぱり「ハック」です。そんな仕事を好むハッカーは、要するにコンピュータ（あるいはプログラムできるものすべて）にのめり込むようなタイプです。
ハッカーたち自身がまとめた用語集である「jargon file」では、ハッカーをリスト1のように定義しています。長いでしょう？ それだけ「 Hacker」という単語にこだわりを持っていることがうかがえます。
プログラム可能なシステムの細かい部分を探ったり、その機能を拡張する方法を探求したりすることに喜びを感じる人。必要最小限のことしか勉強したがらない大半のユーザーとは対照的
熱中して（さらには取りつかれたように）プログラミングをする人、またはプログラミングを単に理論化するのではなく、プログラミングを楽しむ人 ハック価値（hack value）を評価できる人 手早くプログラミングするのが得意な人
ある特定のプログラムのエキスパート、または頻繁にそれを使って仕事をする人。例えば「UNIXハッカー 」
あらゆる種類のエキスパートまたは熱狂的なファン。例えば「天文ハッカー 」
創意工夫をして制約を打破したり、回避したりするという知的な難問を楽しむ人
（誤用）あちこち調べ回って機密情報を探り出そうという悪意の詮索好き。このことから「パスワードハッカー」、「ネットワークハッカー」などといわれる。この意味での正しい用語は「クラッカー」
リスト1 ハッカーの定義（『ハッカーズ大辞典』、アスキー、ISBN4-7561-0374-Xの掲載要旨）
ハッカーはほかの人から見て、一見不可能だと思えるようなことを現実にしてしまうことがあります。プログラミングの知識がない人、経験の浅い人からは魔法使いのように見えることもあります。「好きなことにのめり込んでいる」という意味では幸せそうですが、富とか資産とかいう単語とは無縁の人が多いようです。しかし、世の中には例外的に自分の才能を上手にお金に変える手段を見いだしているハッカーもいます。
良いハッカー・悪いハッカー
システム侵入をするような悪い人がハッカーと呼ばれたのは、それがかつて「創造的な知的チャレンジ」であり、そのようなことを行うハッカーが存在したからです。
たいていのハッカーは、世間一般と倫理観に少々ずれがあります。ときには法律を順守することや「良い社会人」であることよりも、知的好奇心を満たすことの方が大切だと考える気持ちは分からないでもありません。
ですが、ハッカーであることと、悪人であることとはまったくの独立です。いや、むしろ、仮に本物のハッカーがシステム侵入を行ったとしても、その動機はおそらく「やってみたかったから」、「できることを証明したかった」であって、「利益を得たい」というような犯罪的な動機ではないだろうと思います。ハッカーにはお金のような物質的欲求の低い人が多いのです。

About thirty years ago , three companies dreamed up logos that have become so powerful , I do n’t even have to show you the images to get them to pop up in your head .
A sneaker company paid a few hundred dollars for an abstract , upside down wave , a coffee company picked a half - naked mermaid ( is there any other kind ) that cost them nothing , and a computer company picked [ hired a PR firm that picked ] a piece of fruit with a bite out of it .
What the images had in common : nothing .
They range from abstract to woodcut to groovy .
The art of picking a logo , even one for the Olympics , has almost nothing to do with taste or back story .
A great logo does n’t mean anything until the brand makes it worth something .
That ’s why spending $ 800,000 for a logo is ridiculous .
And it ’s why you ca n’t ( I do n’t think I ’m going out on a limb here ) draw the logo of any Olympic games since 1898 .
The Olympics have trouble creating new logos of value because each Olympics already has an image that sticks with people … and that ’s the image of the city where the games take place .
Putting an abstract picture on top of something that already has a picture does n’t work .
[ and of course , the original Olympics logo meant nothing much when they started , but now provides a great shorthand to remind us of a whole bunch of attributes ( youth , sportsmanship , spirit of the games , yadda yadda ) that would be very hard to visualize without it . ]
The iPod did n’t need a logo , where a pair of sneakers or a cup of coffee do .
If you ’re given the task of finding a logo for an organization , your first task should be to try to get someone else to do it .
If you fail at that , find an abstract image that is clean and simple and carries very little meaning –until your brand adds that meaning .
It ’s not a popularity contest .
Or a job for a committee .
It ’s not something where you should run it by a focus group .
It ’s just a placeholder , a label waiting to earn some meaning .
Anyone want to join me for a cup of mermaid ?
No sugar in mine .
It might have gone down as the death of a “ quasi - transient ” woman with a history of abusing drugs .
That ’s how the May 9 death of Edith Isabel Rodriguez was initially reported to the Los Angeles County coroner ’s office .
But five weeks later , her demise has become a cause celebre , a symbol of bureaucratic indifference .
It is fraught with significance not just for one struggling inner-city hospital but for political and health leaders in the Los Angeles area and perhaps beyond .
The county Sheriff ’s Department , health officials and the Board of Supervisors all are feverishly trying to determine who was to blame and how to prevent a recurrence .
Despite a long history of problems at Martin Luther King Jr. - Harbor Hospital , two things set the Rodriguez case apart : the existence of a security videotape showing the woman writhing for 45 minutes on the floor of the emergency room lobby and the public release this week of two 911 calls in which witnesses unsuccessfully pleaded with sheriff ’s dispatchers for help .
The case — first reported by The Times — has crystallized people ’s fears that even in their most desperate moments , the emergency system wo n’t take them seriously .
The videotape itself has not even been made public ; mere descriptions of its content by those who have seen it have evoked outrage .
“ Here ’s a person crying for help .
Will no one help ? ” said Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who discussed the case on CNN this week .
“ What kind of a society are we when we ca n’t even render aid to someone who ’s in their own blood and vomit on the floor and you ’re mopping around them ?
It ’s a kind of morality tale of a society gone cold . ”
Said Marcela Sanchez , Rodriguez ’s sister : “ It could be you .
It could be your mom , your baby , your sister .
Unfortunately , it was my sister . ”
Nearly every major broadcast network has devoted segments to what happened to the 43 - year - old woman .
The death has even become fodder in the emerging debate over the U.S. healthcare system : Filmmaker Michael Moore , whose new documentary , “ SiCKO , ” chronicles the system ’s problems , has added a photo of Rodriguez to his website with the phrase “ Died trying . ”
As new details have emerged , public officials have hastened to show their concern .
The Sheriff ’s Department said Thursday that it will review for a second time the way dispatchers handled the 911 calls from Rodriguez ’s boyfriend and a female bystander .
One dispatcher curtly told the bystander that the situation was not an emergency ; the other said there was nothing she could do because Rodriguez was already in a hospital .
Previously , the department had provided written “ counseling ” to the dispatcher who was curt .
The department is also examining how it handles 911 calls from hospitals , said Capt .
Steven M. Roller of the sheriff ’s Century Station .
There is no current policy , but Roller said paramedics would only take patients to the nearest hospital , which would be the one where they were .
Meanwhile , county health officials are finalizing their response , due today , to a federal report citing serious deficiencies in the way Rodriguez was treated .
And they are reviewing the conduct of all emergency room workers , including contract physicians , who evaluated Rodriguez over the three days before she died but each time found nothing seriously wrong .
She died of a perforated bowel , which probably developed in the last 24 hours of her life , according to a coroner ’s report .
Hers was one in a series of cases allegedly mishandled by King - Harbor , formerly known as King / Drew .
In 1994 , a woman was infected with HIV after the hospital mistakenly gave her a transfusion with blood that had tested positive for the virus .
Years later , a woman died after drinking a glass of tissue preservative left by her bedside .
In 2000 , a 9 - year - old died from a cascade of errors stemming from treatment of two broken teeth .
More recently , nurses have been faulted for turning down the alarms on cardiac monitors and not noticing when patients went into distress and died .
But the Rodriguez case has garnered more attention than any of the others , in part because of the video showing her extended time on the floor and a janitor cleaning around her .
It is not the usual “ he said , she said ” account .
The county has repeatedly refused to release the tape , however , citing the ongoing sheriff ’s investigation .
“ If there was n’t a videotape , we would n’t be discussing it .
Period .
The end , ” said Miguel Santana , chief of staff to Supervisor Gloria Molina .
Supervisor Yvonne B. Burke , whose district includes the hospital , said the emotional 911 calls made the difference .
“ Everyone I run into feels it was so callous the way this woman was treated , ” she said .
“ Plus it ’s been replayed over and over and over again . ”
Rodriguez , a California native , was poor and uninsured .
She reportedly had a history of narcotics use and lived with various relatives .
Many people like her die , their cases forgotten by everyone but friends and family .
“ They do n’t die on camera , ” said Dr. Felix Nuñez , medical director of the South Central Family Health Center in Los Angeles .
“ It ’s usually poor people dying on skid row , and they ’re just carted away .
We do n’t hear and see anything about them . ”
Perhaps the case also struck a chord because everybody , rich and poor , relies on emergency rooms , although King - Harbor serves a largely poor and minority population .
When patients show up , they often discover they must wait hours to be seen .
“ The incident embodies the frustration that Americans feel with the waits at hospitals , with the negligence at hospitals , ” said Jamie Court , president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights .
“ Everybody one day visits the emergency room . ”
Some local officials understood the potential significance of Rodriguez ’s case almost immediately .
Days after her death , coroner ’s records obtained by The Times show , county officials and politicians weighed in with questions and suggestions about the investigation .
Dr. Robert Splawn , senior medical director of the county Department of Health Services , called the coroner ’s office several times .
During a May 12 call , he voiced his “ great concerns over this case ” and suggested that Rodriguez was high on cocaine or methamphetamine at the time of her death , according to the documents .
Results of toxicology testing by the coroner showed that Rodriguez did not have cocaine in her system .
She tested positive for methamphetamine , but the level was not “ life - threatening . ”
At another point , on May 18 , Splawn called , “ wondering why nobody called him , ” and Deputy Medical Examiner Louis Pena declined to take his call , the documents say .
Earlier this week , Splawn was named interim medical director of King - Harbor .
Others who talked to the coroner ’s office included county lawyers , health department director Dr. Bruce Chernof , and Molina and members of her staff .
Sharon Harper , the No. 2 county administrator , said she does not believe that anyone , including Splawn , acted inappropriately in investigating the matter ; they were simply inquiring about a major case .
“ I do n’t think that the health department is trying to skew any results , ” she said .
“ This was serious to them . ”

Justin Delfino looked out the window of his Ahwatukee home and could n't believe what he was seeing .
It was shortly after noon on July 23 and several men dressed in black jeans and green shirts were getting out of an unmarked white Suburban , casually putting on flak jackets and helmets .
Soon the men were lingering in front of his neighbor 's house in the upscale gated subdivision of quarter - million - dollar homes .
Delfino never would have guessed that he was witnessing the final preparations by the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office SWAT team moments before it unleashed a barrage of tear gas grenades into his neighbor 's home .
" They looked unprofessional .
They were getting dressed on the scene .
They were n't organized , " Delfino , 22 , says .
From his vantage point inside his home , Delfino could n't see that deputies had rolled an armored personnel carrier into the neighbor 's front yard as they prepared to storm the house .
Delfino could see no readily visible insignia on any of the men , so he figured the scene must be a prelude to a prank on the two men and a woman with a toddler who lived in the two - story stucco house across the street .
" I thought , these must be their friends and they are going to try and shoot paint balls at them , " Delfino says .
But soon he knew that what he first thought was a gag must be about something deadly serious .
" I saw one of the guys was perched and aiming a gun at the window , " he says .
" All of a sudden , he fires off a tear gas round into the upstairs window .
" I immediately called 911 .
I did n't know what was going on . "
Delfino says the men -- who he next thought must be members of a gang -- continued firing tear gas canisters through three upstairs windows in the front of the house .
He saw others wearing flak jackets go around to the back of the house , where he heard them fire two more rounds at the upstairs windows of a back bedroom .
After a few minutes on the phone with a 911 operator , Delfino says , he was told that the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office was serving a search warrant on the house and " not to worry . "
That 's when Delfino really got nervous .
With good reason .
Delfino tells me he did n't know whether a huge gun battle was about to erupt 20 yards from his front door .
No one from the sheriff 's office had alerted him -- or any of his neighbors -- to evacuate .
Moments later , the situation deteriorated even further when the house erupted into flames .
Now , the entire neighborhood of closely packed homes was threatened by the possibility of fire .
There was n't a fire truck in sight .
Delfino 's ' hood would n't have fared much worse if it had been a gang of street thugs blasting away at the house , rather than Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's inept and bumbling SWAT team .
In less than 30 minutes , Arpaio 's special forces unleashed an unprecedented wave of violence on this quiet community .
Consider this :
 Just after the tear gas canisters were shot , a fire erupted and destroyed a $ 250,000 home plus all the contents inside .
( The home 's occupants believe the tear gas canisters caused the fire .
Phoenix fire officials say the blaze was probably started by a lighted candle that was knocked onto a bed during the confusion . )
 The armored personnel carrier careened down the street and smashed into a parked car after its brakes failed .
 And in the ultimate display of cruelty , a SWAT team member drove a dog trying to flee the home back into the inferno , where it met an agonizing death .
Deputies then reportedly laughed as the dog's owners came unglued as it perished in the blaze .
" I was crying hysterically , " Andrea Barker , one of the dog 's owners , tells me .
" I was so upset .
They [ deputies ] were laughing at me . "
Making fun of the 10 - month - old pit bull puppy 's death was n't enough .
Arpaio 's goons then left the dog's body to rot in the ashes for the next five days of 105 - degree temperatures .
A pall of death hung over the neighborhood .
It was a putrid reminder of Arpaio 's reckless use of force and callous disregard for the public 's welfare .
Not to mention the heinous treatment toward the terrified dog .
And what did Arpaio 's crack SWAT team net from the raid that left a needless trail of death and destruction ?
MCSO stormed the house believing there was a cache of stolen automatic weapons and armor-piercing ammunition .
But MCSO got bushwhacked .
Instead of finding weapons of mass destruction , they discovered an antique shotgun and a 9 mm pistol that appear to be legal weapons .
There was no sign of the cop -killer bullets .
Perhaps they are buried somewhere out in the desert , with Saddam 's plutonium .
Given the overwhelming display of force deployed by Arpaio 's deputies , one would have expected the arrest of a mass murderer .
Instead , the crack SWAT boys nabbed 26 - year - old Eric Kush .
Let me tell you , Kush is really a bad , bad guy .
He was wanted on a misdemeanor warrant for failing to appear in Tempe Municipal Court on a couple of traffic citations .
Thank God he 's off the street .
Well , not quite .
He posted his $ 1,000 bond on the misdemeanor warrant and was quickly released from jail .
Arpaio's Ahwatukee assault should have drawn banner headlines in the daily newspapers .
But the Arizona Republic , where Arpaio 's son- in - law , Phil Boas , serves as deputy editor of the editorial pages , buried the story in a community section .
The East Valley Tribune ignored it entirely .
The local papers missed a helluva story .
Needless to say , neighbors are infuriated .
" The operation was completely and grossly mishandled , " says Justin Delfino 's father , Gene .
" They endangered my son and other people in this neighborhood , " Gene adds .
" I would love to see their reaction if this happened in their neighborhood . "
I 'm not criticizing the sheriff 's department for investigating activities at the Ahwatukee home occupied by Gabrial Golden , Andrea Barker and Eric Kush .
There are clear indications that these young people living in an upscale rental home might have been engaged in some serious criminal activity .
My gripe is that Arpaio 's SWAT team embarked on extreme and dangerous maneuvers that unnecessarily placed the entire neighborhood in mortal danger .
A more measured , thoughtful and patient response likely would have achieved the same goal without the wholesale destruction of private property and the death of a puppy .
Gabrial Golden , 28 , has a history of felony arrests dating back to 1996 .
He is on probation for an armed - robbery conviction .
In July , he became the focus of a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department investigation in connection with the theft of automatic weapons and armor- piercing bullets .
Early on the morning of July 23 , hours before MCSO rolled into Ahwatukee , Gabrial Golden was lured to a meeting with his probation officer , where he was arrested .
He remains in custody .
According to press accounts , upon his arrest , Golden told MCSO that Kush was acting erratically and was armed .
Kush , however , had no felony record , and his only legal ding was failing to appear in Tempe Municipal Court on a traffic warrant .
There were no other indications that Kush was about to unleash a rampage of cop-killer bullets on the neighborhood .
In fact , Barker says she did n't even know Kush was at home when the SWAT team suddenly appeared in the front yard , complete with an armored personnel carrier .
The 22 - year - old Barker says MCSO banged on her front door , announced they had a warrant and kicked in the door before she could respond .
" I was coming down the stairs and I heard them pound on the door , " Barker says .
" Literally two seconds later they kicked the door in mine and my daughter 's face as I was trying to open it . "
Barker says deputies yanked her and her daughter outside .
" They started yelling , ` This is the sheriff 's department !
Eric , come out with your hands up ! ' "
Barker says .
But Eric did n't come out .
Initially , he holed up in the attic .
" I guess he just got scared , " Barker says .
With Kush crouched in the attic , the SWAT team could have entered the house and made their way upstairs to confront him .
Instead , they started launching tear gas grenades .
" Three to five minutes after they shot the tear gas cans into my bedroom , I saw flames coming out the back of the arcadia door , " Barker says .
Within minutes , the upstairs of the house was engulfed in flames .
Kush , Barker says , could hear Dre , his prized pit - bull puppy , yelping , and he jumped from the attic to try to save the dog .
As black smoke billowed from the house , Barker says , Kush frantically tried to get Dre to run outside , the puppy yelping " like a baby . "
At one point , Dre ran from the master bedroom and bolted down the stairs toward the front door , where it came face to face with a SWAT team member .
Instead of letting the dog run outside , the SWAT member reportedly launched a counterattack .
" They shot the dog in the face with a fire extinguisher when he tried to come out of the fire , " says Trisha Golden , Gabrial 's younger sister , who helped raise the dog and was outside the burning home calling for it to come out .
She did not live at the house , but hung out there frequently , she says .
She heard about the fire and came immediately .
" He turned and ran back into the master bedroom and burned [ to death ] . "
Delfino says he asked one of the SWAT officers what happened to Dre and was told that the dog had been " neutralized " with the fire extinguisher .
He asked the officer if the dog had attacked anybody , and the cop said no .
As smoke filled the house and Kush 's efforts to save the dog failed , he finally fled from the burning home and was immediately thrown to the ground and his hands and feet were cuffed by four SWAT officers .
Meanwhile , Trisha Golden continued frantically to call for Dre to flee the house .
" We were like screaming for Dre , and [ a deputy ] turned around and said , ` Why do n't you shut the fuck up ? ! ' "
Trisha Golden says .
I could n't reach Eric Kush or Gabrial Golden for comment .
But Kush , a biking and skateboarding enthusiast , told KTVK - TV Channel 3 that sheriff 's deputies thought it was hilarious that his dog had burned to death in the fire .
" As they 're hog - tying me , they have the nerve and the audacity to laugh at me and say , ` Did you hear that dog screaming upstairs ? ' "
Kush told Channel 3 .
" I do n't know how they have the audacity and the heart to say something like that . "
Eric Kush is not an intimidating fellow .
He 's about five - feet - six - inches tall and weighs about 125 pounds .
There was no indication he had taken anybody hostage or was endangering the neighborhood .
In fact , neighbors say he is a friendly and easygoing guy .
His only legal blemish was the outstanding misdemeanor warrant .
If MCSO truly believed they were facing a madman armed to the teeth with armor - piercing bullets that would cut through the flimsy chicken - wire and stucco walls of homes in the neighborhood , they did n't have the sense to alert neighbors to get the hell out of Dodge .
Instead , they left the entire area at risk of getting mowed down by a spray of bullets fired from automatic assault rifles that easily could travel a mile .
But who cares about innocent neighbors when Arpaio 's morons take to the street to make a pinch ?
Who cares that there was a far easier and safer way to nab Kush for questioning ?
The most prudent , cautious and least costly way to pick up Kush would have involved only a handful of officers .
That would n't have been anywhere near as much fun as whipping out the big assault rifles and putting on all that manly body armor .
And MCSO would n't get to deploy Arpaio 's beloved armored personnel carrier if they opted for the low - key approach to community policing .
Lucky the damn tank did n't run over some kids playing in the street !
Arpaio unleashed his SWAT team on Ahwatukee without bothering to give Phoenix police , which has primary jurisdiction in the community , a heads - up about his latest Joe Show .
The sheriff 's failure to alert Phoenix police about the planned SWAT assault will be the focus of a high - level meeting between the two police agencies .
Phoenix City Councilman Greg Stanton says Phoenix police should have been notified before MCSO launched such a dangerous and ultimately unnecessary SWAT maneuver .
Most police agencies would consider the afternoon 's outing disastrous .
But for Arpaio 's idiots , it was a good day -- at least they made an arrest .
No matter that they arrested Kush on a misdemeanor warrant and found none of the automatic weapons that were supposed to be stashed in the house .
As fire spread throughout the house and engulfed the dog , the SWAT team soon had another crisis erupt .
The armored personnel carrier was pulled back from the house as the fire raged .
But a deputy apparently failed to set the brakes on the heavy vehicle and it began rolling down a hill and smashed into a parked car .
The combat vehicle caused at least $ 4,000 damage to Julie Madrigal 's car .
The 44 - year - old mother and her 9 - year - old daughter had already been terrified by the tear gas assault as they fled from their car and ran into their house .
At least Madrigal and her daughter were n't in the path of the carrier as it careened down the hill .
" I heard three shots as we were running in , " Madrigal says .
" I thought , ` Oh my God .
They are shooting at us . '
I did n't know what was going on . "
Madrigal says she watched the house burst into flames and moments later was shocked to see the " tank " roll down the road toward her car .
" All of a sudden , I saw my car jump back three feet and the tank land on top of it , " she says .
The grand scale of the assault by Arpaio 's Barney Fifes made neighbors wonder if Osama himself was holed up in the house .
As details about the raid circulated through the community and word spread about the absence of any serious and immediate threat to the peace , neighbors became enraged over Arpaio 's ludicrous use of force .
" We gathered all around all afternoon to talk , " Madrigal says .
" We were all saying this was just ridiculous .
They just went way overboard .
This was just crazy .
They should have given us some kind of warning . "
Finally , MCSO packed up its toys and went away .
But the stench from their operation would continue to linger for almost a week .
MCSO 's callousness toward the dog , its owners and the neighborhood continued for another five days as the dog lay decomposing inside the burned - out house .
Delfino says the stench permeated his car and left neighbors gagging when they went near the house .
" When I finally went in [ to the house ] , it was enough to make you throw up , " Delfino says .
It never occurred to the MCSO that the rotting dog was a health hazard and a public nuisance .
Once Arpaio 's deputies finished their so - called investigation , they walked away from the mess they created , leaving Dre 's body embedded in the rubble .
It was only then that the occupants were allowed inside .
Delfino says he was with Kush and Trisha Golden when , while digging through burned debris on the kitchen floor , they came across Dre 's remains .
Kush , Delfino recalls , fell to his knees and began vomiting .
They could only stay in the room for a few moments , but long enough to gather some evidence of the animal cruelty inflicted by Arpaio 's deputies .
" I took a picture of [ Golden ] with a shovel holding the dog's head , " Delfino says .
The Ahwatukee fiasco is just the latest in a long string of bumblings and constitutional breaches by Arpaio and his nimrods .
This comes on the heels of last November 's botched prostitution raid where Arpaio 's bozo posse men got naked and , in some cases , had sexual relations with hookers -- leaving Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley little choice but to throw out the cases .
Then there was the publicity - stunt televised arrest of two Peoria firefighters on arson charges during the middle of their night shift .
The arrest sidelined a fire truck for the rest of the evening , putting lives needlessly at risk .
Two months later , Arpaio 's detectives have n't filed a police report with Romley 's office , and no charges have been filed against the firefighters .
And there was the Glen Campbell charade , where Arpaio insisted to the press that Campbell would be treated like any other inmate .
Of course , he was put up in a clean , air - conditioned cell at a seldom - used holding facility in Mesa .
Campbell brought along his favorite guitar , a cell phone and an orthopedic back mattress .
Toward the end of his cushy 10 - day jail sentence , Campbell stroked Joe with the now - infamous Tent City concert .
While the incidents listed above are bad enough , they do n't get at the more serious problems during Arpaio 's 12 - year reign .
Inmates continue to be killed and maimed in Arpaio 's county dungeons , ranked as among the worst in the world by Amnesty International .
About 9,000 people are stuffed into the county 's jails , which were built to hold a maximum of 5,000 inmates .
Increasingly paranoid , Arpaio routinely uses his police powers to illegally investigate political opponents and silence any employee and , in some cases , any private citizen , who dares to criticize his office .
At the same time , Arpaio refuses to comply with Arizona 's public records law , flagrantly ignoring my requests for routine records concerning the financial operations of the jail .
My demand for the financial documents relating to the jail commissary comes on the heels of my discovery that Arpaio has invested an inordinately large amount of cash ( $ 800,000 ) in three commercial real estate ventures .
His spokeswoman insists that nothing is amiss here , but Arpaio refuses to divulge the details of these transactions .
Now , members of Sheriff Joe 's SWAT team have laughed over the death of a dog and at its owners who were tearfully trying to coax their pet out of the burning house .
Again , Sheriff
Joe is hiding , refusing to return my repeated requests for an interview about why he let his goons do what they did to Dre .
The really sick thing is that Arpaio has gotten huge publicity for his campaign against animal abuse .
He 's diverted scarce sheriff 's office resources to duplicate services already provided by Maricopa County Animal Care and Control so that he can be seen as the ultimate animal protector .
Arpaio likes to brag that he spends more money feeding dogs and cats than he does feeding inmates .
This , you see , makes him a tough guy , something voters in the past have dearly loved .
There 's story after story in the press featuring Arpaio boasting how he puts abused pets inside air - conditioned cells while inmates and pre-trial detainees are dangerously packed into stifling overcrowded cells , dormitories and tents .
The sheriff 's office formed the Animal Cruelty Enforcement posse in the wake of the ritualistic slaying of several cats in the Ahwatukee area in 1998 .
As the cases of animal cruelty increased in number , Arpaio formed the Animal Cruelty Unit in January 2000 .
According to the MCSO Web site , " This Unit responds to calls all over Maricopa County dealing with everything from complaints of no food and no water , to animals being starved , beaten , tortured , even killed by suspects . "
Hey , Joe , what do you think about your SWAT team chasing the dog back into a burning house ?
Maybe your vaunted Animal Cruelty
Unit should investigate the SWAT guys for contributing to the needless death of this animal .
Not only did your boys cause the house in which Kush was living to burn down with their assault , they stood by and watched in amusement as the dog 's frantic cries gave way to eerie silence .
" I think it was a big joke to them , " says Trisha Golden .
" They knew how bad we were freaking out about the dog . "
As usual , Arpaio is trying to blame his deputies ' latest fiasco on someone else .
The scene had n't even cooled down after the fire before the MCSO was trying to pin the blaze on Kush .
" They said I was upstairs in the attic burning all these missing guns , " Kush told Channel 3 .
" Why would I burn myself in my own house ? "
Especially since the only guns found in the house were the shotgun and pistol , which appear at this point to be legal weapons .
While Kush offers a plausible denial for starting the fire , a raging debate is quickly surfacing over what did cause the blaze .
MCSO and the Phoenix Fire Department are vigorously trying to focus attention away from the tear gas canisters as the likely cause of the fire .
Meanwhile , the occupants of the house are convinced that the fire was triggered by the tear gas attack .
Phoenix fire officials tell me that four tear gas canisters were fired through upstairs windows in the front of the house , which matches eyewitness accounts by Barker and Delfino .
A fifth canister , fire officials say , was reportedly fired into the attic of the house .
Two other tear gas canisters were fired at the arcadia window in front of the master bedroom , the room where the fire originated .
Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Bob Kahn says those canisters never entered the master bedroom .
One reportedly bounced off a balcony rail and landed in the yard , and the second hit the arcadia window , but did not enter the bedroom .
Despite the highly suspicious fact that the fire erupted minutes after the tear gas was fired into the house , the Phoenix Fire Department 's preliminary report is blaming a lighted candle located near the bed in the master bedroom for sparking the blaze .
" The cause was probably the candle on top of the refrigerator knocked onto the bed by either the pit bull or the occupant , " Kahn says .
Kahn says fire investigators were told by MCSO Detective Mike Traverse that Kush reportedly stated that there was a " lit aromatic candle located on the refrigerator next to the bed . "
Investigators , Kahn says , found a wax residue near the corner of the bed where the refrigerator was located .
Barker is n't buying this explanation .
She repeatedly told me during two interviews that there was not a lighted candle in the bedroom .
She says the aromatic candle was located in the bathroom , but that it was not lighted .
" The only thing I had on my refrigerator next to my bed was an alarm clock and some pictures , " she says .
Barker says she knew the MCSO fired at least two tear gas canisters at her bedroom window based on information she derived from sitting in the SWAT command vehicle .
She says she " heard it break the window . "
" Two or three minutes after they shot it into the room , we had a fire in the master bedroom , " she says .
Barker believes at least one canister landed on the down comforter on her bed and set it on fire .
Last week , I entered the burned - up house through an open front door .
It was clear the fire started in the master bedroom , and there was a huge hole in the floor beneath the bed .
It appeared that Dre fell through the floor and landed in the kitchen , where the dog was covered by charred debris .
There were other holes in the floor where a canister could have possibly ignited a fire , burned through the floor and fallen into the kitchen below .
As far as I 'm concerned , it does n't matter whether a candle or a tear gas canister started the fire that burned the house and killed the dog .
There would have been no fire if Arpaio 's overzealous and unsophisticated SWAT deputies had n't needlessly launched a dangerous assault in a densely populated area .
Such operations should be reserved for the most dangerous situations , where innocent lives are at stake .
In this case , there was one guy with a misdemeanor warrant holed up in the house .
He had n't fired a single shot .
He was n't threatening anybody .
There were no hostages .
There was no clear indication that the house was full of heavy automatic weapons .
All Arpaio 's deputies had to do was show a little patience and a modicum of common sense .
But these are traits that neither Arpaio nor his deputies seem to possess .
Instead , an entire neighborhood was subjected to a dangerous assault that left children traumatized , residents furious , and a puppy on fire .
" It was totally uncalled for , " says Gene Delfino .
" You do n't go hunting for deer with a tank . "
IT IS beginning to dawn on biologists that they may have got it wrong .
Not completely wrong , but wrong enough to be embarrassing .
For half a century their subject had been built around the relation between two sorts of chemical .
Proteins , in the form of enzymes , hormones and so on , made things happen .
DNA , in the form of genes , contained the instructions for making proteins .
Other molecules were involved , of course .
Sugars and fats were abundant ( too abundant , in some people ) .
And various vitamins and minerals made an appearance , as well .
Oh , and there was also a curious chemical called RNA , which looked a bit like DNA but was n't .
It obediently carried genetic information from DNA in the nucleus to the places in the cell where proteins are made , rounded up the amino - acid units out of which those proteins are constructed , and was found in the protein factories themselves .
All that was worked out decades ago .
Since then , RNA has been more or less neglected as a humble carrier of messages and fetcher of building materials .
This account of the cell was so satisfying to biologists that few bothered to look beyond it .
But they are looking now .
For , suddenly , cells seem to be full of RNA doing who - knows - what .
And the diversity is staggering .
There are scnRNAs , snRNAs and snoRNAs .
There are rasiRNAs , tasiRNAs and natsiRNAs .
The piRNAs , which were discovered last summer , are abundant in developing sex cells .
No male mammal , nor male fish , nor fly of either sex , would be fertile without them .
Another RNA , called XIST , has the power to turn off an entire chromosome .
It does so in females because they , unlike males , have two X chromosomes and would otherwise get an unhealthy double dose of many proteins .
There is even a “ pregnancy - induced non-coding RNA ” , cutely termed PINC .
New RNAs are rushing forth from laboratories so rapidly that a group called the RNA Ontology Consortium has been promised half a million dollars to prune and tend the growing thicket of RNA - tailed acronyms .
In the light of this abundance , perceptions about what a gene is need to change .
Genes were once thought of almost exclusively as repositories of information about how to build proteins .
Now , they need to be seen for what they really are : RNA factories .
Genes for proteins may even be in the minority .
In a human , the number of different microRNAs , one of the commonest of the newly discovered sorts of RNA , may be as high as 37,000 according to Isidore Rigoutsos , IBM 's genome - miner in chief .
That compares with the 21,000 or so protein - encoding genes that people have .
Philosophers of science love this sort of thing .
They refer to it as a paradigm shift .
Living through such a shift is confusing for the scientists involved , and this one is no exception .
But when it is over , it is likely to have changed people 's views about how cells regulate themselves , how life becomes more complex , how certain mysterious diseases develop and even how the process of evolution operates .
As a bonus , it also opens up avenues to develop new drugs .
Increase and multiply
Not everyone agrees with Dr Rigoutsos about how many microRNAs there are .
But the results of a project called the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) , published in this week 's Nature , suggest he is on the right track .
The project looked in detail at 1 % of the human genome .
When ENCODE started , four years ago , the conventional wisdom was that only a few percent of this 1 % , corresponding mainly to the protein - coding genes , would actually be transcribed into RNA .
In fact , most of it is .
What this means is unclear — just how unclear being shown by the fact that although the consortium was willing to identify only eight places where this transcription definitely results in an RNA molecule with a job other than passively carrying the code for a protein , they found another 268 where there was likely to be one , and several thousand more where the data hinted there might be one .
That compares with 487 protein - coding genes in the same sequence .
Other evidence suggests that microRNAs regulate the activity of at least a third of human protein - encoding genes .
This means there are very few cellular processes that do not happen under their watch .
Around 20 microRNAs , for instance , are made only in human embryonic stem cells .
These molecules could turn out to be the key to understanding how such cells remain in a state from which they can become any other type of cell — the very reason embryonic stem cells hold such great medical promise .
The existence of microRNAs may also help to explain why some creatures are more complex than others .
Until their discovery , this was something of a paradox .
Knowing that DNA stores data that then get translated into living organisms , and that the complexities of development must require lots of information , biologists naturally expected that the more intricately formed an organism is , the more genes it would have in its cells .
They therefore struggled when they found that C. elegans , a tiny worm that lacks a proper brain but is nevertheless widely studied by geneticists , has about 20,000 genes — only a little bit short of the number in a human .
Indeed , this seems to be a general number for animals .
Another geneticists ' favourite , the fruit fly Drosophila , has a similar number .
But , of course , the genes in question are protein - coding genes .
Add in the genes whose RNA does other things and the balance changes .
It changes even more if exactly what those RNA molecules do is examined .
Single microRNAs , for example , often regulate the levels of hundreds of different proteins .
They are like powerful strings controlling copious protein puppets .
Super - imposed on this , some types of regulatory RNA edit other kinds of RNA .
The effect of extra genes for both of these sorts of RNA molecules is therefore multiplicative rather than additive .
The picture that is emerging is thus one of “ hard - wired ” simple organisms , which mostly stick to using RNA for fetching and carrying , and “ soft - wired ” complex ones that employ it in a management capacity .
In the complexity stakes , it is not how many protein - coding genes you have , but how you regulate them , that counts .
What 's up , Doc ?
Another consequence of RNA 's rise to prominence is that researchers have a new source of explanations for illness .
Small RNAs have been linked to many types of cancer , to genetic diseases of the central nervous system , and even to infections .
Some scientists , for instance , think that RNA molecules help the protein that causes Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease to recruit non-infectious proteins to join its ranks .
The new RNA world is also a source of ideas about how diseases might one day be treated .
In this line of work it is best to start simple , which is why the main hunt for new drugs centres on a technology called RNA interference , or RNAi ( see article ) .
This , in theory at least , promises to turn down the production of any single protein to very low levels .
That distinguishes it from microRNAs , which control many proteins simultaneously .
A hypothetical RNAi drug might , for instance , become the ultimate analgesic by affecting the activity of SCN9A , a gene recently pinpointed as the reason why a Pakistani street performer — who put knives through his arms and walked on burning coals — could not feel pain .
The technology has also helped over - eating mice stay slim and live a fifth longer .
That was done by choking an insulin - receptor gene in the animals ' fat cells .
This made the cells less inclined to store every calorie .
The technique has even created edible cottonseed ( for anyone who might want to try it ) by eliminating cotton 's gossypol toxin .
Not least , it can claim to have produced allergy - friendly soya beans , by turning off the gene that encodes the protein that provokes the reaction .
It is also a technology that can be used at one remove .
Recently , Michael White of the University of Texas and his colleagues used RNAi not to treat lung cancer directly , but to convert tumorous cells that do not respond to Taxol , a widely used anti-cancer drug , into cells that are sensitive to it .
They did this by silencing Taxol - suppressing genes that were usually active in those cancer cells .
RNAi drugs work by mugging another sort of RNA — one of the classes of the molecule discovered decades ago .
These are the messenger - RNA molecules that shuttle information from DNA to the cell 's protein factories .
The drugs themselves are short pieces of RNA made of strands about 21 genetic letters long .
What is unusual about these molecules is that they have two parallel strands , instead of a single one .
One of DNA 's differences from RNA is that it comes as a double - stranded helix .
Molecules of RNA usually have only a single strand .
When a double - stranded RNAi drug enters a cell , an “ argonaute ” protein picks the molecule up and unzips it down the middle .
It chops one strand in two and discards those remnants .
The other strand acts as a guide for the argonaute .
It can pair with a messenger - RNA molecule — at least , it can do so as long as this messenger contains a sequence of 21 letters that complement those of the drug .
When such RNA molecules do pair , the argonaute slices the messenger to oblivion like a sword - swinging samurai , just as it did with the other half of the original RNAi drug .
Thus the gene whose message it was carrying is silenced .
This is how RNAi drugs stop the production of disease - related proteins at source — they hold the tap turned off whereas most medicines try to mop up a continuous leak .
Messenger destruction is specific because 21 letters of code are nearly always enough to identify the instructions for one type of protein over another .
The most probable explanation for RNAi is that it evolved as a defence against viruses .
Double - stranded RNA is rare in nature , but viruses often make it when they reproduce .
This means that organisms which have evolved the ability to recognise and destroy double - stranded RNA molecules have a competitive advantage over those that do not .
That is one example of the role of RNA in evolution .
But there are many more .
The evolution of microRNAs , for instance , underlines their importance in the origin of complexity .
Their number appears to have ballooned when land plants and vertebrates evolved .
But it is early days in this research .
Dave Bartel , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , is surveying grand lists of small RNAs in mosses , flowers , worms , flies and mice in the hope that he will learn when different families of microRNAs emerged and which genes these microRNAs are regulating .
Dr Bartel has already discovered microRNA genes interspersed among sets of protein - encoding genes called Hox clusters .
Hox clusters contain basic instructions about body plans , and the genes within them are arranged in the order in which they influence their owner 's shape during development .
In short , a Hox gene at one end of a cluster contains the information : “ Give this embryo a head ” .
The gene at the other end says : “ And a tail , too ” .
The role of the interspersed microRNAs is to regulate these high - level commands .
Ronald Plasterk , of the University of Utrecht , in the Netherlands , suggests that microRNAs are important in the evolution of the human brain .
In December 's Nature Genetics , he compared the microRNAs encoded by chimpanzee and human genomes .
About 8 % of the microRNAs that are expressed in the human brain were unique to it , much more than chance and the evolutionary distance between chimps and people would predict .
Such observations suggest evolution is as much about changes in the genes for small RNAs as in the genes for proteins — and in complex creatures possibly more so .
Indeed , some researchers go further .
They suggest that RNA could itself provide an alternative evolutionary substrate .
That is because RNA sometimes carries genetic information down the generations independently of DNA , by hitching a lift in the sex cells .
Link this with the fact that the expression of RNA is , in certain circumstances , governed by environmental factors , and some very murky waters are stirred up .
It 's evolutionary , my dear Watson
What is being proposed is the inheritance of characteristics acquired during an individual 's lifetime , rather than as the result of chance mutations .
This was first suggested by Jean Baptiste Lamarck , before Charles Darwin 's idea of natural selection swept the board .
However , even Darwin did not reject the idea that Lamarckian inheritance had some part to play , and it did not disappear as a serious idea until 20th - century genetic experiments failed to find evidence for it .
The wiggle room for the re-admission of Lamarck 's ideas comes from the discovery that small RNAs are active in cells ' nuclei as well as in their outer reaches .
Greg Hannon , of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State , thinks that some of these RNA molecules are helping to direct subtle chemical modifications to DNA .
Such modifications make it harder for a cell 's code - reading machinery to get at the affected region of the genome .
They thus change the effective composition of the genome in a way similar to mutation of the DNA itself ( it is such mutations that are the raw material of natural selection ) .
Indeed , they sometimes stimulate actual chemical changes in the DNA — in other words , real mutations .
Even this observation , interesting though it is , does not restore Lamarckism because such changes are not necessarily advantageous .
But what Dr Hannon believes is that the changes in question sometimes happen in response to stimuli in the environment .
The chances are that even this is still a random process , and that offspring born with such environmentally induced changes are no more likely to benefit than if those changes had been induced by a chemical or a dose of radiation .
And yet , it is just possible Dr Hannon is on to something .
The idea that the RNA operating system which is emerging into view can , as it were , re-write the DNA hard - drive in a predesigned way , is not completely ridiculous .
This could not result in genuine novelty .
That must still come from natural selection .
But it might optimise the next generation using the experience of the present one , even though the optimising software is the result of Darwinism .
And if that turned out to be commonplace , it would be the paradigm shift to end them all .
Gilmore drops out of the race Gilmore drops out of the race
Former Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III is dropping his underdog bid for the Republican presidential nomination today , he told The Politico in an interview .
Gilmore said he has been approached about running for Virginia governor a second time , and about running for U.S. Senate if Sen. John W. Warner ( R ) retires .
Gilmore said he will consider both options .
Reflecting his long - held interest in Old Dominion politics , he said he will start a political action committee to support Republicans running for the state senate and House of Delegate .

In the interview , Gilmore said the punishing financial requirements of the early - starting race caused him to decide it was " impractical " to continue .
" Because of the front - loading of the primaries , I would have basically had to stop campaigning and spend full time organizing hundreds of people to raise money for me , " he said .
Gilmore 's campaign issued a statement in which he said : " I have come to believe that it takes more than a positive vision for our nation 's future to successfully compete for the presidency .
I believe that it takes years of preparation to put in place both the political and financial infrastructure to contest what amounts to a one - day national primary in February . "
Gilmore said he made the decision in the past 48 hours on the basis of " an assessment of where I could do the most good for the country and the state of Virginia . "
He said he has not made a decision about endorsing one of his rivals , but said he would not rule it out .
Gilmore had offered himself as the " consistent conservative " and heir to Ronald Reagan in a field that has left many Republican activists dissatisfied .
He is the first GOP candidate to leave the race .
He said he will continue to speak out on issues like homeland security and terrorism , subjects that he emphasized in debates .
Other candidates commanded much more cash and attention , keeping Gilmore a distant also - ran .
Financial reports this weekend showed he had little hope of cracking the top tier .
Gilmore raised $ 170,000 in the first three months of the year and said he collected $ 211,000 in the quarter ending June 30 , while the leading candidates in the race banked millions .
In Gilmore 's successful race for a four - year term for Virginia governor in 1997 , he showed the popular appeal of fiscal conservativism with his " no car tax " pledge to reduce the commonwealth 's personal property tax .
While in office , he served briefly as chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Gilmore is a lawyer who has made counterterrorism and homeland security his specialties since leaving office .
An Army veteran and son of a Safeway meat cutter , he rose as an outsider in the clubby world of Richmond law , becoming Henrico County commonwealth 's attorney and state attorney general .
He was the first chairman of a congressionally appointed commission on terrorism that became known as the Gilmore Commission .
ATKINSON , N.H. -- Brad Delp , the lead singer for the band Boston , was found dead Friday in his home in southern New Hampshire .
He was 55 .
Atkinson police responded to a call for help at 1:20 p.m. and found Delp dead .
Lt. William Baldwin said in a news release that there was no indication of foul play .
" There was nothing disrupted in the house .
He was a fairly healthy person from what we 're able to ascertain , " Police Chief Philip Consentino told WMUR - TV .
Delp apparently was alone at the time , Baldwin said .
The cause of death remained under investigation .
Police said an incident report would not be available until Monday .
Delp sang on Boston 's 1976 hits " More than a Feeling " and " Long Time . "
He also sang on Boston 's most recent album , " Corporate America , " released in 2002 .
He joined the band in the early 1970s after meeting Tom Scholz , an MIT student interested in experimental methods of recording music , according to the group 's official Web site .
The band enjoyed its greatest success and influence during its first decade .
The band 's last appearance was in November 2006 at Boston 's Symphony Hall .
On Friday night , the Web site was taken down and replaced with the statement : " We just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll . "
A call to the Swampscott , Mass. , home of Boston guitarist Barry Goudreau was not immediately returned Friday night .

Officials said the fake product could be life - threatening
Albumin , or plasma protein , is used to treat patients suffering from shock and burns and during open - heart surgery .
Experts suggest that the fake product could be life - threatening for those already in a serious condition .
The scandal is the latest to expose weaknesses in China 's regulation of food and drug standards .
Big profit
The food and drug administration in the north - eastern state of Jilin found 18 hospitals and more than 30 pharmacies sold or were selling false batches of the albumin .
" There was no element of protein , so it could not perform its intended function , " said the administration 's deputy director , Xu Fei .
" These were out - and - out fakes , " he added .
Officials did not say whether anyone had died or fallen ill through using the false protein , though one Chinese newspaper said it had led to one death .
China Central Television cited an official saying those making the false albumin were making a 300 % profit , assisted by shortages of the genuine product .
The administration said its investigations had " effectively cleaned up the market " .
Series of scandals
China has launched a nationwide clampdown on counterfeit products after a series of scandals .
In one of the worst cases 13 babies died from malnutrition after being fed fake baby milk .
Last month the country 's top food and drug regulator was sentenced to death for taking bribes to approve medicines not properly tested for safety .
Toothpaste , anti-malarial drugs and pet food have also been found to contain contaminated or fake ingredients .
The US and EU have expressed concern over food and drug imports from China , and have pressed Beijing to improve its oversight .
In a move that has startled a number of major players in the world of porn this week , Google has quietly announced that in Jan 2007 it will be releasing GooglePorn .
Google has started the process by removing a number of the top words used for porn traffic in Google from direct association with porn sites .
The next step in the process is to remove the sites from Google ’s public index altogether and move them to GooglePorn .
The whole purpose for the move is not truly known .
Google will not specifcally comment on whether GooglePorn is a move that will financially benefit the company or whether it is being bought in specifically in response to social pressures .
However , Jonathon Reedy , spokesperson for Google , came out today in a release stating “ we ’re doing this to please a lot of religous and political parties , that ’s true , but it ’s not a reduction in the freedom of people ’s speech ” .
When asked if he could name the religious parties involved , Reedy came back with a stern “ no comment ” .
The shake up has sent shivers down the backbone of so many young entreprenuers using Google as the vehicle to direct punters to their porn sites .
Micheal McManus , owner of the site “ pussygalore.com ” and one of the many to come out against Google ’s move stated today “ What ’s worse is not knowing what Google is going to do next to us .
I rely on Google putting me at the top of the list to direct unsuspecting teenagers to my site .
My advertising revenue model is now shot to bits . ”
“ What ’s even worse is the amount of money that Google want to charge us to list on GooglePorn .
We do n’t even have any idea of what we are going to be charged and whether we will be able to continue offering our low prices of $ 3.95 per 3 day access for teenagers anymore .
It ’s just unethical and anti-competitive . ”
“ Our low cost of entry allows so many teenagers to access quality porn online away from their parents in the comfort of their own bedroom .
This is a vital service to society that often goes unnoticed that is now in jeopardy due to Google ’s greed .
It ’s a real shame . ” MacManus added .
This has also bought out a number of queries to see if any other search engines are going to be doing the same .
On the back of Google ’s release , AltaVista has come into the marketplace with its own site for release , AV4U , to be released Q2 , 2007 .
A spokesperson for the free porn industry , who did n’t want to be named , responded by stating “ the whole world of the free porn industry is in jeopardy now .
We rely on the ability to freely go out and purge porn from sites on Google in order to give this back to our very strong teenage readership .
What are we going to do now ? ”
Lisp : побеждая посредственност ь
Летом 1995 года мой друг Роберт Моррис и я основали компанию под названием Viaweb .
Наш план заключался в разработке программного обеспечения , которое позволило бы пользователю создавать свой онлайновый магазин .
Новизна этого софта на тот момент заключалась в том , что он работал на сервере , используя web - страницы как интерфейс .
У многих в то время была та же идея , но , насколько я знаю , Viaweb была первым web - приложением .
Идея показалась нам настолько новой , что название для компании мы придумали так , чтобы оно отражало ее суть — Viaweb ( " Через web " ) , подчеркивало , что программа работает в
Сети , а не на локальном компьютере .
Другая особенность нашего софта заключалась в том , что он был написан на языке программирования Lisp .
Viaweb вначале состоял из двух частей : редактора , написанного на Lisp'е , который использовался для построения сайтов , и системы обработки заказов , написанной на C. Большую часть первой версии составля л
Lisp , так как система обработки заказов была маленькая .
Позже мы добавили еще два модуля , генератор изображений на C , и программу для администрирования , написанную большей частью на Perl'е .
Это была одна из первых больших пользовательских программ на Lisp , который прежде использовался в основном в университетах и исследовательских лабораториях .
Lisp дал нам большое преимущество перед нашими конкурентами , которые применяли менее мощные языки .
cекретное оружи е
Эрик Реймонд ( Eric Raymond ) написал стать ю
" Как стать хакером " , и в ней , помимо других вещей , он советует будущим хакерам , какие языки они должны выучить .
Для начал а Реймонд предлагает начать с Python и Java , так как они просты для изучения .
Серьезный хакер также выучи т С для того , чтобы покопаться в глубина х
Unix , и Perl для системного администрирования системы и создания cgi-скриптов .
В конце концов , истинный хакер должен подумать об изучени и
Lisp'а : Lisp стоит выучить ради того глубокого прозрения , которое вы приобретете в результате ; этот опыт сделает вас лучше как программиста до конца ваших дней , даже если сам Lisp вы практически не будете использовать .
Это тот же аргумент , который мы постоянно слышим в пользу изучения латыни .
Вас не возьмут на работу благодаря лишь ее знанию , разве что преподавателем классической литературы , но это натренирует ваш ум , и вы станете лучше писать на тех языках , которые вы хотите использовать , например , на английском .
Однако , секундочку .
А ведь эта метафора не распространяется так далеко .
Причина , по которой вы не получите работу с латынью , заключается в том , что на ней никто не говорит .
Если вы будете писать на латыни , вас никто не поймет .
Но Lisp — это компьютерный язык , а компьютер говорит на том языке , на котором вы , программист , прикажете ему говорить .
Значит , если Lisp , по слова м Реймонда , сделает вас лучше как программиста , почему бы его не использовать ?
Мне кажется , что если бы художнику предложили кисть , которая позволила бы ему стать еще более хорошим художником , разве не захотел бы он пользоваться ею при написании всех картин , не правда ли ?
Я не пытаюсь высмеять Эрика Реймонда .
В целом , его совет хорош .
То , что он говорит о Lisp'е , — общепринятое мнение : Lisp усовершенствует ваши профессиональные качества , но тем не менее вы не станете его использовать .
Но почему нет ?
Языки программирования — это , в конце концов , просто инструменты .
И если Lisp способствует написанию лучших программ , то следует его использовать .
Ну а если нет , то кому он тогда нужен ?
Это не только теоретический вопрос .
Программное обеспечение — бизнес с жесткой конкуренцией , бизнес , склонный к естественным монополиям .
Компания , в которой пишут софт быстрее и лучше , при прочих равных условиях вытеснит конкурентов .
Когда вы основываете компанию , то особенно остро ощущаете это .
Либо вы разбогатеете , либо не получите ничего .
Если в вашем начинании вы поставите не на ту технологию , ваши конкуренты не оставят от вас и мокрого места .
Мы с Робертом оба хорошо знал и Lisp , и у нас не было причин не доверять своим инстинктам и не воспользоваться им .
Мы знали , что все остальные пишут на C++ или Perl .
Но мы также знали , что это ничего не значит .
Если выбирать технологию по тому же принципу , то операционной системой была бы Windows .
При выборе технологии нужно обращать внимание не на то , что делают остальные , нужно выбирать то , что будет лучше работать .
Это особенно важно для компании - новичка .
В большой компании можно делать то же , что делают другие большие компании .
Но начинающая компания не может себе позволить повторять действия других таких же новичков .
Я думаю , что немногие понимают это , даже среди тех , кто открывают новый бизнес .
Средняя компания большого уровня растет примерно на 10 процентов в год , так что если вы управляете такой компанией и поступаете так , как поступает средний руководитель этого сектора , то можете ожидать такого же прироста — примерно 10 процентов в год .
Конечно , то же самое справедливо и для новых компаний — если вы поступаете так , как поступает средняя компания , следует ожидать среднего результата .
Проблема в том , что со средним уровнем отдачи на начальном этапе вы вылетите из бизнеса .
Уровень выживаемости среди новых компаний меньше 50 процентов .
Так что если вы основали новое дело , лучше делать что - то необычное .
Иначе вы в беде .
В 1995 году мы знали то , что , как мне кажется , наши конкуренты не понимали , а многие не понимают даже сейчас : если вы создаете программное обеспечение , которое будет работать на сервере , вы вольны использовать любой язык , который хотите .
В деле создания программ для десктопа присутствует тенденция разрабатывать программы на языке операционной системы .
Десять лет тому назад " писать программы " значило " писать на С " .
Но для веб - приложений вы вольны выбирать тот язык , который хотите , особенно если у вас есть исходный код языка и операционной системы .
Однако эта новая свобода — палка о двух концах .
Теперь , когда вы можете использовать любой язык , нужно думать о том , какой же язык выбрать .
Компании , которые делают вид , что ничего не изменилось , рискуют обнаружить , что их соперники так не считают .
Если можно использовать любой язык , какой выбрать ?
Мы выбрали Lisp .
Было ясно , что быстрая разработка важна на этом рынке .
Все мы начинали с нуля , поэтому компания , которая добавляет новую функциональность быстрее других , будет иметь серьезное преимущество .
Мы знали , что Lisp — действительно очень хороший язык для быстрого создания программ , а серверные приложения еще сильнее увеличивают эффект быстрой разработки , потому что можно использовать программу через минуту после того , как она написана .
Если другие компании не хотели использоват ь
Lisp , это было лишь преимуществом для нас .
Lisp мог дать нам технологическое превосходство — а нам было важно любое доступное подспорье .
Когда мы основал и Viaweb , у нас не было опыта в бизнесе .
Мы ничего не знали о маркетинге , о том , как нанимать людей , как зарабатывать деньги или привлекать клиентов .
Ни у кого из нас не было прежде того , что можно назвать настоящей работой .
Единственное , что мы умели — это писать программы .
Мы надеялись , что это нас выручит .
Мы были готовы воспользоваться любой возможностью получить преимущество в софтверном бизнесе .
Использование Lisp 'а можно было назвать экспериментом .
Гипотеза заключалась в том , что если мы будем писать на Lisp'е , мы сможем расширять функциональность быстрее конкурентов , и наш продукт будет способен на трюки , недоступные им .
А так как Lisp — язык очень высокого уровня , то нам не будет нужна большая команда разработчиков — соответственно и затраты будут ниже .
В этом случае мы сможем предложить лучший продукт за меньшие деньги , и при этом получить прибыль .
При оптимальном развитии событий мы должны были привлечь всех клиентов , не оставив никого конкурентам , которым пришлось бы в конце концов уйти из бизнеса .
По крайней мере , мы надеялись , что так произойдет .
Каковы же были результаты эксперимента ?
К удивлению , наша гипотеза себя оправдала .
Со временем у нас было много конкурентов , порядка двадцати — тридцати , но ни у одного из них не было продукта , способного соперничать с нашим .
У нас была WYSIWYG - программа для создания онлайновых магазинов , которая работала на сервере , и тем не менее , выглядела как обычное приложение .
У наших соперников были CGI скрипты .
Мы всегда были впереди конкурентов по функциональности .
Иногда , в порыве отчаяния , они пытались добавить новую функцию , которой не было у нас .
Однако с Lisp 'ом наш цикл разработки был настолько коротким , что мы могли воспроизвести аналогичную возможность в течение дня или двух после того , как конкурент объявлял о ней в пресс - релизе .
К тому моменту , когда журналисты , занимающиеся пресс - релизом , звонили нам , у нас было все то же самое .
Должно быть , нашим конкурентам казалось , что мы владели неким секретным оружием , например перехватывали их закрытую переписку или что -то в этом роде .
На самом деле у нас было секретное оружие , но гораздо более простое , чем могло показаться .
Не было никакой утечки информации .
Просто мы могли разрабатывать наш продукт быстрее , чем это казалось возможным .
Когда мне было девять , мне в руки попала книг а Фредерика Форсайта , " День Шакала " .
Главный герой книги — киллер , которого наняли для того , чтобы убить президента Франции .
Убийце нужно было пробраться мимо полиции , чтобы попасть в квартиру , откуда открывается вид на дорогу , по которой проходит маршрут президента .
Киллер прошел мимо полиции на костылях , одетый стариком , и его никто не заподозрил .
Это напоминает наше " секретное оружие " .
Мы писали наш продукт на причудливом языке со странным синтаксисом , полным скобок , на языке , популярном в сфере Искусственного Интеллекта .
Годами такое определени е Lisp 'а вызывало у меня раздражение .
Но теперь это работало в нашу пользу .
В бизнесе нет ничего более ценного , чем техническое преимущество , которого не понимают ваши конкуренты .
В бизнесе , как и на войне , сюрприз стоит столько же , сколько сила .
Я слегка смущен , но признаюсь , что никогда открыто не говорил о
Lisp'е в то время , когда мы работали над Viaweb .
Мы никогда не упоминали его в прессе , и если бы вы искали след ы
Lisp 'а на нашем сайте , все , что вы бы нашли , это названия двух моих книг и мою биографию .
И это не случайность .
Начинающая компания должна давать своим конкурентам настолько мало информации , насколько это возможно .
И если они не знали , на каком языке был написан наш софт , или им было все равно , я предпочел оставить все как есть .
Роберт Моррис говорит , что мне не нужно было скрытничать , потому что даже если бы наши конкуренты узнали , что мы используе м
Lisp , они бы не поняли , почему : " Если бы они были настолько умными , чтобы понять это , они бы уже писали на Lisp'е . "
Лучше всего понимали нашу технологию наши клиенты .
Им было все равно , на каком языке был написана наша программа , но они отметили , что работает он на самом деле хорошо .
Программа Viaweb позволяла им создавать замечательно выглядящие интернет - магазины буквально за минуты .
Таким образом , у нас появлялось все больше пользователей , в основном за счет распространения личного мнения наших клиентов .
К концу 1996 у нас было примерно 70 онлайновых магазинов .
К концу 1996 их было 500 .
Шесть месяцев спустя , когда нас приобре л
Yahoo , у нас было 1070 пользователей .
Сегодня , под именем Yahoo Store , этот продукт продолжает господствовать на своем рынке .
Это одна из наиболее прибыльных часте й
Yahoo , и магазины , построенные с его помощью , — это основа Yahoo Shopping .
Я покинул Yahoo в 1999 , и поэтому не знаю точно , сколько у них пользователей сейчас , но последние цифры , которые я слышал , — это около 14 тысяч пользователей .
Люди спрашивают меня , используется ли Lisp сейчас в Yahoo Store .
Да , весь Lisp код все еще там .
В Yahoo на серверах работает софт , написанный на всех пяти языках , которые советует хакерам Эрик Реймонд .
Парадокс Блаба
Что же в Lisp 'е такого прекрасного ?
Если он такой замечательный , почему его не используют все ?
Казалось бы , риторические вопросы , но на самом деле на них есть прямые ответы .
Lisp настолько хорош не тем , что в нем есть некое волшебное качество , видимое только его приверженцам , а тем , что он — самый мощный язык программирования из существующих .
И причина того , что все вокруг пишут не на Lisp'е , заключается в том , что выбор языка программирования — вопрос не только технологии , но также и привычки , а ничто не меняется так медленно , как привычки .
Конечно , оба эти тезиса требуют разъяснений .
Я начну с шокирующего утверждения : языки программирования отличаются друг от друга своей мощностью .
По крайней мере мало кто будет спорить , что высокоуровневые языки более мощные , чем машинный язык .
Большинство программистов согласятся , что , как правило , программировать стоит не на машинном языке , а на каком - нибудь языке высокого уровня , переводя программу в машинный код с помощью компилятора .
Сейчас эта идея получила даже аппаратное воплощение — с восьмидесятых годов команды процессоров разрабатываются скорее для компиляторов , чем для программистов .
Каждый знает , что писать всю программу вручную на машинном языке — ошибочно .
Но гораздо реже понимают то , что существует и более общий принцип : при наличии выбора из нескольких языков ошибочно программировать на чем -то , кроме самого мощного , если на выбор не влияют другие причины .
Все языки одинаково мощные , если рассматривать их с точки зрения эквивалентности машин е
Тьюринга , но это не та мощь , которая важна программисту .
( Никто ведь не хотел бы программировать машину Тьюринга ) .
Мощь языка , в которой заинтересован программист , возможно , трудно определить формальными методами , однако одно из объяснений этого понятия заключается в свойствах , которые в менее мощном языке можно получить , только написав на нем интерпретатор для более мощного языка .
Если в язык е
A есть оператор для удаления пробелов из строк , а в язык е B его нет , это не делае т
A более мощным , чем B , так как в B можно написать процедуру , которая делала бы это .
Но , скажем , если язык A поддерживает рекурсию , а B — нет , это нечто , что нельзя исправить написанием библиотечных функций .
Есть много исключений из этого правила .
Если вы пишете программу , которая должна тесно взаимодействовать с программой , написанной на определенном языке , возможно , окажется разумным писать новую программу на том же языке .
Если вы пишете программу , которая должна делать что - то очень простое , вроде численной обработки больших массивов данных или манипуляций с битами , можно использовать язык не самого высокого уровня абстракции , тем более что программа будет слегка быстрее .
Если вы пишете короткую программу , которую используете один раз и выбросите прочь , возможно , следует использовать тот язык , который имеет лучшие библиотечные функции для данной задачи .
Но в целом для программного обеспечения нужно использовать самый мощный ( и приемлемо эффективный ) язык из всех доступных .
Отличный от этого выбор — это ошибка такого же рода , как упор на программирование в машинных кодах , хотя и с меньшими негативными последствиями .
Понятно , что уровень машинного языка очень низок .
А высокоуровневые языки часто рассматриваются как одинаковые , по - крайней мере , так принято считать .
Но это не так .
Технический термин " язык программирования высокого уровня " не обозначает ничего определенного .
Не существует четкой границы между множеством " машинных " языков с одной стороны , и множеством " высокоуровневых " с другой .
Языки распределены в континууме ( возможно , не просто континуум , а некая структура , уменьшающяяся кверху ;
важна здесь не форма , а сама идея о том , что существует по крайней мере частичный порядок ) абстрактности , начиная от самых мощных " языков высокого уровн я " вниз к " машинным языкам " , которые , в свою очередь , тоже отличаются друг от друга по мощности .
Возьмем Cobol .
Cobol — язык высокого уровня , так как компилируется в машинный язык .
Но станет ли кто -нибудь утверждать , что по мощност и Cobol эквивалентен , скажем , Python'у ?
Возможно , он ближе к машинному языку , чем Python .
А как насче т Perl четвертой версии ?
В Perl 5 в язык были добавлены лексические замыкания ( lexical closures ) .
Большинств о Perl хакеров согласятся , что Perl 5 мощнее , чем Perl 4 .
Но раз вы это признали , вы признали , что один высокоуровневый язык может быть мощнее другого .
Из этого неизбежно следует , что использовать нужно самый мощный язык .
Впрочем , из этого утверждения редко делается вывод .
Программисты старше определенного возраста редко меняют язык по своей воле .
Они будут считать достаточно хорошим тот язык , к которому привыкли .
Программисты очень привязываются к своим любимым языкам , а я не хочу оскорбить ничьи чувства , поэтому я объясню свою позицию , используя гипотетический язык с название м Блаб .
Блаб попадает в середину континуума абстрактности .
Это не самый мощный язык , но он мощнее , чем Cobol или машинный язык .
И на самом деле , наш гипотетический программист на Блабе не будет использовать ни Cobol , ни машинный код .
Для машинных кодов есть компиляторы .
Что же касаетс я Cobol 'а , наш программист не знает , как на этом языке вообще что - то можно сделать .
В Cobol 'е даже нет некой возможности X , присутствующей в Блабе .
Когда наш гипотетически й
Блаб - программист смотрит вниз на континуум мощности языков , он знает , что смотрит вниз .
Менее мощные , чем Блаб , языки явно менее мощны , так как в них нет некой особенности , к которой привык программист .
Но когда он смотрит в другом направлении , вверх , он не осознает , что смотрит вверх .
То , что он видит , — это просто " странные " языки .
Возможно , он считает их одинаковыми с
Блабом по мощности , но со всяческими сложными штучками .
Блаба для нашего программиста вполне достаточно , так как он думает на Блабе .
Когда мы поменяем точку обзора программиста , используя любой язык программирования выше по континууму мощности , мы обнаружим , что теперь программист смотрит на Блаб сверху вниз .
" Как же можно что - то сделать , использу я Блаб ?
В нем отсутствует даже конструкция Y ! "
Используя метод индукции , приходишь к выводу , что только те программисты , которые понимают самый мощный язык , в состоянии осознать полную картину разницы в мощности между различными языками ( видимо , именно это имел ввид у
Эрик Реймонд , когда говорил о том , что Lisp сделает вас лучше как программиста ) .
Следуя парадокс у Блаба , нельзя доверять мнению других : другие программисты довольны тем языком , который используют , потому что этот язык определяет способ их программистского мышления .
Я знаю это из своего опыта , когда учился в старших классах школы и писал программы на Бейсике .
Этот язык не поддерживал даже рекурсию .
Трудно представить написание программ без рекурсии , но в то время мне это не нужно было .
Я думал на Бейсике .
Я был спец .
Мастер всего , что изучил .
Пять языков , которые советует хакера м Эрик Реймонд , находятся в разных точках континуума мощности , и то , где они находятся относительно друг друга , — тонкий вопрос .
Я скажу , что Lisp находится на вершине континуума .
И чтобы поддержать это утверждение , я скажу о том , чего мне не хватает , когда я смотрю на остальные пять языков .
Как же можно что - то сделать с ними , думаю я , без свойств а Z ? И самое большое Z — это макросы .
( Рассматривать макросы как отдельное свойство — это немного неправильно .
На практике их польза увеличивается такими свойствам и
Lisp'а , как лексические замыкания и частичная параметризация ( rest parameters ) .
Во многих языках есть что -то , называющееся макросом .
Но макросы в Lisp 'е уникальны .
То , что делают макросы имеет отношение , верите вы или нет , к скобкам .
Создатели Lisp 'а добавили все эти скобки в язык не для того , чтобы отличаться от других .
Скобки в Lisp 'е имеют особый смысл , они — внешнее свидетельство фундаментальной разницы межд у
Lisp 'ом и другими языками .
Программа на Lisp 'е состоит из данных .
И не в том тривиальном значении , что исходные файлы содержат символы , а строки — один из типов данных , поддерживаемых языком .
После прочтения программы парсеро м
Lisp код состоит из готового к использованию дерева структур данных .
Дело не в том , что в Lisp 'е странный синтаксис , скорее , его нет вообще .
Программы пишутся в готовых синтаксических деревьях , которые в других языках генерируются парсером во время разбора исходного текста .
Эти синтаксические деревья в
Lisp 'е полностью доступны вашим программам , и вы можете писать программы , которые изменяют эти деревья .
В Lisp 'е подобные программы называются макросы .
Это программы , которые пишут программы .
Программы , которые пишут программы ?
И когда же такое может понадобиться ?
Не очень часто , если вы думаете на Cobol 'е .
И постоянно , если вы думаете на Lisp'е .
Было бы удобно , если бы я дал пример мощного макроса и сказал бы : " Вот! Смотрите ! " .
Но если бы я и привел пример , для того , кто не знае т
Lisp , он выглядел бы не более чем белиберда .
Рамки данной статьи не позволяют изложить все необходимое для понимания подобного примера .
В книге Ansi Common Lisp я старался излагать материал как можно быстрее , но даже так я не добрался до макросов раньше страницы 160 .
Однако мне кажется , что я могу дать убедительный аргумент .
Исходный текст редактора Viaweb на 20 - 25 процентов состоял из макросов .
Макросы сложнее писать , чем обычные функци и
Lisp'а , и считается дурным тоном использовать их там , где можно без них обойтись .
Поэтому каждый макрос в той программе был необходим .
Это значит , что примерно 20 - 25 процентов кода в программе делают то , что нельзя просто сделать на других языках .
Как бы скептически ни относилс я
Блаб - программист к моим заявлениям о таинственной мощи Lisp'а , это должно его заинтересовать .
Мы не писали этот код для своего собственного развлечения .
Мы были маленькой компанией , и программировали так , как только могли , чтобы возвести технологический барьер между нами и нашими конкурентами .
Пытливый читатель может задаться вопросом , а нет ли здесь взаимосвязи ?
Некоторая большая часть кода делала нечто , что очень сложно сделать на других языках .
Получившееся в результате программное обеспечение делало то , что программное обеспечение наших соперников делать не могло .
Возможно , между этими фактами есть связь .
Я советую вам подумать в этом направлении .
Возможно , это все не просто старческие бредни .
Айкидо для начинающих компани й
Однако я не думаю , что смогу убедить кого - нибудь ( старше 25 ) выучит ь Lisp .
Цель этой статьи — не изменить чье - то решение , а вдохновить тех , кто уже заинтересован в использовании Lisp'а — тех , кто знает , что Lisp — это мощный язык , но беспокоятся из - за того , что Lisp мало используется .
В случае конкуренции это преимущество .
Мощь Lisp 'а умножается тем фактом , что ваши конкуренты этого не понимают .
Если вы раздумываете над использование м
Lisp'а в новом бизнесе , не стоит беспокоиться о том , что большинство не понимает этот язык .
Вам нужно надеяться на то , что так все и останется .
А так оно скорее всего и будет .
Большинство довольны тем , что они используют — это природа языков программирования .
Компьютерное железо изменяется настолько быстрее личных привычек , что практика программирования обычно отстает от процессора на десять — двадцать лет .
В таких местах как MIT писали на высокоуровневых языках уже в начале 60 -х , но многие компании продолжали писать на машинных кодах вплоть до 80 -х .
Бьюсь об заклад , что многие продолжали писать на машинных кодах до тех пор , пока процессор , словно бармен , собирающийся закрыть бар и пойти домой , не выдворил их прочь , переключившись на набор команд RISC .
Обычно технология меняется быстро .
Однако с языками программирования все по -другому — они не просто технология , они воплощают собой способ мышления программистов .
Это наполовину технология , наполовину религия .
В результате сравнения языков программирования принимают форму либо религиозных войн , либо университетских учебников , настолько нейтральных , что они похожи на труды по антропологии .
Те , кто желают спокойствия , избегают столь острой темы .
Однако вопрос религиозен лишь наполовину , этот вопрос изучить не помешает , особенно если вы собираетесь создавать новый язык программирования .
Средний язык — это язык , которым пользуется средний программист .
Движется он медленно , как айсберг .
" Сборка мусора " ( Garbage Collection ) , впервые введенная в употребление в
Lisp 'е примерно в 1960 году , сейчас повсеместно признается хорошей штукой .
Динамическая типизация также становится все более популярной .
Лексические замыкания , введенные в употреблени е Lisp 'ом в начале семидесятых , сейчас едва видны на экране радара .
Макросы , появившиеся в Lisp'е в середине шестидесятых , до сих пор — терра инкогнита .
Очевидно , что средний язык обладает мощной инерцией .
Я не предлага ю
вам сопротивляться этой силе .
Я предлагаю совершенно обратное — подобно практикующему айкидо , воспользоваться этой силой против своих противников .
Если вы работаете в большой компании , это может быть не так просто .
Вам будет трудно убедить своего косного босса позволить вам программировать на Lisp'е , особенно если тот только что прочитал в газете о каком - то языке , который , как и
Ада двадцать лет тому назад , готов завоевать мир .
Но если вы работаете в начинающей компании , в которой еще нет такого босса , вы можете , как это сделали мы , извлечь выгоду из парадокс а
Блаба : использовать технологию , которой ваши конкуренты , неотрывно привязанные к своему среднему языку , не смогут ничего противопоставить .
Если уж довелось работать в начинающей компании , есть неплохая подсказка , как оценивать конкурентов .
Прочитайте список их вакансий .
Все другое на их сайте может быть сплошным сочинительством , и лишь описания требуемых специалистов должны быть точными , иначе они наймут не того кандидата , что им нужен .
За те годы , что я проработал в Viaweb , я прочитал множество объявлений о найме на работу .
Примерно каждый месяц появлялся новый конкурент .
Первое , что я делал после того , как проверял , доступна ли онлайновая демонстрация работы их программы , — смотрел список их вакансий .
Через пару лет я научился отличать опасных конкурентов от неопасных .
Чем больше отдавало IT - мэйнстримом от описания требуемых кандидатур , тем менее опасна была компания .
Самыми безопасными были те , кому требовались специалисты по Oracle .
О таких не стоило беспокоиться .
Также мы были спокойны , если требовались разработчики на C++ или Java .
Если требовались программисты на Perl или Python , это уже было слегка пугающе — это значило , что компанией или , по крайней мере , ее технической частью заправляли настоящие хакеры .
Если бы я когда - нибудь увидел объявление о найме на работ у
Lisp - хакеров , я бы обеспокоился не на шутку .

Droves of cats and kittens are swarming into animal shelters nationwide , and global warming is to blame , according to one pet adoption group .
Several shelters operated by a national adoption organization called Pets Across America reported a 30 percent increase in intakes of cats and kittens from 2005 to 2006 , and other shelters across the nation have reported similar spikes of stray , owned and feral cats .
The cause of this feline flood is an extended cat breeding season thanks to the world ’s warming temperatures , according to the group , which is one of the country ’s oldest and largest animal welfare organizations .
“ Cats are typically warm - weather , spring - time breeders , ” said the group ’s president , Kathy Warnick .
“ However , states that typically experience primarily longer and colder winters are now seeing shorter , warmer winters , leading to year - round breeding . ”
“ Basically , there is no longer a reproduction lull with cat breeding cycles , and unfortunately , it seems more people are bringing boxes of kittens into our agencies during winter now , ” she added .
Studies have shown that global warming is altering the breeding seasons of other animals , such as migratory birds and penguins .
One possible solution to stem the tide of cats is to make sure pets are spayed or neutered .
“ We have long discussed the benefits of spaying and neutering cats , ” said Pets Across America Vice President Bob Rhode .
“ It is likely that global warming is probably not going to be slowing any time soon , therefore , it benefits everyone when pet owners take action and spay and neuter their pets . ”
Every large organization loses laptops , but when those laptops contain the personal tax information of millions of Americans , it 's a big deal .
Big enough that the Treasury Department 's Inspector General for Tax Administration looked into the problem , and released a report on the Internal Revenue Service 's penchant for losing machines filled with unencrypted tax data .
" As a result , " writes the report 's author , Michael Phillips , " it is likely that sensitive data for a significant number of taxpayers have been unnecessarily exposed to potential identity theft and / or other fraudulent schemes . "
How bad is the situation ?
When inspectors looked into the matter , they found that 490 laptops had been reported stolen between January 2 , 2003 and June 13 , 2006 .
Unfortunately , because reporting procedures for stolen laptops were often not followed , there is n't a real way to know whether this number is accurate .
490 laptops sounds like a lot , but the IRS currently has more than 47,000 in operation , and has no doubt used many more than that over the last few years .
The report does not suggest that the agency try to cut losses to zero , but instead that it take better precautions .
When thefts do occur , taxpayer data should be protected .
Instead , inspectors found that " a large number of the lost or stolen IRS computers contain similar unencrypted data , " and that employees routinely used flash drives , CDs , and DVDs to cart unencrypted data around with them .
The report also points out that physical security is important .
111 laptops were stolen right out of IRS facilities ; if these were stored in lockable cabinets while employees were out , theft could be reduced significantly .
Many of the remaining laptops were stolen out of vehicles or employee homes , suggesting that " employees may not have secured their laptop computers in the trunks of their vehicles or locked their laptop computers at home . "
The problems even extended to off - site data backups , where backup media were often unsealed and open to anyone in the building .
In one case , " one employee who retired in March 2006 had full access rights to the non-IRS off - site facility when we visited in July 2006 . "
IRS management has agreed with the findings of the Inspector General and has pledged to implement the report 's recommendations .
The report does note , however , that the IRS was warned about unencrypted data back in 2003 but did not take " adequate corrective actions . "
Here 's hoping that more is done this time around .
Actually paying my taxes is painful enough ; having my identity stolen because of it would be rage - inducing .
Django status update : June 26
Hello everyone , and welcome back to our regularly - scheduled Django Status Reports .
In the past , members of the development team took time out of their week to post these tidbits and as their schedules have become more hectic with Django itself , their day jobs , a book , and side projects , they 've been unable to contribute as much as they 'd like .
Many people , myself included , felt that these posts added a lot of value to the Django community , so I offered up my services and here we are !
That 's enough rambling — I 'll get on with our updates for roughly the past 90 days or so :
Beyond the major news above , activity in the trunk this week was low .
The changeset round up for this status report includes : [ 5516 ] —
A patch committed by Malcolm Tredinnick that speeds up reverse URL matching by caching their results based on a patch by smoo.master@gmail.com .
A minor note , this change is potentially backward incompatible , but should n’t cause any major issues . [ 5478 ] —
The Django - gis branch , GeoDjango , received several GDAL related improvements . [ 5502 ] — Stefane Femgier submitted a patch that correctly sets the mime - type for admin media content , and was integrated into the trunk this week .
That 's it for now , and please be aware that the next one of these should be significantly shorter .
If you have any interesting Django - related news , projects , or announcements that you 'd like to see here , please send a short note to clintecker@gmail.com .
A Qatar sheikh held up a British Airways flight at Milan 's Linate airport for nearly three hours after discovering three of his female relatives had been seated next to men they did not know .
When none of the other business class passengers agreed to swap seats , the sheikh , a member of Qatar 's ruling family , went to the pilot , who had already started the engine , to complain , an airport official said .
The pilot ordered him and his travelling companions , the three women , two men , a cook and a servant , off the plane .
The London - bound flight took off nearly three hours behind schedule last night and around 50 of the 115 passengers missed connecting flights .
Traditions in the conservative Gulf Arab region bar women from mixing with unrelated men .
Is there something new that open source development methods and values can bring to the economy ?
How about something old ?
I think the answer may come from the developing world , where pre-industrial methods and values persist and offer some helpful models and lessons for a networked world that 's less post - industrial than industrial in a new and less impersonal way .
This began to become apparent to me a few years ago I had a Socratic exchange with a Nigerian pastor named Sayo , whom I was lucky to find sitting next to me on a long airplane trip .
We were both on speaking junkets .
He was coming from an event related to his latest work : translating the Bible to Yoruba , one of the eight languages he spoke .
I was on my way to give a talk about The Cluetrain Manifesto , a book I co-authored .
My main contribution to Cluetrain was a chapter called " Markets are conversations " .
Sayo asked me what we meant by that .
After hearing my answer , he acknowledged that our observations were astute , but also incomplete .
Something more was going on in markets than just transactions and conversations , he said .
What was it ?
I said I did n't know .
Here is the dialogue that followed , as close to verbatim as I can recall it ...
" Pretend this is a garment " , Sayo said , picking up one of those blue airplane pillows .
" Let 's say you see it for sale in a public market in my country , and you are interested in buying it .
What is your first question to the seller ? "
" What does it cost ? " I said .
" Yes " , he answered .
" You would ask that .
Let 's say he says , ' Fifty dollars ' .
What happens next ? "
" If I want the garment , I bargain with him until we reach an agreeable price . "
" Good .
Now let 's say you know something about textiles .
And the two of you get into a long conversation where both of you learn much from each other .
You learn about the origin of the garment , the yarn used , the dyes , the name of the artist , and so on .
He learns about how fabric is made in your country , how distribution works , and so on .
In the course of this you get to know each other .
What happens to the price ? "
" Maybe I want to pay him more and he wants to charge me less " .
" Yes .
And why is that ? "
" I 'm not sure . "
" You now have a relationship " .
He went on to point out that , in his country , and in much of what we call the developing world , relationship is of paramount importance in public markets .
Transaction still matters , of course .
So does conversation .
But the biggest wedge in the social pie of the public marketplace is relationship .
Prices less set than found , and the context for finding prices is both conversation and relationship .
In many cases , relationship is the primary concern , not price .
The bottom line is not everything .
Transaction rules the Industrialized world .
Here prices are set by those who control the manufacturing , distribution and retail systems .
Customers do have an influence on prices , but only in the form of aggregate demand .
The rates at which they buy or do n't buy something determines what price the " market " will bear  in a system where " market " means aggregated demand , manifested in prices paid and quantities sold .
Here the whole economic system is viewed mostly through the prism of price , which is seen as the outcome of tug between supply and demand .
Price still matters in the developing world , Sayo said , but relationship matters more .
It 's a higher context with a higher set of values , many of which are trivialized or made invisible when viewed through the prism of price .
Relationship is not reducible to price , even though it may influence price .
Families and friends do n't put prices on their relationships .
( At least not consciously , and only at the risk of cheapening or losing a relationship . )
Love , the most giving force in any relationship , is not about exchanging .
It is not fungible .
You do n't expect a payback or a rate of return on the love you give your child , your wife or husband , your friends .
Even in the industrialized world , relationship has an enormous bearing on the way markets work , Sayo said .
But it is poorly understood in the developed world , where so much " comes down to the bottom line " .
I shared this conversation a few weeks later with Eric S. Raymond , who put the matter even more simply .
" All markets work at three levels " , he said .
" Transactions , conversations and relationships " .
Eric is an atheist .
Sayo is a Christian .
With those two triangulating so similarly on the same subject , I began to figure there was something more to this relationship business .
I began to ask questions .
For example , What happens when you view markets through the prism of relationship ?
Why do we write free or open source code ?
Linus says ( in the title of his only book ) he does it " Just for Fun " .
Yes , there are practical purposes  there have to be .
Scratching itches , for example .
Development communities are notoriously long on conversation ( check out the LKML for starters ) , and on relationship as well .
Not a whole lot of transaction there , either , since the code is free .
Next question :
Are there economies involved ?
I think the answer is yes , and they are concentrated on the manufacturing end .
We make useful code for its " because effects " .
Thanks to Linux , much money will be made ; but because of it , far more than with it .
Just look at Google and Amazon as two obvious examples .
Perhaps a billion of the world 's Websites are Apache on Linux .
Relationship is involved here , too .
Writing code that serves as abundant and free building material is an act of generosity .
Dare we say we do it for love ?
Certainly a lot of us love doing it .
Likewise with performing artists .
Musicians do n't take up an instrument and develop their skills just to make money at it .
They do it for love of the experience , of playing together with other musicians , of giving something to an audience , and to the world .
Of course , professionals like to get paid for their work too .
That 's what makes them professionals .
What if the goods are essentially free ( as in beer , air or love ) ?
That 's the case with code , music , art , and anything else that can be digitized and copied .
Many artists want or need to be paid for what they do .
The question is how we get our love to fund theirs -- how we can relate in ways that work financially for both the supply and the demand of essentially free stuff .
The entertainment industry has had an answer ever since the Net showed up .
Hollywood was n't blind to the Net. Quite the opposite .
They correctly saw the Net as a way for every device to be zero distance from every other device -- and to pass identical copies of anything between anybody a cost that rounded to zero .
They saw this a threat to their incumbent business model .
So they came up with a way to deal with that threat : DRM , or Digital Rights Management .
DRM worked by crippling recorded goods so it can't easily be copied except by those whose rights were managed by suppliers .
It has n't worked .
A few days ago Steve Jobs said so himself , in a landmark essay titled Thoughs on Music , published on February 6 .
It not only notes the failure of DRM , but subtly recruits customers and fellow technologists to help Apple convince the record industry that it 's best to sell music that is n't DRM'd .
He concludes , " Convincing them to license their music to Apple and others DRM - free will create a truly interoperable music marketplace .
Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly " .
The operative verb here is " license " .
Let 's ignore the record companies for a minute .
Instead , lets look behind them , back up the supply chain , to the first sources of music : the artists .
Part of the system we need is already built for these sources , through Creative Commons .
By this system , creative sources can choose licenses that specify the freedoms carried by their work , and also specify what can and cannot be done with that work .
These licenses are readable by machines as well as by lawyers .
That 's a great start on the supply side .
Now let 's look at the same work from the demand side .
What can we do -- as music lovers , or as customers -- to find , use , and even pay for , licensed work ?
Some mechanisms are there , but nothing yet that is entirely in our control -- that reciprocates and engages on the demand side what Creative Commons provides on the supply side .
Yes , we can go to websites , subscribe to music services , use iTunes or other supply - controlled intermediating systems and deal with artists inside those systems .
But there still is n't anything that allows us to deal directly , on our own terms , with artists and their intermediaries .
Put another way , we do n't yet have the personal means for establishing relationships with artists .
For example , I relate in some ways to Stewart Copeland , though he does n't know it .
Stewart is best known as the drummer in The Police , even though the band has n't recorded an album since 1983 and Stewart has since then established himself as a first - rank composer of soundtracks , including " Rumble Fish " , " Talk Radio " and " Wall Street " .
IMDb lists him as a composer of scores for sixty - nine movies and TV productions .
You have to hit " page down " six times or more to get to the bottom of the listings .
Still , much as I appreciate Stewart 's compositions , I 've always loved his drumming .
I 'm not a drummer , but I 'm a serviceable percussionist .
( When I pick up bongos , congas , a rub - board or a tambourine , I get approving nods from the real musicians I jam with -- as rarely as the occasion arises . )
When the Police ceased touring and producing albums , I missed Stewart 's drumming most of all .
Last year I got a big charge out of hearing an IT Conversations podcast interview with Stewart , though I was disappointed to hear he does n't drum much anymore .
Then I heard last week on the radio that the Police may be getting back together and touring again .
I can relate to that .
But how ?
Stewart 's website is one of those over - produced flash - filled things that recording an performing artists seem to think they need in order to " deliver an experience " or whatever .
Nearly every internal link leads to a link - proof something - or - other in the same window , among other annoyances .
To call it relationship - proof would be an inderstatement .
So instead let 's look at relating through the IT Conversations podcast .
I say that because yesterday Phil Windley , who runs IT Conversations , posted Funding Public Radio ( and ITC ) with VRM on his blog , and listed some of the things he might be looking for from VRM or Vendor Relationship Management .
That is , from something that lives on the demand side , but can relate on mutually useful terms with the sjupply side  which in his case is IT Conversations .
Here 's the first answer :
It ca n't be limited to a browser .
I want a button , or a something , on my MP3 player that allows me to relate not only to IT Conversations as an intermediary , but to the artist as well -- if the artist is interested .
They may not be .
But I want that function supported .
What we need on the user 's side is a tool , or a set of tools , that support both independence and engagement .
If what we 're looking for does n't exist , how hard will it be to build ?
I 'm sure it wo n't be easy , but it will be less hard than it was before the roster of open source tools and applications grew to six figures , which is where it stands now .
And that 's not counting all the useful standards that are laying around too .
What do we need ?
First , I think we need protocols .
These should be modeled on the social ones we find in free and open marketplaces .
They should work like the ones Sayo talked about in his Socratic dialogue with me on the airplane .
They should be simple , useful and secure .
Second , we need ways of supporting transactions .
This is a tough one , because to work they need to be low - friction .
I should be able to pay IT Conversations ( or any public radio station , or any podcaster ) as easily as I pay for a coffee .
Or better yet , as easily as I tip a barista .
So PayPal wo n't cut it .
( Not the way I 've experienced PayPal , anyway . )
Third , we need ways of selectively and securely asserting our identities , including our choice to remain anonymous .
This means getting past sign - on hurdles on the Web , and past membership silos out in the physical world ( such as the ones that require a special card , or whatever ) .
Again , the friction should be as low as possible .
Fourth , we need ways of expressing demand that will bring supply to us .
Let 's say I want to hear other interviews with Stewart Copeland .
I do n't want to go through the standard Google / Yahoo text search .
I want to tell the marketplace ( in some cases without revealing yet exactly who I am ) that I 'm looking for these interviews , and then have them find me .
Then I want an easy way to pay for them if I feel like it .
As Sayo suggests , I might be more willing to pay something if I can relate to the source , and not just invisibly use goods produced by that source .
In Putting the Wholes Together , which I posted recently at Linux Journal , I said public broadcasting would be a good place to start -- not just because public broadcasting needs to find ways to make more money from more listeners and viewers , but because payment is voluntary .
Seems to me that when payment is voluntary , relationship will drive up the percentage of those who pay .
It 's just a theory , but one that should be fun to test .
Soon as I get the time to put it together , I 'll put out a challenge for developers ( that 's you , if you write code ) to help out on this .
Some developers are already collected at ProjectVRM , which is where we 're organizing the effort .
I 'm meeting with NPR in Washington , D.C. in a couple hours , and again tomorrow .
I 'll bring up the possibility of help from you guys when I talk to them .
And I 'll be in many meetings and talks next week at the IMA Convention in Boston and Beyond Broadcast in Cambridge .
Help is welcome .
Let 's show these folks how much more they can do because they relate .
Let 's obsolete those annoying fund - raising marathons when they shut off programming , plead poverty and give you some schwag if you send money .
There has to be a better way .
Let 's build it .
The vast majority of hijacked computers are Windows PCs
The initiative is part of an ongoing project to thwart the use of hijacked home computers , or zombies , as launch platforms for hi-tech crimes .
The FBI has found networks of zombie computers being used to spread spam , steal IDs and attack websites .
The agency said the zombies or bots were " a growing threat to national security " .
Signs of trouble
The FBI has been trying to tackle networks of zombies for some time as part of an initiative it has dubbed Operation Bot Roast .
This operation recently passed a significant milestone as it racked up more than one million individually identifiable computers known to be part of one bot net or another .
The law enforcement organisation said that part of the operation involved notifying people who owned PCs it knew were part of zombie or bot networks .
In this way it said it expected to find more evidence of how they are being used by criminals .
" The majority of victims are not even aware that their computer has been compromised or their personal information exploited , " said James Finch , assistant director of the FBI 's Cyber Division .
Many people fall victim by opening an attachment on an e-mail message containing a virus or by visiting a booby - trapped webpage .
Many hi-tech criminals are now trying to subvert innocent webpages to act as proxies for their malicious programs .
Many bots are used to send out junk mail or spam
Those in charge of botnets , called botherders , can have tens of thousands of machines under their control .
Operation Bot Roast has resulted in the arrest of three people known to have used bot nets for criminal ends .
One of those arrested , Robert Alan Soloway , could face 65 years in jail if found guilty of all the crimes with which he has been charged .
In a statement about Operation Bot Roast the FBI urged PC users to practice good computer security which includes using regularly updated anti-virus software and installing a firewall .
For those without basic protections anti-virus companies such as F Secure , Trend Micro , Kaspersky Labs and many others offer online scanning services that can help spot infections .
The organisation said it was difficult for people to know if their machine was part of a botnet .
However it said telltale signs could be if the machine ran slowly , had an e-mail outbox full of mail a user did not send or they get e-mail saying they are sending spam .
JOHAN looked up .
Jenna was running toward him .
She had yelled something , he was n’t sure what .
Then he saw it .
The open mouth , the tongue , the teeth , the flattened ears .
Jenna ran right past him , and it struck him -- a flash of fur , two jumps , 400 pounds of lightning .
It was a grizzly , and it had him by his left thigh .
His mind started racing -- to Jenna , to the trip , to fighting , to escaping .
The bear jerked him back and forth like a rag doll , but he remembered no pain , just disbelief .
It bit into him again and again , its jaw like a sharp vise stopping at nothing until teeth hit bone .
Then came the claws , rising like shiny knife blades , long and stark .
Johan and Jenna had been on the trail little more than an hour .
They had just followed a series of switchbacks above Grinnell Lake and were on a narrow ledge cut into a cliff .
It was an easy ascent , rocky and just slightly muddy from yesterday ’s rain .
Johan took some pictures .
Jenna pushed ahead .
It was one of the most spectacular hikes they ’d taken on this trip , a father - daughter getaway to celebrate her graduation from high school .
There were some steps , a small outcropping , a blind turn , and there it was , the worst possibility : a surprised bear with two yearling cubs .
Advertisement
The bear kept pounding into him .
He had to break away .
To his right was the wall of the mountain , to his left a sheer drop .
Slightly behind him , however , and 20 feet below the trail , a thimbleberry and alder patch grew on a small slope jutting from the cliff .
As a boy growing up in Holland , Johan had roughhoused with his brother and had fallen into bushes .
He knew it would hurt , but at least it would n’t kill him .
So like a linebacker hurtling for a tackle , he dived for that thimbleberry patch .
The landing rattled him , but he was OK .
His right eye was bleeding , but he did n’t have time to think about that .
Jenna was now alone with the bear .
She had reached down to pick up the bear spray .
The small red canister had fallen out of the side pocket of his day pack , and there it was , on the ground .
But she could n’t remove the safety clip , and the bear was coming at her again .
She screamed .
“ Jenna , come down here , ” he yelled .
Advertisement
She never heard him .
She was falling , arms and legs striking the rocky cliff , then nothing for seconds before she landed hard .
The bear did hear him , however .
It looked over the cliff and pounced .
Johan had never seen anything move so fast in his life .
He tucked into a fetal position .
The bear fell upon him , clawing and biting at his back .
His day pack protected him , and his mind started racing again .
His daughter did n’t have a pack .
He always carried the water and snacks .
If the bear got to her , it ’d tear her apart .
He turned , swung to his right and let himself go .
Only this time there was n’t a thimbleberry patch to break his fall .
It was a straight drop to where Jenna had landed , and instead of taking the bear away from her , as he had hoped , he was taking the bear to her .

JOHAN
Otter lived with his wife , Marilyn , and their two teenage daughters in a two - story home in a semirural neighborhood of Escondido , Calif .
He worked as an administrator at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla .
He ran in marathons and bred exotic birds .
He knew the love of his family , success at his job , good health .
At 43 , he had dreams of a long and happy life .
But dreams are often upended .
Johan knew this , and whenever possible , he tried to distance himself and his family from risk .
It was Aug. 25 , 2005 .
Seven days earlier , Johan and Jenna had packed up the family pickup truck and driven north through Nevada and Utah .
In September , she would begin her freshman year at UC Irvine .
Hiking was their special bond .
He was a runner , she was a dancer ; they both were in good shape for the trail , and it was n’t unusual for Marilyn and Stephanie , their younger daughter , to stay home .
Johan and Jenna checked into a motor lodge on the east side of Glacier .
Johan was eager to experience the wildness of the park , and the first night he did .
A black bear , just outside the lodge .
For millenniums , bears have lurked on the periphery of everyday life , dark shadows just beyond the firelight .
On this continent , they have been our respected competition and greatest threat .
Even though close encounters with bears , especially grizzlies , are rare , they trigger a conditioned response , a reflex of fear and flight that is seldom called upon in modern life .
Sometimes we get away .
Sometimes we can’t .
Advertisement
But most of all , bears inspire a deep fascination .
Johan remembered how , as a boy , he would go with his family on vacations to Norway and how his parents , his brother and he had always wanted to see a bear .
The curiosity never left him .
Three years ago , during a trip to Canada with the family , he and Stephanie saw a cub .
Marilyn and Jenna stayed back .
On this trip to Glacier , they had an ambitious hiking schedule , and they were disappointed when it rained their first full day .
They contented themselves with driving to various sights .
The next day was beautiful .
The sun cut through scattered , misting clouds .
Johan was eager to get out on the trail before anyone else .
It was 7:30 a.m .
The path wound through a lush carpet of thimbleberry , beargrass and lilies growing beneath a mix of Engelmann spruce and Scotch pine .
They skirted Lake Josephine , and in less than an hour , Johan and Jenna were above the tree line .
Surrounding peaks were lightly dusted with snow .
At one point Johan spotted a golden eagle trying to catch a thermal .
They talked loudly , just as you ’re supposed to do in bear country .
Jenna was trying to figure out how she could be both a dancer and a doctor .
He wondered if he ’d be able to qualify for the Boston Marathon .
As they made their way along the southern flank of Mt. Grinnell , a glacier - carved cliff that rises nearly 3,500 vertical feet from the valley floor , they fell silent , lost in the sounds of the wind and the water , the beauty of the moment .
Ahead of them were the Gem and Salamander glaciers .
A ribbon of water cascaded into the forest below .
A river flowed into the turquoise stillness of Grinnell Lake .
Advertisement
Penstemon , columbines and fireweed bloomed amid the low - lying alder scrub .
They passed through Thunderbird Falls , a landmark on the trail where a stream often pours from the cliff above onto a platform of flat stones .
Today it was only wet and slippery , but the drop - off was unforgiving .
TEN minutes past the falls , they ran into the bear .
In a matter of minutes , they had all tumbled 30 feet down a rocky V - shaped chute , landing on a ledge beneath the trail .
Jenna had scrambled away , and the grizzly was on top of Johan .
The attack had just started , and it had been going on too long .
He grabbed the bear by the fur on its throat .
The feeling of the coarse hair , as on a dirty dog , was unforgettable , and for a moment the animal just stared at him , two amber - brown eyes , its snout straight in his face .
It showed no emotion , no fear , no anger .
There were just those eyes looking down at him .
Johan considered fighting .
He reached to his left for a rock .
A piece of shale , it crumbled in his fist .
He tucked his knees to his chest and tried to cover his head .
Advertisement
The bear bit again and again on his right arm .
So this is what it feels like to have your flesh torn , he thought , still trying to comprehend the attack .
He tussled about , trying to avoid greater injury .
“ Aaagh , ” he screamed .
Now the bear was tugging on his back .
It felt as if someone were jumping up and down on him , and he found himself growing angry .
Throw it off the mountain .
If only he could throw it off the mountain .
He felt a sharp pressure on the top of his neck and his head .
The bear was biting into his skull , chewing into the bone .
This could be it , he thought .
This could be his death , and his right hand was useless .
He could not push the bear away .
Advertisement
If only this were a movie or one of those old episodes of “ Bonanza ” he used to watch on TV .
He ’d be a stuntman , and they ’d stop shooting any time .
But this was real .
He ’d die if he did n’t make another move , so he rolled and fell again , sliding 20 feet down the slope to a small ledge and then over that and onto a narrow shelf .
Right foot , left foot .
He landed on his feet .
He was lucky he stopped .
He would n’t have survived the next long straight drop .
He was silent .
The bear stood above him , unable to reach him .
It felt good to be left alone .
Water flowed down his back .
Cold water .
He ’d fallen into a small stream , runoff from yesterday ’s rain .
Jenna heard the bear panting as it came closer to where she lay beneath the branches of a low - lying alder .
She felt woozy from her fall .
She had a knot on her head .
Her back ached , and her ankle was bleeding .
Advertisement
She tried to stay tucked in , but when the bear got close to her face , she had to push it away .
It nipped at the right corner of her mouth , at her hair , her right shoulder .
Each bite was quick , followed by a slight jostle .
Her screams split the morning silence like an ax .
JOHAN pressed himself against the mountain .
There was no room to sit or lie down .
He heard Jenna , but he could n’t do anything .
He would remember the sound as the worst he had ever heard , and then there was nothing .
All was still .
He was wet and dirty , soaked with blood and starting to shiver .
The attack had lasted at most 15 minutes .
He looked at his right arm and saw exposed tendons .
His medical training as a physical therapist told him no major nerves or arteries had been cut .
They can sew that together , he thought , and that , and that .
Advertisement
Then he touched the top of his head and felt only bone .
He stopped exploring .
It was enough to know that his scalp had been torn off .
His neck hurt .
He wondered if something was broken .
He could n’t see out of his right eye .
He reached up .
It was full of blood and caked over .
Was his eyeball hanging out ?
No , it was still in place .
He carefully parted his eyelids .
The sweet turquoise stillness of Grinnell Lake shimmered nearly 1,500 feet below him .
He could see .
He was relieved .
“ Jenna , ” he eventually called out .
“ Dad . ”
Advertisement
She had played dead , and the bear had moved on .
She assessed her injuries .
A bite on her shoulder as deep as a knuckle .
Lower lip torn down to her chin .
Hair caked with blood .
Her father ’s voice was the best sound she ’d ever heard .
“ Are you OK ? ” he asked .
“ I ’m OK .
How are you ? ”
Advertisement
“ I ’m bleeding a lot . ”
He thought of his own injuries and of his daughter ’s appearance .
“ How ’s your face ?
Did it get you ? ”
“ Just my mouth . ”
“ And your eyes ? ”
“ They ’re fine . ”
Advertisement
He could tell by the sound of her voice that she was OK .
Thank you , God .
He gazed up into the sky above Mt. Gould on the far side of the valley .
He thought of the people he knew who were dead .
His mother and father .
Thank you , Mom , and thank you , Dad , for being an energy that he could draw on .
Somehow it made him less afraid .
And thank you , Sophie .
She was a patient of his , an 80 - year - old woman who had died last year .
They had grown close as Johan worked with her .
She would complain -- I ’m going to die , she ’d say -- and he ’d tell her to be quiet .
You ’re not going to die , Sophie .
And to think he nearly had .
And thank you , Steve , his father - in - law , Marilyn ’s dad , who had become his own dad in a way .
Advertisement
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
Then he called back to Jenna .
“ It got me kind of bad . ”
It was the only time he told her how he felt .
After that , he turned stoic .
No complaining .
No despairing .
He knew his dad would have reacted the same way .
He chalked it up to being Dutch :
You take care of yourself and your children .
Jenna would do the same .
Together , unprompted , they began to call out .
Advertisement
“ Helllp . ”
“ Helllp . ”
GLACIER National Park straddles the Continental Divide .
Popularly thought of as North America ’s Switzerland , famous for its snowy peaks , alpine meadows , rivers and lakes , the park attracts nearly 2 million visitors each year .
On the east side of the park , the Grinnell Glacier Trail is one of the most popular day hikes .
“ Helllp . ”
Advertisement
Johan knew he could n’t stand here much longer .
He took off his day pack and camcorder .
His digital camera was gone , lost in the chaos .
He pulled a jacket out of his pack and put the hood over his head .
The night before , he ’d read a book about bear attacks : how a woman in Alaska had stopped the bleeding of her scalp by covering her head .
He also thought it might be easier on Jenna or anyone else who might happen to see him .
He wanted to climb to the ledge above .
He did n’t know how he ’d carry his pack and camcorder .
Then it came to him , what they say on airplanes .
Leave your luggage and take care of yourself .
It made sense .
He clambered and crawled off the narrow shelf and up to the ledge .
He felt dizzy , so he sat down .
Johan and Jenna alternated their calls .
Jenna had decided to stay where she was .
She too was dizzy and uncertain of her injuries .
Perched on the side of the mountain , about 75 feet apart , they looked down into the valley .
Their cries disappeared in the vast open space .
It was windy and cold , and the quiet seemed unreal after the intensity of the attack .
“ Helllp . ”
Advertisement
Then Jenna called out .
“ Dad , the boat just got to the dock .
I see people getting off . ”
It was a water taxi that ran a regular service across Lake Josephine .
Johan knew that with the arrival of the boat , hikers would soon be streaming along the trail and their shouts would be heard .
He was tired .
He stopped yelling and tried not to think about how badly injured he was .
Nothing a little surgery can’t fix , he told himself .
Besides , he was alive , and his daughter was fine .
Amid the isolation and the cold , he grew sore and stiff and numb .
Lying down , sitting up , nothing helped .
Forty - five minutes later , he heard Jenna talking with someone .
She called to him .
“ Dad , there are people here now .
They ’re getting help . ”
Still it seemed like forever .
Then Johan saw a man cutting through the bushes and sliding down toward him .
The man ’s eyes were wide open .
The expression said everything .
Advertisement
“ Are you OK ? ” the man asked .
“ Do you see a camera ? ” Johan replied .
Jim Knapp was surprised by the question , but very little was making sense .
Knapp and his wife had started their hike that morning a little past 8 , well ahead of the water taxi .
After an hour on the trail , they heard what sounded like a coyote or a hawk or some animal being attacked .
Then there was more , and it sounded human .
They started running .
Someone must have fallen or sprained an ankle .
Advertisement
Knapp told Johan he would look for the camera , but his attention was focused on the injured man before him .
It was the most gruesome sight he had ever seen .
Blood covered Johan ’s face .
His arms and legs oozed blood .
His voice and sentences were jerky and repetitive .
He reminded Knapp of Dustin Hoffman in “ Rainman , ” and with his sweat shirt pulled up over his head , he looked like Beavis in an episode of “ Beavis and Butthead . ”
“ Jenna ’s OK , ” Knapp said , as he began to get a sense of Johan ’s injuries .
He noticed the day pack -- but no camera -- on the shelf beneath them , and he climbed down to retrieve it .
Inside were a sweat shirt and four water bottles .
He covered Johan and tried to make him drink .
He took off his T - shirt and wrapped it around a deep gash on Johan ’s leg .
He laid out some nuts and a granola bar and took some water up to Jenna .
Then Johan saw a girl .
She was sliding down to him .
Her name was Kari .
Advertisement
Kari Schweigert and Heidi Reindl had been car - camping in Glacier .
They were just starting on an 11 - mile hike when they ran into Jim Knapp ’s wife , running down the trail , screaming for help .
Then there were two teenage boys .
Johan could n’t keep track of everyone , but one of the boys -- the one who wore a beanie -- did get his camera .
It was the camcorder , and Johan was glad to see it .
He was also glad that people were finally getting there , but he felt bad for them .
He knew stumbling upon a bear attack -- and finding him as bloody as he was -- could n’t be easy for them .
A fall or a sprain , sure , but a bear attack ?
He tried to tell himself that it would be OK .
He tried to console himself .
If he and Jenna had not been attacked , then these other hikers would have .
What can we do , everyone asked .
How can we help ?
The rock at the back of his head felt like it was digging into his skull .
He squirmed about .
He wanted them to help him sit up , but they did n’t want to .
They were worried about his neck .
Advertisement
Then he ’d have to do it himself .
He simply wanted to sit up , have a drink of water and then maybe lie down again .
But he was fading .
VOICES told him that help was on the way , only he was losing interest .
He did n’t want to deal with any of this anymore .
It was all too much : wondering how they ’d get him and Jenna off the mountain ; wanting to be cleaned up from the dirt and sticky blood ; saddened that their trip was ending this way .
Kari Schweigert sat beside him , talking .
Her curly hair was tied back in a ponytail .
She was in a tank top ; Johan was wearing her jacket .
He was shaking and numb with cold .
Advertisement
“ How are you doing ? ” she asked .
“ The pain is OK , ” he said .
“ I ’d just like to take a nap . ”
Then she started to move in closer to him .
She knew he was cold .
She said she wanted to warm him up .
She angled around him and covered his abdomen and chest with her body , her legs off to a side .
“ Are you sure about this ? ” he asked .
He did n’t want her to get covered with blood ; it would be impossible to wash out .
Advertisement
She could n’t cover him completely , but she did shield him from the wind .
It was a moment he would never forget .
How strange , he thought , to be hiking along on this trail one moment , thinking about running in a marathon , and then suddenly not being able to walk , being so dependent upon strangers , and now this girl so close to him , so tender and different from the savagery of the attack .
His mind kept going back to Jenna .
Everyone told him that she was not as badly injured as he was .
He felt guilty .
Why had he wanted to go hiking here ?
Why was n’t he a better parent ?
Schweigert kept talking to him .
She told him not to fall asleep .
It made sense .
He knew he ’d lost a lot of blood , and he knew he was in shock .
The wash of voices and movement of people around him , once reassuring , began to blur .
A park ranger and a dozen hikers were on the trail above them .
The ranger radioed a report on Johan and Jenna ’s status to the ranger station at Many Glacier , where an incident commander was assembling a rescue team .

A few of the hikers peered over the edge .
“ Do you need anything ? ” they yelled .
“ More jackets . ”
Someone tucked one under Johan ’s head .

His neck felt broken .
“ WHAT ’S your name ? ”
“ Johan Otter . ”
“ Where are you ? ”
Advertisement
“ Glacier National Park . ”
“ What time of day is it ? ”
“ Late morning . ”
“ What happened ? ”

“ Bear attack .... ”
The name badge said Katie .
She wore the green and gray uniform of the park service .
She had slid down the slope , balancing a medical kit and a shotgun in her hands , and once she determined that he was alert and oriented , she started dressing his wounds .
Katie Fullerton had pulled into the Many Glacier parking lot expecting just another summer day .
Then she heard about the attack .
She and another ranger were ordered to get to Johan and Jenna as soon as possible .
Since opening in 1910 , Glacier National Park has had only 10 bear fatalities , and they were enough .
The incident commander at Many Glacier had put a call out for additional rangers , some stationed on the west side of the park , 70 miles -- a two - hour drive -- away .
A helicopter , chartered from Minuteman Aviation , would ferry those rangers to the site of the attack and would be used to shuttle equipment and personnel up to the mountain .

Whup , whup , whup .
Katie Fullerton looked up .
At 9,000 feet , the white chopper had negotiated a U - shaped notch in the Garden Wall , a narrow filigree of stone crowning the Continental Divide .
As it drew close , it circled , looking for a place to land .
Johan and Jenna
Otter could not have fallen in a less accessible place .
Three hours had passed since the attack , and Johan ’s metabolism was slowing down .
The blast of adrenaline triggered by the attack was long gone ; the 15 - minute torrent of thought and reaction had dissipated in a miasma of pain , discomfort and boredom .
Why was the rescue taking so long ?
Crashing mentally and emotionally , he knew he needed to stay warm and awake .
Gusts of wind ghosted along the cliff ; temperatures shot from warm to freezing as clouds drifted beneath the sun .
Hikers on the trail were tossing down energy bars , water and more outerwear .
A ranger was talking on the radio .

A second ranger crouched beside Johan .
He had arrived with nearly 50 pounds of gear , including a life - support pack with IV fluids , medications and an oxygen tank , and he began cutting away Johan ’s jackets and clothing .
He introduced himself as Gary , Gary Moses .
Johan appreciated his calm and confident manner .
Moses explained that the plan was to place Johan and Jenna on litters , have them lifted up to the trail and then carried down to a landing zone , where the chopper would take them to the Kalispell Regional Medical Center in Kalispell , Mont. , in the Flathead Valley on the west side of the park .
Rangers on the trail set up a belaying system .
They knew they had to move fast .
Moses took Johan ’s vitals .
His blood pressure was 80 over 30 , his pulse 44 , his temperature dropping .
Moses prepared an IV line .
Johan tried to lie still , but he was shivering uncontrollably .
Then he heard something .
It was Katie Fullerton ; she was crying .
The sound startled him at first .
Advertisement
“ Do you want to stand down ? ” Moses asked his fellow ranger .
She shook her head .
Johan was glad .
She had worked hard to make him comfortable and safe .
This was her first season as a patrol ranger , her first major trauma .
Just last year , she ’d been collecting user fees , and she had grown up near the park .
She and her family had hiked these trails .
This could just as easily have been her father .
Advertisement
Her tears reminded Johan how grave his situation was .
THE helicopter was making a second landing , and all Johan could think was : Hurry up .
A second medic had joined Moses and Fullerton .
“ How ’s Jenna ? ”
It was his steady refrain .
“ There ’re people with her . ”
Advertisement
Moses and the other medic put a C - collar around Johan ’s neck and got ready to insert a urinary catheter .
Johan reminded them about a scene in “ Seinfeld ” in which an embarrassed George Costanza is caught naked and complains about “ shrinkage . ”
They burst out laughing , and Johan relaxed a little .
This is who he was : not just a bloodied man but someone always there with an easy line , ready to lighten the mood , to give to others .
Moses reassessed the rescue plan .
It had taken nearly an hour to find a vein and get the IV started .
Carrying Johan out , lifting him to the trail and then down to the helicopter landing zone was going to be too traumatic , and the afternoon was getting on .
He thought a helicopter could lift Johan directly off this ledge , in a rescue known as a short haul .
It would be quicker but riskier .
Still , he did n’t see any way around it .
He radioed in his recommendation .
The incident commander agreed .
They called in the rescue helicopter operated by the hospital in Kalispell .
As they waited , Johan remembered an Air Force chopper that had crashed during a rescue on Mt. Hood little more than three years earlier .
Everything -- the foundering , the dipping , the rolling down the slope in a cascade of snow -- had been televised on the evening news .
Advertisement
It made him nervous .
“ Am I going to die ? ” Johan asked .
“ You ’re not going to die up here , ” the second medic said .
RED against the blue sky and white clouds , the short - haul helicopter was easier to spot than the Minuteman .
Advertisement
“ Hear that ? ” Gary Moses looked out over the valley .
“ That ’s the sound of your rescue . ”
Pilot Ken Justus adjusted the foot pedals and hand controls to bring the Bell 407 closer to the cliff .
Travis Willcut , the flight nurse , sat next to him , calling out positions , monitoring radio traffic .
Jerry Anderson , a medic , dangled 150 feet beneath them on a rope with a red Bauman Bag and a body board at his waist .
Piloting a helicopter at moments like this is like pedaling an exercise bike on the roof of a two - story building while trying to dangle a hot dog into the mouth of a jar on the ground .
Lying on his back , Johan watched .
The IV had kicked in .
Though stiff and still cold , he was wide awake and in no pain .
Anticipation was everything , and he remembered feeling a little afraid .
He hated roller coasters and worried about his stomach .
Advertisement
“ You ’ll have the best view of your life , ” Moses said , hiding his worry .
He knew getting Anderson in would be tricky .
Because helicopters can’t cast sharply defined shadows on steep terrain , pilots flying short - haul missions have trouble judging closing speeds and distances .
Anderson , dangling at the end of the rope , had a radio in his helmet .
He was using it to direct Justus lower and closer to Johan .
Abruptly , the radio died .
“ I ’m at your 11 o’clock position , a mile out , ” Moses broke in with his radio , once he understood the problem .
“ Half mile , 12 o’clock . ”
“ Do I need to come up or down ? ”
Advertisement
“ Up about 10 feet . ”
Then just as Justus got closer , he caught Anderson ’s shadow on the ledge and set him down about 20 feet to the right of Johan .
The other rangers shielded Johan from the rotor wash and dust .
Anderson unhooked himself .
Justus moved the helicopter away .
With the rangers ’ help , Anderson slid the body board beneath Johan and strapped the Bauman Bag around him .
He waved Justus back in .
“ We ’re ready to lift . ”
Advertisement
“ Roger , ready to lift . ”
Johan could n’t tell when he was off the ground .
Dangling with Anderson beside him , 150 feet beneath the helicopter , all Johan would see was Anderson ’s face , the blue sky and the belly of the chopper .
The wind whistled around him .
“ Woo hoo ! ”
The hikers and rangers on the mountain started cheering and clapping .
With Johan and Anderson still beneath him , Justus accelerated down the valley to the helipad at Many Glacier .
A waiting crowd was asked not to take pictures .
Johan was transferred into an ambulance while Justus went back to pick up Jenna .
Finally Johan was out of the wind and in a warm place .
Advertisement
Then he heard the news .
“ Jenna is here , ” someone said .
“ Hi , sweetie , ” he called out as they prepared to fly him to the medical center in Kalispell .
With his head wrapped in bandages , mummy slits for his eyes and the C - collar on his neck , Johan could n’t see her .
“ Make sure when they call Mom that you talk to her . ”
He knew he would n’t be the one making that call .

“ Otherwise she ’ll totally freak out , ” he said .

In the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park , a team of researchers has discovered a novel bacterium that transforms light into chemical energy .
The discovery of the chlorophyll - producing bacterium , Candidatus Chloracidobacterium ( Cab. ) thermophilum , will be described in the 27 July 2007 issue of the journal Science in a paper led by Don Bryant , the Ernest C. Pollard Professor of Biotechnology in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Penn State University , and David M. Ward , Professor of Microbial Studies in the Thermal Biology Institute and Department of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences at Montana State University , and colleagues .
Yellowstone National Park is known as a tourists ' wonderland that is full of animals , strange rock formations , geysers , and colorful hot springs , but it is also a scientific reservoir housing what may be the world 's largest diversity of thermophilic ( heat - loving ) bacteria .
Yellowstone habitats have been explored since the 1960s for new organisms that may have important applications in biotechnology , for cleaning up pollution ( bioremediation ) , or in medicine .
The research team led by Bryant and Ward found the new bacterium living in the same hot springs as the most famous Yellowstone microbe , Thermus aquaticus , which has revolutionized forensics and other fields by making the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) a routine procedure .
Remarkably , the new genus and species Cab. thermophilum also belongs to a new phylum , Acidobacteria .
The discovery marks only the third time in the past 100 years that a new bacterial phylum has been added to the list of those with chlorophyll - producing members .
Although chlorophyll - producing bacteria are so abundant that they perform half the photosynthesis on Earth , only 5 of the 25 major groups , or phyla , of bacteria previously were known to contain members with this ability .
" The microbial mats give the hot springs in Yellowstone their remarkable yellow , orange , red , brown , and green colors , " explains Bryant .
" Microbiologists are intrigued by Octopus and Mushroom Springs because their unusual habitats house a diversity of microorganisms , but many are difficult or impossible to grow in the lab .
Metagenomics has given us a powerful new tool for finding these hidden organisms and exploring their physiology , metabolism , and ecology . "
Metagenomics is a means of studying organisms without having to culture them .
Bulk samples are collected from the environment , then DNA is isolated from the cells and sequenced by so - called shotgun sequencing on a very large scale .
Analysis of the DNA sequences reveals what types of genes and organisms are present in the environment .
The team focused on two genes : 16S ribosomal RNA , a crucial component of the machinery used by all living cells to manufacture proteins ; and the gene for a protein called PscA , which is essential for converting light energy into chemical energy .
16S ribosomal RNA is distinctive in each species .
Says Bryant , " Finding two new genes with a computer is not enough to justify naming a new organism .
You need to prove those genes come from the same genome . "
Because the two genes were close together in the genome , the team was successful in isolating a single fragment containing both .
" We were lucky that a former graduate student in Ward 's lab , Jessica Allewalt , had already grown a culture of mixed microbes from the mats , " Bryant explains , " although she did n't realize at the time that the mixture contained Cab. thermophilum . "
Cab .
thermophilum grows near the surface of the mats together with cyanobacteria , or blue - green algae , where there is light and oxygen , at a temperature of about 50 to 66 degrees Centigrade ( 122 to 151 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
The organism was found in three hot springs -- Mushroom Spring , Octopus Spring , and Green Finger Pool -- in the Lower Geyser Basin , not far from the Old Faithful Geyser .
Unexpectedly , the new bacterium has special light - harvesting antennae known as chlorosomes , which contain about 250,000 chlorophylls each .
No member of this phylum nor any aerobic microbe was known to make chlorosomes before this discovery .
The team found that Cab . thermophilum makes two types of chlorophyll that allow these bacteria to thrive in microbial mats and to compete for light with cyanobacteria .
This discovery is particularly important because members of the Acidobacteria have proven very hard to grow in laboratory cultures , which means their ecology and physiology are very poorly understood .
Most species of Acidobacteria have been found in poor or polluted soils that are acidic , with a pH below 3 .
However , the Yellowstone environments are more alkaline , about pH 8.5 ( on a scale of 1 to 14 ) .
Bryant notes , " Judging from their 16S rRNA sequences , the closest relatives of Cab. thermophilum are found around Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone and hot springs in Tibet and Thailand .
As we look more closely , we may find relatives of Cab. thermophilum in the microbial mats of thermal sites worldwide . "
" Finding a previously unknown , chlorophyll - producing microbe is the discovery of a lifetime for someone who has studied bacterial photosynthesis for as long as I have ( 35 years ) , " says Bryant .
" I would n't have been as excited if I had reached into that mat and pulled out a gold nugget the size of my fist ! "
He adds , " I am really grateful to Dave Ward for the chance to work with him and his students in the park and to visit Montana frequently .
Our collaboration is a great example of how science really becomes exciting when scientists from different disciplines interact . "

Paul Craig Roberts sincerely believes that Bush and Cheney are capable of a false flag operation to advance their agenda :
If the Bush administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle East and to entrench the " unitary executive " at home , it will have to conduct some false flag operations that will both frighten and anger the American people and make them accept Bush 's declaration of " national emergency " and the return of the draft .
Alternatively , the administration could simply allow any real terrorist plot to proceed without hindrance .
And :
Think about it .
If another 9/11 - type " security failure " were not in the works , why would Homeland Security czar Chertoff go to the trouble of convincing the Chicago Tribune that Americans have become complacent about terrorist threats and that he has " a gut feeling " that America will soon be hit hard ?
[ Homeland Security chief warns of ' increased risk ’
Chertoff bases ' gut feeling ' on history , Al Qaeda statements By E.A. Torriero , July 11 , 2007 ]
Why would Republican warmonger Rick Santorum say on the Hugh Hewitt radio show that " between now and November , a lot of things are going to happen , and I believe that by this time next year , the American public 's ( sic ) going to have a very different view of this war . "
Throughout its existence the US government has staged incidents that the government then used in behalf of purposes that it could not otherwise have pursued .
According to a number of writers , false flag operations have been routinely used by the Israeli state .
During the Czarist era in Russia , the secret police would set off bombs in order to arrest those the secret police regarded as troublesome .
Hitler was a dramatic orchestrator of false flag operations .
False flag operations are a commonplace tool of governments .
Ask yourself :
Would a government that has lied us into two wars and is working to lie us into an attack on Iran shrink from staging " terrorist " attacks in order to remove opposition to its agenda ?
At the start of his article Robert 's gives us his take on what to expect if Congress fails to control the Bush team :
Unless Congress immediately impeaches Bush and Cheney , a year from now the US could be a dictatorial police state at war with Iran .
And he tells us why he believes this :
Bush has put in place all the necessary measures for dictatorship in the form of " executive orders " that are triggered whenever Bush declares a national emergency .
Recent statements by Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff , former Republican senator Rick Santorum and others suggest that Americans might expect a series of staged , or false flag , " terrorist " events in the near future .
And Roberts pulls no punches when he explains why the Bush team is prepared to take such desperate measures :
Too much is going wrong for the Bush administration : the failure of its Middle East wars , Republican senators jumping ship , Turkish troops massed on northern Iraq 's border poised for an invasion to deal with Kurds , and a majority of Americans favoring the impeachment of Cheney and a near - majority favoring Bush 's impeachment .
The Bush administration desperately needs dramatic events to scare the American people and the Congress back in line with the militarist - police state that Bush and Cheney have fostered .
I 've followed Paul Craig Roberts on anti-war.com since the onset of the war .
At each step of the war , his predictions seemed plausible but a bit far fetched .
In each case , his predictions later proved to be correct .
His 2003 articles now appear as if they were written in sober hindsight .
There are more than a billion people online worldwide
The Pew report on the future internet surveyed 742 experts in the fields of computing , politics and business .
More than half of respondents had a positive vision of the net 's future but 46 % had serious reservations .
Almost 60 % said that a counter culture of Luddites would emerge , some resorting to violence .
The Pew Internet and American Life report canvassed opinions from the experts on seven broad scenarios about the future internet , based on developments in the technology in recent years .
Written responses
The correspondents were also able to qualify their answers with written responses giving more detail .
" Key builders of the next generation of internet often agree on the direction technology will change , but there is much less agreement about the social and political impact those changes will have , " said Janna Quitney Anderson , lead author of the report The Future of the Internet II .
She added : " One of their big concerns is : Who controls the internet architecture they have created ? "
Bob Metcalfe , founder of 3Com and the inventor of ethernet , predicted the net would be a global connection of different devices .
" The internet will have gone beyond personal communications , " by 2020 he wrote .
' Embedded micros '
Mobiles will play a big part in the net 's future
Louis Nauges , president of Microcost , a French information technology firm , saw mobile devices at the forefront of the net .
" Mobile internet will be dominant , " he explained .
" By 2020 , most mobile networks will provide one - gigabit - per - second - minimum speed , anywhere , anytime .
" Dominant access tools will be mobile , with powerful infrastructure characteristics .
All applications will come from the net . "
But not everyone felt a " networked nirvana " would be possible by 2020 .
Concerns over interoperability ( different formats working together ) , government regulation and commercial interests were seen as key barriers to a universal internet .
Ian Peter , Australian leader of the Internet Mark II Project , wrote : " The problem of the digital divide is too complex and the power of legacy telco regulatory regimes too powerful to achieve this utopian dream globally within 15 years . "
' Real interoperability '
Author and social commentator Douglas Rushkoff agreed with Mr Peter .
The less one is powerful , the more transparent his or her life .
The powerful will remain much less transparent
NetLab founder Barry Wellman on issues of privacy versus transparancy
Send us your comments
He wrote : " Real interoperability will be contingent on replacing our bias for competition with one for collaboration .
" Until then , economics do not permit universal networking capability . "
Many of the surveyed experts predicted isolated and small - scale violent attacks to try and thwart technology 's march .
" Today 's eco-terrorists are the harbingers of this likely trend , " wrote Ed Lyell , an expert on the internet and education .
" Every age has a small percentage that cling to an overrated past of low technology , low energy , lifestyle . "
" Of course there will be more Unabombers , " wrote Cory Doctorow of blog BoingBoing .
Some commentators felt that the violence would either be tied to the effects of technology , rather than the technology itself , or possibly civil action around issues such as privacy .
" The interesting question is whether these acts will be considered terrorism or civil disobedience , " wrote Marc Rotenberg or the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
Of course there will be more Unabombers
Cory Doctorow , BoingBoing
More than half of respondents disagreed that English would become the lingua franca of the internet by 2020 and that there would be dangers associated with letting machines take over some net tasks such as surveillance and security .
Internet Society Board chairman Fred Baker wrote : " We will certainly have some interesting technologies .
He added : " Until someone finds a way for a computer to prevent anyone from pulling its power plug , however , it will never be completely out of control . "
The repondents were split over the whether the impact of people 's lives becoming increasingly online , resulting in both less privacy but more transparency , would be a positive outcome .
' Access information '
Tiffany Shlain , founder of the Webby awards , said such transparancy would be a benefit to society .
The dramatic growth of the internet shows no sign of abating
" Giving all people access to our information and a context to understand it will lead to an advancement in our civilisation . "
But NetLab founder Barry Wellman disagreed : " The less one is powerful , the more transparent his or her life .
The powerful will remain much less transparent . "
Mr Doctorow wrote : " Transparency and privacy are n't antithetical .
" We 're perfectly capable of formulating widely honored social contracts that prohibit pointing telescopes through your neighbours ' windows .
" We can likewise have social contracts about sniffing your neighbours ' network traffic . "
By 2020 an increasing number of people will be living and working within " virtual worlds " being more productive online than offline , the majority of the respondents said .
Ben Detenber , an associate professor at Nanyang Technological University , responded : " Virtual reality ( VR ) will only increase productivity for some people .
For most , it will make no difference in productivity ( i.e. , how much output ) ; VR will only change what type of work people do and how it is done . "
Glenn Ricart , a board member at the Internet Society , warned also of potential dangers .
He envisaged " an entire generation opting - out of the real world and a paradoxical decrease in productivity as the people who provide the motive economic power no longer are in touch with the realities of the real world " .
I like to write blog postings in reStructuredText , and I use rst2html from Python ’s docutils to turn them into HTML before pasting into my blog software .
One thing missing is source highlighting for Haskell , Python etc .
Thankfully , Both reST and Python ’s docutils are written to be extensible .
Below is a replacement ‘ rst2html ’ which includes support for Haskell colouring using HsColour , and just about everything else using Pygments .
Example usage :
.. code - block :: python import os # Standard hello world stuff class Hello ( ) def do_it ( self ) print " Hello world " if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : Hello ( ) . do_it ( ) def main ( ) print " Hello world "
Output :
import os # Standard hello world stuff class Hello ( ) def do_it ( self ) print " Hello world " if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : Hello ( ) . do_it ()
Some sample Haskell :
class
Show a where show :: a -> String showsPrec :: Int -> a ->
ShowS showList :: [ a ] ->
ShowS show x = shows Prec 0 x " " shows Prec _ x s = show x ++ s showList [ ] = showString " [ ] " showList ( x : xs ) = showChar ' [ ' .
shows x .
showl xs where showl [ ] = showChar ' ] ' showl ( x : xs ) = showChar ' , ' .
shows x .
showl xs class
Eq a where ( == ) , ( /= ) :: a -> a ->
Bool x == y = not ( x /= y ) x /= y = not ( x == y )
Here is the code :

What better way to keep out the riffraff at an office gym than one of those newfangled electronic locks ?
Of course , getting legitimate users to remember the key code can be a bit of a challenge , so it ’s probably best to put a sign on the door that tells them what the key code is .
But of course , that presents a security problem with the aforementioned riffraff , so it ’s probably best not do that .

Media critics : CNN's
YouTube debate did n't suck but still mainly a stunt David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Joe Scarborough reported Tuesday on the CNN YouTube debate , where Democratic candidates answered questions posed by ordinary citizens in the form of short videos .
" I was expecting the YouTube debate last night to suck , " Scarborough started off .
" I was actually -- I was impressed . "
" The questions were good , " replied NBC News political director Chuck Todd .
" It was a good candidate forum .
The downside was that the moderator missed opportunities to create a debate .
...
It was a glorified , high - tech town hall .
...
It was engaging , the program kept moving ... but it still was n't a debate . "
Later in the show , Scarborough told Tom Shales of the Washington Post , that he felt the debate " was really good viewing , " to which Shales responded , " I did n't love it .
...
It seemed like kind of more of a stunt . "
Shales felt that reporters would have asked pretty much the same questions , but without the silly aspects .
" The news is n't supposed to be that entertaining , " he said .
Shales also complained that the videos could not be seen clearly because they were not shown directly but only through shots of the screen on the debate platform , with the camera frequently cutting away for candidate reactions .
Scarborough was particularly critical of the candidates ' own videos that were part of the event , saying , " Where mainstream media outlets try to bring in new technology ... sometimes they overreach and it can be embarrassing .
...
You may have had candidates trying to be a bit too hip for their own good . "
However , Scarborough and Shales agreed that many of the limitations of the debate were part of the more general problem with television , which reduces everything to soundbites .
" In the end , was it CNN using a gimmick , and in the now - immortal words of Dan Rather , did they dumb it down and tart it up for younger viewers ? " asked Scarborough .
" It 's really too early to be doing debates in the first place , " responded Shales .
The following video is from MSNBC's Morning Joe broadcast on July 24 .

( CNN ) -- Irritated by the highest gas prices in U.S. history , John Thorner has a message for his 70 employees : Stay home .
Rising gas prices topped the $ 4 per gallon mark in some U.S. cities this summer .
Thorner is requiring all staff at the National Recreation and Park Association to avoid commuting at least one day a week -- either by working four long days and taking the fifth one off , or by working from home on the fifth day .
" The 70 people in our office drive an average of 30 miles a day .
We did the math and figured that by having the employees not commute one day a week , we would be saving 100 gallons a week , " says Thorner , executive director of the nonprofit , which is based in the suburbs of Washington .
" This is not a huge amount of gasoline , but it could serve as a model for other operations . "
When the average price of gasoline in the United States hit $ 3.18 in May , it was the highest price ever recorded , even when adjusted for inflation , according to the Lundberg Survey of thousands of service stations across the nation .
Those record prices helped push more than a few employees to find alternative ways of working , according to Rose Stanley of WorldAtWork , an association for human resource professionals based in Scottsdale , Arizona .
Stanley knows about this firsthand .
Having arranged to work at home one day a week for the past year , she budgeted $ 50 for commuting the other four days .
" But it was costing me $ 75 a week . "
So six weeks ago , she says , she asked if she could work at home a second day each week .
" I 'm back down to within my budget . "
Employers , too , are talking more about telecommuting , says Jennifer Pickett of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation .
" Just in the past week or so , we 've heard from employers who specifically mentioned gas prices as a reason for their considering a telework program to offset the cost of commuting for their employees , " says Pickett , whose department runs Telework !
VA , a program that provides incentives for businesses in the state to encourage their employees to work at home .
While there 's no data available on whether teleworking has increased as a result of rising gas prices , the anecdotal evidence is accumulating :
• " I 've been having people calling me asking , ' How do I get my boss to let me work at home ?
I ca n't afford to drive to work anymore , ' " says Chuck Wilsker , president of The Telework Coalition , an advocacy organization .
• " We 're seeing a dramatic increase in the use of the services we offer just in the past 30 days , after the gas prices reached $ 3 , " says Michael Halicki of the Clean Air Campaign of Georgia , which provides incentives to individuals to stop commuting alone in their cars .
" I can't document that there 's been an increase in teleworking , but we have seen a definite increase in interest in it by employers . "
• " Rising gas prices are definitely making people at least talk more about working at home , " agrees Erik Nelson of Better World Club , which bills itself as an environmentally friendly auto club .
Even if few employers are likely to mimic Thorner and force their workers to stay home , the nonprofit director is unapologetic : " It 's an economic issue for our employees .
It 's also an environmental one for us as an organization .
Conservation is part of our mission . "
Much to his surprise , it turns out to be an economic issue for his organization as well .
After an article about his plan was published in The Washington Post , Thorner learned that his organization may be eligible for financial incentives for its model behavior .
" When gas prices go up , it makes people more conscious of how expensive it is to commute , " says Lonnie Golden , a labor economist at Penn State Abington who researches flexible work arrangements .
" And more employers might consider accommodating those employees who wish to reduce commuting time .
" It 's encouraging to think that something good will come out of rising gas prices . "

Saving money is essential to building your net worth .
Savings accounts and money market accounts are meant to hold your liquid assets or funds that you expect to use within a year .
You may think , “ If you 've seen one high - yield savings account , you 've seen them all ” but , actually , higher interest rates and certain features can make one account a better choice than another .
Online High Yield Saving Account and Money Market Account Rates
As online banking has evolved , consumers can find a high yield and still hope to get the mobile and digital banking convenience they need .
They 're free to compare interest rates and account features in search of the best online high - yield savings account for their liquid assets .
Savings Accounts
When you want to set up an emergency fund or other savings account for short - term liquidity , an online savings account usually offers higher interest rates than many brick - and - mortar banks .
In addition , online banking is much more convenient .
Money Market Accounts
While money market accounts are similar to savings accounts , they used to earn higher interest rates and their restrictions then were more stringent than they appear to be today .
Our research is showing that , in some respects , the differences between the two types of accounts are blurring .
In your search for the best money market account , you may find that interest rates are quite similar to savings account rates .
Also , the minimum balance requirements and number of withdrawal transactions allowed may be on par with savings accounts .
All of this underscores the need to personally investigate the specifics of any account you open .
Even though rates are low right now , they will eventually rise as the economy recovers .
Regardless , it is important to develop the habit of saving .
Keeping track of the latest interest rates is the research part of that habit , but the payoff is that the best interest rates and services can help you make the most of your savings in any economic environment .
Here is a synopsis of what some of the major banks offer with a direct link to their individual website .
That way you can easily learn more and open an account when you are ready .
The Best High - Interest Savings Accounts
Most Americans are n't saving much these days , but if they knew how to better grow their money with high savings rates , they may change their mind .
One recent survey found 62 percent had less than $ 1,000 in a savings account , and only 29 percent had over $ 1,000 put aside for emergencies .
Many will point to low interest rates as the reason they are not saving in an account , adopting an almost “ why bother ” attitude .
But having a savings account is smart for several reasons :
In case of emergency , there 's actual money to cover the cost , so you do n't end up overloading credit cards or having to take out a loan .
It makes you more aware of your overall financial picture , especially if you set up a schedule to make deposits into the savings account .
Saving money up front also saves you on interest if you do need to cover an unexpected cost or save for something specific like a new car or a vacation .
If you lose your job or find your hours reduced , a savings account is a nice addition to whatever severance or unemployment you receive .
With all the reasons to open a savings account , how about exploring these options ?
Here are the best savings accounts for 2019 :

Comparing High - Interest Account Features
When it comes time to research which online high - yield savings account or money market account is best for you , take a look at the information we consistently maintain on this page and bookmark it .
Plan to come back frequently to check that your accounts are still performing the way you want them to in light of any new rates and terms being offered .
An online savings account or money market account is a safe and convenient way to earn interest on funds that you may need easy access to .
Either is a far better choice than simply keeping extra sums in cash or in a checking account .
Now that online banking is mainstream , many accounts offer some pretty nifty bells and whistles .
It pays to shop for the best rates , the best service , and the best policies regarding their fees and services .
Here are some of the most important factors to consider :
Safety
Banks are not required to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) .
Most are FDIC - insured up to the legal limit of $ 250,000 per depositor , per insured bank , for each account ownership category though .
Fee Structure
Monthly maintenance fees , statement fees , and ATM charges are just a few of the ways banks charge for their services .
Since these costs can quickly exceed the interest you earn in your account , it is very important to compare each bank 's fee structure to find the most competitive terms .
Minimum Deposit Requirements
Banks may require that a certain amount of money be deposited when you first open a new savings account .
Some banks waive that requirement now and allow you to fund your new account with whatever balance you choose .
A minimum deposit requirement is more common with money market accounts , however .
Minimum Balance Requirements
Likewise , some banks require that you maintain a certain minimum balance in your account at all times in order to avoid paying their monthly maintenance fee .
Transaction Limits
You can make up to six withdrawals or transfers without charge from your savings accounts during any statement cycle according to Regulation D of the Code of Federal Regulations , Title 12 , Part 204 .
Even though many money market accounts allow check - writing privileges and debit - card transactions , Regulation D applies to this type of account as well .
Linking Accounts
Many online banks make it easy to transfer money between your various accounts even if they are with a different bank .
This is especially convenient when you open your new online savings or money market account .
24 - Hour Access
One of the best features of online accounts is that you can manage your money whenever you like 24/7/365 .
You do n't have to travel to a branch or wait for it to open .
Mobile Banking Apps
It is possible to do your banking from anywhere with some of the mobile banking applications available at an online bank as well .
In addition , online banks invest heavily in making sure that every transaction is secure .

pre-eminent psychologist mihaly cziszentmihalyi about the ten paradoxes of creative people .
here ’s an abbreviated version :
1. Creative people have a great deal of physical energy , but they ’re also often quiet and at rest .
…
One manifestation of energy is sexuality .
Creative people are paradoxical in this respect also .
They seem to have quite a strong dose of eros , or generalized libidinal energy , which some express directly into sexuality .
At the same time , a certain spartan celibacy is also a part of their makeup ; continence tends to accompany superior achievement .
Without eros , it would be difficult to take life on with vigor ; without restraint , the energy could easily dissipate .
2. Creative people tend to be smart yet naive at the same time .
…
Another way of expressing this dialectic is the contrasting poles of wisdom and childishness .
As Howard Gardner remarked in his study of the major creative geniuses of this century , a certain immaturity , both emotional and mental , can go hand in hand with deepest insights .
Mozart comes immediately to mind .
3. Creative people combine playfulness and discipline , or responsibility and irresponsibility .
… Jacob Rabinow , an electrical engineer , uses an interesting mental technique to slow himself down when work on an invention requires more endurance than intuition : “ When I have a job that takes a lot of effort , slowly , I pretend I ’m in jail .
If I ’m in jail , time is of no consequence .
In other words , if it takes a week to cut this , it ’ll take a week .
What else have I got to do ?
I ’m going to be here for twenty years .
See ?
This is a kind of mental trick .
Otherwise you say , ‘ My God , it ’s not working , ’ and then you make mistakes .
My way , you say time is of absolutely no consequence . ”
4. Creative people alternate between imagination and fantasy , and a rooted sense of reality .
5. Creative people trend to be both extroverted and introverted . … in current psychological research , extroversion and introversion are considered the most stable personality traits …
Creative individuals , on the other hand , seem to exhibit both traits simultaneously .
6. Creative people are humble and proud at the same time .
7. Creative people , to an extent , escape rigid gender role stereotyping .
8. Creative people are both rebellious and conservative . …
The artist Eva Zeisel , who says that the folk tradition in which she works is “ her home , ” nevertheless produces ceramics that were recognized by the Museum of Modern Art as masterpieces of contemporary design .
9 . Most creative people are very passionate about their work , yet they can be extremely objective about it as well .
10 . Creative people ’s openness and sensitivity often exposes them to suffering and pain , yet also to a great deal of enjoyment .
…
Deep interest and involvement in obscure subjects often goes unrewarded , or even brings on ridicule .
Divergent thinking is often perceived as deviant by the majority , and so the creative person may feel isolated and misunderstood .

「 On Lisp」（著者 はPaul Graham氏）という書籍がインターネットで無償で公開されているのをご存じだろうか（関連リンク）。Lispのマクロについて解説した本で，内容には定評がある。この本は，日本語訳も無償で公開されている（関連リンク）。この翻訳を行った野田開氏が2005年11月17日，Allegro Common Lispの開発で知られる米Franzの日本法人が開催したイベントで，翻訳に至った経緯を語った。翻訳を始めたのは高校生のときだというから驚きである。
野田氏は高校生のとき，高度な数式処理をパソコン上で行えるオープンソース・ソフトウエア「GNU Maxima」に興味を持ったという。Maximaの中身 はCommon Lispで記述されていた。ところが，Common Lispのコードが理解できない。そこで購入したのが，Paul Graham氏が書い た「 ANSI Common Lisp」（ピアソン・エデュケーション発行）。さらに2ちゃんねるで，Graham氏が著名なLisperであること，未訳の名著「
On Lisp」が存在し，無償でダウンロードできることを知った。そこで，高校3年生の冬に勉強がてら翻訳を開始。2ちゃんねるのスレッドやメールでの応援を受け，2年後の2004年11月頃に訳了した。同氏は現在，21歳で東京大学物理工学科の3年生である。
同書は全25章からなり，1～6章がCommon
Lispの解説，7～18章がマクロの解説，19～25章がマクロを利用したプログラミングの実例集になっている。実例は，最初は他の言語でも実現できるような例が載っているが，読み進めるにしたがって，マクロを利用しなければ実現できない例になっていくという。
なお，野田氏によ るOn Lispの日本語訳は，2006年にオーム社が出版する予定。現在，査読作業が進められている。また，On Lispは米国では絶版になっているが，米国でも復刊する計画があるという。
Not Paying Attention at the Virginia DMV
Two men have been issued Virginia drivers ’ licenses even though they were wearing outlandish disguises when they had their pictures taken at the Department of Motor Vehicles :
Will Carsola and Dave Stewart posted Internet videos of their pranks , which included scenes of Carsola spray - painting his face and neck bright red and Stewart painting the top of his head black and sticking a row of fake buckteeth in his mouth in an Asian caricature .
They each enter the DMV office and return with real licenses with photos of their new likenesses .
In another video , a shaved - headed Carsola comes out of the DMV with a photo of his eyes crossed , and another friend obtains a license after spray - painting on a thick , black beard and monobrow .
The videos are here and here .
The Virginia DMV is now demanding that the two come back and get real pictures taken .
I never thought I would say this , but I agree with everything Michelle Malkin says on this issue :
These guys have done the Virginia DMV–and the nation– a big favor .
Many of us have tried to argue how much of a joke these agencies and our homeland security remain after 9/11 – particularly the issuance of driver ’s licenses ( it was the Virginia DMV that issued state photo ID to several 9/11 hijackers who were aided by illegal aliens ) .
But few dissertations and policy analyses drive the message home more effectively than these two damning videos .
Thanks , guys .
I honestly do n’t know if she realizes that REAL ID wo n’t solve this kind of problem , though .
Nor will it solve the problem of people getting legitimate IDs in the names of people whose identity they stole , or real IDs in fake names by bribing DMV employees .
( Several of the 9/11 hijackers did this , in Virginia . )

There 's just something irresistible about random objects that get down to surrounding beats , and the Morpho Towers : Two Standing Spirals installation is quite the eye - catcher indeed .
The pair of ferrofluid sculptures were deigned to stand in a platter of ferrofluid and move " synthetically to music , " which translates into a magnetic field being generated by sound and creating autonomous art .
Subsequently , the towers react by attracting " spikes of ferrofluid " from the bottom - up , which can mold itself and transform into a variety of stunning shapes .
The spikes themselves are designed to " rotate around the edge of the spiral cone , becoming large or small depending on the strength of the magnetic field , " and by utilizing time series metadata ingrained in the music , the designers can create ( and control ) more dramatic scenes on the towers ' sides .
So if you 're interested in what a magnetic Christmas tree might look like , be sure to take a peek after the jump for the artwork in motion .

In 2004 , Randall County , Texas faced a problem .
The aging courthouse was cramped , unsecured and difficult to work in and the county could n't afford to renovate the historical structure .
That ’s when County Judge Ernie Houdashell had an idea and turned to Wal - Mart for help .
The result has everyone smiling three years later .
Randall County ’s new Judicial Center provides state - of - the - art security , abundant space and more parking than this Texas Panhandle county is likely to need well into the next century .
The County ’s solution also helped Wal - Mart out of a jam ; a huge empty building that no longer served its original purpose .
Wal - Mart Stores and Sam's Clubs are often so successful that they outgrow their buildings and have to relocate to better serve their customers .
Canyon Texas had been no exception .
When the retailing giant replaced their existing Canyon store with a new super center it left the original store unoccupied .
Charles Goodnight drove 1,600 cattle into Palo Duro Canyon in 1876 , Houdashell and Wal - Mart have created a courthouse annex that rivals any in the country .
You enter the Judicial Center through a security checkpoint - manned by a sheriff 's deputy armed with a large pistol where once you would have been greeted by a Wal - Mart greeter .
The friendly deputy instructs you to walk through a metal detector similar to the devices used at airports and takes your driver ’s license .
Another deputy in a nearby booth carefully monitors dozens of security cameras located inside and outside the building .
Your license is scanned and returned and the deputy gives you a sticky label with your picture and name to be worn while you are inside the facility .
There 's also a hardened shell where many of the county records dating back to 1880 are stored .
The shell , comprising concrete and steel - reinforced walls , is built to withstand an F - 3 tornado , Houdashell said .
The jail 's holding facility , which has been certified by the State Commission on Jail Standards is out of public view .
The holding center is intended to provide a secure place for criminal suspects to await arraignment in one of the five state - of - the - art courtrooms .
What is visible are several female jail trustees armed with glass cleaner , towels and furniture polish to keep the judicial center gleaming .
District Attorney James Farren cannot get over the space in which he and his staff get to work these days .
“ The old DA 's office , just off the Courthouse Square , was - shall we say - a bit snug ” , Farren told reporters during the official ribbon cutting last January .
“ The old building was so cramped that police officers had to be careful to maneuver themselves in such a manner to keep their weapons away from criminal defendants if they happened to pass each other in the hall ” , Farren explained .
In the new justice center , everyone has plenty of room .
As a surprise bonus , the place is virtually soundproof .
The new justice center sits about 60 yards south of a high - speed track with freight trains roaring by at 60 to 70 mph .
But you do n't hear the trains as they rumble past the building .
" You have to look up to notice a train going by , " Farren said .
" And after awhile , you just kind of tune it all out . "
Where once the building was filled with shoppers and Wal - Mart employees , the district clerk , county clerk , DA , three district judges and two court at law judges call the new new Wal - Mart Courthouse " home " nowadays .
Houdashell is mighty proud of the finished product that has emerged from months of negotiation with Wal - Mart and the subsequent construction effort .
The county issued certificates of obligation totaling more than $ 8 million to revamp the place .
The new justice center marks the beginning of an era in Randall County .
It 's a gem that bears no resemblance to its former life as a retail outlet .
It has produced smiles on the faces of those who work there - and likely will bring smiles to many who do business there .
As for the old courthouse which was built in 1908 , county officials were cautiously optimistic .
Officials remain hopeful the state will deliver money to help pay for its renovation , after which the commissioners court will move into the historic building and raze the North Annex which was built in 1957 .
Author 's Note : After I wrote about the Wal - Mart store that Randall County converted into a justice center , some of you asked about the former justice center that I call home .
Since I 've been here , part of my home has also served as a Justice of the Peace office and the city 's police station .

Government watchdog says Bush ignored law after 30 % of signing statements Michael Roston
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This The Government Accountability Office issued a report showing that US government agencies ignored Congressional legislation on 30 % of the occasions when President George W. Bush issued a ' presidential signing statement ' after signing bills into law .
The report was released today by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , and Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) , Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee .
Rep. Conyers slammed Bush 's use of signing statements , which he noted were far more frequent than any previous administration .
" The Administration is thumbing its nose at the law , " he said .
" This study calls for an extensive review of these practices , something the Administration has so far refused to do . "
Senator Byrd agreed .
" The White House can not pick and choose which laws it follows and which it ignores .
When a president signs a bill into law , the president signs the entire bill .
The Administration cannot be in the business of cherry picking the laws it likes and the laws it doesn't , " the President Pro Tempore of the Senate said .
" This GAO opinion underscores the fact that the Bush White House is constantly grabbing for more power , seeking to drive the people 's branch of government to the sidelines .... We must continue to demand accountability and openness from this White House to counter this power grab . "
The GAO examined a sample of 19 specific provisions from fiscal year 2006 appropriations acts where Bush took exception with a signing statement .
It found the laws passed by Congress were subsequently ignored about 30 % of the time .
" Of these 19 provisions , 10 provisions were executed as written , 6 were not , and 3 were not triggered and so there was no agency action to examine , " said the report , which was issued as a letter and signed by GAO General Counsel Gary L. Kepplinger .
While the Congress members who released the report passed judgment on the legality of the post - signing statement actions , the GAO did not .
" We did not assess the merits of the Presidents objections , nor did we examine the constitutionality of the provisions to which the President objected , " Kepplinger wrote .
Kepplinger noted that there were four broad categories under which the President objected to a law passed by Congress : the theory of the unitary executive ; the Commander in Chief power , national security , foreign relations , or law enforcement ; bicameralism and presentment clauses of the Constitution ; and miscellaneous categories related to the Recess Appointments Clause and the Fifth Amendment . "
The six instances in which the agency ignored the law after the president issued the statement with his signature were broken down by the GAO : * - The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ) did not seek approval from the congressional appropriations committees prior to incurring obligations for administrative expenses beyond the level set by Congress .
* - The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) did not submit a proposal and expenditure plan for housing as directed by Congress because it does not normally produce such plans .
* - The Department of Agriculture did not obtain prior approval for a transfer of funds .
* - The Department of Defense ( DOD ) did not include as part of the fiscal year 2007 budget submission to Congress separate budget justification documents for the costs of all contingency operations for the Military Personnel , Operation and Maintenance , and Procurement accounts .
* - DOD responded to an inquiry from the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs , House Committee on Appropriations , in 38 days , instead of 21 days as directed .
* - The Customs and Border Patrol ( CBP ) did not relocate its checkpoints in the Tucson sector every 7 days as directed by Congress .
While GAO acknowledged the law had been ignored , it did not say whether the President 's signing statement had played a factor in that act of omission .
" Although we found the agencies did not execute the provisions as enacted , we cannot conclude that agency noncompliance was the result of the Presidents signing statements , " Kepplinger wrote .
The GAO 's full report to Congress can be downloaded at this link .
A bill authored by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that would stiffen criminal penalties in copyright cases has sparked a furor , but if history is any indication it may face a tough haul in Congress .
Before the Intellectual Property Protection
Act of 2007 can even go to Congress , it will need to be sponsored by a member of the House or Senate .
The Justice Department has yet to find a sponsor , although it 's hoping that a meeting with Hill staffers will flush one out .
And while the DOJ claims to have bipartisan support for its bill , a similar measure introduced last year failed to make it to a vote .
" We 're still reviewing the bill , but based on our initial review , we have some concerns , " said Corynne McSherry , a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" One of our biggest concerns is that it criminalizes attempted copyright infringement . "
McSherry said this is unprecedented in copyright law , and noted that the bill is ambiguous : " It ’s not totally clear what would count as attempting copyright infringement . "
Essentially , the bill would turn copyright law into something more akin to existing drug laws :
The government could seize personal property , wiretaps would become legal for the first time , violators could face life in prison and , in an ambiguous and far - reaching provision , the mere attempt to violate a copyright would become a crime .
The Intellectual Property Protection
Act of 2007 , proposed by Gonzales on Monday , would amend current U.S. copyright law to give the government far more power to investigate and prosecute cases , expand the scope of what constitutes a criminal act , and would stiffen penalties , including adding life terms for those whose activities cause death .
Among the proposed changes , the bill would make it easier to charge someone as a repeat offender and stiffen the penalty for recidivism .
It would expand forfeiture provisions to allow the government to seize any property used in the commission of a crime – a PC , a home , cash on hand .
Exporting pirated material would also become a crime and the bill would grant the feds wiretapping authority , which it currently lacks .
The " attempt " provision , stipulating that mere intent constitutes a crime , means that the law could conceivably be expanded to interpret a computer full of music next to a spindle of blank CDs as an act of piracy .
The legislation ’s most eye - catching provision dramatically increases the penalties for criminal activities that cause harm or death – such as hawking bogus Lipitor or adding a fake " UL " logo to a power cable that does n't meet Underwriters Laboratories ' safety standards .
Actions that knowingly or recklessly cause bodily harm would result in jail terms of up to 20 years , while those causing death could send a defendant away for life .
Speaking on background at a conference call Monday , a senior Justice Department official noted that the penalty provision could include all manner of pirated goods " from counterfeit pharmaceuticals , counterfeit auto parts , aircraft parts – anything , really , that would endanger life or limb . "
The bill would also criminalize the intent to commit copyright crimes , which the Justice Department claims brings copyright more in line with other criminal laws .
Currently , a crime actually has to have occurred in order for prosecutors to bring a case .
The new legislation would criminalize the mere attempt .
" ( If ) in an investigation we find a big warehouse of DVDs but we can’t prove necessarily that they were actually distributed or sold , then as long as we see evidence we can charge those folks for attempt , " the DOJ official said .
Yet , expanding the government 's power to prosecute those who merely attempt or intend to violate copyrights raises a red flag , some critics say .
Not surprisingly , the music labels and Hollywood are expected to endorse the proposed legislation .
After all , it 's similar to last year 's copyright bill that had the backing of Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) , the Software and Information Industry Association and the RIAA .
And it 's likely that Smith , the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary committee , will back Gonzales ' bill .
An RIAA representative said the organization had not reviewed the bill and could n’t comment .
The MPAA is also still analyzing the proposed legislation , according to Gayle Osterberg , an MPAA vice president .
However , she did offer boilerplate support for the process , if not the bill itself .
" We very much appreciate the department 's ongoing commitment to intellectual property protection and look forward to working with the department and Congress as the process moves ahead , " she said .
If the bill does make it into law , you may want to think about moving those CDs just a little farther from your computer .

The Two Switches Friday , 05/30/03 07:17 AM
This post follows up two previous posts , Moving Mount Fuji and The $ 21 Question .
Please see them for background if you 're interested .
I solved it !
And it is great !!
The infamous " two switches " puzzle does have a solution , and it is n't a trick ; it is a pure logic puzzle .
Actually it is a great logic puzzle , because after you work out the solution , you discover a little teeny crummy thing that makes the solution not the solution , and then you have to figure out a way around it .
Excellent .
So , first , here 's the puzzle [ courtesy of tech Interview ] :
The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive .
He tells them , " You may meet today and plan a strategy .
But after today , you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another .
" In the prison is a switch room , which contains two light switches labeled A and B , each of which can be in either the ' on ' or the ' off ' position .
I am not telling you their present positions .
The switches are not connected to anything .
" After today , from time to time whenever I feel so inclined , I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room .
This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position .
He must move one , but only one of the switches .
He can't move both but he can't move none either .
Then he 'll be led back to his cell .
" No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there , and he 'll be instructed to do the same thing .
I 'm going to choose prisoners at random .
I may choose the same guy three times in a row , or I may jump around and come back .
" But , given enough time , everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else .
At any time anyone of you may declare to me , 'we have all visited the switch room ' and be 100 % sure .
" If it is true , then you will all be set free .
If it is false , and somebody has not yet visited the switch room , you will be fed to the alligators . "
What is the strategy they come up with so that they can be free ?
I actually think this puzzle is too hard to give in a technical interview .
Perhaps many of you are thinking " what 's he talking about , that puzzle was trivial " (!)
But for me this was a three - bike - ride puzzle , and although some candidates might really enjoy puzzling it out , to expect them to figure it out in fifteen minutes is unrealistic .
( As we noted before in Moving Mount Fuji , you want to use puzzles which all good candidates can solve , so as to detect bad candidates . )
Okay , on to the solution .
First let me give the " correct except for a little teeny crummy thing " solution : The Almost Right solution
The prisoners get together and nominate one prisoner as the " leader " .
All the other prisoners are equivalent .
The leader is going to count how many different prisoners have visited the switch room .
When the count equals the number of prisoners , he goes to the warden and says " all the prisoners have visited " , and everyone goes free .
Here 's the strategy for the followers and the leader : Visit by a follower :
If switch A is on , toggle switch B .
If switch A is off and you have not previously toggled switch A , toggle it on , otherwise toggle switch B .
If switch A is off and you have previously toggled switch A , toggle switch B. Visit by the leader :
If switch A is off , toggle switch B .
If switch A is on , toggle it to off .
Increment the count of prisoners .
That 's it !
Each prisoner will toggle switch A on exactly once .
Only the leader can toggle switch A off , and he will count each time he does so .
Each time switch A is on it means a different prisoner has toggled it .
When the count equals the number of prisoners , you 're done !
This works because only the leader turns switch A off .
Only the followers turn switch A on , and they only do it once each .
The key is that each prisoner can remember whether they 've previously toggled switch A . Each time the leader turns switch A off , one more new follower has visited .
Note that the switch room basically has one state , held by switch A .
The only purpose of switch B is to give each prisoner something to toggle if they do n't want to change the state of switch A . Make sure you understand my convoluted explanation before going on .
Hopefully you will have clear that the switch room holds one state , and how the leader and the followers interact .
The problem with the Almost Right solution A key complication in the puzzle is that the initial state is not known .
If the initial state were known - let 's say the switches were both off - then there would not be a problem , and we'd be done .
But this complication actually means the strategy outlined above wo n't work exactly right .
Here 's why .
The initial state of switch A can be either off or on .
If switch A is off , there is no problem .
If a follower visits first , they 'll toggle switch A on , and when the leader visits , he 'll toggle switch A to off and the count will be one .
If the leader visits first he 'll do nothing since switch A is already off .
All will be cool .
But if the initial state of switch A is on , then there 's a problem .
Nothing will happen until the leader visits , and he 'll toggle switch A off and set the count to one .
But - his count will be off by one !
The leader cannot tell the difference between ' initial state off , one follower visited ' and ' initial state on , zero followers visited ' .
This matters because if the leader is off by one , he 'll either wait forever for a last follower who does n't exist ( prisoners remain prisoners ) , or he 'll tell the warden everyone has visited when one prisoner still has n't ( prisoners fed to alligators ) .
So - what to do ?
The crux of the complication is that the leader can't know whether the first " switch A on " was created by a follower .
So the solution has to be - nobody can do anything until the leader has visited at least once .
The Right solution
The prisoners get together and nominate one prisoner as the " leader " .
All the other prisoners are equivalent .
The leader is going to count how many different prisoners have visited the switch room .
When the count equals the number of prisoners , he goes to the warden and says " all the prisoners have visited " , and everyone goes free .
Here 's the strategy for the leader and the followers : Visit by a follower :
If switch A is on , toggle switch B .
If switch A is off and you have not previously toggled switch A , and you have previously seen switch A on , toggle it on , otherwise toggle switch B .
, toggle it on , otherwise toggle switch B .
If switch A is off and you have previously toggled switch A , toggle switch B. Visit by the leader :
If switch A is off , toggle it on .
.
If switch A is on , toggle it off .
If you did not turn switch A on during your previous visit , increment the count of prisoners .
The additions to the strategy are italicized .
Each follower must remember two things , 1 ) whether they 've seen switch A on during any previous visit , and 2 ) whether they 've previously toggled switch A .
They must have seen switch A on before toggling it on themselves , and they will only toggle it on once .
The leader must remember two things also , 1 ) whether he toggled switch A on during his previous visit , and 2 ) the current count of followers who have toggled switch A .
To see how this handles the initial state complication , let 's consider the possibilities .
If the initial state of switch A is off , then nothing will happen until the leader visits , because no follower will have previously seen an on state .
If the initial state of switch A is on , then again nothing will happen until the leader visits , because only he can turn switch A off .
Since nothing happens until the leader visits , the initial state ambiguity is settled ; the leader can be sure that the state of switch A has not been disturbed since the start .
So there you have it - a terrific logic puzzle , with a depth that is belied by the apparent simplicity of the situation .
Note that the solution would be the same no matter how many prisoners there were - I do n't know if asking the question with 1000 prisoners or n prisoners would have made it easier .
( Somehow the number 23 suggests a specific value , does n't it ? )
Someone in Nigera apparently read my most recent post , because I got a hillarious piece of Nigerian spam on the subject of quantum mechanics :
I am Civ Opopekim , the only son of the late Professor Lawrence Opopekim , of a much respected university in my country of NIGERIA , who was dedicated to the study of RETROCAUSALITY .
Upon examining my father 's scientific journals , I have discovered a matter of the most URGENT importance to your future ( and past ) well - being .
As most of my father 's work has not yet been published , I am counting on your discretion in this sensitive matter .
In the course of research , my father discovered the photons created in his experiments were entangled through QUANTUM MECHANICS with photons found in your locale .
Further study revealed the break - through discovery of photon tilt patterns in the photons of your area based on experiments planned but yet to be performed by my father .
Alas since my father was poisoned to death with tainted YAK MILK by scientists from rival laboratories who lured him to GENEVA under the false pretense of a scientific conference , a financial situation has arisen where I can no longer assure the continuation of his research or the operation of his laboratory ( it embarrasses me to admit this sad truth ) .
As a person of science , you are aware that even changes at the quantum level cause universes to take separate but parallel infinite paths .
I fear that if I am unable to continue my father 's schedule of experiments and therefore cause the photons in your immediate area to not have tilted in the way they already have , the life you have come to know and enjoy will cease to be and you will find yourself in a parallel existence unfavorable to you .
To this end , and for the sake of your past and current self as well as my father 's research , I humbly ask you for the sum of US $ 10,000 , which will allow me to keep for father 's laboratory open for a time to carry out the scheduled experiments .
As an indication of your willingness , please forward to me your : full name , company , full contact address , phone , cell , fax , city , sate , zip code , occupation , SSN and all the necessary information will be sent to you on the acceptance of this arrangement .

Gabun Geistlicher will übers Wasser laufen - und ertrinkt
Zwanzig Minuten dauert es normalerweise , die Mündung des Flusses Komo in Gabun mit dem Schiff zu überqueren .
Ein junger Geistlicher wollte es nun ohne Transportmittel versuchen - und jesusgleich über das Wasser wandeln .
Sein Vorhaben endete tragisch .
The golden eagle chick is five weeks old
Two chicks were hatched in a remote area of the Glenveagh National Park in County Donegal but one of the young birds died after five days .
There will be a further nervous wait to see if the remaining chick can continue to grow and fledge in late July .
Golden eagles last bred in Glenveagh back in 1910 .
The bird had become extinct in Ireland but was reintroduced at Glenveagh six years ago in an effort to reintroduce the bird to Ireland .
The new chick , whose father is from Skye and mother from Sutherland , is now just five weeks old .
Project manager for the Golden Eagle Trust Lorcan O'Toole said he was delighted at the news .
" We think it is a girl but we are not quite sure .
It is still relatively small , " he explained .
" Eagle chicks are quite vulnerable but she will quickly grow . "
The trust has been monitoring the birds in Donegal for the last five or six years .
' Milestone '
Eggs are normally laid around mid March and take six weeks to hatch .
This first wild golden eagle is described by conservationists as a milestone in efforts to reverse the decline of native animal and plant species in Ireland .
" Emotionally we are just delighted to have such a wild creature breeding in Ireland once again , " Mr O'Toole said .
" Golden eagles would have been quite a common sight , 300 or 400 years ago .
But they have had a pretty poor history for the last two to three centuries .
" We just feel that it is a good omen and it bodes well for the future where we can all maybe show more awareness of our landscape . "
The birds were recently reintroduced to Ireland from Scotland with the assistance of various enthusiasts .
In Scotland , under wise management , there are still 420 pairs of golden eagles .
But the eagles have died out in Wales and the few remaining English eagles can only be found in the Lake District .
" Maybe if there is a bit more tolerance of wildlife , we can see some of these species return to their former haunts , " Mr O'Toole said .
ON THE JOB / Profiting from profiling :
The nice life of a female dealer
The Latino drug dealers on the sidewalk below " Jennifer 's " apartment in the Mission keep getting arrested .
Not once a year or even every few months , but constantly .
( If the government wanted to be efficient , it would just have its mail carriers do the arresting , since they 're there anyway . )
Off to jail they go , and then others fill their place , and then the first ones get released , and all the while the dealing continues .
Jennifer , who is white , and who dresses tidily and arranges flowers for a popular art gallery , talks about the dealers with clear discomfort .
Not because they 're troublesome or violent .
It 's more that she feels guilty .
The police never arrest her .
Jennifer enjoys the flower arranging , but mostly it functions as a legitimate income to show the IRS .
Really , she 's a marijuana dealer .
In many ways , Jennifer 's a typical one for the Bay Area :
She sells a relatively small amount , she sells almost exclusively to friends and she draws a line between pot and harder drugs .
What 's atypical is that she 's a middle - class she .
Drug dealing has been dominated by men , historically .
It 's a glass ceiling that , ironically , has worked in Jennifer 's favor : Police zero in on those who comprise the bulk of the industry and tend to overlook anomalies like Jennifer , who have typically been left out .
It also helps that she looks like she does n't need the money .
" It 's a double standard , " Jennifer says about her neighborhood dealers , forever getting arrested .
" I probably earn twice as much as them . "
And so it is that , even in drug dealing , certain grim American truths persist :
The rich will get richer , the poor will struggle and run into trouble , and struggle all the more desperately .
Paloma Sales is the director of an ongoing study of women and drug markets in San Francisco at the Institute for Scientific Analysis ; when it 's over , 160 of the city 's female drug sellers will have been interviewed .
The vast majority , Sales says , started dealing to support their families and often feel they have no alternative .
( This is different from male dealers , she says , who tend to be more invested in the perceived glory and status of it . )
Feeling the economy 's pinch , women are entering the drug market more -- and at earlier ages -- than ever before .
Compared to the risks a street dealer faces , a middle - class dealer like Jennifer tends to be well protected .
" They have the resources to hide their activities better and a safety net should they be caught -- they can pay bail -- and enough capital that they can leave the profession if they want without jeopardizing their own survival , " Sales says .
The middle - class pot seller is hardly a new creation .
Showtime 's " Weeds , " for instance , has tried to portray this alternative to the more familiar image of a dealer .
But as with the average low - income dealer , the show 's suburban - mom protagonist is driven to sell drugs by economic circumstances largely beyond her control .
As with the poorer women in Sales ' study , the dealing supports the family .
But what about Jennifer , who 's not supporting kids or paying a mortgage ?
What to make of her special variety of dealer , existing as she does in this funny kind of margin ?
She 's a minority in the business because of her gender and class , but also an exception to the kind of desperate street dealer who gets a sliver of public sympathy for his or her plight .
In a way , a middle - class woman selling marijuana from her apartment runs more counter to societal values than a poor man doing so on the street .
And yet he 's the one who gets arrested .
If it 's any consolation to her , the pay 's good .
In fact , this is where I tell you to sit down .
And to clear away any thoughts about how many hours you spent last week at work , how much you spent on the education that landed you this work or how little you get paid to do it .
Jennifer is 20 and figures she earns about $ 500 for an hour 's work .
I do n't mean to sound hayseed about this drug - dealing thing .
It 's not that I find the job particularly extraordinary ; it 's more that it 's so common , and has so long been a fixture of the landscape , that I never really bothered to ask certain questions -- not unlike a bus driver , maybe .
So on a recent weekday in Dolores Park with Jennifer , I poked and prodded :
What 's the lifestyle like ?
Is it scary ?
Do you get Ferrari - rich , or is that just a stubborn old " Miami Vice " myth ?
And at some level , should I be considering a career change ?
Drug dealer has a disagreeable ring to it , plus what do you tell your grandmother ?
But $ 500 an hour ?
And a 15 - to - 20 - second commute , depending on how quickly she walks from the bedroom to the living room ?
Jennifer 's in - box is not slowly elevating her blood pressure ; she does not watch her youth slip away in endless branding meetings .
Often she works just an hour a week , plus a few hours for flower arranging or other part - time jobs .
Grandmother , we might need to talk .
Jennifer 's current career began , as many of ours do , by accident .
She was sharing a San Francisco apartment with someone who , it turned out , was selling pot .
He had a small but reliable client base .
In the film version , he is to be played by an incautious Leonardo DiCaprio with dollar signs in his eyes :
He decided he could be earning more .
Without warning he picked up and moved to Oregon , where lore had it he could grow and sell his own pot with impunity .
Marijuana customers are like any other shoppers :
When one day the store is shuttered , they want a cardboard sign with a smiley face to direct them to the new location .
Jennifer 's roommate left no helpful instructions , and eventually his own supplier asked Jennifer if she wanted to inherit the business .
It had never occurred to her , and she was n't even a pothead , but she 'd seen how easy the money came .
In a life - is - short moment , she agreed to give it a try .
( As Sales says , inheriting the business from a man is how most women get their start . )
That was a year ago , and so far it 's gone off without a hitch .
What she 's learned is that the movies have it even more wrong than she 'd thought .
Is there risk ?
Certainly .
But she believes a woman like her -- in a city like this -- need n't worry much .
Sure , there are industry hazards :
Once her dog ate six of her brownies and spent a dazed week in the pet hospital .
But other than cutting edibles from her lineup , precautions are minimal .
She does n't take her products on BART or MUNI .
She only sells out of her apartment and only to close friends .
When the customers come to buy , she tries to keep them around a while so that a suspicious stream of visitors is n't coming and going .
Her scale , money and pot are kept in three different parts of her apartment .
She never has more than two ounces with her at a given time .
" To be honest , I do n't understand why someone living in San Francisco would n't sell pot .
I probably know 15 small dealers off the top of my head -- all guys , of course -- and I 've never , ever heard of one getting busted , " she says .
Of course , this says as much about the different strata of pot dealers as it says about Bay Area law enforcement .
Poorer women are getting arrested .
Certainly police focus far more on scary drugs like meth than relatively harmless ones .
But women are going to prison for all kinds -- in fact , they 're the fastest - growing segment of the prison population .
For Jennifer , there 's no particular thrill in breaking the law ; rather , the law seems more like a pesky anachronism that will eventually catch up with reality .
Every few months , after all , another study confirms that marijuana 's not remotely as harmful as the " war on drugs " suggests -- a war , in turn , that strikes many as far more deleterious than at least some of the drugs it aims to eliminate .
Still , Jennifer is not without common sense , and when one of her customers started to seem hooked , she cut him off .
Of course , Jennifer 's circumstances allow her this sort of flexibility .
If she put in a little effort , she says , it would n't be hard to bring in $ 2,000 a week .
Her clients ?
Conservatory of Music students .
Customers and employees from various bars and cafes in the Mission .
Friends she meets at work .

Pinned inside an overturned Ford Explorer on Interstate 5 in Bakersfield , Gabriel Koloszar looked up to see her friend Paulo Aguilar hanging unconscious from his seat belt , his blood dripping down on her .
Rescuers pulled Koloszar out through the windshield .
When she tried to stand , another passenger cried out : " Oh my God , Gabby .
Your feet ! "
Only then , she recalled , did she look down to see her mangled flesh .
The trauma of that morning turned to outrage after Koloszar and Aguilar sued U - Haul International Inc. , alleging that the accident was caused by a defective tire on the trailer they had been towing .
When their attorneys sought to inspect the tire and rim , they were told that would be impossible .
The evidence had disappeared .
A Kern County Superior Court judge declared in December that he would sanction U - Haul for " extreme negligence " in losing the evidence .
Two weeks later , a federal judge in Ohio penalized U - Haul for similar conduct in a separate case .
U - Haul , the leader of the do - it - yourself moving industry , has repeatedly lost , altered or discarded truck and trailer parts sought by injured customers who sued the company , a Times investigation found .
In some cases , the company scrapped or repaired damaged parts in defiance of court orders that they be preserved as evidence .
At least twice , judges have imposed on U - Haul an exceedingly rare and severe sanction for misconduct in a civil case : throwing out the company 's defense and entering judgments in favor of plaintiffs who needed the missing evidence to pursue their claims .
U - Haul said that the few instances of lost or spoiled evidence were purely accidental and that " the complexity of managing equipment across thousands of locations " sometimes led to mistakes .
Although it is not uncommon for parties in litigation to be accused of destroying or discarding documents , legal experts said it is unusual for it to happen with physical evidence .
It is unknown how many times this has occurred in lawsuits against U - Haul .
No independent source gathers information on such cases .
U - Haul said judges had sanctioned it for spoiling evidence in " at best , a handful of cases " and had never ruled that it had done so intentionally .
Asked for a list of those cases , U - Haul said : " We do not have such a list . "
From interviews with plaintiffs ' lawyers and court records , The Times identified 11 instances since 1989 in which records show that U - Haul lost , altered or discarded evidence .
Judges sanctioned the company in some of those cases .
In the others , plaintiffs did not seek sanctions , or the cases were settled before courts could rule on motions for sanctions .
U - Haul said that it has been sued more than 10,000 times over the last 20 years and that the few examples of sanctions should be viewed in that context .
They " do not constitute a pattern of destruction of evidence , " said Edward J. " Joe " Shoen , chairman of U - Haul and its parent company , Amerco Inc .
Shoen said that as a lawyer , he is particularly sensitive to the need to preserve evidence and that destroying it would not be in U - Haul 's interest .
" It 's about the worst thing you can have happen in a lawsuit , " he said .
" You 've just dug yourself a hole because now everyone assumes the worst . "
Companies have a duty to preserve evidence not only when a suit has been filed , but also when they know one is likely due to injuries or deaths .
Even the inadvertent loss or destruction of evidence may be punished by the courts because it can deprive the other side of a chance to prove its case .
U - Haul said it has strengthened its evidence protection in recent years by requiring its agents to obtain the legal department 's approval before putting equipment from accidents back in service .
The company declined to provide a copy of the policy .
Dale A. Oesterle , a business law professor at Ohio State University , said an occasional failure to preserve evidence " may not be an indictment of corporate policy or corporate attitude .
I do n't think you can expect a corporation to have a perfect record . "
But Jonathan Turley , a George Washington University law professor , said that after losing evidence once or twice , a company would be expected to put a stop to it .
" If the company had been previously sanctioned for this conduct , it 's hard to imagine a good - faith reason why " it would continue , he said .
" This is something I 've never heard of not with a major company . "
' MISSING IN ACTION '
At the wheel of his Explorer on Labor Day weekend 2002 , Aguilar was heading home with Koloszar and two other friends from the Burning Man counterculture festival in the Nevada desert .
Their camping gear stashed behind them in a U - Haul trailer , they were about 100 miles north of Los Angeles when the Explorer flipped and rolled , coming to rest in the median of I - 5 .
Aguilar , an insurance agent who was 20 and living in North Hollywood , suffered a fractured skull and a broken vertebra in his neck , which required two surgeries to repair .
Koloszar , then 24 , was hospitalized for two months for treatment of foot injuries , which required multiple surgeries and skin grafts .
She was left with deep scars , diminished sensation in her feet and more than $ 700,000 in medical bills .
She and Aguilar each sued U - Haul , contending that a worn tire on the trailer suddenly deflated , causing the trailer and the Explorer to veer to the left .
Koloszar 's suit also named Ford Motor Co. , asserting that the SUV 's instability contributed to the crash .
In a deposition , a U - Haul manager acknowledged that the trailer should never have been rented because there was almost no tread in the middle of one of its tires .
Even so , U - Haul denied this caused the wreck , citing a police report that Aguilar allowed the Explorer to drift and then overcorrected the steering .
Soon after the accident , a plaintiff 's expert got a brief look at the suspect tire and rim .
U - Haul said it stored the components at a company shop in Bakersfield , with a sign saying they should not be disturbed .
But in August 2005 , after months of requests by the plaintiffs ' lawyers to examine the parts more thoroughly , U - Haul reported that they had vanished .
" As to the tires , wheels and / or rims , " a U - Haul lawyer said in a letter , " I am told that they are missing in action . "
The company said in court papers that a former employee who burglarized the Bakersfield shop had probably stolen or junked the tire and rim — making the company the victim .
" If the tire and wheel were indeed stolen , " the company said , " this was a criminal act against U - Haul . "
Given its " diligent effort " to preserve the evidence , the loss of the parts was at worst " merely negligent " and not deliberate , U - Haul said .
" How convenient for them , " said Koloszar , who now lives in Berkeley .
" Is n't it ironic that you would just lose a key piece of evidence ?
They claim it to be stolen , but who would really steal a busted tire and rim ? "
Citing other cases in which U - Haul had lost evidence , Koloszar 's attorneys asked Kern County Superior Court Judge Louis P. Etcheverry to punish the company .
" U- Haul has an established pattern and practice of discovery abuse , including conveniently losing critical evidence , and the practice continues in spite of U - Haul having been previously sanctioned by other courts for its conduct , " the lawyers said .
Etcheverry said in December that because of U - Haul 's " extreme negligence , " he would impose sanctions before the trial , which had been scheduled for July .
" Otherwise , " he said , " you are encouraging everybody just to deep - six the evidence . "
The threat of sanctions was removed last week , when Koloszar reached a confidential settlement with U - Haul and Ford .
Aguilar also settled his suit .
James Rouse , a lawyer for Koloszar , said the impending sanctions were " a substantial motivating factor in bringing U - Haul to the table . "
Steve Taub , U - Haul 's assistant general counsel , responded : " While Mr. Rouse is entitled to his opinion , he is incorrect . "
Late last year , a federal judge in Ohio sanctioned U - Haul for a similar lapse .
Christian S. Strong , Mindy Swegles and Brian Hunzicker were returning to Kentucky from a Florida vacation in May 2002 when a U - Haul motorcycle trailer they were towing swerved and their Explorer overturned on a Tennessee highway .
Strong and Swegles had recently graduated from college and became engaged in Florida .
Hunzicker and Strong were best friends .
Swegles , then 23 , who was driving without her seat belt fastened , suffered fractures and a head injury that her physicians said left her brain - damaged and unable to pursue a teaching career .
A suit filed by Swegles and her two passengers said a defective trailer axle damaged a tire and caused the crash .
U - Haul blamed Swegles for inattentive driving and going too fast .
Soon after the accident , the plaintiffs ' experts inspected the trailer 's tires and rims at a U - Haul storage site in Knoxville , Tenn .
But when it came time for further testing in July 2004 at a lab in Columbus , Ohio , the trailer arrived minus the tires and rims .
" I thought it very odd , given the fact that the trailer clearly had an ' evidence hold ' tag on it , " said William A. Posey , who represented the plaintiffs .
" While they say they have policies and procedures to protect evidence , clearly they do n't . "
On Dec. 28 , days before the trial , U.S. District Judge Michael Watson sanctioned U - Haul by excluding some of the expert testimony it planned to present .
Noting that U - Haul 's lawyers " suggested that the tires and rims were salvaged for use on another trailer , " Watson concluded : " Whatever steps defendants took to protect the trailer and its parts were obviously inadequate . "
Watson later punished U - Haul again after its lawyer violated his order by telling the jury that the plaintiffs could not support their case with physical evidence .
The judge said the lawyer 's conduct was " unbelievable , " given that U - Haul had lost the trailer parts .
Watson told jurors they could infer that the lost evidence would have been " unfavorable to the defendants . "
In February , the jury found that the trailer was not defective but awarded the plaintiffs nearly $ 2.6 million in damages because of U - Haul 's failure to advise them to drive slowly and take other precautions .
To prevent destruction of U - Haul equipment , plaintiffs ' attorneys obtained a court order within days of a 1995 rollover in Wyoming that killed Donna Jean Cullen .
The order barred U - Haul from " disturbing or altering " the equipment she had rented : a tow dolly for hauling a second vehicle .
Cullen , 32 , of Helena , Mont. , was pulling an Isuzu Trooper behind her Mazda pickup , a combination that violated U - Haul 's own safety rules for tow dollies .
The rules say that to ensure stability , the lead vehicle must weigh at least 750 pounds more than the vehicle being towed .
The Mazda and Trooper were nearly the same weight .
According to a suit filed by her family , Cullen was northbound on Interstate 25 in northern Wyoming " when the towed Isuzu Trooper began to sway uncontrollably from side to side , " causing both vehicles to skid sideways and flip over .
Documents filed in court showed the dolly had undergone extensive repairs days before it was rented to Cullen .
The company moved the dolly from a wrecking yard in Casper , Wyo. , to U - Haul offices in Denver to conduct examinations , actions permitted by the court .
Within 45 days , the dolly was to be turned over to Cullen 's lawyers .
When the deadline passed and the plaintiffs demanded to know the whereabouts of the dolly , a company lawyer informed them that it had been repaired and returned to service .
" When you have a court order , " said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers , " bells and whistles should go off , and everything should stop . "
U - Haul said its violation was " inadvertent " and caused little harm to the plaintiffs because their investigator had photographed the dolly before it was put back on the road .
But courts sanctioned U - Haul for obstructing the plaintiffs ' efforts to learn the dolly 's repair history and why it was not preserved as evidence .
The company was ordered to reimburse fees and expenses of the Cullen family 's lawyers .
U - Haul settled the case with a confidential payment in 1999 .
' YEARS OF TORTURE '
Judges have decided at least twice that U - Haul 's conduct in losing evidence was egregious enough to warrant striking the company 's defenses and entering verdicts in favor of its opponents .
One instance involved a suit filed by Vivian Cabasso after she was severely injured in a 1995 accident .
Cabasso's fiance , Lee Goldberg , had rented a U - Haul trailer to move his belongings from Florida to New York .
On a downhill stretch of Interstate 77 in Statesville , N.C. , the trailer began to sway .
" I looked out , and the trailer is coming up beside me and it's just going side to side , " Goldberg recalled .
" It just took control of the entire vehicle and flipped us over . "
They rolled several times .
Goldberg escaped with minor injuries , but Cabasso , then 49 and a mother of two , suffered a fractured skull , broken neck and shattered arm .
She required years of rehabilitation .
In her lawsuit , Cabasso maintained that inoperable trailer brakes caused the wreck .
U - Haul said the brakes worked and Goldberg was at fault .
Soon after the accident , a U - Haul expert examined the braking system .
But over the next several years , the company failed to comply with court orders requiring that Cabasso's experts be given access to the trailer , court records show .
At one point , U - Haul said it was trying to pin down the address where the trailer was being stored , Cabasso's lawyers said in a court filing .
In reality , the lawyers said , the trailer was left " lying outdoors , exposed to the elements " at the same U - Haul yard in North Carolina where the company 's expert had looked at it .
In November 1999 , U - Haul disclosed that the braking system " is no longer mounted on the trailer and its whereabouts are unknown . "
In response , the trial judge struck U - Haul 's defense , effectively deciding the case in Cabasso 's favor .
All that remained was for the jury to decide how much U - Haul should have to pay in damages .
A New York state appeals court affirmed the ruling in 2001 .
To avoid a trial on damages , U - Haul settled the suit with an undisclosed payment .
Goldberg , a lawyer , said he and Cabasso " were astounded " by the disappearance of the brakes .
" It was the pivotal point of the case , and it was gutted . "
Though they ultimately prevailed , Goldberg said U - Haul 's tactics put him and Cabasso through " three or four years of torture . "
In a statement to The Times , U - Haul said it had stored the trailer with an " Evidence Insurance Hold " sticker and could not explain why the brakes were removed .
The company said its expert found that the brakes worked , and that it was " simply illogical " to think it had intentionally trashed helpful evidence .
In 1996 , an Alabama judge struck the company 's defense for violating an order to preserve components of a tow dolly involved in a deadly wreck .
Roger D. Waldon Sr. , 46 , was towing a Mercury Cougar on a dolly behind his Dodge truck when he lost control , crashed , and was thrown from his pickup and fatally injured .
Waldon 's son sued U - Haul , claiming that the dolly was defective .
Six days after the accident , plaintiff lawyers obtained a court order barring U - Haul from altering the dolly or removing it from a wrecking yard .
The judge later amended the order to allow U - Haul to transfer the dolly to a warehouse .
But he ordered U - Haul " not to remove , loosen , adjust , disassemble or alter any of the components . "
Inspecting the dolly , plaintiffs ' experts found worn tire straps and a broken hook — proof , they said , that the device had been rented in a dangerous condition .
But when the dolly arrived at a metallurgical lab for further testing , the suspect components were gone .
Walker County Circuit Judge John L. Madison issued a default judgment against U - Haul , ruling that " the only issue remaining is that of damages for the unlawful homicide which did occur directly as a result of the wrongful acts " of U - Haul .
As in the Cabasso case , U - Haul avoided a trial on damages by settling the suit for an undisclosed sum .
In a statement , U - Haul said it was " not clear and it was never established how the evidence was lost . "
But the company said it was " appropriately sanctioned " because Waldon " could no longer prosecute his claim in the absence of the trailer . "
WITHHOLDING DATA
Judges have sanctioned U - Haul in other lawsuits for withholding information , such as lists of previous accidents that might show its awareness of hazards .
That 's what happened in the case of Donald Marx .
As Marx , then 40 , was getting his tank filled at a gas station in Grants Pass , Ore. , a rented U - Haul truck waiting behind him lurched forward , crushing his leg against his own vehicle .
Lawyers for Marx and the driver of the U - Haul said the truck slipped out of park because of a faulty transmission .
U - Haul blamed the accident on driver error , noting that a police officer at the scene drove the truck and found nothing wrong with the transmission .
Listening to lawyers at an August 2001 hearing , Oregon judge Robert W. Redding was not pleased .
Marx 's lawyers complained that U - Haul had tried to deceive them by making the truck available for testing without disclosing that the transmission had been replaced .
Marx 's lawyers discovered this some time after taking the truck to a transmission specialist who found no defects .
The hearing brought forth other complaints of stonewalling , including U - Haul 's failure to comply with a court order to disclose other reports of trucks moving while in park .
Redding fined U - Haul $ 10,000 and warned that if the case went to trial , he would allow Marx 's lawyers to put in evidence an internal document known as the " dumb shit " memo .
The memo , described by the judge as " that tasteless piece of literature , " was written by U - Haul founder L.S. Shoen , company chairman from 1945 to 1986 .
In the 1976 memo , Shoen coached U - Haul managers to be as unhelpful as possible to a plaintiff 's " hired gun " lawyer if called to testify .
Do n't lie , he said , but embrace the fleeting nature of memory .
" After 48 hours the memory curve drops off to approximately 10 % of what we originally saw or heard , " he wrote .
" So the first rule is to realize that you are a ' dumb shit ' and be glad that you are . "
U - Haul settled the Marx case in 2002 for an undisclosed sum .
Steve Taub , U - Haul 's assistant general counsel , described Shoen 's memo as " simply a folksy — and sensible — reminder that if you do not know the answer to a question , then say you do not know .
This is the same advice given to witnesses every day by lawyers . "
Taub added : " All witnesses who testify on our behalf are instructed to tell the truth . "
In Los Angeles , U - Haul 's resistance to pretrial discovery brought a judge 's anger to a boil in February 2003 .
L.A. County Superior Court Judge Susan Bryant - Deason was presiding in a suit filed by Fortino and Susana Figueroa after a 2001 crash that left him a quadriplegic and her with leg fractures .
The Figueroas lost control of their Ford Explorer while using a U - Haul dolly to tow a pickup .
U - Haul repeatedly switched defense counsel , causing delays and frustrating attempts by the Figueroas ' lawyers to test the dolly and obtain U - Haul documents .
Among other things , U - Haul resisted requests for a list of incidents in which people had been killed or injured in wrecks involving dollies .
Bryant - Deason said some of U - Haul 's objections were " just ridiculous . "
When the company failed to meet her deadlines , the judge imposed a $ 25,000 fine for " repeated , repeated , repeated violations " of her orders .
Bryant - Deason also struck some of the company 's defenses .
U - Haul settled the case in May 2003 for $ 1.6 million , court records show .
Ford Motor Co. paid an $ 880,000 settlement .
Three months later , an Arizona judge sanctioned U - Haul in a wrongful - death suit after finding that it had provided different accident lists to plaintiffs in separate tow dolly cases .
The Arizona suit stemmed from a 1999 wreck that killed Maria Lozano - Millan , her 7 - year - old son and her sister .
In response to the plaintiffs ' requests , U - Haul furnished reports of 168 previous tow dolly wrecks .
One of the lawyers , John A. Commerford , noticed discrepancies between the list and those produced in two other cases .
" The idea they would play games with discovery when there are three families who are absolutely crushed and destroyed was beyond the pale , " Commerford said .
State Superior Court Judge Anna M. Montoya - Paez ordered U - Haul to pay $ 10,000 in sanctions in August 2003 and warned that future abuse of discovery rules could result in a $ 100,000 fine .
U - Haul settled the case for a confidential sum .
Commenting on the Figueroa and Lozano - Millan cases , U - Haul attorney Taub said that in each case the court was justified in imposing sanctions .
" We paid the price for it , " Taub said .
" It 's not the way we litigate now . "
For example , company executives said , U - Haul no longer takes the position that it cannot furnish data on accidents involving its vehicles because the information is under the control of a separate company , Republic Western Insurance Co. U - Haul and Republic Western are both subsidiaries of Amerco .
U - Haul advanced this argument in 1998 in a Canadian suit involving a man who suffered brain damage in a tow dolly crash .
John C. Abromavage , U - Haul 's director of engineering services , testified in that case that he received daily accident data by computer from Republic Western , but could not save it .
He said that after he read the information , it would " disappear " from his screen and he could not retrieve it , court records show .
Justice M.J. Allan of British Columbia Supreme Court said Abromavage 's testimony reflected a " corporate policy of keeping potentially incriminating documents out of the possession of U - Haul " so it would not have to disclose them .
Allan ordered U - Haul to produce accident reports sought by the plaintiff .
U - Haul settled the case before it had finished doing so .
U - Haul General Counsel Larry De Respino said the company has adopted a more cooperative attitude .
U - Haul aims to provide all " reasonable , relevant evidence , " he said , because " we have nothing to hide . "

Who knew it was legal for a woman to walk around with her breasts exposed in New York ?
Well , one woman did – and a cop did n’t – and now she has forced the city to fork over a $ 29,000 legal set tlement for ille gally busting her when she law fully bared her bosom and went for a stroll two years ago .
Jill Coc caro , a 27 - year - old East Village artist who now goes by the name Phoenix Fee ley , went au naturel on Aug.
4 , 2005 , when she pulled down the front of her paint er ’s jumpsuit dur ing an art - show promotion to cool off .
In 1992 a state appeals court ruled that if men could expose their chests in public women could not be pun ished for doing the same .
In 2003 , high - profile law yer Ron Kuby had used the law change to win a $ 10,000 settlement from the city for a model who ’d been busted wearing a thong and body paint to the Coney Island Mer maid Parade .
But that did n’t stop a cop , who spotted Fee ley at about 1:30 a.m. strolling topless on Delancey Street , telling her to cover up .
When Feeley refused – informing the officer she had a legal right to be naked to the waist , just like a man – the of ficer took her into cus tody for indecent exposure .
“ I did not do anything to anyone on that street , I did not harm anyone , ” she recalled .
“ I was so not resisting arrest . ”
But Feeley spent 12 hours in custody before the officer told her the District Attorney ’s Office had declined to press charges .
While she was detained , Feeley claims , an officer yanked her from a patrol car by her hair , that she was taken to Bellevue Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and that cops refused to help her repair her by - then badly ripped jumpsuit .
“ I was asking not to walk around in my underwear and they were not helping me with that , ” she said .
“ By the end of the night I walked out with my shirt off and my pants on . ”
“ The thing the cop did not seem to understand , and what ’s so problematic , was that it was Phoenix who would decide what parts of her body would be exposed , ” said her attorney , Jeffrey Rothman .
The arrest came a day before her young daughter ’s birthday and caused Feeley to miss a Family Court appearance involving her ex-husband .
Feeley said she ’s gone bare - breasted before – after running the 2004 New York City marathon – without cops bothering her .
“ I ’ve always just felt that was something natural , ” Feeley said of baring her breasts .
“ I ’ve kind of always done it out of practicality . ”
She sued the city and the arresting officers last October .
The city agreed to settle , without admitting any fault , on June 4 .
“ I felt like I deserved it , ” Feeley said .

Few Foreign Fighters in Iraq ;
Many are Saudi
Al - Maliki Says Iraqi Troops ready
Manan Ahmed gives further insights into the motivations of the Glasgow bombers .
Ned Parker of the LA Times reports that of 19,000 “ insurgents ” held by the US military in Iraq , only 135 are foreigners .
Think about that when you hear Bush say that the US is fighting “ al - Qaeda ” in Iraq or that “ al - Qaeda ” would take over Iraq if the US left .
The foreigners just are not that important to the guerrilla war .
Only .7 % of detainees are foreigners , and unless they run faster than Iraqis , that is likely their percentage share in the “ insurgency , ” too .
The US is fighting Iraqis in Iraq , who are nationalists of various stripes , whether religious or secular .
They are Sunni .
They have n’t given fealty to Bin Laden and are not “ al - Qaeda . ”
So you ’d think after all the ink spilled on Iranian and Hizbullah contributions to the troubles in Iraq , that they ’d be prominent among the foreign fighters , right ?
Wrong .
It is not clear that the US has any Iranians at all in custody .
There was a big deal made at the NYT about one Lebanese Hizbullah guy who may have been a freelancer .
So if they are n’t from Iran , where are they from ?
Saudi Arabia — 45 %!
Only 15 % are from “ Syria and Lebanon , ” and I ’ll bet you that all but one of those are Sunni. 10 % are from North Africa , which is only about 14 guys .
North Africa is Sunni .
That is , the numbers Parker pulled out of a US officer in Iraq demolish the entire image that the Bush administration and the Washington press corps has been presenting of the war .
Foreign “ al - Qaeda ” is almost irrelevant to it .
Iran is entirely trivial to it .
The Baathist , Allawi - dominated Syrian government is trivial to it .
The Lebanese Hizbullah may not be involved at all , as an organization .
Certainly it is not involved in any significant way .
Which country is providing a lot of foreign suicide bombers ?
US ally Saudi Arabia .
Has any general or Bush administration official called a press conference to denounce Saudi Arabia ?
No. Has Joe Lieberman threatened it with a war ?
No .
Everything is being blamed on Iran because powerful American special interests want to get Iran , regardless of the facts .
There is n’t any significant cadre of foreign “ al - Qaeda ” fighters in Iraq if this is all we could capture .
They ca n’t take over the country because they are such a tiny group .
Everything Bush and Cheney have said about the nature of the war and the supposed dangers of a US withdrawal is transparent falsehood .
Nuri al - Maliki contradicted his Kurdish foreign minister on Saturday , insisting that if US troops withdrew from Iraq , the new Iraqi army and police could keep order .
He did admit the desirability of further training and equipment .
Al - Maliki has all along differed from his political allies on this point .
When he became prime minister in late spring of 2006 he immediately said that Iraq ’s army would be able to take over all security duties within 18 months .
If he still believes that , as seems likely given his comments , that means he thinks they ’ll be ready by January .
What gives a person pause is that al - Maliki ’s Da’wa Party has no militia .
Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , the head of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , has a paramilitary of some 15,000 or more Badr Corps militiamen .
Al - Hakim , who is the one who should be confident of his troops , has repeatedly called for US soldiers to remain in Iraq .
If the Badr Corps , the most disciplined and well trained Arab force in Iraq , cannot do the job in al - Hakim ’s view , then the green and feckless Iraqi military certainly cannot .
So it makes you think al - Maliki is engaging in wishful thinking .
The State Department is requiring personnel to wear body armor when going out to a restaurant inside the Green Zone , e.g .
But our brave foreign service officers have to sleep in un-hardened structures that afford them no protection from incoming rockets .
It is disgraceful and Congress should challenge Condi and Bush about this .
Let ’s write our congressional representatives demanding that our professional diplomats be afforded the basic decency of safe housing immediately .
McClatchy reports that 21 dead bodies were found in Baghdad on Saturday .
It also reports violence in Basra and Diyala province I did not see elsewhere .
Reuters reports other civil war violence in Iraq for Saturday .
Major incidents :
If you do , your distrust may have its roots in your early years - what ideas you were exposed to and from whom .
So say Yale psychologists Paul Bloom and Deena Skolnick Weisberg .
For those who may not wish to read the detailed article , I will summarize here the findings along with some of my own observations .
According to Bloom and Weisberg , resistance to science may stem from several different areas - prevalent religious and political beliefs in the child 's social circle , lack of first hand experience of certain phenomena , intuitive ( and wrong ) take on how things work in the physical world and innate cynicism .
Examples :
Political and religious teachings of elders and those whom we trust can influence how we evaluate science .
Global warming and evolution are two debates over which Americans are starkly divided for political and religious reasons .
Both phenomena require long periods of time to arrive at their present day outcomes and both are difficult to reproduce in the test tube within a short time .
One might be tempted to classify the opposition to them as the lack of first hand experience .
Not quite .
We believe in a lot of things we cannot see or whose presence we cannot verify using our normal physical faculties .
Yet most people irrespective of their religion or politics , accept the reality of germs , electricity and atoms without ever obtaining positive proof of their existence .
There is no active religious or political camp which questions the disease causing nature of pathogens , utility of electricity as a source of energy or the structure of the atom .
For that matter children and adults alike , accept without question faraway geographical ( that there is a continent of Antarctica ) and historical ( that there was an Abraham Lincoln ) facts because there is no controversy surrounding them .
On the other hand , the truth about global warming and evolution is in contention because there are competing narratives rooted in religion and politics to explain ( or dismiss ) both .
Scientists are no longer persecuted or burnt at the stake for their heretical claims but heated debates still rage when science challenges deeply held religious beliefs or flies in the face of political expediency .
What we personally experience trumps our class room and book learning when it comes to our understanding and predicting physical phenomena .
What we learn in theory is often counterintuitive to what we feel and science education alone does not make us immune to making unscientific decisions .
Consider the diagram below of two possible trajectories of a ball exiting a curved pipe .
Laws of physics tell us that the ball will move in a " straight " line after it leaves the curved pipe ( figure A ) .
But even after knowing that , a large number of college undergraduates picked figure B where the ball continues in a circular path .
They instinctively and erroneously applied the " Aristotelian common sense " of object movement , ignoring the correct laws of motion they had read in science books .
However , if the ball is replaced with water , a scenario which most have observed in their backyard while playing with the lawn hose , they correctly predicted a straight path for the exiting water .
Despite the explosion of scientific knowledge in the last century and a half where space travel is routine and NASA 's photographs from outer space are commonly available in most elementary schools , some still believe in a flat earth and a Geo-centric solar system .
The reason for such dogged obscurantism is partly religious and partly due to " instinctive " reaction to what seems counterintuitive to the naked eye .
A spherical and revolving / rotating earth just does n't feel right to some folks .
They continue to ask :
Why do n't the people on the other side fall off ?
Why do n't I feel the earth move ?
Why do I see the sun rise , set and cross the sky ?
Another reason why we resist science is our skepticism about situations where the outcome is either suspect or in dispute , as also our cynicism towards grandiose claims .
This cynicism is on the whole a good thing because scientists have personal biases too and we should not fall prey to false dogmas just because they are " scientific . "
The recent spate of FDA approved drugs being recalled from the market ( not just newly approved ones ) , industrial accidents and pollution , corporations pushing genetically altered food and other scientific developments whose value is clearly questionable , raise our suspicions about science .
Are children skeptical too ?
" Yes " , say Bloom and Weisberg : " ... when five year - olds hear about a competition whose outcome was unclear , they are more likely to believe a character who claimed that he had lost the race ( a statement that goes against his self - interest ) than a character who claimed that he had won the race ( a statement that goes with his self - interest ) .
In a limited sense , then , they are capable of cynicism . "
Then there is the bias of the public against scientists themselves .
Even though individual scientists live among us and lead mundane lives , as a group they tend to conjure up the image of ... well , clever " conjurers , " somewhat like the alchemists of yore .
But most important among the factors that influence our acceptance of or resistance to scientific knowledge depends on whom we listen to in our early years .
If the teacher has one explanation for how animals and people came to inhabit the earth and our parents and pastor have another , which version we believe depends to some extent on whom we trust more .
However , I do n't agree with the authors that this influence is always easy to predict or that it lasts a life time .
Most children ( unless they have been methodically indoctrinated ) , even in their pre-teen years are sophisticated enough to weigh two sides of a story and make up their own minds .
If they choose to believe their science teacher and not their parents , it does n't necessarily mean that their overall trust in dad and mom will diminish .
Children understand that adults are not infallible and can make mistakes .
They also learn early enough that different adults ( parents , coach , teacher , counselor , doctor ) bring their own areas of expertise to the table .
Kids therefore can make judgements regarding which adult to trust in a particular situation .
As an erstwhile science teacher , I cannot stress enough the importance of training school teachers rigorously .
Science teachers should be interesting , convincing and receptive to their pupils ' curiosities and inquiries .
The effort must start from elementary school itself .
Waiting until high school and college may be too late .
We should remember that teachers are not just the repositories of dry , seemingly irrelevant and monotonous facts but they are also in competition with other societal forces outside the classroom for the trust of their students .
Reports are surfacing that EMI is in negotiations with some of the leading music stores to offer a substantial portion of its music catalog without DRM , with an announcement due as early as today .
Under one scenario , music stores like Napster , Real Rhapsody , and others would fork over sizable advance payments in exchange for the right to sell music as unprotected MP3s .
Another industry source reports that EMI was also discussing the possibility of selling MP3s on MySpace using SnoCap .
All of the parties reportedly involved are remaining close - mouthed on whatever negotiations may be taking place , but the scuttlebutt is that the negotiations have been going on for months .
Needless to say , any decision by one of the big four labels to make a sizable chunk of its music available for download sans DRM would be ground - breaking .
EMI has experimented with DRM - free music in the past .
The most recent occurrence was in December 2006 when they gave Yahoo Music the green light to sell a single from Norah Jones and a couple of tracks from Relient K as MP3s .
Selling a large portion of its catalog as unprotected MP3s would put it at odds with the RIAA and other major labels , who firmly back the continued use of DRM .
" Let me be clear .
We advocate the continued use of DRM in the protection of our and our artists 'intellectual property , " said Warner Music CEO Edgar Bronfman , Jr. during his company 's quarterly earnings call .
Steve Jobs has gone on record saying that Apple would gladly sell DRM - free music if the labels agree .
If the reports are true , EMI is close to taking Jobs up on his offer , with an EMI spokesperson telling Reuters that the label is pleased with how its MP3 experiments have turned out .
" The results have been positive , " said the spokesperson .
" [ The ] lack of operability between a proliferating range of devices and hardware and the digital platforms for delivering music is more and more becoming an issue for music consumers and EMI has been engaging with our various partners to find a solution . "
Legal music downloads have made up for some of the decline in CD sales , but the labels ' decision to insist on DRM wrappers for every track has arguably played a significant role in Apple 's ownership of the digital music market .
Puncturing the closed DRM ecosystems with unprotected files would likely allow other music services to sell iPod - compatible music for the first time ( hacks aside ) , putting a chink in Apple 's armor .
More importantly , it would give consumers the same freedom they get with the purchase of an album on CD : the ability to listen to it on the device of their choosing without any restrictions .
Jefferson pleads ' not guilty ' but no trial until January '08 Michael Roston
Published : Friday June 8 , 2007 Print This Email
This A breaking news report at CNN says that Rep. William Jefferson , the Louisiana Democrat who was indicted on 16 public corruption charges Monday , pleaded ' not guilty ' on all counts .
He also waived his right to a speedy trial , meaning that proceedings will not begin until January 2008 .
In a press conference Friday morning after the proceedings , Jefferson said he would fiercely fight the charges against him .
" I am absolutely innocent of the charges that have been leveled against me .
I 'm going to fight my heart out to clear my name , " he said , speaking in public for the first time since the indictment was announced on Monday .
He further communicated that he would not leave office .
" I will not sacrifice my honor , or cave to political pressure ... there is more at stake than .. what 's happening to me , " he argued .
" The people of the second district of Louisiana already know this - that 's why they voted overwhelmingly for me in this last congressional election . "
However , he did cryptically admit to making an " error in judgment . "
The Congressman 's statement came after the initiation of an ethics investigation against him by the Committee on Standards and Official Conduct .
While House Republicans , including Minority Leader John Boehner have been vocal in their calls for Jefferson to resign , House Democrats have been more circumspect in their statements .
" I think Mr. Jeffersons effectiveness has been substantially impaired , and I think he needs to take that into consideration as to what action he is going to take , " House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said in a Tuesday evening floor speech .
Handicapping of the trial was already underway , with a newspaper in Jefferson 's home of New Orleans predicting that the judge who is hearing the case will conduct the African - American congressman 's trial in a stern manner .
" [ District Court Judge T.S. ]
Ellis , an appointee of the late President Reagan who this week ordered Jefferson 's bank accounts sealed , has already signaled his disdain for political corruption , " wrote Bruce Alpert at the New Orleans Times - Picayune 's blog .
" ' Public corruption is the worst kind of virulent and malignant cancer , ' Ellis said last year when he sentenced Vernon Jackson , CEO of iGate Inc. , to seven years , 3 months in prison .
He issued the sentence after Jackson , who is likely to be a witness in the Jefferson trial , pleaded guilty to funneling more than $ 367,500 in bribes to a company controlled by the congressman 's family . "
Reported Funeral mid December 2001
Translation of Funeral Article in Egyptian Paper :
al - Wafd , Wednesday , December 26 , 2001 Vol 15 No 4633 News of Bin Laden's Death
and Funeral 10 days ago Islamabad -
A prominent official in the Afghan Taleban movement announced yesterday the death of Osama bin Laden , the chief of al - Qa'da organization , stating that binLaden suffered serious complications in the lungs and died a natural and quiet death .
The official , who asked to remain anonymous , stated to The Observer of Pakistan that he had himself attended the funeral of bin Laden and saw his face prior to burial in Tora Bora 10 days ago .
He mentioned that 30 of al - Qa'da fighters attended the burial as well as members of his family and some friends from the Taleban .
In the farewell ceremony to his final rest guns were fired in the air .
The official stated that it is difficult to pinpoint the burial location of bin Laden because according to the Wahhabi tradition no mark is left by the grave .
He stressed that it is unlikely that the American forces would ever uncover any traces of bin Laden .
Scientists report the first conclusive discovery of the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere of a planet beyond our Solar System .
The discovery was made by analysing the transit of the gas giant HD 189733b across its star in the infrared .
Giovanna Tinetti , ESA fellow at the Institute d’Astrophysique de Paris , and colleagues from around the world , used data from NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope .
They targeted planet HD 189733b , 63 light - years away , in the constellation Vulpecula .
The planet was discovered in 2005 as it dimmed the light of its parent star by some three percent when transiting in front of it .
Using Spitzer , Tinetti and the team observed the star , which is slightly fainter than the Sun .
They watched its starlight dim at two infrared bands ( 3.6 and 5.8 micrometres ) .
Had the planet been a rocky body devoid of atmosphere , both these bands and a third one ( 8 micrometres ) , recently measured by a team at Harvard , would have shown the same behaviour .
Instead , as the planet ’s tenuous outer atmosphere slipped across the face of the star , the starlight absorbed showed a different , distinctive pattern .
The atmosphere absorbed less infrared radiation at 3.6 micrometres than at the other two wavelengths .
“ Water is the only molecule that can explain that behaviour , ” says Tinetti .
The presence of water vapour does not necessarily make it a good candidate in the search for planets that harbour life .
“ This is a far from habitable world , ” she adds .
Instead of a rocky world like Earth , HD 189733 b is large , about 1.15 times the mass of Jupiter .
Located just 4.5 million km from its star , it orbits it in 2.2 days .
In comparison , Earth is 150 million km from the Sun ; even Mercury , the innermost planet , is 70 million km away .
This is the inaugural edition of Code Reads , a weekly discussion of some of the central essays , documents and texts in the history of software .
This week we ’re talking about Frederick Brooks ’s The Mythical Man-Month .
( OK , let ’s be honest : I ’m talking about it .
I ’m hoping you , or you , or you , may want to , as well !
If you do n’t want to read my essay , you can just go straight to the comments and post something . )
Frederick Brooks ’s The Mythical Man-Month came out in 1975 , and I first heard its title later that decade .
I ’d already been a teenage programmer of sorts ( of games in BASIC ) for a few years , but I knew nothing of the world of large software projects that Brooks ’ work addressed .
I did know that the phrase “ mythical man-month ” grabbed my interest .
It sounded less like the management - science term it was , more like a description of some prehistoric beast , heaving itself out of the primordial swamp to lumber across a desolate landscape .
Transmuting dry corporate - speak into evocative imagery ?
That was some trick .
When I finally did read Brooks ’s book , more than two decades later , there , on its cover , were those beasts — struggling to pull their limbs free of the tar pit that served as Brooks ’s starting metaphor for the awful dilemmas of software - project scheduling .
By that time , I ’d become more familiar with the sort of work Brooks ’s book addressed .
I ’d knocked my head more than once against the wall of software development .
And I found , as so many readers had before me , that this quarter - century old book anticipated and analyzed most of the problems I ’d encountered — and even offered some useful advice on how to avoid them .
The Mythical Man-Month is best known for its formulation of Brooks ’s Law : “ Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later . ”
Software development is n’t like harvesting corn or carving widgets ; since each project ’s work is unique , when newcomers join up , the existing experts need to drop what they ’re doing and orient the new recruits .
And as the project ’s roster grows , so too does the amount of time each participant has to devote to coordinating his work with a greater number of colleagues .
Brooks ’s
Law is so counter - intuitive that one still regularly encounters projects that ignore it , on the assumption that either ( a ) their particular undertaking is uniquely exempt from Brooksian limits or ( b ) the project employs some new methodology that invalidates Brooks ’s principle .
( One central argument of Eric Raymond ’s “ The Cathedral and the Bazaar ” is that open - source methods combined with an efficient communications network like the Internet can overcome the logic of Brooks ’s Law and allow the efficient deployment of swarms of developers in debugging efforts . )
But much more than Brooks ’s Law awaits those developers who wish to go beyond the catchphrase level of familiarity with The Mythical Man-Month .
The book introduces a whole slew of concepts at the heart of our understanding of how we build software :
How do disastrously late projects get that way ?
“ One day at a time . ” ( Brooks applied this phrase to the software field long before it became a 12 - step self - help mantra . )
Most slippage is the offspring of “ termites , not tornados . ”
Sequential constraints :
Some projects take an irreducible amount of time because one part of the task needs to be finished before the next can be begun — or , as Brooks puts it , “ The bearing of a child takes nine months , no matter how many women are assigned . ”
Coding is n’t what takes the most time : Brooks ’s rule of thumb is that actually writing the code takes 1 / 6 of a project ’s time — with planning taking another third and the remaining half devoted to testing and debugging .
Programmers vary wildly in individual productivity : Wildly as in the highly productive programmer may well be able to produce ten times more useful stuff , however you choose to measure it , than his colleague .
more useful stuff , however you choose to measure it , than his colleague .
The goal of “ conceptual integrity ” or unity of design :
The best programs and software systems exhibit a sense of consistency and elegance , as if they are shaped by a single creative mind , even when they are in fact the product of many .
The fiendish problem is less how to create that sense in the first place than in how to preserve it against all the other pressures that come to bear throughout the process of writing software .
The “ second system effect ” : Brooks noted that an engineer or team will often make all the compromises necessary to ship their first product , then founder on the second .
Throughout project number one , they stored up pet features and extras that they could n’t squeeze into the original product , and told themselves , “ We ’ll do it right next time . ”
This “ second system ” is “ the most dangerous a man ever designs . ”
Brooks ’s success in The Mythical Man-Month at defining the nature of the software - project beast depends , I think , on to two special characteristics of the work : its roots in Brooks ’s personal story , and the power and clarity of its style .
The Mythical Man-Month traced its origins to Brooks ’s experiences leading the team tasked with writing the IBM 360 ’s operating system — an unprecedently huge project that suffered legendary delays .
At a 2004 event the Computer History Museum held marking the 40th anniversary of the birth of the IBM / 360 project , Brooks recalled the book ’s genesis :
When I was leaving IBM , Tom Watson Jr. and I had a very good conversation .
He said , “ You ’ve managed the hardware part of the project , and you ’ve managed the software part of the project .
What is the difference , from a management point of view , between the hardware and the software ?
Why does software seem to be so much harder to manage ? ”
And I said , “ Well , I ca n’t answer that on the spot , but I ’ll think about it . ”
And it took five years .
I think it ’s important , in reporting a development effort , to indicate what you tried that did n’t work as well as what you tried that did work .
And the fact that I ’d consider the OS / 360 effort phenomenally successful does n’t meant that I think that everything we did along the way was wise .
We made some stupid blunders .
There ’s an urgency to The Mythical Man-Month that makes it more immediate , and more satisfying , than most run -of - the - mill business books .
Brooks emerged from the IBM project asking passionately , “ Where did we screw up ? ” — and trying to record the answers for the benefit of futures toilers in code .
None of that would get Brooks very far , or have us reading him three decades later in this volatile field , without his unusual skill at expressing complex ideas :
He is at once forthright and graceful .
He draws just enough parallels from outside the field ( a New Orleans restaurant menu , the Tower of Babel ) to leaven the proceedings without ever sounding gimmicky .
Even when he ’s packing multiple polysyllables , his sentences flow with power :
Program maintenance is an entropy - increasing process , and even its most skillful execution only delays the subsidence of the system into unfixable obsolescence .
And at times his eloquence waxes positively Elizabethan :
The programmer , like the poet , works only slightly removed from pure thought - stuff .
He builds his castles in the air , from air , creating by exertion of the imagination .
Is The Mythical Man-Month dated ?
Some of it , sure .
At one point , Brooks says , “ I am convinced that interactive systems will never displace batch systems for many applications . ”
Oops .
( Brooks graciously cops to this and some other mis-predictions in his retrospective postscript , “ The Mythical Man-Month After 20 Years . ” )
Still , even such a cloudy - crystal - ball passage has some value today : it made me wonder about the times I ’ve said , echoing other computer users of my generation , “ I ca n’t ever see Web - based software entirely replacing desktop applications . ”
Such certainties could well prove as fleeting as Brooks ’s confidence in batch mode .
The Mythical Man-Month also devotes many pages to discussions of the proper management of the five - foot - thick “ project workbooks ” of a bygone era .
In the days before intranets and wikis and source - code repositories , these were the tools a team used to coordinate work .
No one will shed a tear for the demise of fat binders .
But today ’s wheel - reinventers could probably benefit from an examination of how previous generations got their teams rolling in sync .
In other words , even in those passages where it ’s showing its age , The Mythical Man-Month remains valuable .
It ’s a remarkably enduring work .
It was the first book I turned to when I began my quest to understand why software is so hard , and I know I ’ll keep returning to it .
Anyone trying to create software is , as Brooks paints the picture , traversing a pit ; The Mythical Man-Month offers us “ boardwalks across the tar . ”
Before giving my bleak answer to the question posed above , prior to detailing the admittedly nightmare scenario it derives from , let me first tell you where I ’m coming from .
I think neocon true believers view the world as a giant version of the board game RISK .
In that game one empire triumphs , while all else lose .
They believe a war larger than the one we momentarily are confined to , one fought to secure strategic Middle Eastern oil reserves which America " needs " for our future , is inevitable .
And by triggering that war sooner rather than later , the cost to win it , by their accounting , will be lower than the tab putting it off would add up to .
But the American public is reluctant ; we have seen too much war already , and few are willing to now pay the price that an expanded war entails .
So what is a good Neocon to do ?
How about the following :
Build up Iran into a major strategic threat to America .
Point to a bloody Iranian hand directing every setback for American policies in the Middle East .
Build on every possible fear that each supporter of Israel has that Iran is hell bent on destroying Israel ASAP .
Blur every distinction possible between Iran 's current leadership and Al Qaeda 's current leadership by making them all out to be birds of a feather out of their mind fanatics willing to sacrifice everything on this earth to further a demented religious ideology .
Stress that unlike Bin Ladin and Hussein , the Iranians really will soon have nuclear weapons in their trigger happy hands .
And always keep repeating : " You simply ca n’t talk to them until they start acting like adults and meet our preconditions for direct negotiations " .
As that propaganda mission nears critical mass , paint a rosy picture of how easy it still would be to take out Iran 's nuclear capacity at this point with some well placed bombs and cruise missiles , and maybe a few brave special ops forces working with our newly embraced brave Iranian resistance movement ( no longer terrorists ) members behind enemy lines .
Repeatedly emphasize that the only thing Arabs really understand ( or Persians " same difference " ) is a clear willingness to draw a line and use force to back it up .
Confidently predict that with their false bravado exposed as impotent in the face of American resolve , Iran 's current regime will be torn apart by dissension and finally repudiated by the masses of Iranians now living in oppression under their harsh rule .
Return to the fear argument to close the deal , saying anyone who opposes dealing with a growing Iranian threat until after it grows much stronger is either crazy or a jelly spined Democratic liberal .
In other words ; recycle and trot out the exact same campaign that bulldozed Democrats into standing aside and letting Iraq be invaded .
The only difference this time , now that Americans are revolted by the rising American casualty toll inside Iraq , is the claim that we wo n't have to bloody our hands on the ground in pursuit of the grand victory that awaits us if we have the fortitude to strike Iran from the air while we still are able .
For now neocons are concentrating on the next step of their strategy to protect and project America ’s global interests ; namely to bomb Iran .
Personally I doubt they believe any of the bombastic false bravado that they peddle to the public about this .
Well maybe a few do , those among them furthest divorced from reality , but I expect most neocons know full well that attacking Iran is the prelude to a larger war , not the elimination of the gravest threat now facing America .
They are simply counting on most Americans not figuring that out in time to stop them .
The war that an attack on Iran will usher in will cease to be elective in the eyes of most Americans .
It wo n't remain an option , after that point , to say on second thought maybe it was a mistake to attack Iran , we regret it , and if we could take back the bombs we would .
Unlike Iraq it wo n't be an option , once the magnitude of the mistake becomes apparent , to simply withdraw our forces from Iran 's borders and suggest that everyone go back to playing by the old rules again .
This time Americans will be attacked both at home and abroad , and not just soldiers , and not just on specified battle fields .
We wo n’t be " fighting them over there to keep from fighting them here " .
The soft underbelly of America 's economy will be effectively targeted by far more significant forces than Bin Ladin 's dour band .
In other words we will have a real war on our hands , against large numbers of determined enemies who will hate us with a passion and fight with that passion against us .
Throw in the fact that Israel will inevitably come under increasing attack as well , which is precisely what the Israel right is counting on .
They too see further war in the Middle East as inevitable , and with America under attack along side them , they will call on their American allies to join them in smashing common Islamic foes .
At that point there no longer will be a viable alternative to defending ourselves militarily .
Americans will quickly discover that Peace is not an option being offered us , regardless of who we blame for throwing prior chances for peace out the window in the first place .
That is when a draft will be reinstituted .
They will call it " mobilizing to defend America " .
That is when social benefits , suddenly deemed unaffordable during a time of war , will be cut .
They will call it " tightening our belts " .
That is when taxes will be raised on all Americans , though the wealthy wo n’t feel much pain , having previously pocketed a steady parade of tax cuts for the past twenty five years .
They will call it " shared sacrifice "
And that is when tough talking authoritarian minded Republicans will position themselves as the only ones with the balls ( yes that chauvinistic term is intentional ) to do what must be done to protect America from very real enemies .
And they will call that " strong leadership " .
Remember , neocons want this war .
Remember , neocons believe the only alternative to waging and winning this war is the waning of our American Empire .
Like a pusher they will dangle a " limited surgical air strike " on Iran before the public as a patriotic cheap thrill , but we wo n't have any choice but to pay whatever the price once America comes under fierce attack in the aftermath .
The neocons want to lock us into a wider Middle Eastern war , and the surest way to do that is to attack Iran .
As an added bonus some neocons even view war with Iran as a perfect tonic to bolster their battered movement .
Admittedly the bombing Iran part is but one of the bullets ticked on his larger list of recommendations , but have a quick look at what Mr. Muravchik has to say here :
Published November 1 , 2006
TO : My Fellow Neoconservatives
FROM : Joshua Muravchik
RE : How to Save the Neocons
" ... Prepare to Bomb Iran .
Make no mistake , President Bush will need to bomb Iran ’s nuclear facilities before leaving office .
It is all but inconceivable that Iran will accept any peaceful inducements to abandon its drive for the bomb .
Its rulers are religio - ideological fanatics who will not trade what they believe is their birthright to great power status for a mess of pottage .
Even if things in Iraq get better , a nuclear - armed Iran will negate any progress there .
Nothing will embolden terrorists and jihadists more than a nuclear - armed Iran .
The global thunder against Bush when he pulls the trigger will be deafening , and it will have many echoes at home .
It will be an injection of steroids for organizations such as MoveOn.org .
We need to pave the way intellectually now and be prepared to defend the action when it comes .
In particular , we need to help people envision what the world would look like with a nuclear - armed Iran .
Apart from the dangers of a direct attack on Israel or a suitcase bomb in Washington , it would mean the end of the global nonproliferation regime and the beginning of Iranian dominance in the Middle East . "

For those who think the picture I paint above is too extreme to take seriously , I ask you this .
How much are you willing to bet ?
What are you willing to lose later if you are wrong , in return for holding onto your calm certainty now that it 's not going to happen ?
What odds does it take to justify your complacency , five to one against an American ( or Israel with full American support ) attack on Iran ?
Perhaps you find the odds closer to ten to one against it , if so does that leave you secure enough about the future to feel no need for concern now ?
Or maybe you think I 'm a whacko alarmist , me and Wes Clark and Sy Hersh and Noam Chomsky and a bunch of other crazies just like them .
If the odds really are 100 to one against this pending war , is that reassuring enough to return to quarrelling over primary candidates and forget all this fretting over preventing a war with Iran ?
One chance in a hundred is the same odds cited for a flood rising to the so called century mark in any given year .
With a big storm already raging , and with numerous dark clouds gathering by the second on the near horizon , how comfortable are you going to sleep on the flood plain of that once in a century storm ?
The 20 the Century saw two World Wars .
The 21st century has none to show for itself so far , but it 's still fairly early .
One is n't really over due yet , so why should anyone think we might be approaching the brink of one now ?
And no one listens to neocons anymore , do they ?
The name for the following site I believe is self explanatory : StopIranWar.com
http://www.stopiranwar.com/
General Wes Clark and VoteVets.org need our help to stop this war .
Here is the full passage that the title of this Diary is taken from .
The subject was a possible U.S. air strike on Iran :
There is only one thing standing it their way , preventing them from doing whatever they think will bring them more power and wealth .
Liberals .
In the absence of a functioning media to inform the public , liberals and progressives are the only thing standing in the way of a complete power grab by the neo-cons .
This makes them far more dangerous than terrorists .
Indeed , the terrorists are a necessary part of their plans , so terrorists must not be brought to justice ( think Osama Bin Forgotten ) .
Further , liberals threaten to bring back fiscal responsibility , including higher taxes on the wealthy , which is akin to a “ war on wealth ” , according to Kudlow the Crackpot on CNBC .
Liberals threaten their plans to dismantle government , deregulate business , wage endless and highly profitable wars , and control the strings of power in perpetuity .
Terrorists are n’t a threat , they are a critical tool … a prop … a crutch .

Novell says that Microsoft always alleged there were violations , but that Novell
has never accepted those claims and still does n't .
Microsoft says there are violations , and that they have discussed specific
patents with Novell .
These are consistent statements .
MS is n't claiming Novell agreed to the
allegations .
They are n't even claiming that specific patents were discussed
before the deal was made , only that there have been discussions .

What a feeling this is .
Am I the only one under the impression we are witnessing a major turning point ?
The emperor is losing his clothes at last .
Noting the FUD is for all practical purposes useless , Darigaaz made an interesting post .
That confirms it for me .
Microsoft has three options now - a spectacular flameout a la SCO , a steady decline into irrelevance , or a complete corporate reinvention .
Upon this I observed that option 2 and 3 are unlikely to suit Microsoft current management .
Therefore option 1 it will be and this means an actual lawsuit .
Money is not the objective of Microsoft , they will sue for the purpose of causing disruption .
This is where comes the magnificient risk analysis from Webster .
It deserves to be read in full , buthere is an operative part .
Litigation is a very risky step for the Monopoly .
The DoJ may perk up in an effort to show that they can function with Gonzalez sans deputies .
They have a problem showing actual damages since open source software is free .
One pays basically for support when corporations buy Red Hat .
Without damages , an injunction is less likely .
They are more likely to face appeals and lose patents every step of the way .
The patentability of software will also get a good review .
There are some intelligent receptive justices amongst the Supremes .
The Linusians would probably form a class action defense .
Imagine IBM and Moglen involved .
The patent Office and system is so disfunctional .
The Monopoly has argued against it itself since it is sued so often .
Their own words wil be turned against them .
Plus if they start a patent war on Linux , IBM could try to join their part of it into the SCO trial .
SCO and the Monopoly telling Judge Wells she does n't understand her own orders .
Therefore option 1 does n't look good either .
It will just accelerate the defeat .
The question is now will Microsoft try something rash ?
Or will they just milk the monopoly profits while they last doing what they can to slow down their decline ?

Microsoft is going try everything possible to shutdown Groklaw .
SCO / Caldera had hoped to win their shakedown efforts by controlling the
information flow .
But because of Groklaw , SCO / Caldera could not control the information flow .
And
SCO / Caldera is now losing .
This is why SCO / Caldera - Microsoft tried to depose you and to eventually put you
under some gag restriction .

Meh ... I doubt MS cares about any distro other then RHEL and SLES or any
companies besides RH , Novell , IBM and HP .
I would suspect that IBM and HP will play ball leaving RH the only major
enterprise player squeezed .
I 'm guessing they are hoping that between this
nonsense ( which will be resolved with a simple patent cross license between
the major players ) and GPL v3 that the corporate linuxes will fork on GPL v2 .
Will RH cave ?
Who knows .
OIN is n't the same as a defensive patent portfolio
from it 's description in articles and RH's own portfolio is tiny .
But divorcing Linux v3 from its corporate sponsors would put RMS in the
same boat as Theo ... just a much larger one with more folks on board .
For MS
that 's a huge win .

I was pondering this last night , and have to admit that this is terribly bad
timing for Microsoft .
We could potentially be on the eve of multiple summary judgment findings in SCO
v IBM .
Worst case scenario involves Judge Kimball not only finding for IBM on
several counts , but also publicly chastising SCO for not being open and up front
about their boasting claims of massive infringement .
Sanctions may even be
involved , against the company and / or its litigators .
If this happens , companies around the world who make a living using or
developing open source software will become emboldened and stand up to the great
monopoly .
They may even band together as a legal class and demand that
Microsoft " put up or shut up " on their patent claims , holding a
Kimball judgment in their hands as legal precedence .
Microsoft will be forced in the end to either stand up to accusations of
barratry , tortious interfererence and anti-trust bullying , or to lay their
patents on the table for all to see .
Either option does n't play too well for
Redmond .
I was also just thinking of their claim that OpenOffice violates a certain
number of their patents .
How curious that this statement should come out in the
middle of the process to get OfficeXML ratified as an ISO standard .
Once again , MS puts itself into what could be perceived as a no -win situation .
If they rattle the patent sabre louder , they endanger their document format in
its quest to be considered an " open " standard .
If they do n't ,
OpenOffice and the ODF standard picks up that much more steam and momentum , and
OfficeXML risks falling by the wayside , not being approved as an ISO standard .
Indeed , very intriguing times we live in .

If a deal looks to gain an extra buck in the near - term , and they

Here is an o pinion from Paul McDougall at Information Week .
They basically say Microsoft must sue .
What choice does Microsoft have ?
It 's basically lost the Internet to Google .
If Linux and other free software continues its march toward mainstream ( do n't underestimate the significance of Dell 's decision to ship Ubuntu Linux for the desktop ) what 's left for the company ?
Only the courtroom .
Perhaps that from Microsoft perspective , the Novell and other patent deals are preliminaries for lawsuits ?
They want to reduce the number of potential FOSS defenders before they unleash the lawyers .
A business plan Slashdot style : Sign companies into patent deals for five years
Sue non signatories out of existence Upon renewing the patent deals after five years , alter the terms under threats of more lawsuits
There is no ???? step .
If this stage is reached , Microsoft has succeeded to impose a proprietary patent tax on Linux .
Profit A question for Novell , how do you plan to address step 3 ?
Proceed to step 4 and pay the Microsoft tax ?
We can see why the GPL3 matters .
This is how we can stop this plan .

Novell has no choice in what they say .
Under the " Liberty or Death "
clause of the GPL , they cannot distribute GPLed software if there is any reason
why it cannot be freely distributed thereafter .
Specifically , if Microsoft has
any patents that would apply to the Linux kernel , nobody can distribute the
Linux kernel .
As long as Novell maintains that there is no patent encumbrance ,
they can consistently distribute Linux .
If they admit to patent encumbrance ,
they are admitting a violation of the GPL .
Microsoft , of course , does as it pleases .
I 've speculated before that this may
be a sleazy division of labor : Novell maintains no patent problems , to keep
distributing Linux , and Microsoft maintains there are , to make Novell 's Linux
more attractive .
After all , Novell 's patent deal with Microsoft is worthless if
it 's as meaningless as Novell needs to claim .
( If that 's a confusing sentence ,
it 's because it's my best attempt at describing a confusing situation . )

Until Microsoft comes up with actual examples as underlined in US law ( and note
that that software patents do not apply outside the US at the moment ) then they
simply have no case and could potentially be prosecuted for potential damage to
business for millions of people who now use or depend on Linux .
As has been stated several times , I believe this is a real turning point in the
software industry .
Microsoft can see a nightmare scenario of large numbers of
people across the world abandoning Windows ( especially as Vista is not exactly
the best product they have ever come up with ) and are terrified of the
consequences .
The most damaging thing of all is that ordinary computer users ( not those of us
in the IT industry ) are starting to realise that Microsoft are becoming
* irrelevent * ( i.e. you do n't * need * Windows or indeed any Microsoft products
anymore if you have a computer ) .
Is it any wonder that they ( like anyone under
threat ) are turning nasty .
The second problem that Microsoft have is that a large percentage of computer
users do not * trust * them anymore .
Would you ?
Once SCO is defeated ( which is n't long now I think ) , Microsoft 's position will
be much weaker .
Microsoft need to bring a case to court with the claims out in the open or they
will simply be compared to SCO 's baseless sabre rattling and ignored .
Either the claims will turn out to be FUD ( which I suspect most of them are ) or
we will work around them .
If Microsoft really bring on the pressure to stop
Linux vendors shipping products then I 'm sure that there are enough patents in
the hands of companies who work with Linux and BSD UNIX to stop Vista / XP being
shipped for a while in the US .
Mr Bullmer , I will * never * buy another Microsoft product as long as I live ( and
I have spent most of my career working with Microsoft products so far ) and would
gladly donate money to any effort that keeps Linux alive ( and I 'm sure I 'm not
the only one ) .
You will not win this battle .
There are too many people in the world who care
about open source software to see that happen .

The Fortune article contains the following juicy tidbit : Gutierrez refuses to identify specific patents or explain how they 're being infringed , lest FOSS advocates start filing challenges to them .
I 'm wondering what the possibility of MS knowing - or at least having a reasonable belief - that the validity of their patents are highly questionable .
If MS itself believes they do n't have valid patents , would it not constitute fraud for them to try and license said unvalid patents ?
Would the refusal to disclose the patents for fear FOSS advocates would start challenging them constitute a potential belief the patents are invalid ?
Could the above argument possibly be used to force MS to disclose the patents somehow ?
Hmm .... curious .

Dunno why folks think this is bad timing for MS .
This is great timing if their
objective is to fork Linux into v2 and v3 camps .
These manuvers are IMHO not intended for the court room but the board
room .
There 's a lot of wait and see IMHO among the corporate players and
they do have the resources to fork Linux on v2 vs v3 lines .
V3 is close to soup .
There are provisions in there that IMHO make
corporations ambivalent about the transition regardless of non-binding
public statements ( like IBM engineering blogs ) .
If MS comes with a cross license +
$ $ $ deal then staying with V2 ( even if it
means forking ) where they retain control over their destiny rather than the
FSF would seem like a good deal to corporate GCs in my opinion .

This is just a thought and feel free to correct me if needed :
I kinda see the patent agreement as a sweeping promise not to sue over the interoperability that Novell wants to add to SuSE .
Active Directory and other structures are patented by MS and interoperability could violate those patents .
Rather than name all the patents involved , MS just agreed to all of them .
Perhaps Novell did n't see the potential for FUD in the agreement .
Also , Active Directory ( AD ) has always struck me as a clone of Novell Directory Services ( NDS ) which was added to Netware 4 back in 1993 .
Rather than battle between NDS and AD patents ( and validity of AD patents when viewing the prior art of NDS ) , they agreed to the covenant .
I would guess someone should look and compare any NDS patents with any AD patents and functionality and see if there is an overlap .
Full Disclosure : I like Novell and SuSE .
I used Netware before Windows had a sever platform .
I run SuSE at home and Microsoft at work .

The second Microsoft story does n't really specify the order of the events .
Everything is perfectly consistent if Microsoft discussed particular patents
with Novell after the deal , and Novell did n't find them convincing .
For that
matter , my initial interpretation of Microsoft 's second statement was that they
made their big announcement , then refused to tell the general public about
particular patents , but then went to people with whom they have patent deals
( and who would therefore care less about challenging the patents ) and told them
where they got the numbers .

Microsoft says that Linux and other FOSS software violates 235 of their patents .
From the Eolas vs. Microsoft case we know that just one patent can be worth $ 521 million .
235 * $ 521 million = $ 122435000000 .
Yup $ 122 Billion
So this revelation by Steve Ballmer and other Microsoft executives is clearly material to Microsoft 's future financial results ( the market cap for MSFT is currently less than $ 300B , so a revenue stream of this size is huge ) .
So it 's time to BUY , BUY , BUY now before Wall Street realizes the huge impact of this news .
And if this all turns out to be FUD and Microsoft turns out not to have 235 defendable patents , or does n't elect to collect on them , well then you can sue Microsoft for making these forward looking public statements .
You just can't lose !

it has discussed them in private with companies like Novell Inc. that it ...
MS does n't state that they even talked with Novell .
They only state that they talked with companies like Novell ie maybe other companies that have some similarity with Novel ( redhat maybe )
And even if they did talk with Novell there is no indications any agreement was reached ; the issue of alleged patent infringement may have been an issue discussed after contracts where signed and money was transfered .
Novell has publicly rejected MS ideas that clearly were n't disused when that contract was concieved .
The only thing we really have is an agreement between MS and Novell one detail of which is a litigation truce regarding patents infringement claims , and an insinuation by MS that such a truce is a form of admittance or recognition of the patent issues being putting forth .

In addition to the recent contradictory / misleading statements highlighted in the
article , consider this :
At the time of the deal , observers noted the large balance of dollars going to
Novell in the deal .
Representatives from both companies , if I recall correctly ,
implied that was due to the strength and number of Novell 's patents , esp. in
networking , compared to MS 's patent porfolio .
I cannot determine value of my
patent porfolio compared to yours without knowing what is in both .
No business will spend hundreds of millions of dollars unless they know what
they are getting for it .
If the patent portion of the agreement was really about
patents , both sides knew what the other side had .
The public comments from both
sides just do not add up .
The patent rider on this deal is just plain fishy .
And
it stinks .
I think the patent deal was an excuse for MS to purchase FUD ( if people believe
what MS says , this FUD comes at a bargain price ) , and for Novell to inject some
much needed cash into their business .
Unfortunately for MS , fewer people are inclined to believe them these days .
Unfortunately for Novell , the cost of that cash is proof to the open source
community that they do n't grok the community .
At all .
In both cases , the deal was driven by what I call QVB's - Quarterly Vision
Bosses .
QVB's are the subset of PHB 's bosses who are genetically incapable , from
all appearences , of seeing anything beyond the next quarter 's financial
reports .

There is no requirement for any of these

Honestly , I wonder why that question is n't asked more in business , but here we
have some good questions .
I found it interesting how Novell seemed surprised by
the community reaction and wanted to cover itself , while Microsoft saw an
immediate opportunity for FUD .
After all , we do know that Microsoft had links
to SCO ...
Anyhow , my feeling is that Microsoft started this to stir discontent .
That
does n't absolve Novell , but at least Novell can keep their story straight .
Microsoft is starting to change theirs to suit the audience ... does that remind
you of anyone else ?
So I 'm going to have to say that I believe this is a calculated effort by
Microsoft to disrupt things .
Maybe some of it was accidental , but they 're
certainly capitalizing on the opportunity .
Novell ?
Well , they seem to have
sold out without fully realizing the ramifications .
Maybe , hopefully , they can
undo it , but I wonder how .
At least the agreement expires in a few years .
As for Microsoft , I can't see them doing anything but blowing more hot air .
Unless SCO pulls out some kind of surprise win ( hahahahahaha ! ) , I doubt they 'll
want to follow suit , but that does n't mean they wo n't make private arrangements
with large companies , sorta like they did with Novell , but kept out of the
public eye .
If they were litigating , someone might just use discovery to see if
they 'd made any more strange Novell - like deals that might contravene the GPL ,
because I have to feel like any further ones will be under NDAs and they 'll try
to avoid mentioning Linux on paper ( even if they market the license as some kind
of tax to permit the use of Linux ) .

The MS and Novell people have no interest in telling " the truth " .
From Novells point of view :
First of IF you know you are guilty of patent infringement the very last thing you would do is to blabber about it in public .
It least if you listen to your corporate lawyers .
And you would write no memos , emails or even napkins that discuss the issue .
And very few people in the organization would know .
Maybe not even the CEO .
Note that I do not know if Novell is aware of any patent infringements , I just point out that the response would be the same no matter what .
From MS point of view it is also obvious that they want to portrait Linux situation in the worst possible light .
The worst thing that could happen is that the , eventually , loose another case a'la SCO .
No big deal .
They are probably smart enough to not paint themselves into a corner .
If you look for honesty you are better of somewhere else than in press releases concerning patent issues .

The one - way street is that Microsoft can look inside Linux 's open software , but
we cannot look inside Microsoft 's closed software to find where it has violated
Linux copyrights / patents .
As well , even though it appears that Microsoft is doing a shotgun approach to
gathering patents , I believe it is very carefully calculating and trying to
manoeuver its way into having bottleneck - critical patents as a strategy .
In any
event it is building a diverse portfolio .
Though some of its patents have been revoked ( and one can only assume that close
inspection of other patents will find more ) , there will still be lots left for
it to wield in court .
Further , suppose Microsoft found something not completely protected in Linux and
it applied for and obtained a patent .
If SCO with $ 10 or $ 20 million can tie up
IBM for years , which of us would want to meet Microsoft in court with its
billions ?
The intimidation factor ?
Enormous .
It seems to me that we need to focus a lot of attention on reforming software
patent laws into a copyright type of law .
And we need to be sure the DOJ sees
understands that any action by a monopolist abusing its power hurts industry and
creativity in this country .

I 'm very familiar with Novell 's product line .
I 'm a CNE , and CDE ( Certified
Directory Engineer ) .
I no longer work with Novell 's stuff .
However , there are
things we all need to remember :
1. SUSE is just a part of Novell 's product line .
Due to their wonderful
marketing no one knows about ID management , GroupWise , eDirectory , or ZENWorks .
All of which are fine products or at least decent .
2. Novell writes client and server software for Windows .
Novell 's Client32 for
Windows as it was once called , is how you mapped drives to a NetWare / OES Linux
NSS volume .
In OpenSUSE you wont find any of the Novell non-GPLed stuff , ( anymore anyway ) ,
however , in OES Linux , or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server you will .
The difference
is that OES Linux includes eDirectory and many of the NetWare services for
Linux , and SLES does n't .
I 've spent quit a lot of time bashing Novell 's crappy service , software release ,
and marketing over the years .
So , even though I 'm very puzzled by their
actions .
Here 's my take ( if you give Novell the benefit of the doubt ) :
Novell needed an agreement to continue developing its Windows products
( GroupWise server and client , eDirectory , etc. etc. ) so that Windows clients
could mount / map or use services running on SLES or OES Linux .
MS needed a cover
for itself in case it was determined that the SCO " source " license was
indeed a farce ( which it is ) .
Then turned around and used Novell 's need to
twist their arm into a bad patent agreement .
Novell being on the short end of
the bargaining leverage bar .
The thing most folks miss out on is that
GroupWise , eDirectory , ZENWorks and other products Novell produces run on
NetWare , Windows , Linux , even AIX and other platforms .
The product I can most
see them needing the agreement for is Identity Manager which needs to tie in
pretty close to the OS to work .
The problem is Novell 's crappy marketing and business decision makers made this
look like a bad deal ( at best ) and MS made it look worse .

both these peeps of bad faithers are playing everyone both knwo the deal and if
novell or MS has balls they would say here it is you be the judge , the fact is
they do n't to increase the fud .novells goal is to pretend to be open source
friendly while letting MS whine out the patent FUD .
As we see in the most recent
article using press releases and lying can and will come back to haunt you .
GOOD to the oin folks and now its the cold war .
Where everyone yaps until
software patents are dissolved .
MS can't win a true patent war in fact is actually has the msot revenue wise
to lose , we all know it .
Silently IBM and others having been gathering up them .
this is n't about innovation it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that patent
holdings by any comany above mid sized are ntohign mroe then weapons of mass
destruction .
How ?
Use them to destroy competition and slow competitions innovations .
Ruin lives
by causing places ot pay more then they should .
Lessons tax reveunes thus and
therefore our standards of living .
It is ntohign short of an attack on democracy
they are allowed to use these in such ways .
SHAME on the WHOLE CORPORATE industry for it .

You are correct , PJ , in noting the inconsistancies .
However , given the actors
involved , the inconsistancies ( i.e. lies ) are more likely to be comming out of
Washington State than out of Utah .
Novell may be able to provide more
information , but it has already and consistantly said that it has no specific
information .
It is the other side that has changed its tune .
( Those people do
seem to have a reputation for streching the truth past its elastic limit . )
On the other hand , while there are some very negative consequencs for Novell in
terms of publicity and the fact that it does enable FUD , there may be ( but I
have no hard evidence ) benifits to Novell , and possibly even the entire FOSS
community , from improved interoperability .
Given that , I can see why Novell
might be reluctant to terminate the ' deal ' .
Novell probably deserves some credit for being as open as it can be about the
deal .
The other participant is the one that deserves centure .
[ Sorry , I need a serious software upgrade on this machine and have not had the
time to do it , so please forgive any spelling errors . ]

Whenever I can't understand what Microsoft is up to , I tend to get a little worried .
Stupidity and ignorance of law do n't seem to be among their list of faults .
Not really .
They claim to know exactly which patents are infringed , and also claim that they do n't plan to litigate .
Even if it were n't for laches , that does n't seem likely to cause much worry .
So now I have to wonder ... what is their other hand doing while we 're all so distracted with their patent - rattling ?

... to disclose the terms of any contractual obligations they may have , as part
of SEC scrutiny ?
Any major business deal is guaranteed to have a material
effect on the company 's business risk .
If this is not so , could the real attorneys in the audience offer an explanation
of why ?

I think if Novell , as a corporation , truly has any sense of business ethics and
pride should cancel its deal with MS .
Sure , it just got into the deal and ,
according to press in protest releases ( how much can you believe those ? ) it is
leading to more and more businesses using SuSe .
However , if they truly believe that MS is spreading FUD they should protest by
canceling the deal .
" We cannot continue to deal with liars " or
something like that .
Personally , I think software patents are stupid ( patenting clicking one time to
checkout ....wtf is that ? ) so I 'd love to see a software patent Armageddon !
Let 's get Novell to say , " Oh yeah !
Well Windows infringes on these
patents ! "
And IBM will say , " Yeah , Windows infringes on THESE
patents . "
Then MS will tell both Novell and IBM that " Lotus Notes and
Netware infringe on THESE patents ! "
Then Apple comes along and says they
invented the GUI and sue MS .
Then PARC says they actually invented the concept
of the GUI and mouse and they sue .
And everyone sues everyone until the US
government realized that software patents are silly .

In the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park , a team of researchers have discovered a new genus and species of chlorophyll - producing bacterium that transforms light into chemical energy .
The discovery is described in a paper written by Don Bryant of Penn State University and David M. Ward of Montana State University .
Yellowstone National Park is a tourist 's wonderland because of its wildlife , mountains , geysers and hot springs .
But the park is also a scientific reservoir that harbors what may be the world 's largest diversity of thermophilic ( heat - loving ) microorganisms .
Discovered in microbial mats in three of Yellowstone 's hot springs , Candidatus chloracidobacterium ( Cab. ) thermophilum belongs to the Acidobacteria phylum , a poorly characterized phylum that was not previously known to include bacteria capable of photosynthesis .
" Cab . thermophilum is the first photosynthesizing bacterium discovered in the Acidobacteria phylum , " said Ronald Weiner , program director in NSF 's Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences .
Chlorophyll - producing bacteria are so abundant that they perform half the photosynthesis on Earth .
But only five of the 25 major groups , or phyla , of bacteria previously were known to contain members with this ability .
" The microbial mats give the hot springs in Yellowstone their remarkable yellow , orange , red , brown and green colors , " says Bryant .
Microbiologists are intrigued by Yellowstone 's hot springs " because their unusual habitats house a diversity of microorganisms , but many are difficult or impossible to grow in the lab .
Metagenomics has given us a powerful new tool for finding these hidden organisms and exploring their physiology , metabolism , and ecology . "
Metagenomics is a means of studying organisms without having to culture them .
Bulk samples are collected from the environment , then DNA is isolated from the cells and sequenced by so - called shotgun sequencing on a very large scale .
Analysis of the DNA sequences reveals what types of genes and organisms are present in the environment .
Cab .
thermophilum grows near the surface of the mats together with cyanobacteria , or blue - green algae , where there is light and oxygen , at a temperature of about 50 to 66 degrees Celsius ( 122 to 151 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Unexpectedly , the new bacterium was discovered to have special light - harvesting antennae known as chlorosomes , which each contain about 250,000 chlorophylls .
No member of this phylum nor any aerobic microbe was known to make chlorosomes before this discovery .
" This is an excellent example of how metagenic information reveals how little we know about life on Earth , " said Weiner .
Members of the phylum Acidobacteria have proven very hard to grow in laboratory cultures , which means their ecology and physiology are very poorly understood .
Most species of Acidobacteria have been found in poor or polluted soils that are acidic , with a pH below three .
However , the Yellowstone Cab . thermophilum lived in more alkaline environments that are about pH 8.5 ( on a 1 - 14 scale ) .
" Finding a previously unknown , chlorophyll - producing microbe is the discovery of a lifetime for someone who has studied bacterial photosynthesis for as long as I have ( 35 years ) , " says Bryant .
" I would n't have been as excited if I had reached into that mat and pulled out a gold nugget the size of my fist ! "
Yellowstone habitats have been explored since the 1960s for new organisms that may have important applications for biotechnology , pollution clean - ups ( bioremediation ) , and medicine .
Bryant and Ward 's team found the new bacterium in three hot springs -- Mushroom Spring , Octopus Spring , and Green Finger Pool - - not far from the Old Faithful Geyser .
Also living in these same hot springs is the famous Yellowstone microbe , Thermus aquaticus , which revolutionized forensics and other fields by making the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) a routine procedure .
Funding sources for Bryant and Ward 's research besides NSF included the Department of Energy , the NASA Exobiology Program , and the Thermal Biology Institute of Montana State University .

Term 等の端末を複数同時に立ち上げて作業したり、 screen にて複数の仮想端末を同時並行で操作する際、コマンド実行履歴が端末間で共有できなくて困る事が多々あります。「 さっきのfindコマンドをもう一度... 引数どう書くんだっけなぁ...
あ、確かコマンド履歴にあったはずだなぁ...
ちっ、それはあっちの端末の履歴だったか」みたいな。zshには端末間のコマンド履歴を常に同期できる'SHARE_HISTORY '
なるオプション( * 1 ) があって素敵なのですが、同じことを bash で実現する方法を調べたのでご紹介。 ( * 1 ) zshの同機能について詳しく はITmedia記事 " 豪傑の三種の神器【後編】 " を参照の 事
不具合 ) 通常設定 のbashで困る 事
1. 複数端末間でコマンド履歴の共有ができない
同時に立ち上げている端末間で履歴の共有ができなくて不便に感じることがある。
2. 最後に閉じた端末の履歴しかファイル保存されない
コマンド履歴は端末を閉じた際に ~/.bash_history ファイルに保存されますが、毎回" 上書き保存"
するため、最後に閉じた端末の履歴しか保持されなくて困る。
[ クリックで拡大 ]
※後者の問題だけなら ~/.bashrc に ' shopt -s histappend ' とい う1行を追加すれば解決は可能。
解決策 ) bash でコマンド履歴を共有する方 法
以下の記述を ~/.bashrc 等に追記することで上記問題がすべて解決します。
.bashrcファイル追記内容 :
function share_history {
history -a
history -c
history -r
}
PROMPT_COMMAND=' share_history ' shopt -u histappend export HISTSIZE=9999
変更を保存した上で、すべてのbash端末を立ち上げなおせば有効になります。これにより、以下のようなロジックにて、コマンド履歴が複数端末間で常に同期されるようになります。
[ クリックで拡大 ]
基本的な原理は、各端末にて何かしらのコマンドを実行する度に、
1 ) .bash_history ファイルに1行追記した上で
2 ) .bash_history を端末自身の履歴として読み込みなおす
という処理が毎回裏で自動実施される事で同期がとれる仕組みになっています。また各端末を閉じた際にはあいかわらず .bash_history ファイルへの " 上書き保存 " が発生しますが、常に内容の同期が取れているため毎回同じ内容が書き出されるだけなので問題ありません。
詳細 ) 追記内容の意味解 説
各行の意味は以下の通りです :
function share_history { # 以下の内容を関数として定義
history - a # .bash_historyに前回コマンドを1行追記
history -c # 端末ローカルの履歴を一旦消 去
history -r # .bash_historyから履歴を読み込み直す
}
PROMPT_COMMAND='share_history ' # 上記関数をプロンプト毎に自動実施
shopt -u histappend # .bash_history追記モードは不要なのでOFFに
export HISTSIZE=9999 # 履歴 のMAX保存数を指定
man bash を探ると、history コマンドのオプションには他にも ' history - n ' - 差分のみを . bash_history から読み込み直す - なんて機能もありましたが、zshと違って行ごとにタイムスタンプを持たない為期待通りな動作はしませんでした。という訳でやむを得ず
' history - c ' と ' history - r' を組み合わせて、履歴を毎回再読み込みさせている次第です。
注意点 ) HISTSIZE が大きいとレスポンスが重くなるかも
' HISTSIZE=履歴MAX保存数 ' にてさかのぼれるコマンドの数を指定できますが、ヘビーユーザーの中には数十万-数百万行とか指定している方もいると思われます。前述の通り、今回の手法は「プロンプトにて何かしらのコマンドを実行する度に、裏で .bash_history ファイルを再度読み込み直す 」 事をしているため、HISTSIZEがあまりに大きいとbashのレスポンスが遅くなると思われます。どれくらい実用に耐えうるか、僕の
Pentium M 1.2GHz + RAM 256MB な colinux / Debian 環境で試してみたところ 、
HISTSIZE=300000 ( 30 万 ) で、プロンプト表示毎に「んっ」と一瞬もたつく程度
でした。screenの場合も同程度。もちろんHISTSIZEを数千-数万件に抑えればレスポンスは向上します。これを是とするかどうかは各々で判断ください。いまいちだと感じた場合は冒頭で触れた zsh の利用をオススメします 。
任意の環境でレスポンスを気軽に試せるよう、ダミーなコマンド履歴で埋め尽くされた .bash_history ファイルを生成することのできるperlスクリプトを用意しました。以下のように実行することで同階層に任意の行数の .bash_history ファイルが生成されます。
$ perl make_dummy_history.pl 100000 →同階層に履歴 数10万件の . bash_history ファイルを出力
中身はてんで出鱈目な内容ですが、レスポンスを計るだけなら充分使えます。これを
~/.bash_history ファイルとして置き換えて、.bashrc 内のHISTSIZEに任意の保存数を指定した上で端末を立ち上げ直してください。Enterキーを押す度にレスポンスを確かめる事ができます。

March 9 , 2007  -- Eric Eaton is a 78 - year - old in top physical shape .
But on Monday , after going out for his daily three - mile jog , Eaton never returned home -- the former marathon runner was hit by a car .
By the time police arrived at the scene , eyewitnesses told them it was too late .
They had already discovered that Eaton was n't breathing .
" When I walked around the car , I saw an elderly male laying on the street with a blanket over him , " said Tina Lacertosa , the deputy who showed up at the scene .
But when she took a second look , Lacertosa realized Eaton still had life left in him .
" I lifted up the blanket , and I thought I felt a slight pulse , so at that time I just began CPR .
And within 15 to 30 seconds Mr. Eaton … began coughing , " she said .
An Angel in Uniform
On " Good Morning America , " Eaton , his wife , Joan , and Lacertosa talked about Eaton 's near - death experience from his hospital bed in Hollywood , Fla .
Clutching his wife with one hand and Lacertosa with the other , Eaton said he barely recalled getting struck by the car .
" I did n't remember .
I finished my jog and then … I was given CPR by Tina , " he said .
" I was in heaven .
I just thought … ' Where am I ?
Where am ? ' "
Joan Eaton realized something had happened to her husband when he did n't return home as expected and she saw police cars blocking his normal jogging route .
" He was about 20 minutes late from his normal jog , so I was getting worried , " she said .
" I got in my car and went around the block and I did see the police cars . …
I ran to the front where the police car was , and Tina was there . "
Lacertosa said that once she started administering CPR , Eaton began coughing and clutched her hand .
She joked that since that moment he had n't let go of her .
Eaton 's family calls her an angel for saving the soon - to - be 79 - year - old husband and father .
Doctors have told Eaton that he will likely make a full recovery .
When he leaves his hospital bed , he intends to hit the road .
Asked whether he'd jog again , Eaton said , " Oh , yes . "
His wife echoed : " We hope . "
INSPIRED by our PM and with a burning desire to be a fiscal conservative , I approached my children with a household version of an AWA .
The offer ?
In exchange for a slight increase in pocket money they would sign away previous " childhood " award conditions including tooth fairy bonuses , Easter egg allowances , Christmas presents and all current birthday " fringe benefits " .
They were sceptical that this arrangement was going to be a winner for them but then I explained the regime of " user - pays " that I had devised for our shiny new economic rationalist household .
From their slightly increased " pay packet " the kiddies will be expected to fork out for extras like DVDs , trips to the movies , sporting equipment , music lessons and non-essential food items .
It 's a radical change but I am confident that in a couple of years we will have eradicated household debt and be the proud owners of a healthy budget surplus .
My wife has been polling the family since the introduction of our domestic AWAs and she reports that my popularity is sliding .
The latest poll reported that the vagrant who inhabits a nearby park has achieved a 62 per cent rating as " preferred father figure " , a lead of 62 percentage points on me .
But this is n't a popularity contest - it 's about the bottom line !
1 . Use light colors and clever contrasts .
Shop These Products Now : Tv’s Floor Lamp
In a small space , everything counts .
This is the main idea behind this article , which will teach you how to make a small room look bigger by simply applying a few clever tricks .
Small rooms can feel confining and uncomfortable .
But certain design concepts fool the eye and make interiors seem much more spacious than they are .
Color techniques , furniture arranging and smart lighting are just some of the topics we cover in this post .
We hope these ideas will inspire you .
Shop These Products Now : Curtains
A while back , we had a post on room color and how it affects your mood .
Here ’s how to use color to make a room look bigger .
( Hint : It is all about optical illusion . )
It is a generally known fact that light colors make a room look bigger and brighter .
Light and bright walls are more reflective , making a space feel open and airy , which helps maximize the effect created by natural light .
Dark colors , on the other hand , tend to absorb light , making a room look smaller .
For an optimum effect , select soft tones of off - white , blue and green , and always remember that brighter rooms look bigger and more inviting .
Try painting your wall trim and moldings in a lighter color than your walls .
By doing so , the walls will appear farther back , making your living room seem bigger .
2. Lighting is a key element in opening up a space .

Allowing natural light inside the room opens up the interior and makes it look larger .
If you do not have a lot of natural light , you can add some creative effects using lighting fixtures .
You will be amazed at how this small addition can make a big difference .
If you have access to natural light , bringing it into your home through large windows will instantly connect the room with the outdoors , no longer limiting your space .
Use sheer window coverings , or pull them back completely , to allow more light in .
If the view is bad , put plants or flowers near the windows and use lamps to brighten the space .
3 . Cut the clutter .
Shop These Products Now : Lamp
Keep your room tidy and organized .
There ’s nothing that makes a small space feel cramped more than having too much stuff .
With things neatly arranged and out of sight , the space that is in view will feel orderly and open .
A cluttered room equals a smaller room .
Do n’t cover your walls with a lot of pictures .
One large painting works better than a group of small paintings .
If there ’s too much going on , all clamoring for attention , it can make the room feel busy and crowded .
When decorating a small room , create a focal point — one area or feature that will draw the eye .
In the dining room , this will probably be the table .
In the bedroom , it will most likely be the bed .
Make that focal point the star of the room .
Arrange the furniture so that focus is drawn to that area , and keep the décor in the rest of the room to a minimum ( limit the number of accessories ) .
Keep the floor as clear as possible .
This is one of the most important ways to maintain a sense of spaciousness .
Take out large rugs to create the illusion of more floor space .
4 . Well - placed mirrors can do wonders .

Mirrors can make your room look larger .
Use a focal point and angle your mirrors toward it to give the illusion of depth .
Mirrors also reflect both natural and artificial light to make a room brighter during the day and night .
They bounce light deep into the room , making it appear larger .
Placing a mirror near a window to reflect the outdoors is especially effective .
Mirrors on the walls and glass tabletops will give your room a more open feel .
You can also use mirrored cabinet doors to make spaces feel larger .
5. Maximize your furniture arrangement .
Shop These Products Now : Curtains
Sometimes furniture can take up a lot of space .
To avoid that , use multi-functional furniture , such as a chest that can be used as a coffee table , a sofa bed or a bed with drawers for storage underneath .
Use an expandable dining table , folding tables and nesting tables , which can be tucked away when you do n’t need them .
Place larger pieces of furniture against the walls to maximize the open space .
Scale your furniture to fit the size of the room , and do n’t block pathways .
If furniture and accessories block the view into a room , it will look cramped .
By moving furniture out and away from walkways , you ’ll open up the space and make it feel larger .
At least some of the furniture should be the same color as the walls .
Even bigger items such as armoires and chests will begin to blend in , expanding the room .
The longest straight line in any room is the diagonal .
When you place your furniture at an angle , it leads the eye along the longer distance rather than the shorter wall .
As a bonus , you often get some additional storage space behind the piece in the corner .
Tall furniture can make the ceiling seem lower than it actually is .
Make sure there is plenty of space between your furniture , too .
Choose a sofa and chairs with open arms and exposed legs .
This allows light to filter under the furniture , making the room appear airier .
Glass tables also will help to maintain the appearance of an open space .
Kiva is building on its success as well .
It has given out more than $ 400,000 in loans .
And what started in one small village in Uganda has spread to 11 other countries just in its first year .
As for life in the Acholi Quarter , new houses are being built , and more people are becoming small - business owners , helping to support their families .
Working in the quarry is no longer their only option .
Before he leaves , Boyd accompanies Janet , the loan officer , to deliver some good news to Amos , the furniture maker .
In less than a week there have been enough lenders on the Kiva Web site to complete his loan of $ 1,100 , and they deliver the money to a grateful and beaming recipient .
If past experience is any measure , Amos will repay the loan in just a few months .
So far Kiva has a repayment rate of 100 precent .
Jessica takes
Boyd to meet some of the businesses that were started with these first loans and tells him , " If they failed , the whole idea probably would have stopped right there . "
Moses Onyango , the microfinance partner who helped organize those first loans , explains what happened next .
" Immediately , when the first businesses were logged on the site , they got funding of $ 3,100 .
They wired the money to me .
I brought the money to the village .
I gave the money out to them .
And the businesses started immediately . "
Boyd travels with the couple to the rural area of Tororo in eastern Uganda , where the first seven enterprise grants were given out .
Jessica Flannery tells
Boyd that , on her first trip to Africa , she was struck by how a small amount of money could go such a long way , and she returned home to tell her husband , Matt .
Inspired by her report , Matt Flannery built a Web site with a simple concept in mind -- peer to peer lending that makes microcredit more efficient and accessible .
Jessica Flannery first came to Uganda in 2004 to do some development work with a group called Village Enterprise Fund .
The fund was providing grants to a handful of local business owners to help them grow their enterprises and , in turn , create a trickle of prosperity down to others in the community .
Back in the Ugandan capital of Kampala , Boyd meets up with Matt and Jessica Flannery , Kiva 's co-founders .
The two normally live in San Francisco but are here to see the progress of their online loan program firsthand .
Grace Ayaa also looks after more than her own family .
She is the assistant director of Life in Africa , another of Kiva 's local partners in Uganda .
At the weekly meeting of her Life in Africa group , three loan requests are up for review .
It 's a lively affair in an outdoor garden setting .
People fire off questions to the new applicants , who must give a good account of why they should be chosen .
Those present are invested in making the right decisions , as they are all responsible if the business should fail .
One of the hopefuls , Molly , has her loan officer explain that she needs $ 275 to set up a stall selling charcoal for fuel .
One woman calls out that she supports Molly 's loan but that she should not hire her son .
" He refused to go to school 10 years ago , " she says .
" He might be capable of stealing or disrupting the business . "
It 's a close community , and people know much about each other 's lives .
Molly 's loan is approved , and soon enough it 's uploaded to Kiva 's Web site halfway across the world .
As Boyd travels across Uganda , meeting people and listening to their stories , he finds that many struggle to support much more than just themselves .
In the town of Mbale , Amos Mayoka , a furniture maker , is hoping to get a loan of around $ 1,000 to expand two businesses he has started .
" My elder brothers passed away of AIDS and left me with a lot of children .
So now it 's entirely on me to keep up the two families , " Mayoka tells Boyd .
When asked how many people he supports , Mayoka responds , " More than 20 . " Amos ' picture and story are uploaded to the Kiva site , and his loan officer Janet will monitor the progress of his request .
" Banks do n't value emotional returns , " says Shah , " so they will charge a high interest rate to these microfinance institutions .
But people are a little more forgiving .
Today , your average person can't actually invest in small businesses in the developing world . "
By creating Kiva , Shah says , " we 're tapping into this new source of capital , " which is ordinary people .
Kiva has been connecting lenders with would - be entrepreneurs for a year now , but it is a small operation , relying on donations and a staff of seven in San Francisco to keep things running .
Premal Shah , who used to work for PayPal , is Kiva 's president , and he explains the role Kiva is trying to carve out in the microfinance world .
Other lenders in the United States talk about their experiences .
" My husband 's hobby is rebuilding old motorcycles , " says Donna Slote , who loaned to a small motorcycle workshop she saw on the site .
" It 's incredibly personal in the sense that you get to choose the specific businesses that you want to loan to .
You have a real connection with where your money 's going and what it 's being used for , " adds Slote .
Back in San Francisco , we see the other side of the operation , meeting some of the people who found Kiva 's site and decided to make a loan .
Nathan Folkert is a software engineer who lives in the city 's Mission District .
He read Grace Ayaa 's story online and decided to help fund her peanut butter business .
Ayaa is one of 70 businesses Folkert has loaned money to .
He pulls up Grace 's journal page where a message is waiting for him .
" Thanks so much Nathan , " Grace has written .
" I purchased the fridge and bought the packing materials , and this has really enabled me to produce more . "
Most people living here work all day in the local rock quarry breaking rocks used to build houses .
The pay is around $ 1 a day .
Ayaa helps people in the quarter out of the quarry work and into a position where they can start viable businesses with the help of a loan .
Traditionally , micro credit is offered through banks that charge as much as 35 percent interest or moneylenders who charge as much as 300 percent .
Kiva provides loans from individuals at a fraction of the cost .
Boyd travels to Uganda to find out more about the real - world impact of these micro loans ,
He arranges to meet Grace Ayaa , whose peanut butter business received a micro loan through Kiva .
When she fled a brutal war between government and rebel forces in the north , she took refuge in the capital .
She takes Boyd to the Acholi Quarter , a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Kampala , where many people displaced by Uganda 's decades - long conflict scrape together a living .
Kiva , which means " agreement " or " unity " in Swahili , would allow people with a little bit of extra cash to use their credit card or the online money transfer company , PayPal , to lend directly to African entrepreneurs .
Kiva got its start a little more than a year ago in Uganda , where it forged partnerships with local microfinance institutes so that each business would be vetted and approved before being posted on the site .
Microcredit is not new .
It 's been around in one form or another for hundreds of years .
But in the Information Age , a San Francisco company has taken the idea of microfinance and upgraded it for the Web.
Radio reporter Clark Boyd first reported about Kiva.org for Public Radio International 's news program The World .
He now travels to Uganda for FRONTLINE / World , where the first recipients of money collected through Kiva 's Web site are building and expanding businesses .
Roodman continues to blog about Kiva 's challenges saying the special peer - to - peer relationship that Kiva built its reputation on and that became the heart of our original Kiva report in Uganda is now " partly fictional . "
We recommend you follow Roodman 's blog , where you 'll find Kiva 's responses to his criticisms and how they are changing up their model .
In a blog post in October 2009 entitled Kiva is Not Quite What it Seems .
Roodman took Kiva to task for not accurately portraying the way it now distributes the money raised , and invited Kiva 's CEO Matt Flannery to respond .
It used to be that businesspeople who had been approved for a loan were listed on Kiva ’s website , where anyone could read their stories , and choose to lend to that specific business via PayPal .
Roodman 's look under the hood at this lender - to - borrower connection became the thrust of wider criticism in November when a New York Times story raised fundamental questions about how Kiva 's microlending practices have evolved .
July 13 , 2010 : Reporter 's Update :
When we first traveled to Uganda to report on Kiva 's online peer - to - peer lending model in 2006 , the San Francisco - based nonprofit had just surpassed $ 500,000 in loans .
Four years later , that loan figure has surpassed $ 100 million .
But there have been growing pains , and in recent months they have drawn the scrutiny of author and blogger David Roodman , who follows developments in microfinance at the Center for Global Development .

Oh my God !
I´m so exited about this news !
It ´s the best way to help people who really need .
Even here , in Argentina , we live in PARADISE compared to what people in Africa have to deal with everyday !
Now , I ´m really thinking about making something similar ... so that the idea spreads out get to as many needed people as possible .
At least I´ll sign up to Kiva .
It ´s great when you realise that you can help needed people with as simple things as a click ! ;)

This reminds of a Chinese saying : " Give a man a fish and feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish and you will feed him for life . "
The micro loan program is the best way to give assistance to the people who REALLY need it -- no corruption / politics involved .
For all it is worth , people regain or acquire self dignity , which is every person 's dream .

Let 's step back one step .
If it were not for PBS none of us would have the marvelous opportunity to participate in an organization like Kiva .
I saw the initial program over a year ago and was struck by the simplicity of the idea .
However , had it not been for the consistently excellent broadcast philosophy of PBS I would not have become hooked on PBS in general and Frontline in particular .
Watching PBS daily gives me a wonderful window to see the USA and the world .
Opportunity for learning and doing presents itself daily on your local PBS station .
Watch and contribute !

I am a woman who always felt dependent upon my husband for money and frustrated that I felt I could n't accomplish any significant giving , as I longed to do .
With KIVA
I now am thrilled to know that even I can contribute in a very meaningful and creative way , and the best part is that when my loan is repaid I can give again , and again .
I plan to tell everyone about this program , starting with my kids .
For their birthdays , and Christmas gifts , I plan to donate in their names so they can experience this joy too !
This whole story is inspiring - great .

I was so pleased to see a story that did not evoke despair , but rather emphasized the creativity , humour , and industriousness of those living in the Third World .
Your features on Afghanistan , Uganda , and Paraguay , which I caught by chance , were each riveting ; I look forward to watching Frontline regularly !

I teach Entrepreneurship and think this would be a great philanthropic project for my students .
I 'm thinking we could take a portion of the profits from our businesses and select someone to invest in and keep it going from semester to semester as new students enter my class .
Fantastic organization and a great way to help others help themselves as well as the economic well - being of their communities .

This show is one of the reasons I watch PBS ( I do n't even have cable ) .
Just as PBS can change our lives , we can change other lives .
As a business owner / entrepreneur , I can relate to these people and would not hesitate to to help .
Luckily , I have not had to borrow for the business , but these people have no choice .
Thanks Frontline !

Thanks for airing the Kiva story again .
I signed up right after the original broadcast , once I could get past the avalanche of traffic you brought to Kiva .
I am now an enthusiastic lender with Kiva and will continue to expand my portfolio .
It occurred to me that one reason for the huge response is that Kiva lenders and Frontline viewers come from the same gene pool ; those that appreciate getting at the truth and doing the right thing .

KIVA 's founders are creative , compassionate people who have turned an idea into an inspirational reality .
I will happily be a lender .
I also look forward to involvement in a local version of this great program so we can help our neighbors in this same way .

To whom it may concern , I am really pleased to see that the common day to day Americans are more focused on a micro level to help people in poorer countries .
I applaud you for what you are doing and i plan on joining you guys in the not too distant feature .
I want to also thank PBS for their outstanding programing .
I as one who is from the African diaspora know the burden of people each and everyday .
I have relatives living in Africa and I support them financially because it is the right thing to do .
I do n't loan them money but I help as much as I am able to .
I am now thinking of doing what you guys are doing in other parts of the world .
BRAVO TO YOU ALL .

I first learned of Kiva just a few weeks ago .
I noticed that they were a sponsor of one of my favorite places .....
zaadz.com ... where people are coming together in peace from all over .
So naturally while I was watching the re-run of this I was excited .
( Thanks for re-running this story . )
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
We are pleased to have re-run our story about Kiva last night ( April 10 , 2007 ) .
When we first broadcast this story in October 2006 it elicited an enormously positive response and prompted many people to make micro-loans through Kiva .
We are happy to see that this is happening again .
( anonymous )
That Frontline story on Kiva and the women from Uganda were powerful and humbling .
I have seen the face of poverty in my life but never did I have it as bad as breaking rocks all day in a quarry .
To see a woman starting a peanut butter business with so little , is inspiring .
I hope many more in the world see this story !

I just caught your show " A Little Goes a Long Way " by accident .
I was napping , and woke up just as it aired .
I think it was heaven sent .
I have been complaining for years that there was no way to give directly to people in need , with out 80 % going to " Administrative Overhead " .
And then of course , you never really knew if any of it got to the person who needed it .
Thank You Kiva .
I am 65 years old , and my only income is Social Security , but even I can give to help someone else .
And what a great feeling to do so .
After reading all the
feedback from people who have given , I plan to be a regular every time I can .

It gave me back faith in human beings being able to make a difference .
I want to access Kiva 's web site , and imagine many are trying to do the same ( server is down ! ! ) .
I am ready to lend a hand and help make a difference .
Thanks for informing !

This story moved me like no news story ever has .
After working on several biological research projects , including my PhD thesis , in Nicaragua I had known that the experience touched and changed me , yet I am still realizing just how deeply .
At first , I wanted to give money away to everyone I met .
That all changes when you see the desperation , the fighting among those who have become accustomed to our hand - outs and you realize that charity misplaced does nothing to solve , but rather feeds additional poverty .
Kiva has a sound strategy for empowering those who truly desire to improve thier own lives without breeding more poverty .
Kiva 's grantees can now look for customers and business strategies rather than hand - out lines .

KAMPALA , UGANDA
Hello , am a 22yr old student at Makerere university [ in Uganda ] .
Recently I learned about the great work done by kiva lenders on " The Oprah Winfrey show " at a friend 's hostel room .
Having to finish university in a year 's time and then swim helplessly in a sea of high unemployment and limited opportunities , I have [ instead ] a good business idea that I want to develop .
I see kiva as a God - sent angel to give life to my idea .
I beseech you to email me via my address telling what steps and all necessary conditions to take in order to access a kiva loan .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
The best thing to do is contact kiva.org directly .
We , of course , are a news organization and do not make loans ourselves .
We merely report the news and draw attention to worthy groups such as kiva .

I 've been a Kiva addict since I learned about it in Bill Clinton 's book , " Giving . "
Thank you very much for continuing to spread the word .
Many people fear giving to charity as so much of the money is wasted on administrative costs , or worry that they 're just breeding dependence in Africa .
A new generation of organizations are emerging that give 100 % of donated funds to the intended recipient , and help others to help themselves .
The media coverage that Kiva gets has resulted in loans being funded in hours , not weeks .
I really appreciate anyone in the media giving time and attention to causes like this , rather than giving into the sensationalism and negativity that seem to take over at times like this .
kampala , uganda
I have tried to find how these loans are accessed , to no avail .
Please let me know how an enterprise gets on to the kiva web .

Warning , lending with Kiva is addictive .
In the months since I started I 've helped fund 10 businesses .
I am having withdrawal symptoms since I have had to slow down to give others a chance to experience what I have .
You do n't have to be rich to help .
It makes you feel happy .
I hope soon we 'll have many more businesses added so the lending demand can be satisfied .

My 6th grade class has decided to raise some money for people in Africa after studying many African countries .
I have heard about micro loans on NPR and suggested it to my class .
I told them I would research it and get back to them .
This made me cry .
I am so excited to show this to my class .
They plan on having bake sales and used book sales to raise money to loan to people .
I hope that they will read and respond to this site as well .

I am interested in more information about the Kiva project and how I can help .

I felt somewhat ashamed when the Christmas buying frenzy began again this year .
My grandchildren have so many playthings that none remain significant for long .
So this year , Christmas gifts included Kiva registrations and funding for the first small loans .
We intend to add to this over time and ask the children to manage lending choices as soon as they are able .
Perhaps these privileged young North Americans will gain understanding of the world and learn empathy for those in need .
Thank you to the generous young Americans who conceived Kiva and brought it to reality .

I saw the program on Christmas Day and what a present to me and to others who were as affected I was .
Bless Kiva for helping so many others and for giving cynical people like me a way to help where the money is not wasted by the governments and others who beg for money and then keep 10 to 80 per cent of what they collect .
Austin , TX
Thank you , Frontline .
I do n't watch TV ; I just came to your website looking for some visual stimulation to while away the evening .
And lo , thanks to this wonderful documentary I 'm already a Kiva contributor !
Do keep bringing other avenues to making a difference to our attention .
Many are eager to do their part , if only they knew how .

I have been stuggling trying to get my business up and running after not feeling well and having a hard time with support and motivating myself .
When I saw the advertisement on Oprah before it was done I said , " That 's it , help some one as I help myself and GIVE BACK what it is that I am in need of as well ! "
Planting seeds has always been most effective in my walk of faith and this was a perfect opportunity , not only for me but my family to get involved in the process and watch God move from planting to harvesting ( not just financially ) .
For me it's about the the lesson and then the blessing , laying a strong foundation in principles of disciplining oneself in being active and faithful in deed and not just word only !
Thank you Kiva and may the Lord bless your ministry because that 's truly what it is , helping those that have little or nothing at all ...

I am writting to commend the president and all the leaders [ of Kiva ] and everyone who lends through kiva for the wonderful job you are doing for the poor people all over the world .

I 'm originally from Uganda and your story brought tears to my eyes .

What I love so much about this initiative is that it supports people 's own ideas .
They know best what their communities need .
So many " aid " programs are so wrongheaded because they impose the donor 's value system .
Traditional charity aid just does n't work .
This just might ...
My mom gave me a gift certificate for my birthday to start me off and then I made three addition loans .
Go Kiva !

I too have problems with my education if any one could help , otherwise I was amazed that in the world we have people with big hearts from so far away who want to help people in our country - this to me is GOD given and to me even if I do not get support I know at least a brother or sister is being helped so keep up the good spirit only god rewards such deeds .

Does anyone know if there are any other similar sites ?
Virginia Sweeney
Summerville , South Carolina
came across the story by accident while channel surfing .
i was most impressed by the way the people involved with KIVA helped those who really needed the help .
I do not have a lot to lend but feel that lending a small amount to one centain person would be more benifical to that cause than donating it to a large charity where the money does n't seem to dribble down to those who really need it .
i would appreciate a more detailed way of funding someone .
keep up the good work .
Jay Pasqua

I think this story was from the heart .
I watched your program on how help was given to the people of Uganda .
You really do n't know what you have untill you see this program and realise you can still make a difference for other people .
I guess we realize what we have and help others in need .
I would like to become part of this lending program to try and help make a difference .
God works in many ways .
Take a minute to look at you own life , and see what you can do big or small to help others .

I saw the Frontline piece on Kiva about 6 months ago .
I signed up and started loaning the next day .
I have Kiva bookmarked and I visit often .
Be forwarned , loaning in such a direct way can be addictive .
It 's hard to visit the site without giving .
Some of my loans have now been repaid ( well ahead of schedule ) and I can now loan the money to others .
My goal is to include 100 loans in my " portfolio " .
I 'm nearly a third of the way there .
Be generous .
Susan Tripp
Berkeley , California
I was so pleased by this idea that I thought there must be a catch , so I looked up some critiques of microcredit : " Recent studies have found that microlenders regularly fail to help people attain permanent self - employment because they so often fail to ensure that the loans are actually used by their borrowers to start small businesses .
" Most disappointing of all , such programs have been quite unsuccessful in reaching the poorest individuals who are the purported targets of their efforts .
Meanwhile , even the most successful microfinance programs are unable to sustain themselves without aid of foundation or government support .
" The microfinance industry is still in the process of diagnosing these failures , but one underlying cause appears to be that , like any other development strategy , microlending for the purpose of developing small businesses is a complicated endeavor that requires a localized understanding of the particular economic , cultural and social factors affecting entrepreneurial success . "
I guess the ultimate proof is when these economies become self - sustaining and able to uplift even the poorest , which our society has failed to do .

I only learned about micro loans last year , and I absolutely LOVE the KIVA approach -- get people involved with people ... beautiful !
Please notify me , if you can , when you 're back up and running .
With smiles and hope ,

I am trying to get to the kiva site so that i can see how I could help in the lending specially if there is one for Ethiopia but having trouble getting to the web site .

Like everyone else , I was overcome by the generosity of spirit - of both lender and recipient .
In a world so filled with chaos and heartbreak , watching this story breathed new , hopeful air back into me .
I 'm originally from S.F. and so happy to know of this new non-profit .
As a frequent traveler to Africa , and with wonderful friends in East Africa , I hope to participate in Kiva 's project and wish both Kiva , and the deserving entrepreneurs , nothing but the best .
This , is what life is supposed to be .
Charlottesville , VA
Let 's see what we can do with this opportunity .
Thank you for educating us , thanks to Kiva for the foresight and effort .
Time for others of us to step up .
Thank you .

This is a great idea that will put out of business to the corrupt African governments .
Hopefully Western countries can learn something from Kiva and will give their loans directly to the people not to the corrupt governments .

I cant find the website for Kiva , please help , I would like to start helping .
Newfane , Vermont
I saw your video , checked out the Kiva website and sent a loan to a fisherwoman in Samoa .
I sent a link to friends I thought might be interested , and posted a notice with links to Kiva and your video on iBrattleboro.com , our local citizen journalism website .
Even children who pool their resources can make a loan and " adopt " an adult , who in turn will provide food , shelter and clothing for others .

As a new Kiva lender I was so moved as to create a 24 hour Live Internet Talkathon http://talkathon.org for March 18th , 2007 .
Oh , we wo n't do as much as Frontline , but we hope to do as much as we can .
Kiva.org is the most important development I 've seen on the web since the web itself .

This idea is very worthy of people taking action .
I am glad to see the return on investment in one year .
Great job Kiva founders !
Keep it up !
I am inspired .

This seems like an amazing opportunity .
One feels so doubtful about giving to some charity without really knowing how the money will be spent .
This kind of enterprise , bypassing much of the government red tape at both ends , and with a personal touch , is fantastic .
And even Americans who are n't so wealthy themselves can afford to invest $ 50 and not worry about whether they even get it back .
Tiago Alves

Great job covering Kiva 's work !
I personally had the privilege of listening to Kiva 's president when he came to the University of San Francisco .
I recorded the event and it is available here : http://www.usfmbapodcast.com
Hope you find it as interesting as I did !

The entrepreneurship in Uganda has touched me in deeply .
The pride in the eyes of the people does a lot for my view of Africa .
I am a college student , but I know that I could give money easily .
Thank you for opening my eyes to another way to serve my community .

I wish to participate in this wonderful project .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Please contact Kiva directly at Kiva.org to find out more about becoming a donor .

I record Frontline weekly and catch up when I can .
I finally watched the episode on Kiva last night ( 11/24/06 ) and was greatly moved .
I signed on to help three businesses .
Your program is still having impact many weeks after the original airtime .
Hey , I missed the outages at Kiva by viewing it so late ! ;-)

I 'm a high school Economics teacher .
I showed my students Frontline 's story about micro credit that was broadcast last year .
Now Kiva provides us an opportunity to contribute .
We are planning a fundraising project and school - wide awareness of this wonderful project .
It is an excellent way to teach about global citizenship while also connecting to economic standards .

Great story .
This is on lines with the Nobel prize given to micro loans concept in S. Asia , but here the addition of technology makes it more heartfelt .
It brings a lot more satisfaction for the deed .
Thanks for bringing this out .
Christine
Seattle , WA
A week later and I still cannot get it out of my mind .
So many possibilities , everything from charity , learning how to invest , using this as a method of teaching children about both economy and helping others .
I will start with our family , then reach out to my community to participate along with Kiva .
Thank you for creating Kiva and for broadcasting its story .
This is real news .

For the past four years I have been working on an outreach project in a small batay ( village ) in the Dominican Republic .
Two years ago , we began an attempt to establish a micro lending program for the village after realizing that what the people there needed more than donated clothing , school supplies and medicine was a self sustaining , functioning economy that could survive outside the exploitation of the tourist and global economics that ravage such places .
Thanks to Frontline for demonstrating the power of microeconomics for their TV audience !
Los Angeles , CA
I think it 's a beautiful program .
The only problem I have is why do people feel they have to go so far , even through the net , to help ?
When you really want to help , you start in your own backyard .
When you help somewhere else and ignore what 's around you , then that is not wanting to give .
Famous people go out of this country where they make their millions and ignore the orphans here and go half - way around the world to adopt .
What about our orphans ?
We have orphans .
We do n't like to call them that , but we do .
Going all the way to the other side of the world to help or to adopt a baby is not really wanting to help , and it is n't really wanting a baby for the right reasons .
So you see , your program is great and it is helping a lot of people all the way on the other side of the world .
We even have hungry , homeless people here .
You do n't have to look so far to help .
But maybe I 'm wrong ; it 's happened before .
Vicki Allen

It 's nice to know that any individual can actually do something to help make a difference in this world .
Why is n't this info in the headlines ?
I think more people would help if they just knew how .
Jason Bursey

This is beautiful .
Thank you so much for reporting on Kiva .
Are there other groups like them ?
Norbert Tokarski

Right out of the Bible : Feed a man today and tomorrow he is hungry .
Empower him to feed himself and he hungers no more .
This is incredible !
I will keep partnering with Kiva forever .
Thank you Frontline for this exposition without which I , and apparently many others , would never have known of the great humanitarian effort that Kiva makes possible .
If only some of those people with those things hanging on their ears at the U.N. would have seen this excellent piece of journalism !
Edmond , OK
Is a video or DVD currently available for purchase from the piece - " Uganda : A Little Goes A Long Way " ?
If not now , are there plans to make it available and when ?
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Yes ; the entire episode of FRONTLINE / World in which " Uganda : A Little Goes A Long Way " appeared is available for purchase .
You can buy either a VHS or DVD copy of the episode , " Burma : State of Fear , " online at www.shoppbs.org.
Glenn Norris
Edmond , OK
What a great idea !
A group of friends have been involved in micro credit for several years , investing through a major foundation .
This is so much more direct and personal .
We ( society ) seem to focus on the tragedy of the third world rather than the hope of individuals .
This is the avenue we have been looking for ( without knowing it ) .
Thanks to everyone at KIVA and FRONTLINE WORLD for another great story .
Tim McKillop
Hayward , CA
What an incredible organization Kiva is putting together .
You can see the people 's faces and the great hope they have and you can deliver some of that hope with pinpoint accuracy .
It is time for people to rise to this occasion , not governments .

" We can do no great things ; only small things with great love . "

I watched the show last night were Americans can help with their credit card loan money to those wanting to start up their own business or help there business grow .
I want to help !
I was so moved and touched ; where do I go to sign up and help someone in more need than I am ?
When I search Kiva , I cannot locate where to make a donation or become a lender .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Go to www.kiva.org; at the top of the page , select the " Lend " button .
That will take you to a page where you can select from a list of Kiva 's current loan applicants .
San Jose , CA
I would like to see those wanting loans so I can get on board .
WHAT A GREAT WAY TO GIVE where it is truly needed .

Micro lending calls forth the essence of being human in both the lender and the borrower .
I believe it is the only way to address poverty in the world .
Sherri Gray

Thank you Frontline for such an inspiring story .
I know where my charitable $ $ will now go .
Continue to spread the word re : micro loans .
Glens Falls , NY
I was deeply moved by this story .
I have wanted to help people in other countries but not sure if my money would actually go them .
After watching this story , I can't wait to help !
Knowing my money will better someone 's life , even if it is a small amount , is an awesome feeling .
Praise God !
Maria Wagner

I want to get involved in micro lending after seeing this show on PBS .
This is a great service to humanity .
San Francisco , CA
Thank you Kiva and thank you Frontline for a wonderful and enlightening piece on a very worthy subject .
Where do I sign up ?
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Kiva 's website is www.kiva.org.
Once on the website , select the " Lend " button at the top of the page .
Urban
Lawrenceville , GA
What an inspiration indeed !
I was quite moved by the compassion and concern for our fellow humans as shared and led by KIVA .
I 'm rushing to the kiva.org website to do my part in making our world a much better place .
Raj Saxena
Brewster , NY
The Kiva.org site is certainly working now but clearly the team is overwhelmed by the large number of individual bankers vs. the number of validated borrowers .
The lending limit is temporarily capped at $ 25 , which is a good way to at least connect individuals into the program without exhausting the current list .
Thanks to Frontline , Kiva is about to experience the rapid growth that can come with the Internet .
That growth will come with immense challenges to preserve the basic principles they started with .
I 'm sure the team 's ingenuity will help get past that and that we will see many successful Kiva clones .
Alfredo Martinez
Redwood City , CA
A great show by PBS .
The KIVA concept is a very noble and wonderful idea .
It motivates people to help and others to be able to use this help along with business guidance .

I am interested in lending too .
Kristina Mistry
San Antonio , TX
Just wanted to let everyone know that the site is up and you can contribute to the loans .
The process is very easy and rewarding .
You will not want to limit yourself to funding just one of these hardworking , deserving entrepreneurs .
Louisville , KY
The program on micro lending was the most hopeful and exciting thing that I have seen on TV in a very long time .
I cannot wait to get involved in this wonderful project !
Carrie Reiter
San Francisco , CA
Kiva is my community partner ( at Starbucks ) and a true ideal of philanthropy .
I know them and see how their small group works tenaciously night and day .
I want to thank you for giving " ordinary people " a chance to make an extraordinary positive impact in so many lives and so many countries .
May you be blessed in every aspect of your endeavors .
Redding , CA
I am glad that Kiva 's website has recovered .
Everything seems to be working except that we are limited to $ 25 donations per borrower , due to the demand to help out .
That says volumes for the affect the story had on the viewers .
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to help .
I hope you do a follow - up segment on the affect this program had on Kiva .
Beavercreek , OH
Having grown up in Peru , I have seen third world poverty first hand .
This is the best idea to help the poor I have seen so far .
My husband and I already made five Kiva loans this morning and are planning on several more gift cards for Xmas .
Any chance you will be expanding the loan services to Peru ?
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
You can contact Kiva directly at contactus@kiva.org to inquire about the locations of their current and future loan applicants .
Suisun City , CA
Story was touching , what a great idea but why are you making it so hard to find the web site ?
I can't find it listed anyplace on the PBS web site .

Heidi Hursh

I am a high school teacher in Denver at a magnet school for international studies .
My students had learned about Mohammad Yunus and the Nobel Peace Prize and then I told them about this program .
They were intrigued .
I 'm hoping that we can raise money to arrange our own micro loan .
I will also show them the video once it becomes available .
Alison
Commack , NY
Your story on KIVA really touched my heart , as nothing else has in a very long time .
And the outpouring of interest - enough to crash KIVA 's servers - is also heartwarming .
People helping empower other people - total strangers - yet all in this together .
It was a blessing today to register and then help 2 people with their dreams .
I see everyone else is doing the same thing today !
In gratitude for the blessings in my life , I plan on helping spread the word .
Thank you VERY much for this piece - and perhaps you can do a follow - up ?
Miriam Laskin
New York , NY
I was so happy , watching this documentary !
Kiva.org reminded me right away of " Donors Choose , " the education - oriented web - based organization that I 've supported for several years .
Today I managed to make two donations to folk via Kiva.org and I 'm so glad that their website is back up and that Frontline 's publicity seems to have attracted so many people like me who want to help one - on - one .
Thank you Kiva , thank you Frontline and PBS !
Lisa Eriksen
Redondo Beach , CA
So often I see people suffering , wishing I could help them .
You showed me that I can .
I 'm very exited .
This is personal .
You can SEE who you help .
We CAN make the world a better place a few people at the time .
A little trickle will become a great river .
Hurrah .
Thank you so much for the program .
Ward Martin
Green Valley , AZ
I have become more and more convinced that person - to - person giving is often more effective than merely writing checks to large , traditional organizations , however important and useful the latter may also be .
So I think KIVA and I definitely have a future together .
New York , NY
THANK YOU for bringing this to me .
It brought me to happy tears and I would love to know how to get in touch with the San Franciscans who were involved with the Uganda loan program so I can become involved in some way as well .
Thank you , thank you .
Every little bit we do counts .
This is proof .
Thank you .
As always , your programs are amazing .
Andrew Bell
New York , NY
Amidst the flurry of news stories about corrupt , anti-social , narcissistic politicians and lobbyists who produce nothing of value , the Kiva story offered a perfect antidote .
It is about faith in human nature , generosity , joy in others ' empowerment , and in actually making something tangible .
Croton on Hudson , NY
I watched Frontline this evening and was so impressed that I signed on to Kiva 's site and wanted to be a part of this .
However , I could not get past their home page .
How does one get in contact with them ?
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Kiva 's website , www.kiva.org, is now back up and running .
If you are still unable to access the site , you can email them at contactus@kiva.org .
Ardys Reverman

A heartfelt thank you for inspiring mentor guides .
Maybe support feels so good because this is the way we are designed to learn things .
You are on to something to connect our synergy and energy .
Our 21st century human story of growth and change give back our choices of spiritual awareness .
Making a difference globally and individually in a new way of whole brain learning will create far greater results working together .
Youness Shafagh

When I saw the program I was so impressed by the sense of hope that tears came to my eyes .
Please send me Kiva 's address to make a donation .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Kiva 's website is Kiva.org .
Their server is experiencing problems but you can still donate .
Keep checking back with them because their new servers will be up soon !

AMAZING !
For those in the USA that think one individual has no impact on the events of lives of others in the world , read the comments published from this one story .
Bravo Frontline , bravo Kiva , and bravo to all of you for being involved .

This has been a great achievement for Kiva and all partner MFI'S .
WOMEN'S INITIATIVE TO ERADICATE POVERTY IN UGANDA will finally meet the demand for loan money in the communities of our operations .
Thanks for the great work done by both Kiva Heading Staff and the Frontline / World Staff .
We are very grateful .

Janet is one of Kiva 's partners in Uganda , and is featured in this story .
Aaron Butler

I am currently a student in the Human Development program at Warner Pacific College .
Kiva micro-lending is the perfect topic for my group 's final presentation .
We are excited to challenge our cohort to fund one loan during the conclusion of our presentation .
Wonderful idea Kiva .
Kudos to you .
Thank you Frontline / World ...
Brent Duncan

This was one of the most remarkable shows I have seen on how to make a real lasting difference in a part of the world where one dollar can go a long way .
In this case one dollar can multiply with judicial administration .
Imagine when these new entrepreneurs start to become micro lenders themselves to feed the growth as a second generation of lenders on projects like this .
Brooke Anderson

Amazing and impressive .
I 'm moved by the tenacity and hard work of the KIVA team who are making all of this happen .
They are blessing many !
Steve Forsey
North Tonawanda , NY
Like the rest of those sharing their comments , I look forward to , and am even anxious about accessing the Kiva website to be able to grasp the whole idea more completely .
I will definitely become involved in this worldwide project and anticipate that it will realize extraordinary mainstream success within a couple years .
What we can all do is place the website link on our messenger lists for others to inquire about and access in order to spread the word more rapidly .
Anyone with skype would find this an invaluable way to spread the message .
Also it would be nice if in the future the lender can also offer to donate the interest charged on the loan to the borrower so that Kiva is compensated while the borrower has nothing additional to pay back beyond the amount of the loan itself .
To anyone interested , lets individually , yet collectively , consider ways in which we can promote and encourage the message that Kiva conveys .
I am really excited about this .
Bronx , NY
As a young woman just starting out , many people reached out to me with assistance in myriad ways ; informing me of childcare programs , college loans , and job opportunities , all of which helped me to become a self sufficient contributing member of society .
I 'm living proof that small amounts of help and hard work can sometimes be all that is needed to change lives .
I plan on paying it forward , thanks to Frontline and Kiva.org !
oswego , NY
Micro-lending works .
I am so glad to see Premal 's work .
Kiva 's work is so right on the money ( wink ) .
We all want to help , and it is the ONLY way things will change , because we are the ONLY ones that want things to change .
I am not really convinced that the big guys really are 100 committed .
There are so MANY reasons to think POVERTY is defeatable but for the Will to do so .
Here with KIVA -- well , it cuts through the red tape .
Thanks .
Maybe while we wait , more people will start up such organizations .
Maybe I will .
I have only been thinking about it for 20 years .
But till then , keep on with the good work and as soon as I can I will give more of me than words .
Robert Nelson
SEATTLE , WA
Great Show , wonderful idea and it is heartening to learn that it is working .

I lend private and residential money for a living and I see how so many people take $ 1.00 for granted .
My daughters are starting to save so that they can help finance a business and make someone 's dream come true .
God CAN work and bless people with KIVA 's help from a world away !
How can I get a copy of this program so that I can send it to my family .
Great idea for Senior projects in High Schools !
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
You can buy this on DVD or VHS from www.shoppbs.org or by calling ( 800 ) PLAY PBS .
Search for Episode VI - you have to buy the entire hour - long broadcast .
The title is " Burma : State of Fear " -- it is titled by the first story on the program .
The Kiva story is the second story on this episode of FRONTLINE / World .
In addition , the entire piece will be available to watch on our website as of November 7th 2006 .

I was born in Nairobi and lived in Kampala until I was 9 years of age .
For years , I have been seeing stories of corruption , crime and decline of these countriesâ€TM economy .
I love the innovation of this organization and how it has created hope for many great people that normally would not have much hope .
I was extremely inspired by the story but more by the people and their accountability .
Count me in as soon as the site is back up !!!
Carrie Durant
Hamilton , Canada
I only caught the last half of this show and have been moved not only by the wonderful results from the program the founders created for micro-lending , but mostly by the fact that many in North America are actually doing something rather than just thinking of others in need .
Congratulations to mankind for contributing to those truly in need who want to help themselves .
Rajesh K
Boston , MA
A fabulous idea - better than giving money for free , since the effects of funds invested in micro-financing are much more profound and long lasting .
I appreciate the wonderful work Kiva has been doing with the initiative and am grateful to PBS / FRONTLINE for providing the much needed exposure to kiva.org .
Claudia Nagy

Thank you !
I will return to be part of this awesome initiative .

Dearest Kiva ,
I recently stumbled onto a website called www.untoursfoundation.org/.
I forwarded the website to many of my friends yesterday because I was so impressed with the great work that is going on and the way it was being done .
All things are connected and therefore we ALL benefit when we empower one another .
This morning my friend saw the forwarded website and told me about the Frontline show she watched last night about Kiva .
There are no such things as coincidence .
I am so deeply touched , pleased , thrilled , jubilant , ecstatic that creative minds have come up with viable , valuable and very real solutions to so many of the world 's problems .
When people feel good about themselves and can feed , clothe and school their families they make the world a better place .
These are Win / Win / Win / Win solutions .
How could anyone not want to support these efforts ?
Thank you Kiva for giving us a way to empower others .
Thank you Frontline for making this known .
Suggestion for your website .
Please include a printable and email forward - able brochure with basic information about Kiva for folks to tell others about this fantastic way of helping others .
I have many friends that would be interested .
I also work in company with about 10,000 employees , many of which would be happy to contribute .
It would be a great way to spread the word .
Question : Many Native Americans live in extreme poverty .
Does Kiva seek out those in this country as well as others to give a hand up to ?
Brightest Blessings to you and this wonderful work !
Christina Jordan

I am the founder of Life in Africa , the Kiva partner through which Grace Ayaa received her loan .
It 's been very exciting for us to see such a huge boost in traffic to lifeinafrica.com since the show .
We have n't seen it yet in Uganda , but it sounds like the Frontline crew did a great job .
Our supporters report that they loved it .
Congrats , and thank you !

Amazing !
We were so excited to see this .
Genius ... is all we could say .
We are so excited to get involved !

KUDOS Frontline , you have provided another quality program , educating your audience .
The feature on Kiva was fascinating , providing more insight to how one can positively influence our global economy .
I can't wait to begin .
Françesc Trias Puig

Presently , Europe is inundated with stories of ceaseless migrations of sub-Saharan Africans escaping towards a better life .
Kiva.org is just but a small example of how concerned people can attempt to make the lives of some of these struggling people better and sustainable .
In my opinion , it makes a lot more sense than spending money on fences , walls , soldiers and patrol boats that only serve as a band - aid to cover the infection .
There is a way to help those willing to work to help themselves , and a better way than the option of a dangerous , heart - breaking , and humiliating journey to a life sending small remittances from the developed world .
Are there any such programs headquartered in Europe ?
May Europeans get involved with Kiva ?
If so , I will spread the word as much as possible .
Thank you for the moving story .
I hope to see it syndicated back home .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Europeans may indeed get involved with Kiva .
Anyone from anywhere in the world may become a Kiva lender simply by going to www.kiva.org.
Betty Zorn

Thank you once again Frontline / World for your wonderful program .
The KIVA site is still not responding , I was able to donate to KIVA but could not make any loans .
I will keep trying .
I have been donating to Houston PBS for many years .
This type of programming makes me proud that I support Public Broadcasting .
Keep up the good work .
Pat Phillips

Great idea and great show .

I have been a Kiva " loaner " for quite a while now and I love them !
I did n't see the PBS show because I live in Norway , but I 'm here to see what the fuss is all about since my daily visit to Kiva 's website has been disturbed by all you people !
Way to go !
Be sure to try again when they get it back online , you wo n't regret it !
I give Kiva gift certificates to everyone I know now and encourage others to do the same !
Do your friends and family really need a new toaster more than Hellen in Uganda needs a new dairy cow ?!?

What an inspiring and moving story !
The Kiva concept is simple , yet genius .

Sheena Jacob

I was thrilled to see the program .
I have been researching and studying a lot about microfinance around the world & I know that PBS has done other programs on this topic .
I think that the model of ( micro ) social entrepreneurs financed by ( micro ) social investors is the only model of long - term economic sustainability that can prevail on a global scale .
Thank you Kiva for your great work and thank you Frontline for featuring it .

Thank You , Frontline / World for this story .
It is an answer to my prayers and the solution to the despair of poverty .
This is an idea whose time has come for such a time as this !

Thanks , too , for the inspiration .

I heard this was an amazing edition of Frontline , but I did n't get to see it .
Can you tell me when it will be shown again ?
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
All three stories from the October 31 broadcast of FRONTLINE / World will be available for viewing on our website starting November 7 .
Check with your local PBS station to inquire whether they plan to re-broadcast the episode in the near future .

Dear Frontline Community :
This is Premal from Kiva with an update 24 hours after the show first aired .
We are just overwhelmed with your generosity and interest -- thank you .
I want to share with you all an email from Jeremy , our engineer here at Kiva , which summarizes the last 24 hours :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject : The Frontline Effect Just a quick update on what 's been going on at Kiva World HQ .
Last night at 6:25:00 PM EST the Frontline segment about Kiva was broadcast .
At approximately 6:25:01 PM EST our server was completely overwhelmed and has been down ever since .
Simply put - we were not ready to handle the massive amount of traffic that hit our server .
Not by a long shot .
As Premal put it , we were " a lemonade stand in the middle of the Boston Marathon " .
Within minutes it became obvious that we were n't going to be able to get things working , so we took down our website and put up a simple HTML page with a short note explaining the situation , a link to contactus@kiva.org , and a button to donate through PayPal .
As of now - roughly 24 hours after the first airing - we 've gotten well over 3000 emails and over $ 30,000 in donations .
Furthermore , I have yet to read a single negative comment .
Not one .
I 've never seen anything like it .
As we speak , we are using some of the donated funds to move our site to a new hosting company that specializes in scaling websites to massive proportions .
Hopefully by the time we go live we 'll have multiple servers handling our traffic .
It 's hard to say exactly when that will happen , but I will be working through the night to try to have kiva.org up and running by 5 AM PST .
This is an incredible thing we 're witnessing .
Thank you to everyone who has helped us come this far .
I feel so lucky to be a part of it .
I 'll let you know the moment we get back online .

FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Thanks , Premal , for keeping the Frontline / World community updated on the reaction Kiva has been receiving .
Premal included a sampling of emails they 've received that shows the incredible support and interest in Kiva you all have expressed .
Unfortunately , we have so many Reacts coming in to our own website , we 're unable to publish those emails .
There is certainly no shortage of positive reaction for this story and for Kiva !
We will continue to provide updates on getting access to Kiva as they come in .
You can also check the Kiva site directly for updates : www.kiva.org

Nothing is as inspiring as organizations that directly improve people 's lives , not by giving them handouts , but rather giving them opportunities to be self sufficient !
Forget about relying on governments to solve the world 's problems .
This is a far simpler , more powerful and effective way to improve the lives of people all around the world .
I can't wait to make a loan as soon as your website is back up .

I echo the sentiments of all others who have taken the time to post .
What an absolutely inspirational story !
I confess that I contributed to the failure of the Kiva 's server by immediately trying to visit their website after the broadcast .
After realizing the reason for my inability to connect , I pulled out my credit card and made a donation toward Kiva 's new server !
Come on folks -- this is an opportunity to help this worthy organization build the technological infrastructure that will allow ALL of us , as well as our family and friends , participate in this great project .
It 's rare these days to find an opportunity where you can honestly feel that you can make a difference .
It would appear that Kiva is going to give us that rare experience .
I look forward to their prompt return to the net .
Frontline restored my faith that something worthwhile can actually be found during primetime !
Houston , TX
Thanks for such a great story !
We are planning to give money in our nephews ' names this Christmas , and you 've just found our " charity " for us !
This way , the kids will have the chance to choose their own investment and learn about so many valuable concepts all at once !
I must say that , though I was n't very impressed with Frontline / World the first time I encountered it , now I make every effort to catch it every time it airs - I learn so much from you !
Thank you .

I wish we could do this not only around the world but in our own country as well .
Thank you .

After watching this Frontline story , I knew the Kiva server would " crash " but for a good reason !
Thanks for the quality show and A story !

As another former Peace Corps volunteer ( Romania ) , I was inspired to see this remarkable usage of technology to help people .
This story was touching ... and interesting as it coincides with the Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Yunus !
Thank you Frontline for quality reporting .
Your staff continues to go the distance , to question what hurts so many people in the world , and to show us what is then helping so many in the world .
Hopefully our current right - wing administration can watch and learn !

Frontline , this was a wonderful profile on how one person 's ( or couple 's ) dream and passion to have a positive impact on the world happened and is having the desired impact .
Jessica and Matt Flannery and the Kiva team 's entrepreneurial , inspiring , and innovative spirit are incredible ... the world is lucky to have you .
Thank you for providing such a remarkable way for us to connect and contribute to intelligent and motivating entrepreneurs across the world .
WOW !

Unfortunately I missed the Kiva story but my husband was able to see it and told me about it .
We are now in our mid-40s and are looking for ways to give back .
Kiva is definitely one way ; we have some ideas already on how we can spread the news to people in our community and perhaps help others build their own community .
Looking forward in researching this opportunity .

I think this episode was amazing .
I 'm currently in college and not sure where I 'm going in life , but this program helped to get me back on track .
I want to live a life involved with organizations such as KIVA !
I am so excited about it all , I do n't have much but I plan to lend , give , and just do whatever I can to help the organization and the people all over the world that need the assistance of the organization .
So basically I would like to thank the KIVA organization , FRONTLINE , and PBS for making me realize that what 's really important is just living a life doing whatever you can just to improve the lives of others .
Susan Palmer
Manhattan beach , CA
I was truly inspired by the story .
The look of pride and self - esteem on both the loaners and borrowers was heart - warming .
I am in and passing this website onto my friends and family today .
The concept is riveting ... way to go !
Fritz Tossberg
Hamilton , MT
The Kiva story was great .
I went to their website and found it busy , but was able to send them a donation via Pay Pal .
A really simple , elegant idea .
I will make some loans and will get friends to help .
We should do this in Iraq when we get out .
Allison Braddock
St Louis , MO
Bravo !
What a great concept .
Kiva is really making a difference by providing opportunities in the world for people that do n't stand a chance otherwise .
I am chomping at the bit to help out in any way possible .
Dauril Alden

Wonderful program ; wonderful concept .
I echo sentiments expressed above ; loaning to such people is more worthy than giving unwanted Christmas gifts .
Judy Hudson - Trujillo

Great story and wonderful concept .
I am doing a training session with 8 social entrepreneurs from Zambia in December .
I would like to show them this film clip .
Please let me know when it is available .
We are doing this training on a shoestring budget - so free distribution or taping into an electronic version I could show on laptop would be appreciated .
Thanks ,
Judy
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Streaming video of the Uganda story will be available on our Web site on November 7 .
Good Luck with the training !

Microlending has always intrigued me .
I 've given to organizations like Doctor Without Borders , Mercy Corp , Heifer International -- but always wondered about the recipients and how they fared .
Kiva provides a simple and easy way to directly lend a helping hand and you can see the smile of the person you 're helping .
Once the loan is repaid , one can keep re-lending .
An embrace to the people that started Kiva .
I 'm going to include info on Kiva in all my Christmas cards .
Keith Bell
Gallatin , Tennessee
This video was wonderfully timed to coincide with the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 that was awarded to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank for their efforts to create economic and social development via microlending in Bangladesh .
I can see the snowball effect for Uganda : small loans allow individual businesses to flourish ; new sources of income allow for individuals to spur other businesses since they now have disposable income ; living standards rise ; a ripple effect positively impacts the entire community .
Great concept , great video .
Frontline / World continues to be among my favorite programs on television .
I use these episodes in my geography classes every semester .
Thanks .
Britt
Salt Lake City , UT
Thanks to PBS yet again for educating us in a positive way !
Jessica and Matt Flannery , ASANTE SANA !
( Thank you very much ) .
I know there are many other microfinance organizations around the world , but you made microcredit more efficient and accessible to us !
Ann Black
Gainesville , Florida
I was so moved by the program last night .
I 'd like to help .
I visited your site but could not log on .
Please let me how I can get in touch with someone who needs help .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Be sure to visit kiva.org .
They should be up and running sometime soon .
David Edwards
Corsicana , TX
I have been to Uganda twice and have seen the desperate needs .
I have also seen the Nationals taking advantage of the generosity of others and others taking advantage of them .
I applaud the work of Kiva .
Through accountability and encouragement , hard - working people get the opportunity to succeed .
You inspire not only their efforts , but also many Americans who seek to make a difference .
Leon Johnson
Baton Rouge , LA
Inspiring article , but I can't believe that it is so hard to actually find a Kiva web link , anywhere in the article .
I will search again .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Be sure to visit kiva.org .
Their website will be up and running sometime soon .
Edward Daniels
Charlotte , NC
I have been involved loaning money to Kiva for about a month .
I was not aware of the Frontline program .
I called them today and they said they were swamped by the reaction to the show and they do not think they will be back up until tomorrow .
Please make sure you go to the website when it comes back online .
It is great and I have enjoyed lending very much .
I hope all of you will enjoy it as much as I have .
Glenn A .
Arlington , VA
I enjoyed your story , and it seems like lots of other people did too since it basically crashed Kiva 's server .
However , I think you should have also spent time talking about the drawbacks and potential negative aspects .
The piece here on the website explains that many experts do n't think microlending like this is really helping poor people all that much .
Why not include their viewpoint in the story as well ?
Santa Fe , NM
Excellent !
Philadelphia , PA
Thank you for the wonderful way you are making someone 's life a little easier .

I 'd like to encourage everyone who was as moved as I was by the program to go to www.kiva.org.
Yes , their server is n't able to handle the volume right now , but there is a quick link to PayPal .
If we all pitch in for a new server for the KIVA site , we can all begin to help forge responsible relationships with the third world .
Houston , TX
Thank you for this wonderful and enlightening story .
Now I know how I can help without feeling that I am being robbed of most a donation !
Springfield , MO
Their server can't handle all the traffic looking for information on the microloans .
However , you can donate money to go toward a new server for Kiva from the site : www.kiva.org.
Looks as though this would be a good cause also so more people can get involved .
Bloomington , Indiana
Sure would like to have seen a link to the Kiva website on the pbs.org site somewhere .
Can you not provide that ?
Otherwise , I loved the story and really want to get involved .

Rarely does one television program have the opportunity to improve the lives of thousands of people around the world .
Your program has made this possible .
Thank you .
Matthew Hirst
Charlottesville , Virigina
Microfinance has been around for a long time , and I always thought it was a great way to give the world 's poorest a means to help themselves , to empower them .
But I never knew there was anything I could do to become involved until I saw this program .
Very exciting and uplifting -- so thank you , Frontline .
The reaction has been so big that Frontline / World viewers apparently overwhelmed the Kiva servers this morning .
Jim Creekbaum
Brownsburg , Indiana
What a great program .
Often you see people in need wanting to be given money , but a loan gives them ownership , responsibility , and a feeling of personal self worth .
After all , what better feeling can one have than knowing someone believes in them and their endeavors .

Redwood City , CA
Living in the land of opportunity all of my life is something I take for granted .
Your show filled me with such hope and excitement -- not only for the program created in Uganda but also for the two people who set the wheels in motion .
Both are young Americans from my dear Bay Area who reached out and showed the potential that our children have for changing our world .
Thank you for this gift and I will support you financially right now !
Barbara
Tallahassee , FL
Your piece offered hope and a practical hands on a way to make a difference .
I will pass this on to many who are looking for an effective way to act .
I hope the Kiva site is up and running again soon .
I am eager to see how I can help .

I found this story so inspiring .
So often when we give money we are afraid it goes to the bureaucracy and does n't get to the people to which it is intended .
I love the idea of putting something into a community and really , really helping .
Kiva's web site has been inaccessible since the show aired last night which - actually - is a good thing .
Hopefully many are also inspired to participate .
Thanks again ...
Neil Sommerfeldt

It was just by chance I switched the channel to Frontline .... or was it !
I can't wait for the web site to come back online .... what a great way to help people help themselves .
Shreveport , Louisiana
We always appreciate Frontline and the informative and stimulating articles and materials provided in the programming .
This piece on Uganda and the loaning of money to help these individuals start small business is great , to say the least !
You can see the hope , pride and enthusiasm in their faces .
This is the way the world should be : people helping people .
So much better than the violence of war and the pestilence of disease .
Thanks !

I can't wait until their website is back -- I plan to use it to do my Christmas shopping !
I am proud of the people involved with Kiva -- all angles .
Once again , PBS makes a difference .

I watched your Report on the microloan in Uganda and was deeply moved .
Thank you for showing that there is still hope in this world .
See , PBS does make a difference .
Please do more reports / follow - up of this type .
As a note to other readers , the www.adelantefoundation.org also provides microloans in Honduras .
Fabienne Carmignon Duffy

The cause and concept are so enthralling and so down to earth that , for once , I am looking forward to engage myself and my children in the process of helping those much less fortunate .
Thank you , Frontline .
Allan Nassau
Las Vegas , Nevada
After watching Frontline last night I too went to the Kiva web site .
It is still down this morning .
I will keep trying .
What a dignified way to help someone less fortunate than you .
I too was moved like I never have been before .
I have always looked for a way to get involved .
I 've found my way .
If our government is looking for a way to spread American ideals of Capitalism around the world is there a better way than to help with a loan to start a new business or expand a new one ?
Just think what microfinance organizations could have done with 240 billion , the cost of the Iraq war .
Michael Butler
Philadelphia , PA
A direct pipeline to the people who have an idea and the willingness to work hard to make it work !
I will gladly lend them a hand .
I especially like the simplicity of cutting out the big chiefs who " administer " the typical charitable conributions .
Count us in !
Gloria Hennen
New Prague , MN
Great broadcast !!
I have always been interested in Missions and wanted to touch people personally .
Kiva will allow this to happen without my having to be there .
I have been online most of the morning but the system crashed with the overwhelming response .
Will keep trying .
Orlando , Florida
I was totally astounded when I saw this last night at 2:30 am when I awoke with another bout of insomnia , but what a thinking , soul searching bout it was , and still is .
I am telling everyone , encouraging these gifts of hope , and think that with the Holiday season coming , what better way to give a gift to another in your recipient 's name .
It would eliminate the duplication of useless and / or unwanted gifts .
Teens and up will benefit this year as I am not going to spend money on them that will not give them the feeling that this should .
Fabulous program .
Jonathan Johnston
Houston , Texas
people are not looking for something for nothing and are willing to work hard .
I would like to know how to get involved in the microloan program .
It seems fantastic .
Michael Cohen
Sterling , VA
Thank you Frontline for such a telling and heartwarming story about how people can help those in need grow their businesses using microloans and help foster responsible , local economic growth .
I 've already started to investigate the kiva.org web site further so that I can get involved .
I 've also started spreading the word about Kiva to others who I think would also like to get involved .

This is the first program that shows what real giving is all about .
Contrast that to the stories about the millions of dollars misused in the 9/11 and Katrina debacles .
Garden City , NY
After the show , I like probably most of your viewership went to Kiva.org to find their servers overwhelmed .
I tried again a few minutes later and was able to get through and make a small donation so they can buy another server .
I thought it might be a good idea if Frontline would make the video segment available to Youtube so the Microfinance and Kiva story could attract an even wider audience .
Great job !
Joyce Baker

I watched the Kiva story as I was handing out fistfuls of candy to trick - or - treaters .
Such a contrast !
I am starting to contribute to Kiva loans today .
Many thanks to the founders of this program !

Great show about Kiva and the great job they are doing .
Please send me their contact information .
I would like to get help .
Thank you

Baton Rouge , LA
This has really inspired my family .
I always beleived that unless you were giving major money to someone you really were not helping , but after watching these stories in awe , I know that my measley $ 50 that I spend on coffee a month could potentially help an entire community .
Bravo !
Pamela Hill

My husband and I watched your show last night ; Kiva is a brilliant idea .
The Kiva concept has renewed my faith in mankind .
I intend on telling my friends about this wonderful program .

I 've been to Africa twice and have always been trying to figure out a way to contribute in a meaningful way to the people who live there .
Short of actually going there and volunteering my skills I found my answer when I saw the program on Kiva .
Sue Quinn
Pittsburgh , PA
I was impressed by the ease and relatively little amount of money one can invest to improve so many lives .
I visited my daughter who was studying in Kenya last year and was moved by the plight of the people .
I wanted to help anyone and anywhere I could but came to realize giving money or materials directly is only a quick fix .
Sustainable and well monitored programs like Kiva 's can make a difference !
Chicago , IL
I just so happen to be flipping through the 5 or 7 channels I have and ran accross this PBS special .
I was moved to email friends and co-workers to help out .
Please keep in mind I am not the type to send senseless emails or forwards .
Patrick Vaughan
Hamilton , MT
What a great story .
Thanks very much for presenting this to us .

Leah Roberson
Searcy , AR
I can't wait until the website is back up .
With a 100 % payback record , I can re-loan money over and over !
I hope they do n't lose potential loaners while the site is down .
Dean Taylor
Doral , FL
I was moved by this story and want to join in .
The KIVA server seems to be loaded , so I will keep checking .
Thank you PBS for getting the truth out on so many issues .
This KIVA program creates hope for all of us .

Paula Tarrant
St. Louis , MO
WOW !
What a success story !
A simple idea empowering many who need help and many who want to help .
It would be exciting if a similar program were developed for the United States .
Kiva will need to drop more servers in ASAP to handle all the new interest .
God Bless those executing this program .
Barbara Smith
Northampton , MA
I have been involved with peer lending in the USA and know first hand how powerful it is .
Would like to know more how that works in Kiva .
There was just a short part in the program with people voting for acceptance of a person 's loan .
Look forward to KIVA 's Web site becoming accessible again .
Thank you Frontline !!
Simne Langton
New York , NY
Kudos to Kiva for making a great concept work and for reaching out to those who need help .
100 % loan repayment is remarkable !!
I can't wait for their server to come back so I can join in their cause .
And thanks PBS for enlightening me .
Joan Riggs
Pittsburgh , PA
Terrific show .
Will it be shown again on PBS ?
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
PBS stations are free to re-broadcast the show .
Check your local listings or contact your station and suggest they show it again .
The video will be available next week online and will be a permanent part of our website .
( anonymous )
I watch the program and was quite touched .
I like the viewer in California would like to have more information as to how to help or how to be a lender .
This is one of the most inspiring show I 've seen for some time to show that it takes very little to help another human .
Good Work .
Diane Lucar - Ellens
grand Rapids , MI
What a great program .
I 've lived in Third World countries and have seen the extreme poverty .
It seems so overwelming and I 've often wondered how to help without government red tape !!
Here 's a way !
I 'll definitily check it out .
David Lim
Fullerton , CA
I enjoyed last night 's episode and your segment on Kiva.org really opened my eyes to what microfinancing can do for people who really want to rise out of their poverty and support themselves .
I feel this is the wave of the future and its already been proven .

[ Haskell ] Comments from Brent Fulgham on Haskell and the shootout
Brent Fulgham has given me permission to share this message that he sent to us about his views on Haskell and the Great Computer Language Shootout .
There 's some nice advocacy material in here .
I 'd like to publicly thank Brent for all his work on the shootout - benchmarking 50 or so different language implementations and getting any kind of useful results at all is a significant feat .
The shootout results have also influenced our direction in the Haskell community and GHC in particular .
Here 's the message , for your enjoyment ...
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE -----
Hash : SHA1 Dear Drs. Hudak and Peyton - Jones : ( Feel free to forward these comments to anyone you think would enjoy them ) .
A couple of years ago I revived the dormant " Great Computer Language Shootout " website because I wanted to create an up - to - date comparison of language implementations to use as ammunition against my nay - saying coworkers over the state of the art in Computer Science .
Back in those days , I was mainly interested in the performance of Objective Caml and Lisp , but was also interested in a new ( to me ) language called Haskell .
Haskell had ( and still has ) a beautiful , mathematical notation that was very easy to read , but it was such a poor performer that I despaired of ever getting to use it for anything but simple test programs .
While it was conceptually satisfying , pragmatism seemed destined to keep it on the shelf for the foreseeable future .
I wanted to write to inform you how shocked I was to see the great advances in performance in the Glorious Haskell Compiler over the last year or so .
Of course , we have also benefited from some great contributions by the folks on the Haskell - Cafe mailing list .
The thing I find most staggering about the compiler is that its quite brilliant at identifying wasted work .
Many of the original shootout test cases were written to test the performance of simple scripting languages , and had grown a set of hacks over the years to keep the run times large enough to measure as processor speeds improved and language implementations became more sophisticated .
In many cases , tests involved calculation or large values in loops , which would cause Perl and Python ( and even C , Java , and C++ ) to chug merrily away burning cycles so that I could measure the timings in seconds , rather than microseconds .
Then along came GHC , which began achieving enormous wins over the other languages because the lazy nature of the evaluation threw out the unneeded calculations , handing over the final useful result without breaking a sweat .
Consequently , we had to revise many of the tests to force the programs to perform real work that could not be avoided , in some cases by forcing intermediate values to be printed in the solutions so we could be sure the work was actually being done .
With those changes , Haskell began to fall back in speed to more moderate levels .
However , in the last few releases of GHC ( and the last several rounds of tweaks by the Haskellers on the Cafe list ) , GHC has risen to the top of the heap , approaching native C in performance overall .
What I find quite appealing about this is that the performance is consistent across platforms .
While Java's " HotSpot " compiler makes a good showing on Intel , my AMD test machine yields consistently worse results than the Pentium IV system .
However , GHC performs equally well on both systems , yielding a similar fractional performance against C in both cases [ 1,2 ] .
I think this is great because it means that applications written in Haskell can be reasonably expected to yield good performance on all of the common x86 platforms without customizations .
Java and several other languages seem to yield varying performance , probably because of advanced optimizations available on the Intel platform that have been hand - coded into those systems .
At any rate , I just wanted to write a quick fan letter about Haskell , and let you know how impressed I am with its performance .
Looks like it 's time for me to start taking a serious look at Haskell for some real - world problems at work now !

Vertical Bar Graphs with CSS and PHP
This technique was originally inspired by Eric Meyer .
I have used this technique more times than I can remember , each time with a unique twist .
Using HTML and CSS you can create light weight , attractive bar graphs .
Creating them with dynamic data will save you time in the future .

< ul class = " barGraph " > < li class = " set1 " style = " height : 57 px ; left : 0 px ; " >57</ li > < li class = " set2 " style = " height : 27 px ; left : 0 px ; " >27</li > < li class = " set3 " style = " height : 17 px ; left : 0 px ; " >17</ li > < li class = " set1 " style = " height : 99 px ; left : 40 px ; " >99</ li > < li class = " set2 " style = " height : 74 px ; left : 40 px ; " >74</li > < li class = " set3 " style = " height : 54 px ; left : 40 px ; " >54</li > ... </ul >
You wo n't always have an appropriate height value to display , in which case you will need to scale the data relative to your desired graph height .
This code walks through the process .
1.1 Printing the HTML list using PHP
function printGraph ( ) { $ days = array ( ) ; $ x Offset = 0 ; $xIncrement = 40 ; // width of bars $ graphHeight = 500 ; // target height of graph $ maxResult = 1 ; $ scale = 1 ; // Database Connection Information // Connect to and select the database //
Get the data and find max values $ result = mysql_query ( $ query ) ; if ( ! $ result ) die ( " no results available ! " ) ; while ( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc( $result ) ) { $ days [ $row [ ' date ' ] ] = array ( " P1 " => $ row [ ' priority1 ' ] , " P2 " => $ row [ ' priority2 ' ] , " P3 " => $ row [ ' priority3 ' ] ) ; // Check if this column is the largest $ total = $ row [ ' total ' ] ; if ( $maxResult < $ total ) $ maxResult = $ total ; } mysql_free_result ( $result ) ; //
Set the scale $ scale = $ graphHeight / $ maxResult ; echo ' < ul class = " TGraph " >' ; foreach ( $ days as $ date => $ values ) { // Reverse sort the array arsort ( $ values ) ; foreach ( $ values as $ priority => $ num ) { //
Scale the height to fit in the graph $ height = ( $ num * $scale ) ; // Print the Bar echo " < li class= ' $ priority ' style = ' height : " .$ height . " px ; left : " .$xOffset . " px ; ' title= '$ date ' > $ num < br />$ priority < / li > " ; } //
Move on to the next column $ xOffset = $ x Offset + $ x Increment ; } echo '< /ul > ' ; }
Styling the graph with CSS
Once you 've got your list printed , it is time to turn it into a bar graph .
To get you started , Figure 2.0 contains the minimum styles needed to complete the transformation .
2.0 Basic Bar Graph
.verticalBarGraph { border - bottom : 1 px solid # FFF ; height : 200 px ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; position : relative ; } .verticalBarGraph li { border : 1 px solid # 555 ; border - bottom : none ; bottom : 0 ; list - style : none ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; position : absolute ; text - align : center ; width : 39 px ; }
Adding some Style
Figures 2.1 through 2.3 show the styles used on the example implementation above .
There are endless possibilities are endless , these are just a few ideas .
Please feel free to share your creations with me , I would be delighted to see them .
2.1 Fancy Bar Graph
. barGraph { background : url( images/horizontal_grid_line_50_pixel.png ) bottom left ; border - bottom : 3 px solid # 333 ; font : 9px Helvetica , Geneva , sans - serif ; height : 200 px ; margin : 1em 0 ; padding : 0 ; position : relative ; } . barGraph li { background : # 666 url( images/bar_50_percent_highlight.png ) repeat -y top right ; border : 1 px solid # 555 ; border - bottom : none ; bottom : 0 ; color : # FFF ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 0 0 0 ; position : absolute ; list - style : none ; text - align : center ; width : 39 px ; } .barGraph li.p1 { background - color : #666666 } . barGraph li.p2{ background - color :#888888 } .barGraph li.p3 { background - color : #AAAAAA
}
2.2 Faux Line Graph
.fauxLineGraph { background : url( images/horizontal_line_2.png ) bottom left ; border - bottom : 3 px solid # 333 ; font : 9px Helvetica , Geneva , sans - serif ; height : 200 px ; margin : 1em 0 ; padding : 0 ; position : relative ; } . fauxLineGraph li { border - top : 3 px solid # 555 ; border - bottom : none ; color : #000 ; bottom : 0 ; list - style : none ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 0 0 0 ; position : absolute ; text - align : center ; width : 39 px ; } .fauxLineGraph li.p1{ background : url( images/blue_shadow.png ) repeat-x top right ; border - color : # 4E536B ; } .fauxLineGraph li.p2{ background : url( images/red_shadow.png ) repeat-x top right ; border - color : # 355B31 ; } .fauxLineGraph li.p3 { background : url( images/yellow_shadow.png ) repeat-x top right ; border - color : # 88262B ; }
2.3 Dotted Graph
Should we strive to only have one language in our development efforts ?
Throughout much of the last decade the fashion in the enterprise software world has been to focus on one standard language for software development efforts .
Many development organizations strive to do all their work in Java ( or C# / VB ) .
The rationale for this is that developers find it hard to be proficient in more than one language .
Sticking to a single language lowers the learning burden , particularly when hiring new people .
There 's some truth to this , but also much that 's missing .
The programming environment is partly language , but also about languages and frameworks .
Larger frameworks , Hibernate , Struts , ADO , present as much of a challenge to learn as a language even if you program them in a single host language .
Often the difficulty of expressing what you need in the host language is sufficiently awkward that many frameworks resort to configuration files , which are effectively external DomainSpecificLanguages written in XML - which adds a jigger of 80 proof ugliness to them .
For many developers , the one - language notion is a sign of lack of professionalism .
This is best exemplified by the Pragmatic Programmers ' advice to learn a new language every year .
The point here is that programming languages do affect the way you think about programming , and learning new languages can do a lot to help you think about solving problems in different ways .
( It 's important to learn languages that are quite different in order to get the benefit of this .
Java and C# are too similar to count . )
I agree with prags ' advice here , as in most things .
But I also sympathize with the overhead of learning a new language .
My personal scripting is pretty much all done with Ruby and I 've been loath to any more than play with reasonable alternatives like Python , Groovy , or PowerShell .
It 's not that it 's hard to use the alternatives , but with Ruby I know too much that I 'd have to look up with the alternatives .
The important point here is that when I 'm writing these scripts I 'm not manipulating new abstractions .
Much of what I do is fiddling with text , the file system , and hunks of XML or YAML .
If I need to take on a sizable new abstraction , the cost of learning it as a library is n't really much less than the cost of learning a language to manipulate it .
If I want to specify a directed graph structure for display , learning Graphviz 's
Dot language is hardly more work than learning a new Ruby library .
Using a DSL instead of a library can offer us better ways of manipulating our abstractions .
This makes it easier to see what we 've written and to reveal our intentions .
An API is like declaring a vocabulary , a DSL adds a grammar which allows you to write coherent sentences .
This argument is strong for DSLs , but does it also apply to general purpose languages ?
If you are working in Java ( or soon C# ) does it make sense to use Ruby now it 's available on your platform ?
The last decade has seen the rise of memory managed C - based languages .
People saw that , despite many years of skepticism , memory management makes life sufficiently better that it was worth stepping away from C and C++ in the enterprise world .
A common platform and language also pulled people away from proprietary walled gardens like Powerbuilder and Delphi .
Now there is a similar question .
Are modern scripting languages another step forwards ?
Do we prefer their well - chosen terseness ?
Time and time again I hear experienced Java and C# developers report they are more effective in Ruby - which is why I 've been encouraging Ruby .
It would n't surprise me if similar reports appear in the next few years about other languages too .
A decade ago I was talking to my old friend Tom Hadfield at OOPSLA 96 .
Java 's rise was apparent and it was clear that Smalltalk 's future was doomed .
Despite my love of Smalltalk I was pretty sanguine .
I felt that Java gave people enough of what they needed ; while it was n't quite as nice as Smalltalk it was enough of an improvement over C++ , particularly with memory management , for me to be happy with it .
Tom disagreed , he felt there was something fundamentally different about the expressiveness of Smalltalk , the way you could better capture the intention of what you were doing directly in your code - closing the gap between domain knowledge and programming .
In the intervening years I 've come to the view that Tom was right after all .
After several years in curly brace land , Ruby reminded me of what I was missing .
There 's a clarity to reading Ruby code that just makes it an easier medium to work with , despite the inferior tooling .
I 'm way more sympathetic to the Smalltalk holdouts than I felt then , even though I have n't felt inclined to open an image in anger for a long time .
So are we returning to the language cacophony of the late 80's and early 90's ?
I think we will see multiple languages blathering away , but there will be an important difference .
In the late 80's it was hard to get languages to inter - operate closely .
These days there 's a lot of attention to making environments that allow different language to co-exist closely .
Scripting languages have traditionally had an intimate relationship with C . There 's much effort to inter-operation on the JVM and CLR platforms .
Too much has been invested in libraries for a language to ignore them .
So my sense is that we will see multiple languages used in projects with people choosing a language for what it can do in the same way that people choose frameworks now .
I agree with Neal that we are entering a period of Polyglot Programming .
The World according to Harshbarger , Lambrecht , and Lowell
Of course , I was just starting out back then , and I did not have a great variety to pieces and colors .
So , just building a studs - up sculpture out of blue and green bricks was challenge enough .
It 's now six years later , and I have finally gotten around to building a new globe .
While this one is also 15 inches in diameter , I think it is superior in many ways .
I was prompted to tackle the redesign after being inspired by a creation of another LEGO builder : Bruce Lowell .
Some time ago he developed what I consider to be one of the most beautiful building techniques in LEGO - dom : The Lowell Sphere .
The link goes to his original " 6.8 stud wide " model .
It consists of 6 identical pieces which are stuck together .
The surface of the sphere is all " stud outward " , and the roundness of the ball , even at that small size , is exquisite .
I used the technique when building a Snowman model in 2004 .
In that model I enlarged the original sphere to get three different sections for the snowman 's body .
This enlargement I just did " by hand " , and while the bigger spheres are not quite as round , they did the job on that scuplture .
Then , in May of 2005 , another LEGO enthusiast , Bram Lambrecht , announced that he had written a web - application which would generate a " Lowell Sphere " of any size .
Wow !
The output of the application could be read by various LEGO rendering programs , and while super - large spheres would require an insane number of pieces , the beauty of the virtually rendered models was unquestionable .
So ... all of this led me to the New Globe .
Believe it or not , I had never used any of the computer design software out there that could read LDRAW format files , but this project prompted me to final do it .
I downloaded and used MLCAD .
With it I printed out a model of one of the six sections needed to build a 15 inch sphere ( 48 studs ) .
Of course , the printout did not have any continents or countries on it ; it only showed the structure .
I proceeded to build one of those sections out of all blue plates ( and , boy , did this project take a lot of plates ) .
I got an old globe that I had in a closet and with a pencil marked off the six equal sections as best I could .
Then I chose one to start with ( a section featuring most of South America , part of North America , and part of Africa ) .
On my blank , blue section , I used tan plates to map out the land masses .
Now , if I had been lazy , I could have simply built six all - blue sections and then stuck tan plates on the surface .
This would not have been the neatest way to do it , however .
Not only would the raised land areas distort the " smoothness " of the sphere , but since the edges of some of the plates also needed to be tan , just sticking some on the surface would not have looked very good .
No ... once I had a section mapped out on my blank section , I then built a new section ... integrating the tan pieces where they needed to be so that the continents were formed ( here is that same section of the globe , rebuilt ) .
This process of building with both tan and blue was MADDENING .
Building one of the sections in all one color was challenging enough ; but having to remember when to start using some tan bricks , and getting all of the pieces to interlock while not accidently exposing a wrong color somewhere was mind boggling .
It would take about an hour to outline the continents on my blank section , and then another two to three hours to build the section with the tan bricks included .
And to top it off ...
I needed the six sections to mesh properly at the seams .
Oh , and after building the first two sections , I realized I would face a quandry that one often does when building large projects : I did n't have nearly enough pieces .
Despite starting with thousands of small blue and tan plates ( several thousand ) , I was quickly running low .
Nothing a couple hundred dollars would n't fix with a visit to BrickLink , however .
Of course , I did n't know exactly how many pieces I 'd need , so I tried to cover my needs without buying too many extra .
Once the pieces arrived I finally got to finish the job .
Into the side of each section I incorporated some specialty bricks with studs on their sides .
This allowed the sections to then be fastened together ( without glue ) .
The last section I tackled was the South Pole .
Since I decided I was not going to worry about the Antarctic ice masses , I used my original blank section for this area ( I only had to modify it a bit get the south tip of South America as well as Tasmania below Australia ) .
The side - studded bricks did their job , and with a little pressure I joined everything , and had the new , improved globe constructed .
Here is a close - up of North America ; you can see where three sections meet -- the studs point in three different directions in the Midwest of the United States .
After assembly I realized that for some reason I completely forgot to build Madgascar off the southern edge of Africa .
Oh well ...
I will correct that later ...
For now I 'm just happy that the tan bricks provide much better contrast than the green bricks of my original globe .

Raw food diet recipes to help increase your energy and lose weight easily .
When he was running for president , George W. Bush loved to contrast his law - abiding morality with that of President Clinton , who was charged with perjury and acquitted .
For Mr. Bush , the candidate , “ politics , after a time of tarnished ideals , can be higher and better . ”
Not so for Mr. Bush , the president .
Judging from his decision yesterday to commute the 30 - month sentence of I. Lewis Libby Jr. — who was charged with perjury and convicted — untarnished ideals are less of a priority than protecting the secrets of his inner circle and mollifying the tiny slice of right - wing Americans left in his political base .
Mr. Libby was convicted of lying to federal agents investigating the leak of the name of a covert C.I.A. operative , Valerie Wilson .
Mrs. Wilson ’s husband , Joseph Wilson , was asked to investigate a central claim in Mr. Bush ’s drive to war with Iraq — whether Iraq tried to purchase uranium from Africa .
Mr. Wilson concluded that Iraq had not done that and had the temerity to share those conclusions with the American public .
It seems clear from the record that Vice President Dick Cheney organized a campaign to discredit Mr. Wilson .
And Mr. Libby , who was Mr. Cheney ’s chief of staff , was willing to lie to protect his boss .
Honda will release gasoline - electric hybrid versions only of the Civic and of its new small hybrid model currently under development for 2009 ( earlier post ) , according to the report .
Honda will equip mid-size and large vehicles such as the Accord with its new Tier 2 Bin 5 diesel engine .
( The Accord is one of the demonstrator vehicles for the new diesel engine technology . )
( Earlier post . )
The Nikkei Sunday edition reported that Honda will not introduce a hybrid model of the new Accord when the sedan undergoes a full design change in the autumn for the North American market .
Honda plans to promote the clean diesel engine it is developing as its key environmental technology , according to the report , differentiating itself from Toyota ’s concentration on hybrid vehicles .
Honda began selling the Accord hybrid in North America in December 2004 .
Sales have been trending downward over the last two years .
In May 2007 , Honda sold 439 of the Accord hybrids — down 16 % from May 2006 , and accounting for only 1.4 % of all Accord models sold in the month .
Honda ceased production of its first hybrid , the Insight , in September 2006 .
Introduced in December of 1999 , the Insight was the first mass - produced hybrid sold in the US , beating the Toyota Prius to the North American market by a matter of months .

One desk .
Gray .
One ergonomic office chair .
Black .
One waste paper basket .
Gray plastic .
One filing cabinet .
Gray .
When your office was furnished , did the shopping list go something like this :
You know – the usual stuff .
Typical .
Traditional .
Booooooring !
I ’m not going to claim that a fancy desk or a weird chair is going to magically improve your creativity and productivity – but I am damn sure , that all that sameness and eternal corporate grayness , does nothing good for your ability to come up with great new ideas .
Here are some ways to spruce up a workplace that may actually inject some color and fun into your work environment .
Got Milk ?
The Milk desk is a new design to match your Apple gear with it ’s white surface and rounded edges .
It lowers and raises electrically , it has ways to hide the cable clutter , and it also has four compartments at one end that can be configured for storage , trash or , yes , as an aquarium .
Partition magic
Softwall is a great way to flexibly partition a room .
It ’s made of paper with a felt core , and I love it because it does n’t eat all the light in the room ( if you go for the white one ) .
It can be twisted into just about any shape or rolled up when you do n’t need it and it dampens sound more than most room partitioners .
Plus it looks amazing !
The wing desk
Or how about a desk made from the wing of a DC3 plane ?
The saddle chair
The starting point for the Haag Capisco is just your average , garden - variety office chair – but they ’ve moved on from there .
The saddle seat gives you a more erect posture and does n’t cut of the blood flow to your legs .
The seat and back are constructed so you can sit sideways or reversed on it and still support your arms .
And the whole thing tilts back into a very comfortable reclined position .
Bean bags
I ’ve had one of these myself – they rock .
Bean bags look great and can be used in a million different positions .
Four bags and a coffee table and you have a great meeting room !
Bibliochaise
I ’m partial to the the Sumo Omni ( pictured above ) myself .
Disclosure :
They once sent me a free one to review here on the blog .
Where do you keep all your reference manuals and handbooks ?
Close to where you can sit and read them , of course !
Meet the Bibliochaise .
Stokke Garden
It ’s a tree .
It ’s a sculpture .
It ’s … I do n’t know what it is , but I like it .
The meeting bed .
Since I first saw these , I ’ve wanted one and only the huge price tag has kept from picking one up .
It looks strange , but is actually supremely comfortable and allows you to sit / lie in many positions .
I know , I ’ve spent quite some time in a showroom testing one thoroughly :o )
When your business is innovation , your office can’t really look like any other corporate wasteland .
London - based innovation agency ?
What If ! know that – as evidenced by e.g. the life - sized plastic cow statue painted like Spiderman in the lobby and the big red couch / bed they use for meetings :
Conference bike
Art tables
This has got to be the coolest idea in a long time .
7 people pedal along , one of them steers .
It ’s the conference bike and I want one !!
I also mentioned this in my post on seeeeeriously cool workplaces
I was sitting in my usual café writing this blogpost when I spotted a lady at the next table looking through some pictures of weird and beautiful desks .
A balance act
Of course I had to ask her what the story was .
Turns out she ’s Marie Westh , an artist and these are one - off tables she created , first for exhibitions and then later on as usable art pieces .
Check out Marie ’s website with many more weird and fantastic creations .
This is more a metaphor than a piece of furniture – but it ’s pretty cool all the same .
The idea is that three people can have a meeting where they must work together to hold their balance during the meeting .
Like we must each contribute to a conversation , to make it balanced .
Impractical – but cool !

Wood wall
Or how about an entire wall covered in cordwood ?
Not only is it amazingly beautiful , it ’s also great for the acoustics and it gives the wall a great texture .
The upshot
I saw my friends at Connecta and their roommates build this from a huge stack of cord woodon the floor to the finished wall .
Superb !!
So is it the furniture that determines whether a company is creative and fun or staid and boring ?
Of course not !
But the type and variety of furniture does reflect the mood at the company .
If you have row upon row of identical , gray desks and chairs then odds are this is not the place wild ideas are born .
And why exactly is it that everyone must have the same desk and chair ?
Why not let people choose for themselves , and give them a chance to create an environment that suits them .
The resulting variety may be confusing to those who think that business is about structure , order and control … but it ’s sure to be more stimulating and fun for those of us who think that work is about being happy .
There are more pictures of cool furniture in this flickr set .

Saint McCain sits down with Jon for a spirited debate over Iraq policy .
John Amato :.. If anyone wants to write a transcript for the second half of the interview --- that would be great .... Stewart and McCain got into a brawl in that segment ... Do you think any of the talking heads would have this kind of debate with McCain ?
Download Download
Stewart tries to explain a few things to St. McCain about fighting a civil war :
" ... but that assumes that we 're fighting one enemy --- they 're fighting each other .
We 're not surrendering to an enemy that has defeated us .
We 're saying , how do you quell a civil war when it 's not your country ? "
McCain got very angry that Stewart called them out for using the " you 're not supporting the troops , " theme and was trying to filibuster the segment ... He tried to use the troops as a wedge .
Stewart got hot and fought back ... McCain started to stutter .
( rough transcript )
The decision , by a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York , was a sharp rebuke for the F.C.C. and for the Bush administration .
For the four television networks that filed the lawsuit —
Fox , CBS , NBC and ABC — it was a major victory in a legal and cultural battle that they are waging with the commission and its supporters .
Under President Bush , the F.C.C. has expanded its indecency rules , taking a much harder line on obscenities uttered on broadcast television and radio .
While the judges sent the case back to the commission to rewrite its indecency policy , it said that it was “ doubtful ” that the agency would be able to “ adequately respond to the constitutional and statutory challenges raised by the networks . ”
The networks hailed the decision .
“ We are very pleased with the court ’s decision and continue to believe that the government regulation of content serves no purpose other than to chill artistic expression in violation of the First Amendment , ” said Scott Grogin , a senior vice president at Fox .
“ Viewers should be allowed to determine for themselves and their families , through the many parental control technologies available , what is appropriate viewing for their home . ”
Mr. Martin , the chairman of the commission , attacked the panel ’s reasoning .
“ I completely disagree with the court ’s ruling and am disappointed for American families , ” he said .
“ The court says the commission is ‘ divorced from reality . ’
It is the New York court , not the commission , that is divorced from reality . ”
He said that if the agency was unable to prohibit some vulgarities during prime time , “ Hollywood will be able to say anything they want , whenever they want . ”
Images on the original included a man facing a firing squad
The original flowing dress depicted scenes from a Roman Catholic uprising against Mexico 's secular state in the 1920s , in which thousands died .
It provoked uproar , with critics saying the theme was inappropriate for next month 's competition in Mexico City .
Designers now say the dress is being modified as a result of the concerns .
The original outfit was chosen by designers ahead of nearly 30 other gowns , in order , as they put it , to represent Mexico 's culture and history .
Miss Mexico , Rosa Maria Ojeda , wore the dress in public , showing off the billowing , hoop skirt adorned by scenes from the 1926 - 1929 Cristero War .
It would be like Miss USA wearing a dress showing images of the Ku Klux Klan in the Deep South
Jorge Camil
La Jornada
Among the images were Roman Catholic rebels hanging from posts , and a man facing a firing squad .
The outfit was completed by rosaries and scapularies hanging from a bullet - studded belt , topped off with a crucifix necklace and a wide - brimmed sombrero .
Designer Maria del Rayo Macias told La Jornada newspaper : " We are descendants of Cristeros .
Whether we like it or not , it 's a part of who we are . "
But critics said the use of such images was in poor taste and inappropriate .
" It would be like Miss USA wearing a dress showing images of the Ku Klux Klan in the Deep South , with their hoods , their burning crosses and beer cans , " wrote a columnist for La Jornada , Jorge Camil , in a recent article .
" A beauty contest is very far from being the right place to vent political and religious ideologies , " he wrote .
Revolution
Church officials also expressed concern at the use of images from the Cristero War .
" This traditional outfit alludes to events that opened deep wounds , " Monsignor Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel told La Jornada .
The secular government that emerged from the Mexican Revolution tightened anti-clerical laws , provoking a conflict in which churches and convents were closed and foreign priests expelled .
The dress is now being redone to remove the offending images and scenes of death , the designers said .
The outfit due to be worn by Miss Mexico in the competition on 28 May will now include images of the Virgin of Guadalupe and of women who participated in the Cristero rebellion , reports said .
Think about it , another citizen guilty of the same crime will have to spend their full time in a jail cell of 96 feet , while she has 3000 - 4000 ft plus mansion with home gym , theater and pool with cabana boys .
And social contact with friends and families , which is part of the punishment the average folk must endure .
And seriously , do n't give me bullshit about her " medical condition . "
RHS ( Rich Heiress Syndrome ) is not yet recognized by the American Medical Association .
She just starved herself until she had this " condition " and needed to be sent home with a note .
Like the kid who does n't use their inhaler so they can get out of gym class .
Or she chipped her teeth on the jail bars like Sarah Silverman said she would , which is a distinct possibility .
So you hear that kids !
If you want out of jail , just starve yourself and they will send you home !
Of course , you will need to be worth billions for this to occur , and being in the tabloids helps as well .
Otherwise , they might just let you starve since you are not a 1%er .
And while we are on the fact of " medicine " , when I go to jail , can I please have a shrink come talk to me 90 minutes everyday to discuss my issues ?
High on that list will be the fact that I am in freaking jail .
So now she is no longer eating jail food , which is good because I heard when she saw her sandwich it was the first time she had ever seen bologna and freaked out .
Poor little rich girl , had to eat what poor folk eat !
Can you imagine that , eating the cake her class dishes out to us !
The inhumanity .
I often wonder about the Constitution rich folk get to use .
Is it etched in platinum ?
Does it actually project a hologram of the founding fathers telling them they are the 1 % meant to rule us untermensches ?
What exactly does it say about to rule of law , and how it only applies to common people , and not the rich , nor the famous ?
And why do we keep accepting this bullshit , from Libby to Paris , where the rich and powerful are obviously judged on a scales of justice laden with gold , while we are forced to face the music from amp that goes to eleven ?
And I just bet Martha Stewart is fuming about this , and you just know Lizzie Grubman is wondering how she is not on that list that excludes her from the rule of law as well .
Platinum Hat Update : After thinking about , I know think Rove or Cheney had her freed to push Libby and the new out of Baghdad off the front page for awhile .
Think about it .
Though critical and long - awaited , the reactor shutdown may also be the easiest achievement .
It essentially restores the status quo that existed in 2002 — except that now North Korea is believed to have enough plutonium fuel for eight or more weapons , in addition to the one or two it is believed to have manufactured when Mr. Bush ’s father was in office .
The challenge now , which experts believe will be far more difficult , is to convince North Korea to reveal and disgorge its arsenal .
Almost all of that was produced starting in 2003 , while the United States was distracted by the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath .
The February accord commits North Korea to eventually ridding itself of that fuel or the weapons it may have been turned into .
But it sets no deadlines , and getting the North to take those steps will require a second negotiation .
“ I could imagine that the next steps could extend beyond this administration , ” William J. Perry , a former defense secretary under President Clinton , said in an interview in his office at Stanford University on Friday .
“ And the North Koreans will demand a pretty high price for that . ”
North Korea meets its negotiating partners again in Beijing on July 18 , and in a statement yesterday the State Department said that it planned to use the session “ to make rapid progress in implementing the next phase set forth in the Feb. 13 agreement . ”
The initial North Korean steps may also give some additional leverage in Washington to Mr. Hill and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as they try to reverse some of positions that the administration took in the first term , when some , including Vice President Dick Cheney , refused to negotiate with the country and looked for ways to speed the demise of Mr. Kim ’s government .
Mr. Hill and Ms. Rice quietly dropped the American insistence that North Korea would not be rewarded for reversing the steps it took in 2003 , when it expelled the inspectors , increased the production of bomb material and withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
Everything In Its Place
Back when I first started out fishing I carried around a tackle box which held all my fishing gear .
The standard goodies were in this unwieldy chunk of plastic , you know the red and white bobbers , the old packages of snelled hooks that have never been opened , and do n’t forget those old jigs that have seven years of dust and rust on them .
When I opened this apparatus the foul stench of old maggot jars would burn every nose hair in my nostrils .
The odd living fly would make its getaway and buzz by my face scaring me half to death .
The hinges would groan barely opening and duct tape would fill the holes where there was once plastic .
If I walked and fished the banks of a river , I would have to put the tackle box down every time I made a cast .
Usually these tackle boxes were passed down from father to son , or from grandfather to grandson in my case .
My grandfather ’s tackle box became my tackle box after several years of cob webs while sitting idle in the garage .
I hit the water and opened the rusty handle of the box scrambling to get the mess of metal untangled and into the water .
The decaying metal hooks would always find a way into my bulky fingers and foul words would exit my lips .
I finally get to my favorite fishing hole and I ’ve wasted my first hour of sunlight attempting to make use of what was once an organized smorgasbord of shiny new fish snacks waiting to be catapulted in front of the biggest Brown Trout I have yet to lay eyes on .
I would lug this baby around on every fishing voyage with pride and made great use of it for many years , but one day it just blew up and fell apart right there on the water ’s edge .
I was upset after the blow out and a Brown Trout in the river saw me shed a few tears .
Faintly I heard that trout whisper to me , “ Just go get another box and quit your whining ” .
So off I went to the tackle shop to acquire a new box .
I arrived and browsed the shelves like a kid does when he enters the candy store .
My eyes wandered from side to side scanning the shelving like a hawk , look at that box and wow that ’s cool too .
I went up and down those two isles for at least thirty minutes before picking my new back pack and not a box .
Welcome to the new world of tackle organization .
The fishing pro said he used a back pack and not one of those old boxes gramps handed me down .
“ But why a back pack ” I asked the guy bewildered .
He explained to me that I could hold numerous more pieces of tackle and keep it appropriately organized .
Not only that , I could fish as I walked up the river not having to stop and drop the old box of plastic every time I made a cast .
This would maximize my time on the water and increase my hook up rate he stated concisely .
“ It is perfect for all tackle sizes and shapes but you will need to buy some plastic tackle organizers to accompany the back pack ” .
Oh yes I need to spend more money now but pondering the thought of just putting the hooks directly into the back pack I opted to take his suggestion .
I bought three plastic Plano tackle organizers which would suit the size of my fishing lures , paid for them and went home to get my tackle in order .
So let ’s break it down !
Today many tackle systems have removable dividers or removable utility trays for easy access and convenient storage to make locating your favorite lure quick and efficient .
I will write on my trays as to what they hold .
For example on each tray I write down what it contains to save time and get to my tackle fast and proficiently .
A black permanent marker does this perfectly .
I organize my lures as per the manufacturer of the lure .
Rapala Countdowns go into one selected tray that holds six lures .
Berkley ’s into another tray .
I organize by color patterns for less digging around and more fishing .
Rapala Rainbow
Trout patterns all go into one tray , Brown Trout Rapala ’s go into another and so on .
I go one step further and set out my tackle according to where I will be fishing the next day , what the weather is like or what season of the year it is .
The more together you are the more hooks ups you will encounter .
Lastly I make sure all my hooks are checked and the split rings are firmly planted onto the body of the lure .
It ’s always fun until someone loses a fish !
Everything has a place and everything in its place !
Getting organized is cheep and affordable which makes fishing that much more productive and comfortable .
Thanks to the World Wide Web you can shop before you buy to get the best deal possible .
The " Ames " Optical Illusion :
In the late forties , visual researcher Adelbert Ames Jr. designed a series of visual illusions to demonstrate how the mind forms hypotheses about reality and depth .
In one such illusion , Ames tested aspects of depth perception in a specially designed , distorted room .
He constructed a trapezoidal room for the observer to view by gazing through a peephole .
In reality , one corner of the room is farther from the observer than the other corner .
But when viewed from a particular angle , the room appears normal .
If a man would stand in the far corner and a small boy in the near corner , the boy appears larger than the man because of the distorted perspective .
Although the observer knows that adults are usually bigger than children , he still experiences the illusion !

This is the year 2007 .
This is Shlomi Fish , a good hacker , where hacker is a good enthusiastic programmer , not necessarily a computer intruder .
And I have an announcement to make : I refuse to be an IT slave .
Moreover : if you want to employ people like me ( and you do ) , you should not give us only good conditions - you should give us exceptional ones .
Otherwise , we ’ll probably leave , or be fired , much to your misfortune .
So if you hire a beginning programmer with a good potential who ’s full of this ( bad ) attitude , give him or her this reading list .
It will be faster and more fun to improve the quality of the code , rather than to rewrite it from scratch .
Instead he should say : “ give me some time to whip this code back into shape , by refactoring it [= cleaning it up ] ” .
Believe it or not , but refactoring actually saves time , as Joel demonstrates in “ Rub - a - dub - dub ” and Martin Fowler in his “ Refactoring ” book .
If your programmer is keen on labelling a code as “ ugly ” , “ unusable ” or “ I ’d like completely rewrite it from scratch ” , then he ’ll waste your time and be unhappy and under - productive .
While I do n’t claim to be a great programmer , I try to imitate one .
An important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness .
They know that you get an A not for effort but for results , and that it ’s almost always easier to start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all .
So , did I immediately launch into a furious whirl of coding up a brand - new POP3 client to compete with the existing ones ?
Not on your life !
I looked carefully at the POP utilities I had in hand , asking myself “ Which one is closest to what I want ? ”
Because :
Another important factor , that is not always present in nascent programmers , is their desire or even necessity to re-use code , however ugly it may seem .
Eric Raymond wrote about it in “ the Cathedral and the Bazaar ” :
Who are they ?
They are people who come up with wonderful ideas .
Who are interested in many things inside or outside computers .
They often can write a lot of good code , but often their code is wonderfully ugly , but still very functional , mostly bug - free , feature - rich and efficient .
Paul Graham called these developers “ Great Hackers ” in an essay he wrote .
As I said before , I can testify I ’m a good ( or “ above - average ” ) programmer ( and other things ) , but not that I ’m a great one .
That ’s because the baker cannot testify for the quality of his dough .
However , I know some people whom I can tell are great hackers .
If you want your programmers to be as productive as possible , make sure you hire good programmers , who can reflect on what they do , learn more , and who are enthusiastic about writing code and like it .
Only they can be of value to you .
That thing is revolutionary decisions .
Decisions that make one more productive in the future , restructure one ’s code ( or one ’s text or whatever ) in completely better ways , or allow the worker to do something in a better way .
The more such decisions he reaches , the more productive he is , and the more value he is to his company .
He ’s no longer just a code monkey - he ’s a “ Rosh Gadol ” and innovative programmer , who is of much more value to the company than just someone who writes the code that other people told him how it should behave .
Furthermore , actual code writing is not the most productive activity , as surprising as it sounds .
That ’s because if one writes code exclusively for too long , his mind will run in circles and he ’ll lose his edge .
And there ’s something that is even more productive than actually producing output .
Do you honestly believe that if you employ someone for 9 hours , you ’ll get an average of close to 9 hours worth of code writing a day ?
Probably not .
Programmers tend to get distracted .
They find it hard to start coding .
They need to think about what they do .
They need to take breaks for various things ( like drinking , eating , talking with their co-workers , etc. ) .
So if you want to hire great developers , you ’d better make sure you offer them the best .
Not only that , but you ’d better make sure you recognise a great developer when you see one .
How many times have you heard this phrase ?
I ’ll tell you why you ca n’t find them .
It ’s because you treat them like dirt .
Great Hackers are exceptional people : they wo n’t work for you , unless they ’re completely happy .
Some people who read the original article by Paul Graham , thought that they wo n’t fix bugs or do routine tasks .
That ’s not true - they will and often stay up late to do that .
But they refuse to take abuse .
When asked why he changed his opinion from the day before , Mahatma Gandhi replied : “ Yesterday I was more stupid . ” .
And indeed , you ’ll see that the really good programmers may eventually change their opinions .
If you want to tell if someone is a great developer - ask him about his opinion on a few things .
Possibly political .
Possibly related to software management .
Possibly something less serious , like popular culture .
If they ’re a great developer , they ’ll eventually have something innovative and opinionated to say about something .
Not necessarily an opinion you ’ll agree with , but a good , well - thought opinion .
Some great programmers I know purposely maintain a low profile and do n’t comment on everything .
I can respect that .
Others ( including the writer of these lines ) are completely sincere and always express their mind .
So language is one element .
Another element is philosophy .
I ’m not talking about the standard ivory - tower philosophy , which is mostly either useless or completely harmful , but rather of the process of “ loving - the - wisdom ” and seeking wisdom .
Nowadays , most of the greatest philosophers do n’t write books .
Instead they write essays and articles online , emails , weblog entries or comments , or even cartoon strips or other art forms .
The great philosophers of today are bloggers .
It is known that great programmers almost consistently have very good lingual skills .
All of the great programmers I know have a very good level of English .
The famous computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra once commented that he preferred to hire English majors over Computer Science majors because the former made better programmers .
If you see someone with an obviously broken English - do n’t hire him !
( I ’m not talking about a few problems - these are common and people with an audible cognition are more susceptible to them . )
So if you want to hire good developers , your best bet is to find people who are free software enthusiastic .
Other people are just either not good developers , or have the wrong character , which means they will not improve , but become worse in time .
Technology is progressing and workers who are not open ( literally ) , cannot keep up with it .
Naturally , most starting open - source projects amount to nothing .
But most shareware programs have died along the way too .
If you have a good discipline and want your program to succeed , nowadays open - source is what all the cool kids are doing , and practically no one will respect you if you ’re just a non - open - source shareware ( or even just non -open - source “ freeware ” ) developer .
If you want to hire a great developer you can bet your life , that he ’ll contribute for an open - source project .
Why ?
Can you imagine him starting his own shareware project ?
Shareware is practically dead on Linux and other UNIXes , which are the development environment of choice for most people .
And shareware does n’t pay : you work on a shareware program a lot , then you release it for a pay , receive pay from at most 10 people ( if you ’re lucky ) , and no - one can or is willing to contribute back .
On the other hand , if your program is open - source , and you publicise it on freshmeat .
net or a similar site , some people will gladly take a look , some of them will try it ( instead of immediately ignoring it for being non-open - source ) , some of them will send you a good input , and some will even become contributors .
Most importantly , great developers in this day and age work on open - source projects .
While open - source became popular with software , it later expanded to many other fields : there ’s now open - content / free - content texts , pictures and photographs , music , videos , and anything else .
There are open patents , open science , open access , etc .
But let ’s focus on open - source code .
Great Developers experiment on their own - they love to “ hack ” : create new things , enhance existing things , and make the elements of nature do things God did not intend them to do .
No , most great developers do n’t intrude into other people ’s computers .
And most of the so - called “ script kiddies ” ( at least those who are computer intruders ) while usually being perfectly nice people , are not great developers - at least not yet .
Great developers instead spend hours on end improving the quality of existing code by simple , mechanical actions .
They love learning new languages .
They chat endlessly with people from all over the world .
They read a lot of things online and offline .
How to treat Great Developers
So you want to hire a great hacker .
That ’s great !
What should you do ?
Great hackers , are not too concerned with getting an exceptional salary .
They probably wo n’t work for free , but they will often prefer a better job with a smaller pay than an abusive job with a higher pay .
But what do they like ?
Great Developers like to work on stable , well - proven platforms that are preferably open - source .
In today ’s world it means either C or C++ using gcc and g++ ;
Perl , Python , Ruby and to a lesser extent PHP ; Java and possibly also .NET on Windows 2003 or the open - source and cross-platform Mono .
If your platform does n’t work , has bugs that delving into the source wo n’t reveal ( if the source can be read at all ) - they ’re not going to be happy .
At a workplace I worked for a few days , I was given a task to automate a buggy Hebrew windows application written using PowerBuilder , which was incredibly quirky .
It took me three or four days to write less than a hundred lines of Perl code .
I was never so unproductive .
After answering the wrong question in an interrogation , I was fired , and was heavily relieved .
Such applications should not be tested - they should be rewritten using a more modern and less quirky technology .
Another thing great developers hate is to forced to be consumed by their work .
In Israel , some workplaces require at least 9 hours of daily work .
How can you work like that , and still work on open - source projects , have a girlfriend or a boyfriend , go to the meetings of social or technical clubs , hang with your friends in coffee shops , restaurants , or pubs , and other activities like that .
All of these things are not strictly part of work , but they are what make great developers productive .
That ’s because coding happens in your mind , not in your editor or IDE , and because the more inspired a developer is , the more happier he is , the better code he writes , and the better ideas he has .
A programmer who just works all week , without leisure time is heavily underproductive .
Here ’s another thing : in Israel the law mandates at least 12 paid vacation days per year .
At my previous workplace , I received 14 paid vacation days ?
Thank you , Workplace !!
But guess what ?
Fog Creek software , best known as the company co-owned by Joel Spolsky from the “ Joel on Software ” site gives people 6 weeks of paid vacation annually .
And they ’re doing very fine , and people there are super - happy and productive .
So , why should I work for you if all I get are 14 stupid days ?
Get real !
The Best Equipment Money can Buy The Joel Test specifically says that you should give your developers the best tools and equipment money can buy - from hardware to software , to office conditions , to food , to location , to everything else .
Many workplaces do n’t understand that .
In a previous workplace of mine , I was given a recycled computer - it was still fast but its hard - disk was only 40 GB .
It was a pain to get some Windows XP virtual machines running there .
Another computer we developed on still had a 40 GB hard disk too .
We ran out of space there because we had a huge checkout of the Subversion version control system there .
And the only hard - disks that our lab had were whopping 80 GB ones , bought because they were the cheapest ones , which probably would n’t have been sufficient for too long , either .
The most amazing thing was that the computer ’s sole CD drive , was just a CD drive - no CD writing , no DVD reading or writing - a CD drive .
It gave me a lot of grief .
I had to copy a few DVDs I burned at home on my supervisor ’s computer , and copy them over the network , and could not install a Linux distribution from its installation DVD even if I wanted to .
Some people can still happily use old hardware or play with relatively buggy software .
But good developers should not be concerned with this .
They want a hardware with enough space , RAM , and processing power .
They want a screen that they can easily move around ( a flat - panel LCD screen ) .
They want good food in the kitchen .
They want talkative , interesting and benevolent people to talk with .
They want a spacious office .
They want Internet connectivity so they can surf the web and search for answers , chat with their friends , ask people on the IRC for help , and contact some people who know more about the software they are using than they do .
Leave Your Developers Alone
At a previous workplace of mine , my bosses did not like the fact that I sometimes played card solitaire games or Sokoban .
I ’m not much of a gamer and do n’t spend hours on end playing high - end games .
But they did n’t like that people who passed by saw me not working at that very moment .
I needed these games to bring my mind back into cycle .
I was also labelled as a “ strange bird ” , because I often stood and looked at our building ’s garden and lawn through the window .
As Paul Graham notes there ’s a large difference between “ pretend work ” and “ real work ” .
Playing games and looking through the window do not make you less productive .
If you ’re just writing code for the same codebase all the time , your mind will soon run in circles , and you wo n’t be productive .
In a mission statement to an innovative software company , I said that I expected developers to work for only 20 % of the time ?
Why ?
They : Usually wo n’t work more anyhow .
Since so little is expected of them , they will feel willing to work more than that .
( Assuming they are indeed great developers with a wonderful character ) .
The things they ’ll do in the rest of the time will inspire them and allow them to be more productive .
Another issue are the working hours .
Make sure your developers can normally come to the office when they want and go when they want .
If you sometimes need more time or better attendance , then great developers will be happy to comply - temporarily .
But crunch mode is a recipe for disaster - your developers will be over - worked , under - productive , and unhappy .
And if they ’re smart , they will soon quit .
And here ’s another anecdote : at a previous workplace , I was instructed to fulfil my hours quota at least precisely , so they can get enough benefits from the Israeli Chief Scientist .
But what is more beneficial for them : a happy , productive developer who does very good work , or a few extra shekels ?
I can never understand this skewed logic .
Be Honest with your Developers
The first thing about being honest with your developers is telling them exactly why they were n’t hired if this was indeed the case .
Most companies I ’ve been to , either rejected me after an otherwise seemingly successful interview , or even sent me an uninformative rejection letter before any interview .
This will cause the exceptional developer to wonder what has he done wrong , or what ’s wrong with him .
As an employer , you should have the minimal decency to inform the star developers what they did wrong and how to further improve .
Otherwise , you ’re not being fair with them , and they also may tell all their friends how pointless it was to try to apply for you .
( Or tell their friends how good a different company that ’s also looking for great hackers treated them . )
Honesty is also telling your developers when they did something right , like finding bugs , fixing bugs , having good ideas , implementing something on schedule , handling a situation properly , etc. and when they did not do something properly .
Even the greatest developers make mistakes , but you should be honest enough to evaluate their total performance so far and not just their isolated mistake .
A great developer who ’s worked for you for a few months , made a mistake recently learned from it , and is determined not to repeat it , is a better asset than a new developer who still has a lot to learn at the company .
Obviously , honesty goes in both ways .
Great developers should be honest enough to tell their future employers , present employers , and co-workers what they think about them , or if they believe themselves or the latter are doing something wrong or exceptionally well .
Honesty is both liberating , and makes sure one avoids problems and problematic patterns .
Let Them Grow Here ’s another insight : let your developers grow .
If you know they have potential , then hire them regardless if they have the appropriate experience you ’re looking for .
No -one is born a kernel developer , an experienced mod_perl developer , a Java developer with 5 years of experience , or a C / C++ systems programmer .
But many people who are fresh out of college or even high school , and who like to program for fun , are capable of becoming that by being given an appropriate chance .
On the IRC , I ’ve been talking to someone who graduated in Electrical Engineering from a British university .
Since he does n’t want to work for the defence industry , he became a system administrator at a high school .
Now he knows
Perl and uses it extensively , but he does n’t think he can get a more lucrative job as a Perl programmer ( of which there ’s a lot of demand for in England ) because he does n’t have a lot of mod_perl experience .
The reason people want experience is not because the people with experience are more productive , but because they know how to handle problems they encounter better .
I do n’t claim experience is not important .
However , if you ’re using a platform which is both reliable and predictable ( “ it just works ” ) , give your programmers access to the Internet ( with the Web , search engines , and IRC ) , to good searchable books , and to fellow developers who are more experienced than them in that platform , you can make sure they overcome such problems easily .
A different programmer , also from the UK , testified that while he started working with Perl and liked it and was good , no one was willing to give him a chance to grow .
What is important about great hackers is not their knowledge or experience but their potential , attitude and autodidacticism .
Given proper conditions they will accumulate a lot of knowledge , and surpass “ medium - level ” techs with a small amount of experience .
So when hiring , do n’t ask them highly specialised questions .
Otherwise , not only you wo n’t find too many “ experienced developers ” , but you will also reject many great developers , who will be excellent for what you do .
Training a great hacker is cheap .
But hiring an experienced mediocre programmer , is a bad idea .
Take Some Good Advice
Here is some good advice I found about software management : Eric S. Raymond ’s The Cathedral and the Bazaar series .
Also see his “ How to Become a Hacker ” document .
Concentrates on open - source hacking .
Joel on Software - a collection of articles and essays and a weblog by Joel Spolsky .
Concentrates on writing commercial , marketplace software .
Paul Graham - many essays on different topics including Lisp , language design , dynamic languages , startups , and general philosophy .
Extreme Programming - a software management methodology intended primarily for developing in - house software , but with some good , general ideas .
After reading all of those you ’ll become much more clueful about good software management than without it .
Reading them taught me a lot , and even if I disagreed with some of the opinions they voiced , they were still good food for thought .

On Thursday , May 10 , 2007 , Lawrence Wilkerson , speaking on National Public Radio , proposed impeaching President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Here 's the audio .
Wilkerson is a Retired Army Colonel , the former Chief of Staff at the State Department from 2002 to 2005 under then Secretary of State Colin Powell , a Vietnam War veteran , the former Acting Director of the Marine Corps War College at Quantico , and currently a teacher of national security at William and Mary College .
The program , On Point , was hosted by Tom Ashbrook , who focused the discussion on a need for greater public accountability for the Iraq War , but who maintained that the public was not outraged or interested .
( Ashbrook should read some polls and invite on organizers of the impeachment movement . )
Also on the program was Ken Adelman , who promoted the war and said it would be " a cakewalk " .
Adelman argued a case for not holding public officials accountable .
Wilkerson said in early comments on the show : " This administration does n't know how to effect accountability in my opinion . "
But he did not raise the possibility of impeachment until after a member of the audience had phoned in .
The first caller who was put on the air demanded an investigation of the lies that launched the war , and asked for accountability " all the way up . "
In response to Adelman 's claims that history would hold people accountable , the caller said " I would love to have a job where , worst case scenario , my historical record is flawed . "
Ashbrook framed the question in terms of alleged limitations of the U.S. political system , and Wilkerson replied : " Well I do think that that 's a reality of our system .
However , let me back up just a minute and say that I really do think that our founding fathers , Hamilton , Washington , Monroe , Madison , would all be astounded that over the course of our short history as a country , 200 plus years , we have n't used that little two to three lines in Article II of the Constitution more frequently , the impeachment clause .
I do believe that they would have thought had they been asked by you or whomever at the time of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia ' Do you think this will be exercised ? ' they would have said ' Of course it will , every generation they 'll have to throw some bastard out ' .
That 's a form of accountability too .
It 's ultimate accountability . "
After an interruption , Wilkerson continued : " The language in that article , the language in those two or three lines about impeachment is nice and precise – it's high crimes and misdemeanors .
You compare Bill Clinton 's peccadilloes for which he was impeached to George Bush 's high crimes and misdemeanors or Dick Cheney 's high crimes and misdemeanors , and I think they pale in significance . "
Ashbrook asked for some examples of such high crimes and misdemeanors , and Wilkerson replied : " I think that the caller was right .
I think we went into this war for specious reasons .
I think we went into this war not too much unlike the way we went into the Spanish American War with the Hearst press essentially goading the American people and the leadership into war .
That was a different time in a different culture , in a different America .
We 're in a very different place today and I think we essentially got goaded into the war through some of the same means . "

Zyprexa Judge - Which Media Have 1st. Amd. Rights
Zyprexa Judge Decides Which Journalists Have First Amendment Rights
By Evelyn Pringle
The judge issuing injunctions in the Eli Lilly - Zyprexa - Documents case has decided that reporters at the New York Times enjoy the full protection of the First Amendment but that other reporters and media outlets do not .
The secret documents at the center of this hailstorm were provided to the New York Times , and several other journalists , by the same source .
The Times took the lead and ran a series of articles quoting the documents , and an editorial calling for a Congressional investigation of Eli Lilly .
On December 29 , 2006 , Lilly obtained a temporary injunction ordering a list of people , including many authors and journalists , to return the documents and not disseminate them further which included Terrie Gottstein , Jerry Winchester , Dr Peter Breggin , Dr Grace Jackson , Dr David Cohen , Bruce Whittington , Dr Stefan Kruszewski , Laura Ziegler , Judi Chamberlin , Vera Sherav , Robert Whitaker , and Will Hall .
At a January 3 , 2007 , even though he was not asked to , Judge Weinstein announced that he was not going to issue an injunction against the Times and specifically stated :
" The court takes no position on whether and how they can be used by others who received them from other sources .
After all , the New York Times has disseminated them .
This court is not going to issue an order telling the New York Times to return the documents .
So everybody has access to them . "
However , following a few weak arguments by Lilly attorneys during the hearing , the court extended the injunction , not to cover the Times , but to include the Wiki internet web site , Eric Whalen 's web site , the Alliance for Human Research Protection web sites , and the MindFreedom web site .
The Times still has the documents which are now off - limits to other all the journalists , and notably , Lilly has not even bothered to ask the court to order the Times to return them or not disseminate them further .
For its part , when the Times first broke the story , and Lilly started publicly mouthing off about obtaining injunctions to get the documents back , the Times basically said that it would not return them .
“ Our customary practice is to retain documents which we legitimately required during our news gathering process and which are likely to be relevant to future reporting , ” said Times attorney , George Freeman , in a Times article on December 20 , 2006 .
There are certainly no gripes against the Times itself because the information in the documents probably would have remained hidden forever had it not been for the Times .
But a judge and a corporate giant can not decide that a reporter at the Times will be afforded more freedoms than any other reporter in this county .
The decision to allow one newspaper to publish important information and not others , should have all journalists enraged .
Lilly 's ability to get a court to issue an injunction against any journalist at the drop of a hat should be troubling to all members of the media .
Freedom of the press can not be based on the size of a publication or its readership , or in the case of the Times in this instance , the recognition of the power and availability of funds of a newspaper to rise up and fight against a violation of that right .
Last month , the Times reported that the documents show Lilly concealed the side effects of Zyprexa , specifically weight gain and diabetes , because the company knew the information would have a negative effect on sales , and also that Lilly directed its sales representatives to encourage doctors to prescribe Zyprexa off - label to patients who were not schizophrenic or bipolar .
The documents quoted by the Times were designated as confidential pursuant to Case Management Order 3 , a Protective Order entered on August 9 , 2004 , which gave Lilly the right to designate documents confidential , so long as Lilly in good faith believed that they were .
Legal experts now contend that the information quoted by the Times was never entitled to protection .
Several persons listed in the injunction have obtained attorneys to fight for the public 's right to know what 's in the documents .
Attorneys representing interested parties include , Lilly attorney , Sean Fahey , of Pepper Hamilton LLP ; Ted Chabasinski , on behalf of Judi Chamberlin and MindFreedom ; John McKay , represents Jim and Terrie Gottstein ; and Alan Milstein appears on behalf of Ms Sharav , the AHRP , and Dr Cohen .
On January 9 , 2007 , attorney , Fred von Lohmann , of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , jumped in the ring by filing a motion on behalf of John Doe , a citizen - journalist who contributes to the Wiki web site , to object to the injunction that names Wiki .
A January 8 , 2007 , brief filed by Lilly states : " The materials at issue here are subject to a valid protective order under Rule 26 ( c ) ( 7 ) for trade secrets and other confidential information , and thus irreparable harm will result in the absence of an injunction . "
The brief also cites a case that says , " It is well settled law that the harm caused by loss of trade secrets cannot be measured in monetary damages . "
The conduct revealed by the Times could not possibly constitute protected trade secrets by any stretch of the imagination .
Since when did teaching sales reps how to convince doctors to prescribe drugs off - label , for uses never intended , become a trade secret ?
And since when is it a trade secret for a company to conceal the lethal side effects of a drug for 10 years , knowing full well that millions of people are at risk of being injured or killed ?
What " irreparable harm " could come to Lilly that would justify allowing even one more person to take Zyprexa without full knowledge of the health risks linked to the drug ?
Granted , the loss of what Lilly is trying to claim are " trade secrets " might lead to monetary damages , as it well knows .
So far , to keep these " trade secrets " buried during the first 2 rounds of litigation , the company agreed to fork out more than $ 1 billion to Zyprexa victims who were willing to sign gag orders and remain silent , but thousands more are waiting in the wings for the start of round three .
When reviewing the court 's broad injunctions , it is impossible to figure out what happened to Judge Weinstein since he wrote the book , Individual Justice in Mass Tort Litigation ( 2005 ) , in which he could have been discussing the Lilly - Zyprexa - Document saga when he stated :
" A publicly maintained legal system ought not protect those who engage in misconduct , conceal the cause of injury from the victims , or render potential victims vulnerable .
Moreover , such secrecy defeats the deterrent function of the justice system . "
The doctors listed in the injunction have all authored books , studies , or papers in many different publications on issues related to the information revealed in the Lilly documents .
The chilling effect of the court 's orders is most obvious as it applies to these doctors .
In addition to their own journalistic writings , they have been quoted as experts by this author , and many others , in countless articles related to psychiatric drugs long before the new Lilly documents surfaced , yet they are now barred from discussing anything about the secret documents with this journalist or anyone else .
Dr Cohen is the author or co-author of over fifty articles in publications such as the American Journal of Psychiatry , Ethical Human Sciences and Services , and the Encyclopedia of Psychology , as well as twelve books and monographs .
Getting the court to muzzle Dr Kruszewski was a major victory for Lilly .
He is on record telling this author early last year that Zyprexa increased the risk of obesity , diabetes type II , hypertension , heart attacks and stroke , " at the same time that it continues to cause neurological side - effects like the older antipsychotics . "
And furthermore , he is quoted as saying Lilly knew about these health risks for years and failed to warn the public , in articles published months before the new documents emerged to validate his assertions .
Dr Jackson , author of , Rethinking Psychiatric Drugs , is definitely not on Lilly 's Xmas card list either .
In addition to the book and papers she has written , in 2003 , she reviewed documents obtained under the FOIA , regarding to the FDA 's approval of Zyprexa , and provided written and oral testimony under oath in a lawsuit about the statistical manipulation used by Lilly when obtaining FDA approval for the drug .
Ms Chamberlin has been an author , lecturer , and activist in the field of patients ' rights for many years , and sits on the board of MindFreedom International , a coalition of about 100 advocacy groups in 13 countries that provides the public with information on all the latest safety issues and legal developments as they relate to psychiatric drugs .
Investigative journalist and author of , Mad in America , Robert Whitaker , likely holds the number one spot on Lilly 's hit list of despised journalists .
Lilly 's legal team is probably still celebrating the victory of getting his name added to the injunction .
The lack of friendship between Bob and Lilly dates back to November 1998 , when he wrote a series titled " Doing Harm : Research on the mentally ill , " that was published on the front page of the Boston Globe , and reported that in pre-marketing clinical trials , Zyprexa was linked to life - threatening adverse effects in 22 % of the adult patients tested .
Mr Whitatker has been investigating and reporting on Lilly and Zyprexa more persistently than any other journalist .
In 2005 , he used the FOIA to obtain FDA data and reported that Zyprexa 's adverse effects included cardiac abnormalities and hypotension ; Parkinson - like motor impairment ; unbearable restlessness ( akathisia ) ; and acute weight gain ( 50 % ) that increased the risk of diabetes , or basically the same information revealed in the leaked documents .
Vera Sharav , president of the Alliance for Human Research Protection , and Lilly are not the best of buddies either .
She has reported extensively on all issues related to Lilly and Zyprexa as they have developed over the past several years .
In fact , the AHRP sends out daily Infomails on the internet that provide all the up - to - date information on drug safety and legal issues to advocacy groups , members of the scientific community , public officials , the media , medical journal editors , and attorneys .
In addition , Ms Sharav has authored articles appearing in Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry , Journal of Disability Policy Studies , and American Journal of Bioethics .
And last but not least , there is Dr Breggin , the author of countless books on psychiatric drugs , who represents a nightmare in broad daylight to every corrupt pharmaceutical company on earth .
Dr Breggin makes a habit of exposing drug makers that conceal dangerous side effects of psychiatric drugs which in Lilly 's case , not only includes Zyprexa but Prozac as well .
Its not too difficult to figure out why Lilly does not want these incriminating secret documents to be added to the collection that this group of authors has managed to gather on its own over the years , whether it be through litigation or by use of the FOIA .
There is a full hearing set for 2:00 pm on January 16 , 2007 , for all the attorneys to argue for and against the injunction .
Hopefully , one of the attorneys will bring up the fact that allowing Lilly to keep these documents secret for all these years , while the company agreed to pay out over a billion dollars in out - of - court settlements , has done nothing to curb the off - label marketing of Zyprexa .
As a vivid example of Lilly 's off - label promotion efforts revealed in the documents , in one article last month the Times quoted an August 2001 , email from a doctor that was sent to both Lilly and the FDA , complaining about an off - label presentation made by a Lilly sales representative .
The doctor said the sales rep “ presented an elderly female patient who was presented to her physician by her family complaining of insomnia , agitation , slight confusion , and had no physical finding to explain her state . "
The doctor said the sales rep then suggested that Zyprexa might be prescribed for this patient and he went on to describe his interaction with the sales rep in the email stating :
“ I inquired what Zyprexa was indicated for she then indicated that many physicians might prescribe an antipsychotic for this patient .
I then asked for her package insert and read to her that her product was indicated for schizophrenia and bipolar mania — neither of which the presented patient had been diagnosed with . "
The truth is , the off - label marketing schemes discussed in the documents have been so successful that a medication , approved only for an extremely limited population of adults with two types of mental illness , has magically transformed into a best selling blockbuster .
If Lilly had stopped promoting the off - label use of Zyprexa , by now declining sales figures would be showing up in the company 's earnings reports , because there has been no epidemic of mental illness to account for the massive number of prescriptions still being written .
But there has been no decline in sales .
In fact , according to SEC filings , for the third quarter of 2006 , Zyprexa sales overall totaled $ 1.085 billion , a 5 % increase over the same quarter in 2005 .
In the US , the filings state , sales increased 3 % , to $ 519 million , and prescription volume held steady during the first nine months of 2006 .

Analysis of fossilized bones suggests milk - drinking mutations emerged after dairy herding .
The white stuff : milk is an evolved taste Punchstock
When did ancient populations learn that drinking milk ' does a body good ' ?
A team of scientists in Germany has tried to answer this question by studying ancient DNA extracted from skeletons thousands of years old .
Many adult humans can drink cow 's milk — a rare feat among mammals , which usually lose the ability to digest the sugar in milk after they are weaned .
Scientists have found the genetic mutations that allow many Europeans and some Africans to digest milk ( see ' Human evolution : How Africa learned to love the cow ' ) .
Geneticists have estimated that these mutations first spread 3,000 to 7,000 years ago in eastern Africa , and slightly earlier than that in Europe .
But some researchers have posed a ' chicken - and - egg ' question about milk drinking : was dairy herding adopted only by those populations who could already drink milk ?
Or did the invention of dairy herding favour those people who had the mutation , so that the mutation quickly spread throughout the population ?
Joachim Burger of the University of Mainz , Germany , and colleagues worked with Mark Thomas of University College London , UK , to address this riddle by studying DNA from skeletons scattered throughout Europe .
The team examined ten skeletons ranging in age from 3,800 to nearly 6,000 years old .
The skeletons were discovered at archaeological sites in Germany , Hungary , Poland and Lithuania .
Bones offer support
The team drilled into bone and tooth samples from the skeletons , and extracted DNA from the samples .
They then checked the DNA for the most common milk - drinking mutation found in Europeans today .
The team did not find any evidence of this mutation , it reports in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today1 .
Burger and his colleagues say this supports the dominant theory on how milk drinking evolved — that milk - drinking mutations were uncommon before the practice of dairying began .
Then , when humans learned to herd cattle , the milk - drinking mutations spread rapidly , because they conferred a huge advantage on those who had them — perhaps due to the extra protein and fats available in cow 's milk , the team speculates .
Burger says this is the first time that scientists have tried to use very old DNA to answer questions about milk drinking : " While the technique is common in modern - day population genetics , this is the first time that it is published for really ancient DNA , " he says .

Other scientists cautioned that with so few skeletons analysed , from different areas , the results are not necessarily definitive .
But , they said , the method adds a new way to look at milk drinking and other traits .
" The study does provide an excellent example of cross-checking the age estimates based solely on modern variations with datable ancient DNA , " says Diane Gifford - Gonzalez , an anthropologist who studies the origins of dairying at the University of California , Santa Cruz .

Impeach - a- palooza comes to Washington
By Michelle Malkin
St. Cindy Sheehan and her unhinged minions will descend on Arlington National Cemetery Monday morning for an impeachment parade that will end at John Conyers ’ office doorstep .
Similar protests are taking place in the offices of Rep. Howard Berman in California and Rep. Pete Visclosky in Indiana , and at Rep. Conyers ’ district offices in Detroit , among others .
This is no fringe movement .
The nutroots machine has kicked into high gear .
Far Lefty Bill Moyers joined the bandwagon with a one - hour PBS special on impeachment last week .
Jimmy Breslin banged the impeachment drum in his Newsday column today .
Sen . Russ Feingold is crusading for censure .
West Hollywood ’s city council passed an impeachment resolution last week - “ the 80th city or township in the nation to pass such a declaration , following similar actions in Michigan , Ohio and Vermont as well as six cities in Northern California , including Arcada and Eureka . ”
Telluride , Colorado approved one last week as well .
There is an active ImpeachPAC and there is now something called a “ National Impeachment Center ” in L.A .
And Conyers , via Weasel Zippers , says he just needs to gather three more congressional members and then he ’ll move to impeach .
[…]
These people mean business .
They ’re organized , energized , and relentless .
They have substantial public support , funding , and legal / academic infrastructure .
Does the GOP plan to rely on Nancy Pelosi to fend these impeachment hounds off ?
If so , they vastly underestimate the nutroots ’ zeal ” “ and Pelosi ’s fecklessness .
( Original Article )
Americas bipartisan governing elite never expected their common interventionist foreign policy to be damned by a man who has long worked among that august group .
But Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) proved himself not only a political maverick , but one of the few elected federal officials who still prizes  indeed , treasures is a better word  his status as an American citizen .
Rep .
Paul does not view himself as a citizen of the world who deems unrelenting U.S. intervention abroad as the acceptable price the world demands of America for this higher form of citizenship .
Rep .
Paul rejects that price , which is , of course , enormously expensive in monetary terms , as well as in terms of the blood of American kids , most of whose parents and other kin are seldom if ever found in the countrys governing elite .
In the Republican debate in South Carolina , Dr. Paul had the unmitigated gall to tell his fellow candidates the exact truth : America was attacked by Islamists on 9/11 , and untold other times since Osama bin Laden declared war on us in 1996 , because of the United States governments foreign policies and their impact in the Muslim world over the last thirty - five years .
Dr. Paul then consigned to historys trashcan the motivations assigned to bin Laden and his ilk by the Bush and Clinton administrations ; the nine other Republican candidates ; the eight please - dont - ask - us - about - what - Ron - Paul - said Democratic presidential candidates ; most of the media ; and the think tanks , left , center , and right .
Quite correctly , Rep .
Paul deep - sixed  hopefully forever  the idea that our Islamist enemies are attacking us because of our freedoms , liberties , elections , freedom of speech , and gender equality .
In response to Rep. Paul , Rudy Giuliani  is there a more unctuous , ill - informed , and arrogant man in American politics ?
 dismissed the idea that we were attacked for being " over there " as , in his opinion , " absurd . "
Giuliani added that he had never before heard such an analysis , demanded Dr. Paul retract his words , and clearly implied that Dr. Paul was unpatriotic .
In other words , Giuliani applied the usual crude denigration reserved for any American citizen who dares question the establishments self - serving interventionism .
Sadly for Americans , Giuliani probably was telling the truth , both for himself and the American governing elite .
None of the elites denizens appear to have heard , read , or even sensed anything that runs counter to the Muslims - hate - us - for - our - freedoms dictum that became revealed scripture on 9/11 and which , in truth , has governed the elites perceptions of and actions in the Muslim world for decades .
Dr. Paul is right , our governing elite are obsessed with searching abroad for dragons to destroy , especially Islamic dragons ; they thereby ignore the Founders  clear warning that such activity all but assures the ruin of our republic .
Soon after the debate , the bone - deep interventionism of both parties focused on by Rep .
Paul was underscored for Americans by the spending bill for the Iraq war passed by Congress and signed by President Bush .
The bill allowed the intervention in Iraq to continue until at least September and showed there is no real difference between the two parties ; the Republicans want to continue pursuing the military option , while the Democrats argue the military option has failed and there must now be a U.S. - dominated political solution .
Neither party wants to leave Iraq ; each just has its own view of how the intervention should be managed .
And they cynically have stage - managed the next three months so that each will have ammunition  in the form of dead U.S. military personnel  to support their agendas when the next Iraq spending bill is debated .
The Republicans will argue that the " surge " has been costly in lives but is succeeding and cannot be given up ; the Democrats will argue the surge has failed and the high number of U.S. dead show that we must find a political settlement .
Odds are the next spending bill will be signed and leave the situation substantially unchanged because no one  save Rep .
Paul  really wants to get out of Iraq .
Indeed , there is every chance that the next presidential election will come and go and we will still be in Iraq because the gentleman from Texas is the only presidential candidate who is not a rank interventionist .
Faced with this reality , the struggle to make Americans face facts on foreign policy must be fought now and the spark struck by Rep .
Paul fanned into a fire .
Make no mistake , the United States is fighting and losing a growing war against al - Qaeda and its allies .
And our evolving defeat is not the result of military weakness on our part , or any God - is - on - the - side - of - the - Islamists factor on al - Qaedas side .
We are losing because we have underestimated the enemys strength and motivation thanks to the belief of Mr. Giuliani and our bipartisan elite that Mr. Pauls assessment of the Islamists  motivation is " absurd . "
That belief  which can now be called the " Giuliani Doctrine "  is al - Qaedas only indispensable ally and its maintenance is the Islamists only hope for victory .
Our Islamist enemies are motivated by the U.S. policies that have produced Americas military presence in the Muslim world ; approval for the repression of Muslims by Russia and China ; exploitation of Muslim oil resources ; unqualified support for Israel ; and a half - century of protecting Arab police states .
No American , of course , has to agree with Muslim perceptions of U.S. policies .
But perception always is reality , and there is no doubt that most of the worlds 1.4 billion Muslims  even those opposed to bin Laden  perceive U.S. foreign policy as an attack on their faith , lands , and brethren .
Thus , while our bipartisan governing elite fight a non-existent threat  the freedom - haters and the liberty detesters  the threat fueled by hatred for the impact of U.S. foreign policy grows broader , deeper , and more visceral among Muslims .
What to do ?
Take Rep .
Paul up on his idea of debating the components of U.S. foreign policy that are at issue , not to denigrate their authors and upholders , but to allow Americans to assess whether the policies are doing the only thing they must do  protect America .
In this nation there should be nothing too dangerous to talk about ; energy , Israel , and our tyrannical Arab " friends " ought to be on the table for thorough , even vitriolic debate .
An honest , wide - ranging debate would do two things : ( 1 ) It would destroy the myth that Muslims hate us for who we are and how we think and live , and ( 2 ) it would help Americans see that U.S. foreign policy has consequences , good and bad , and that Washingtons current policies ensure war with the Islamists for the foreseeable future , and probably much longer .
Might I suggest , therefore , that the next Republican and Democratic debates focus on a single proposition , and that proposition be taken from the finest book on the history of U.S. foreign relations published in the last quarter century , Walter A. MacDougalls , Promised Land , Crusader State : The American Encounter with the World since 1776 .
In the debates , the proposition before the house for discussion  to adapt the words of Dr. MacDougall  should be :
" Foreign policy defines what America is at home and is the instrument for preserving and expanding American freedom at home .
Foreign policy conducted in the form of crusades for democracy or other ideologies abroad belie Americas ideals , violate its true interests , and sully its freedom .
The Founders never intended foreign policy to impose their values beyond Americas own land and waters .
None of the Founders perceived a mortal conflict between morality and the national interest ; indeed , foreign policy is moral when it is in the national interest . "
Initially , such a debate would amount to Dr. Paul against all comers , but Dr. Paul would be quickly joined by tens of millions of Americans when they hear the fatuous , theory - stuffed attempts by the seventeen other candidates to justify the profligate waste of American lives , treasure , and security for exactly the kind of ideological crusading  democracy , freedom , human and womens rights , etc.  the Founders not only warned against , but damned .
At debates end it would be clear to Americans that their self - appointed , inbred emperors have no clothes .
And the way then would be clear to think about a foreign policy that protects American liberty at home and genuine U.S. interests abroad , and one that is not the republic - destroying play thing of our elite interventionists and the interest groups , foreign lobbies , and domestic military industries that fund their election campaigns .

“ We had been told a 10 percent theft rate was likely in convoys brought in from Pakistan , but we had not expected the spare car keys to go missing , ” defense ministry spokesman Jaroslaw Rybak told news channel TVN24 .
“ We shall have to send away for spares , so it may take from several days to several weeks for our contingent to become combat ready . ”
According to media reports , Polish troops taking part in NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in Afghanistan have been assigned to patrol the mountainous border area with Pakistan to search for Taliban guerrilla activity .
The military vehicles used by Polish forces include Poland ’s Land Rover - like Honkers and U.S. - built Humvees .
Researchers have discovered a protein that blocks the pathways that cause allergic symptoms such as wheezing , runny nose , rashes and potentially lethal allergic shock .
They believe the new drug , which has almost no side effects , could completely eliminate allergy symptoms – from hay fever to potentially lethal nut allergies – that blight the lives of up to a third of all Britons .
It could save the National Health Service up to £ 1 billion a year and it could be on the market within six years .
Ido Bachelet , a key scientist in the award - winning project at the University of Jerusalem , said he believed the product could ultimately “ signal the end ” to many allergies altogether .
He said : “ We have shown this to be very effective .
From what we have seen this can eliminate allergies regardless of their location in the body .
I am very excited by this and we are trying to advance it as quickly as possible . ”
Dr Peter Howarth , leading allergy expert at Southampton University , also welcomed the discovery .
He said : “ This advance opens hope for allergy sufferers for the future .
It is extremely promising and we await with anticipation development in terms of human trials . ”
He added : “ We need new and better drugs as existing therapies are not effective in all patients .
This one should be very safe . ”
Professor Jonathan Brostoff , an allergy specialist at Kings College , London , agreed the findings , “ sounded fantastic ” , though he also added more research was necessary .
The astonishing news comes as the NHS reveals it now spends £ 1 billion a year struggling to cope with a growing allergy epidemic , with 18 million people now developing some sort of allergy during their lifetime .
For many years scientists have been frustrated with existing anti-allergy therapies , including steroids and antihistamines , which only relieve symptoms and can have serious side effects .
The team focussed their work on mast cells – the part of the immune system that helps the body overcome bacteria and parasites .
These cells are found in body tissues including the eye , nose , airways , skin and gut .
In allergy sufferers the cells inexplicably react to inert substances such as certain foods , dust mites and pollen .
But the University of Jerusalem researchers discovered a naturally occurring protein that “ instructs ” mast cells not to react in this way .
They have successfully used it in laboratory experiments and plan to test it on humans within the next year .
Allergy sufferers were excited by the news .
Simone Sagi , 34 , a support worker for the group Allergy UK , who suffers severe food allergies , said that living with her allergy “ can be a nightmare ” .
Ms Sagi , an exhibitions organiser from north London , was diagnosed with food allergies in her mid-20s when she lost more than three stone “ in a short space of time ” .
She said : “ I was a healthy nine - and - a - half stone and by the time doctors found out what was wrong I was six - and - a - half stone .
“ I was being sick constantly , I felt weak , tired , depressed and very worried , but no one could work out what was happening . ”
Eventually doctors discovered she was allergic to a large range of foods including fish , nuts , wheat , many fruits , chocolate and coffee .
“ I now have to take my own food to restaurants or when I go out , and many people treat you really badly when you do this .
Hydrogen peroxide does not foam in the bottle or on your skin because there is no catalase to help the reaction to occur .

Hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) is something you can buy at the drug store .
What you are buying is a 3 - percent solution , meaning the bottle contains 97 - percent water and 3 - percent hydrogen peroxide .
Most people use it as an antiseptic .
It turns out that it is not very good as an antiseptic , but it is not bad for washing cuts and scrapes and the foaming looks cool .
The reason why it foams is because blood and cells contain an enzyme called catalase .
Since a cut or scrape contains both blood and damaged cells , there is lots of catalase floating around .

When the catalase comes in contact with hydrogen peroxide , it turns the hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) into water ( H 2 O ) and oxygen gas ( O 2 ) .
Catalase does this extremely efficiently -- up to 200,000 reactions per second .
The bubbles you see in the foam are pure oxygen bubbles being created by the catalase .
Try putting a little hydrogen peroxide on a cut potato and it will do the same thing for the same reason -- catalase in the damaged potato cells reacts with the hydrogen peroxide .
Hydrogen peroxide does not foam in the bottle or on your skin because there is no catalase to help the reaction to occur .
Hydrogen peroxide is stable at room temperature .

WASHINGTON - A controversial documentary on the threat of radical Islam , promoted by the two most - watched U.S. cable news networks , was marketed and supported in part by self - described " pro-Israel " groups , according to an IPS investigation .
Abbreviated versions and segments of " Obsession : Radical Islam 's War Against the West " ran on FOX News and CNN , but neither station disclosed the film 's connection to HonestReporting , a watchdog group that monitors the media for allegedly negative portrayals of Israel .
HonestReporting marketed " Obsession " but denies it produced or funded the project .
" We initially gave some guidance to the ' Obsession ' staff , " wrote Pesach Bensen , editor of Mediabackspin.com , the organization 's weblog , in an email response to IPS .
" We 're thrilled to see it succeed beyond our wildest expectations . "
When " Obsession " was released last year , news pundits and anchors on FOX and CNN praised the independent film for its candid look at Islamic militancy .
FOX incorporated footage from the film into a one - hour special , which aired seven times in November 2006 .
CNN 's right - wing pundit Glen Beck called it " one of the most important films of our time " .
Sean Hannity of FOX
News described it as " shocking beyond belief " .
While such enthusiasm from right - wing talk show personalities comes as no surprise , mainstream cable news programs also appeared to accept , without question , the premise of the film , which explicitly compares the threat posed by radical Islam to that of Nazi Germany in the 1930s .
Consider , for example , CNN news anchor Kyra Phillips 's exhortations during an adulatory interview in December 2006 with Raphael Shore , the film 's producer : " I encourage everybody to see this movieÃ ƒÂ you definitely get an incredible education from watching this filmÃ ƒ Â
The movie left many of us speechlessÃƒÂ
We appreciate what you 've done . "
HonestReporting was founded in 2000 by British university students who objected to what they considered anti-Israel coverage by European media in response to the second Palestinian intifada .
There is no mention of HonestReporting 's connection to " Obsession " on the film 's website , www.obsessionthemovie.com.
In an online " Ask the Filmmakers " segment on the FOX News website , Shore stated that he could not identify the film 's funders for fear of retaliation by the " radicals " the filmmakers exposed .
Brian Gaffney , executive producer of the FOX News Documentary Unit , declined to comment on whether HonestReporting 's connection was disclosed to the audience , or whether FOX was aware of the organization 's ideological perspective .
" There is no mistaking that this was a film with a clear point of view , " Gaffney wrote in an email to IPS .
" Its forceful case against Radical Islam spoke for itself .
In the case of CNN , which ran segments of the film in the context of a joint interview with Shore and cast member Nonie Darwish , it appears that producers were unaware of the connection .
" I was told that HonestReporting was not involved with this film , " said CNN spokeswoman Megan Mahoney .
Any relation between HonestReporting and " Obsession " is also missing on the film 's website , but the organization 's name does appear at the end of the film 's credits .
In addition , a call for tax - deductible donations to help " launch " the film appeared on HonestReporting 's website , promising a free DVD of " Obsession " upon release .
Contributors of 250 dollars or more were promised a free copy of the book " Israel : Life in the Shadow of Terror " .
An entry on Mediabackspin.com , the organization 's weblog , also describes HonestReporting as a " proud partner " of the film .

" Obsession " features interviews with Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz , investigative journalist Steve Emerson , Itimar Marcus of Israel - based Palestinian Media Watch , and Daniel Pipes , a controversial scholar of medieval Islamic history whose website campus - watch.org sparked criticism in 2002 for its alleged McCarthyesque attacks on Middle East studies professors .
Its production credits include the Middle East Media Research Institute , or MEMRI , a translation service founded in 1998 by Col. Yigal Carmon , who spent more than 20 years in Israeli intelligence and later advised two Israeli prime ministers ; and the Palestinian Media Watch , an Israeli group founded by Marcus , that monitors Palestinian news organizations for alleged anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic propaganda .
" Obsession " , for all its fans , has engendered contentious debate on U.S. university campuses not only for its disquieting barrage of video footage culled from the Arab media , but also for the film 's distribution network .
According to the New York Times , when a Middle East discussion group organized a screening at New York University earlier this year , distributors of the film required those in attendance to register at IsraelActivism.com , the official website of the Hasbara fellowships .
The program , also known as the Jerusalem fellowships , was started in 2001 by Aish Hatorah -- an Orthodox Jewish outreach organization and yeshiva based in East Jerusalem -- in conjunction with Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
According to its website , the group " educates and trains university students to be effective pro-Israel activists on their campuses " by providing its participants with " tools , resources and confidence to return to their campuses as leaders in the fight for Israel 's image . "
Aish Hatorah helped found HonestReporting .
Rabbi Ephraim
Shore , the president of HonestReporting , also helped found Hasbara .
According to the St. Louis Dispatch , a summer screening of " Obsession " in St. Louis was sponsored by the local branch of Aish Hatora and featured a post - film discussion with Walid Shoebat , an ex-Palestine Liberation Organization militant who was interviewed in the film .
In the summer of 2006 , Shoebat , a convert to evangelical Christianity , also spoke at the " Night to Honor Israel , " a three - day event presented by Pastor John Hagee 's Christians United for Israel , a lobby group that aims to mobilize Christian Zionists as a political force , according to the San Antonio Express .
While watching the film , it becomes clear that the controversy surrounding " Obsession " has less to with what it says about the threat of radical Islam , than how it presents the information .
While the film contains disclaimers stating that " it 's important to remember most Muslims are peaceful and do not support terror , " critics argue that it makes little distinction between the religion of Islam and the political realities that inform terrorism .
" It 's all part of that industry of Muslim bashers , " said Ibrahim Hooper , a spokesman for the Council on American - Islamic Relations .
" The sentiment is there , you can see in the [ 1995 ] Oklahoma City bombing that it was originally seen as an act of Islamic terrorism , " said Peter Hart of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting .
" It 's almost a default position for the media , so you 're going to have work like this received uncritically . "
The Oklahoma City bombing , initially attributed by the mainstream media to Islamic terrorists , was actually perpetrated by right - wing extremists from the U.S. midwest .
The film 's director , Wayne Kopping , argues that it aims to uncover the mixed messages propagated by radical Islamists in the Muslim world , who moderate their voices only when they speak in Western media outlets . <
" Children in the Arab world are ... breastfed on a diet of hatred for the West .
Not only that -- the entire culture is permeated with it , " said Kopping in a FOX interview .
" The question is what are they [ the spokespeople ] saying in their own language , on their own TV stations to their own people .
That 's when you really hear what they think , and they call for jihad . "

TSA and the Sippy Cup Incident
This story is pretty disgusting :
“ I demanded to speak to a TSA [ Transportation Security Administration ] supervisor who asked me if the water in the sippy cup was ‘ nursery water or other bottled water . ’
I explained that the sippy cup water was filtered tap water .
The sippy cup was seized as my son was pointing and crying for his cup .
I asked if I could drink the water to get the cup back , and was advised that I would have to leave security and come back through with an empty cup in order to retain the cup .
As I was escorted out of security by TSA and a police officer , I unscrewed the cup to drink the water , which accidentally spilled because I was so upset with the situation .
“ At this point , I was detained against my will by the police officer and threatened to be arrested for endangering other passengers with the spilled 3 to 4 ounces of water .
I was ordered to clean the water , so I got on my hands and knees while my son sat in his stroller with no shoes on since they were also screened and I had no time to put them back on his feet .
I asked to call back my fiancé , who I could still see from afar , waiting for us to clear security , to watch my son while I was being detained , and the officer threatened to arrest me if I moved .
So I yelled past security to get the attention of my fiancé .
“ I was ordered to apologize for the spilled water , and again threatened arrest .
I was threatened several times with arrest while detained , and while three other police officers were called to the scene of the mother with the 19 month old .
A total of four police officers and three TSA officers reported to the scene where I was being held against my will .
I was also told that I should not disrespect the officer and could be arrested for this too .
I apologized to the officer and she continued to detain me despite me telling her that I would miss my flight .
The officer advised me that I should have thought about this before I ‘ intentionally spilled the water ! ' ”
This story portrays the TSA as jack - booted thugs .
The story hit the Internet last Thursday , and quickly made the rounds .
I saw it on BoingBoing .
But , as it turns out , it ’s not entirely true .
The TSA has a webpage up , with both the incident report and video .
TSO [ REDACTED ] took the female to the exit lane with the stroller and her bag .
When she got past the exit lane podium she opened the child ’s drink container and held her arm out and poured the contents ( approx . 6 to 8 ounces ) on the floor .
MWAA Officer [ REDACTED ] was manning the exit lane at the time and observed the entire scene and approached the female passenger after observing this and stopped her when she tried to re-enter the sterile area after trying to come back through after spilling the fluids on the floor .
The female passenger flashed her badge and credentials and told the MWAA officer “ Do you know who I am ? ”
An argument then ensued between the officer and the passenger of whether the spilling of the fluid was intentional or accidental .
Officer [ REDACTED ] asked the passenger to clean up the spill and she did .
Watch the second video .
TSO [ REDACTED ] is partially blocking the scene , but at 2:01:00 PM it ’s pretty clear that Monica Emmerson — that ’s the female passenger — spills the liquid on the floor on purpose , as a deliberate act of defiance .
What happens next is more complicated ; you can watch it for yourself , or you can read BoingBoing ’s somewhat sarcastic summary .
In this instance , the TSA is clearly in the right .
But there ’s a larger lesson here .
Remember the Princeton professor who was put on the watch list for criticizing Bush ?
That was also untrue .
Why is it that we all — myself included — believe these stories ?
Why are we so quick to assume that the TSA is a bunch of jack - booted thugs , officious and arbitrary and drunk with power ?
It ’s because everything seems so arbitrary , because there ’s no accountability or transparency in the DHS .
Rules and regulations change all the time , without any explanation or justification .
Of course this kind of thing induces paranoia .
It ’s the sort of thing you read about in history books about East Germany and other police states .
It ’s not what we expect out of 21st century America .
The problem is larger than the TSA , but the TSA is the part of “ homeland security ” that the public comes into contact with most often — at least the part of the public that writes about these things most .
They ’re the public face of the problem , so of course they ’re going to get the lion ’s share of the finger pointing .
It was smart public relations on the TSA ’s part to get the video of the incident on the Internet quickly , but it would be even smarter for the government to restore basic constitutional liberties to our nation ’s counterterrorism policy .
Accountability and transparency are basic building blocks of any democracy ; and the more we lose sight of them , the more we lose our way as a nation .

Story Highlights • Defense secretary extends
Army tours to 15 months
• House speaker calls extension " an unacceptable price for our troops "
• Change applies to active - duty soldiers already in Iraq ; it 's effective now
• Money used to entice troops to stay in military ; some could get $ 150,000 bonuses
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Tours of duty for members of the U.S. Army will be extended from 12 months to 15 months effective immediately , Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced Wednesday .
" What we 're trying to do here is provide some long - term predictability to our soldiers and their families , " Gates told reporters at the Pentagon .
In exchange for the extension , Gates said the service will be able to give all units a year at home between deployments .
He denied the order was a sign that the Army has passed its breaking point under the stresses of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , saying the service has met or passed its recruiting and retention goals .
But he added that the military has been " stretched " by the conflicts .
And he blasted Tuesday 's leak of that proposal to the media , saying the Defense Department hoped to give the troops 48 hours ' advance notice of the decision .
The order covers the active - duty Army , which provides most of the estimated 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq .
National Guard and reserve troops would continue to spend a year in the war zone , Gates said .
About 15,000 more troops are expected to be deployed to Iraq in coming months to support the efforts to pacify Baghdad and other provinces .
The Marines , whose members serve seven months deployed , are unaffected by Wednesday 's order , said Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Troops now held beyond 12 months are paid an additional $ 1,000 a month .
That policy will continue , Gates said .
Also , the Army has struggled to entice soldiers and Marines not to leave the service .
The campaign to retain soldiers has reached $ 1 billion , with bonuses soaring nearly sixfold since 2003 .

Army : Money crunch ahead
Last week , the Army warned program managers to prepare for a possible money crunch if President Bush vetoes an emergency war spending bill that calls for the eventual withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq .
But analysts say Pentagon staff will be the first to face cuts .
In a memo sent Monday , the Army Budget Office warned that a resolution to the standoff between Bush and Congress over the bill " is doubtful before the end of April . "
It said managers needed to plan to stretch current funds into June , with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan exempt from the restrictions .

Democrats used the announcement to again call for changes to the president 's war strategy .
" The Bush administration has failed to create a plan to fully equip and train our troops , bring them home safely and soon , and provide our veterans with the quality care they deserve , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said .
" Extending the tours of all active - duty Army personnel is an unacceptable price for our troops and their families to pay . "
In her statement , Pelosi encouraged Bush " to sit down with us to find a solution to bring this war to an end . "
Sudan 's defense minister , Abdel Rahim Mohamed Hussein , has accused " 24 Jewish organizations " of " fueling the conflict in Darfur " last week in an interview with a Saudi newspaper .
Hussein was interviewed during an official state visit to the Saudi kingdom last week .
Darfur Crisis ' Israel creating unnecessary drama ' Roee Nahmias Sudanese minister promises his country ' will find the way to deal with refugees ' .
Israel to continue aiding those fleeing Darfur until international solution is found ' Israel creating unnecessary drama '
" The Darfur issue is being fuelled by 24 Jewish organizations , who are making the largest amount of noise over the issue , and using the Holocaust in their campaigning , " the Sudanese defense minister replied .
Hussein added that the Darfur conflict was driven by " friction between farmers and herders and shepherds .
Among the biggest problems is that of water , which is used to exploit the differences and fuel the conflict . "
" Are these Jewish groups supporting ( the rebels ) financially ? , " the interviewer from Okaz asked Hussein .
" Yes , they provide political and material support through their control over the media and across American and British circles , " Hussein said , adding that Jewish groups were using " all means to fuel these conflicts . "
He added that Western reports of 200,000 people dying in Sudan were false , and said : " We talk about 9,000 dead as a result of either government or rebel actions . "
' We came to Israel to look for a better place '
Several days ago , Sudan 's Interior Minister , Zubair Bashir Taha , lashed out at Sudanese refuees who had sought asylum in Israel , and accused " Isaeli authorities of encouraging the Sudanese refugees to come to their country . "
He added that his ministry was " very confused " by Sudanese citizens who came to Israel . "
The Sudan Tribune quoted a Sudanese refugee as telling al - Jazeera television : " We were surprised when we came here .
We met good people , who welcomed us and gave us food .
We feel that we are extremely happy .
We hope that the Israeli government would find a solution for us and our children .
We came here to look for a better place . "
Meanwhile , in the US , a number of Jewish organizations have attempted to raise awareness over the plight of Sudanese citizens who face mass killings and ethnic cleansing from the Sudanese government .
Some 20 Jewish organizations joined the ' Save Darfur Coalition , ' along with other religious communities and American civil rights groups .
Valerie Plame Wilson 's opening statement before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform :
Good morning , Mr. Chairman , and members of the Committee .
My name is Valerie Plame Wilson and I am honored to have been invited to testify under oath before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the critical issue of safeguarding classified information .
I 'm grateful for this opportunity to set the record straight .
I 've served the United States loyally and to the best of my ability as a covert operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency .
I worked on behalf of the national security of our country , on behalf of the people of the United States until my name and true affiliation were exposed in the national media on July 14 , 2003 , after a leak by administration officials .
Today , I can tell this Committee even more .
In the run-up to the war with Iraq , I worked in the Counter Proliferation Division of the CIA , still as a covert officer , whose affiliation with the CIA was classified .
I raced to discover solid intelligence for senior policy makers on Iraq 's presumed weapons of mass destruction programs .
While I helped to manage and run secret worldwide operations against this WMD target from CIA headquarters in Washington , I also traveled to foreign countries on secret missions to find vital intelligence .
I love my career because I love my country .
I was proud of the serious responsibilities entrusted to me as a CIA covert operations officer .
And I was dedicated to this work .
It was not common knowledge on the Georgetown cocktail circuit , that everyone knew where I worked .
But all of my efforts on behalf of the national security of the United States , all of my training , all of the value of my years of service were abruptly ended when my name and identity were exposed irresponsibly .
In the course of the trial of Vice President Cheney 's former Chief of Staff , Scooter Libby , I was shocked at the evidence that emerged .
My name and identity were carelessly and recklessly abused by senior government officials in both the White House and the State Department .
All of them understood that I worked for the CIA , and having signed oaths to protect national security secrets , they should have been diligent in protecting me and every CIA officer .
The CIA took great lengths to protect all of its employees , provided at significant taxpayer expense , painstakingly devised creative covers for its most sensitive staffers .
The harm that is done when a CIA cover is blown is grave , but I can't provide details beyond that in this public hearing .
But the concept is obvious .
Not only have breaches of national security endangered CIA officers , it has jeopardized , even destroyed entire networks of foreign agents , who in turn risk their own lives and those of their families to provide the United States with needed intelligence .
Lives are literally at stake .
Every single one of my former CIA collegues , my fellow covert officers , to analysts to technical operations officers , even the secretaries , understand the vulnerabilities of our officers and recognize that the travesty of what happened to me could happen to them .
We in the CIA always know that we might be exposed and threatened by foreign enemies .
It was a terrible irony that administration officials were the ones who destroyed my cover .
Furthermore , testimony in the criminal trial of Vice President Cheney 's former Chief of Staff , who has now been convicted of serious crimes , indicates that my exposure arose from purely political motives .
Within the CIA , it is essential that all intelligence be evaluated on the basis of its merits and actual credibility .
National security depends upon it .
The tradecraft of intelligence is not a product of speculation .
I feel passionately as an intelligence professional about the creeping , insidious politicizing of our intelligence process .
All intelligence professionals are dedicated to the ideal that they would rather be fired on the spot than distort the facts to fit a political view .
Any political view or any ideology .
As our intelligence agencies go through reorganizations and experience the painful aspects of change , and our country faces profound challenges , injecting partisanship or ideology into the equation makes effective and accurate intelligence that much more difficult to develop .
Politics and ideology must be stripped completely from our intelligence services or the consequences will be even more severe than they have been and our country placed in even greater danger .
It is imperative for any President to be able to make decisions based on intelligence that is unbiased .
The Libby trial and the events leading to the Iraq
War highlight the urgent need to restore the highest professional standards to intelligence collection and analysis and the protection of our officers and operations .
The Congress has a Constitutional duty to defend our national security and that includes safeguarding our intelligence .
That is why I am grateful for this opportunity to appear before this Committee today and to assist in its important work .
Thank you and I welcome any questions .

Many liberals are convinced that the program represented a deep affront to the rule of law , though they do n't know quite what the program was .
Many conservatives are no less certain of the program 's absolute necessity .
And , though they do n't know quite what it was either , they are sure as well that President Bush had the authority to implement it -- whatever federal law on the subject may happen to say .
Unlike many of these oh - so - confident commentators , I actually know something about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
I am one of the very few journalists -- to my knowledge , in fact , the only one -- who ever physically set foot inside the super - secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) Court .
FISA has been a particular interest of mine since the mid-'90s , when I was a young reporter at a legal trade paper and the court it created was the most obscure corner of the federal judiciary .
Precisely because nobody knew anything about it , I studied it obsessively .
I talked to the judges who heard the government 's surveillance requests and to the Justice Department lawyers who advanced these applications .
I learned , in some detail , the contours , value , and the limitations of FISA at a time when very few people cared about it .
So what is my assessment of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , informed by my decade of watching the court and the law that underlies it ?
I do n't know .
The New Republic , this sounds impressive , because they think it constitutes a persuasive ( even necessary ) foundation for someone to begin an argument by insisting , based on nothing , how much more knowledgable they are than everyone else .
In fact , Wittes ' insider credentials are so impressive that he can simply decree the truth about issues without even bothering to offer any rationale or facts at all .
His entire article is devoid of any facts or arguments .
He simply assures us that he knows so much more about FISA than you do , and because of how much he knows , he realizes that these matters are way too complicated even for him -- let alone for you -- to form an opinion about whether the President did anything wrong here .
This is his whole " argument " :
I do n't know what the program is .
I do n't know whether it was lawful before the recent change .
Truth be told , I do n't even understand what the change announced in Gonzales 's letter really means .
I can arrange the facts in the public record so as to describe a program that would , in my view , offend the Constitution .
And I can arrange the facts in the public record so as to describe a program that would not , in my view , offend the Constitution .
I can imagine a program outside of FISA that the law should be amended to accommodate .
And I can imagine a program that violates the FISA precisely because it involves the kind of warrantless surveillance the law was passed to prevent .
What 's more , the more I learn about this program , the less I understand it .
For the eager - to - please , self - styled Beltway insider - experts , a failure to form a clear political opinion is the mark of both intellectual and moral superiority , of emotional maturity , and is the hallmark of that most coveted Washington virtue -- seriousness .
Unlike you , who has formed one of those dirty opinions that the President has no right to break the law , Wittes understand that these matters are much , much more complex and sophisticated than that -- after all , this involves computers and national security threats and data and things you cannot possibly begin to understand -- and it is only your ignorance , your extremely unserious partisanship , that has enabled you to think that you are in a position to oppose or condemn what George Bush has done here ( TNR 's Jason Zengerle long ago I actually know something about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .

The New Republic ,

The administration admits whatever that might entail -- is precisely the type of eavesdropping for which the FISA law requires a court order .
And the fact that the administration has now agreed to conduct this same eavesdropping under the purview of the FISA court by itself proves that this eavesdropping is the type covered by FISA ( otherwise , the FISA judges would have no jurisdiction to supervise it ) .
For that reason , Wittes ' grand conclusion is completely bereft of logic and just factually wrong on every level :
For whatever it 's worth , here 's my best guess -- and , I stress , it 's only a guess -- about what this NSA program was all about : I suspect it was an earnest attempt to address problems that the drafters of the FISA would have been mortified to learn they had created for the intelligence community .
. . .
This hypothesis could be totally wrong .
The point is that , without knowing the precise contours of the program , it is simply impossible to evaluate it against a complicated and subtle law written at a time when the computer age was still in its infancy .
Some day , we will finally learn what the program really was and why it could n't , and then could , be approved through the FISA Court .
Details will leak , or the technology will become too obsolete to warrant continued protection .
When that day comes , those who insist that no possible combination of technology , law , and national emergency could excuse bypassing the court may find themselves embarrassed .

What facts could possibly emerge that make us all realize how Good and Right the President was to break the law , or for us to conclude that he did n't ?
Wittes does n't bother to identify such possible facts , because none exist .
By definition , none can exist .
FISA -- at least the parts relevant to the administration 's lawbreaking -- is not a " complicated and subtle law " except to people who do not understand it or who want purposely to obscure it .
And one does not need to know " precise contours of the program " in order to know that the President broke the law .
That he engaged in the precise eavesdropping without warrants for which FISA requires warrants renders all of Wittes ' very , very complicated and angst - ridden speculation completely irrelevant .
But this is how this sort of pompous , self - styled partisan - transcendence almost always operates .
They think that things like emphatic beliefs and principles -- and especially stern criticism of our Serious National Security Leaders -- are for the lowly , anti-intellectual masses .
The true guardians of wisdom and serious political thought in our society struggle endlessly with complex intellectual dilemmas and never reach any definitive conclusions because they are too smart and too serious for things like convictions or beliefs or things as shrill and irresponsible as accusations of wrongdoing against a sitting wartime President engages in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by statute .
"
The administrationthat the eavesdropping it has been conducting outside of the FISA court -- that might entail -- is precisely the type of eavesdropping for which the FISA law requires a court order .
And the fact that the administration has now agreed to conductunder the purview of the FISA court by itself proves that this eavesdropping is the type covered by FISA ( otherwise , the FISA judges would have no jurisdiction to supervise it ) .
For that reason , Wittes ' grand conclusion is completely bereft of logic and just factually wrong on every level :
What facts could possibly emerge that make us all realize how Good and Right the President was to break the law , or for us to conclude that he did n't ?
Wittes does n't bother to identify such possible facts , because none exist .

The New Republic 's Jonathan Chait defense of Ann Coulter and thus , unlike the complex and thoughtful Chait , failed to appreciate what a " clever , interesting , very well - executed " intellectual achievement it was ) .
The impact of this petty , self - regarding mentality is hard to overstate .
In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , it manifested as endless condemnation against war opponents on the ground that war opponents were simply too shrill and emphatic and failed to grapple with all of the fascinating , multi-layered , theoretical challenges which any serious , complex political thinker had to confront when pondering Iraq .
And the same thing is occurring now with Iran .
Only " partisan hysterics " would take the position that a military attack on Iran is unwarranted , unnecessary , and insane .
More sophisticated , trans - partisan , serious thinkers understand that the issue is far more complex than that and cannot be reduced to such crass partisan certainties .
This really illustrates the core of why our pundit class and Beltway opinion - making mechanisms are so corrupt and worthless , but also so destructive .
The whole point -- the only objective -- of Wittes ' article , and of columns and articles from most of our establishment pundits , is to establish their own special place of wisdom and insight .
To achieve that , they reduce all political matters to nothing more than grand intellectual puzzles , and equate any real beliefs with primitive ignorance .
That is what they mean by heinous , lowly " partisanship " -- genuine political convictions .
There is no place for hard - core beliefs or passion and especially not for anger .
Such emotions are just the misguided stirrings of the masses .
And thus , a President and his political movement start disastrous wars , are provoking still new ones , systematically and deliberately break the law , destroy U.S. credibility , and introduce a whole array of radical and destructive measures .
But those are all just fascinating intellectual matters which we should ponder with delicacy and civility and mild , restrained discourse .
None of them warrants any strong reactions or condemnations .
And so the super - smart , insider pundit class merrily buzzes along , never forming a definitive thought or opinion about anything other than to haughtily condemn those who object to what the President and his political movement have done and plan to do .
Regarding the destruction which this President is wreaking on the country , Wittes summarizes how the truly smart , sober , non-partisan experts ( as opposed to the partisan hysterics ) should react : " ' I do n't know ' seems like a good place to me . "

Dan Froomkin has published a superb list of basic journalistic rules which ought not be controversial but which are nonetheless routinely violated by our nation 's press corps ( h/t Jay Ackroyd and Christy ) .
Just fathom how much more effective and meaningful our media would be if they complied with these minimal guidelines .
has published an article by Benjamin Wittes , a " Guest Scholar " at the Brookings Institution , which argues that the issues surrounding the Bush administration 's warrantless eavesdropping activities are so complex and sophisticated , and raise such grave matters of national security , that not even the most brilliant and well - informed insider - experts -- such as Wittes -- could possibly form an opinion about whether the Bush administration did anything wrong .
Only blind , ignorant partisans would claim that President Bush acted wrongfully or illegally here .
Wittes ' article is the perfect textbook illustration of how the above - it - all , very - serious , super - smart , self - anointed pundit - experts churn out empty , cliched decrees -- which , though totally devoid of substance , nonetheless enable the Bush movement 's worst excesses .
Wittes executes this formula perfectly .
First comes the Broder -ish tactic of equating and then dismissing both " extremes " in the debate in order to establish one 's nonpartisan , elevated , detached objectivity :
Right at the start we learn how very clever and objective Wittes is : both " liberals " and " conservatives " have formed strong opinions about the NSA scandal despite knowing nothing .
Thus , those who object to the President 's law - breaking are exactly the same as those who defend it : merely loud - mouth partisan extremists -- opposite sides of the same shrill , lowly coin -- who can be scornfully dismissed away as know - nothing hysterics .
Such blind ignorance , of course , stands in stark contrast to the very high - minded and insider expertise of Wittes : Just preliminarily , doeditors really not realize how adolescent this all sounds ?
" that " some of the outrage [ over the NSA scandal ] is in fact outrageous " ) .
Like most of these pundits , Beltway journalists , and think - tank " fellows , " Wittesthe President 's lawbreaking to implicate all sorts of murky and complex matters because , that way , the expertise which Wittes thinks he has would be needed .
It would mean that only Wittes , but not you , is qualified to form judgments and that your obligation would be to listen to him and rely on what he says , rather than form your own views .
So he asserts that there are all kinds of complicated issues ( never identified ) which only insiders can understand and which prevent any meaningful opinions to be formed by non-insiders ( i.e. , the masses ) .
As is so often true with articles like this one inand similar venues , Wittes ' eager attempt to show how much more than everyone else he knows ends up revealing the precise opposite -- a profound ignorance regarding the issues about which he is purporting to enlighten us all .
The FISA law , as intended , is one of the clearest laws in the U.S. Code , and the issues raised by the NSA scandal are everythingcomplicated or murky .
I think everyone other than Wittes and a handful of still - confused Bush followers understands now that the U.S. Code provides that " the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act of 1978 shall be theby which electronic surveillance . . . may be conducted " , and FISA itself provides that " A person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally
On Brain Training
It tells you a lot about both the game industry , and Japan itself .
The game ?
Nintendo's 東北大学未来科学技術共同研究センター川島隆太教授監修 脳を鍛える大人 のＤＳトレーニング .
That 's right !
" Touhokudai Gaku Mirai Kagakugijutsu Kyoudoukenkyuu Center : Kahashima Ryuuta Kyouju no Nou o Kitaeru Otono DS Training " .
Seriously .
You can call it
Brain Training is , basically , an application — one you just happen to play on a handheld videogame system .
In this case , the system is Nintendo 's DS — a quirky , two - screen - with - touchscreen handheld system that 's technically creakier than Sony 's PSP , but which has lived up to its intended purpose of generating innovative new styles of games for a
And what does Brain Training do ?
Well , you hold your Nintendo DS like a book ( with left and right screens ) , and you basically use the touchscreen to undergo a wide variety of simple , cleanly - designed , interesting exercises intended to make you smarter .
Or , at least , keep your brain sharp and fresh and delicious .
At the end of your " fun " , the game eventually calculates and reports your " mental age " —
Sales Madness
It may sound painfully simple , but it 's been unstoppable .
From Dec 26th to January 1st , Brain Training 2 sold 414,556 copies .
In one week .
It has consistently been the number one videogame since its release , and — this is important to remember — it 's not even a videogame .
Has it driven hardware sales ?
In the same period , the Nintendo DS moved 390,181 units .
That 's more units sold than every other hardware system that week — combined .
( Yes , that 's two dramatic ItalicsFacts ! )
Most importantly , though , Brain Training is doing what Nintendo said they would do but nobody really believed them on : opened gaming up to a whole new generation of players .
Seeing grandmothers on the train holding their Nintendo DS like a book sends an instant signal — " brain training in progress " .
How It All Came Together I asked Nobuhiro " Noby " Hasegawa — President and CEO of the monolithic , sprawling Japanese entity known as Panic Japan — to elaborate on what makes it so successful .
Here 's what I learned from him .
1 . There 's an existing brain - training boom in Japan .
Dr. Kawashima , the creator of Brain Training , is leading authority in Japan on brain medicine .
His research shows that :
- The brain becomes weaker every year , just as the body becomes weaker every year
- Effective training is a way to regain body strength
- The brain can also be trained , and can be rejuvenated
- The brain does n't need difficult training : even easy work is effective , like reading a book out loud , simple calculations , etc .
Freaky Polygon Dr.Kawashima Freaky Polygon Dr.Kawashima
On the other hand , when very simple calculations are performed quickly ,
With this research , Dr. Kawashima published a " training manual " for the brain , and it became incredibly popular .
They were usually bought as presents from grandchildren and children for their parents and grandparents .
Is it junk science ?
Is there truth to it ?
I 'd certainly love to know more , but it 's already all the rage .
To quote Noby : " People always want to remain young !
Health and dieting are always interesting .
Now , this is true with the brain as well . "
2 . The Japanese do n't necessarily attach stigmas to " childrens " activities .
In America , most adults do n't read comics , or play videogames .
This is , of course , changing , presumably as my generation grows older and has kids ( bring it , Jack Thompson ! ) , but it 's still basically true .
Games aree children 's activities — not for adults .
Of course , in Japan , manga is hugely popular , and the enduring image of a expensive - suited businessman reading a thick - as - a - baby 's - arm comic book on the way to his desk job is as strong as ever .
Thus , as Noby said , " the sense of resistence of the Japanese adult to Nintendo DS 's Brain Training was little . "
3 . It 's priced really well .
It costs about 2,800 yen in Japan — $ 25 — the same price as two Brain Training textbooks .
So , anyone considering a purchase of the books will likely consider the game .
4. Really , it 's a fiendish trojan horse .
But , the parents will need a Nintendo DS to play , right ?
Will an adult buy one just for Brain Training ?
No , and they do n't need to — their children already own one .
And thus , the true genius of Nintendo 's trojan - horse " Touch Generations " concept is revealed .
Many parents might be reluctant to pick up a game system for their children .
Noby specifically uses the ( somewhat sexist but contextually - correct ) example of " Game System vs. Japanese Mom " , which he puts this way : " A game system is obstructive for cleaning .
The controller is complicated so Mom does n't want to try it .
It gets in the way of the child 's studying .
Etc. "
In order for the game machine to succeed in the household , it 'll basically need the mother 's approval .
The adult only needs to borrow the game system while , say , the child is at school , furiously Brain Training while the child is , presumably , learning themselves .
Before you know it , the game system is something mom uses — every day .
Noby concluded , " I expect that Nintendo developed BRAIN TRAINING as a method for obtaining the video - gaming approval of parents .
And , the attempt seems to have succeeded . "
Nintendo wins , and the industry grows .
Tricky !
What does it all mean ?
The included " Relax Mode " , a.k.a. Dr. Mario
The included " Relax Mode " , a.k.a. Dr. Mario
At first it's hard to imagine something like Brain Training ever hitting the top of the USA video game charts .
Virtually impossible , I 'd wager .
But , if you had told me that " Deer Hunter " would 've become the top - selling computer game a few years ago , I would have pulled the car over and laughed you out of it — and yet , it happened , stunning a whole generation of developers who were working on " Brown Devil Alien Guns III " - style games .
Both successes tell a valuable lesson : there are a lot of people who could play video games , but do n't , because the right software is n't there .
This is also interesting to me because we 've already watched applications slowly becoming more " fun " on the Mac , a testament to simplified design and strong UI .
In fact , the whole iPhilosophy seems to be taking complex tasks and boiling them down to bare but highly enjoyable essentials , creating applications that — yes — anyone can use .
Even creating a DVD in iDVD is now just as much " work " as it is " fun " : setting your goal , trying different themes , experimenting with music , dragging and connecting all of the pieces together , managing available disc space , testing it all out , etc .
With a certain degree of ridiculousness , I 'll say this : iDVD is basically a 2D strategy game without the historical setting .
Brain Training may be the very first app hiding out as a " game " , and the lines , as mentioned , will only blur further .
I like this .
But most importantly , I look forward to picking up Brain Training 's US release .
Even if it does n't catch on like wildfire , I look forward to training the hell out of my brain .
I secretly hope it will grow to kick other brain - asses .
As you read this , a fairly significant revolution in the videogame industry is taking place in Japan .
A quirky " game " is gaussian - blurring the line between games and applications , old and young , fun and utility , gamer and non-gamer — and you might be surprised by the results .
It tells you a lot about both the game industry , and Japan itself .
The game ?

The brain can also be trained , and can be rejuvenated -
The brain does n't need difficult training : even easy work is effective , like reading a book out loud , simple calculations , etc.
Hooking humans up to some presumably expensive and freakish brain - scanning equipment , Dr. Kawashima did some interesting tests .
When a brain is simply " thinking " , presumably about chocolate chips and where cat hair goes , it generates this much activity .
When a very difficult expression is being worked out .
looks something like this .
Not a lot going on , really .
On the other hand , when very simple calculations are performed quickly , the brain lights up like a drunk at a drunk convention .
It also shows lots of activity when sentences are simply read aloud .
With this research , Dr. Kawashima published a " training manual " for the brain , and it became incredibly popular .

Tricky !
So , the # 1 game in Japan is a non-game .
My ( shocking ) conclusion : there is a huge market for new styles of games and new game players , and the gap between " games " and " apps " is getting smaller .
At first it's hard to imagine something like Brain Training ever hitting the top of the USA video game charts .
