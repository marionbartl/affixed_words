South Ossetia profile Published duration 21 April 2016
South Ossetia , officially part of Georgia , is separated from Russia 's North Ossetia region by a border running high in the Caucasus Mountains .
Much of the region lies more than 1,000 metres above sea level .
A source of tension since the break - up of the Soviet Union , South Ossetia hosted a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 .
Moscow subsequently recognised South Ossetia as an independent state , and began a process of closer ties that Georgia views as effective annexation .
South Ossetia is inhabited mostly by Ossetians , who speak a language distantly related to Persian .
Most ethnic Georgians have been displaced from the region by the two conflicts .
They had accounted for about a third of the population prior to the fall of the Soviet Union .

Russian conquest
The Ossetians are believed to be descended from tribes which migrated into the area from Asia many hundreds of years ago and settled in what is now North Ossetia .
As the Russian empire expanded into the area in the 18th and 19th centuries , the Ossetians did not join other peoples of the North Caucasus in putting up fierce resistance .
They sided with the Bolshevik forces that occupied Georgia in the early 1920s and , as part of the carve - up which followed , the South Ossetian Autonomous Region was created in Georgia , and North Ossetia was formed in Russia .
Separatism
In the twilight of the Soviet Union , when nationalist leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to power in Georgia , separatist sentiment burgeoned in South Ossetia .
After several outbreaks of violence , the region declared its intention to secede from Georgia in 1990 , and in 1992 proclaimed independence .
Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continued until the summer of 1992 when agreement on the deployment of Georgian , Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers was reached .
Political stalemate followed .
Separatist voices became less strident during President Shevardnadze 's rule in Georgia , but the issues returned to the foreground when Mikheil Saakashvili replaced him .

Making clear his intention to bring South Ossetia and another breakaway region Abkhazia to heel , Mr Saakashvili offered them autonomy .
South Ossetians overwhelmingly rejected the overture in a 2006 referendum .
Tensions came to head in early August 2008 , when , after nearly a week of clashes between Georgian troops and separatist forces , Georgia launched a concerted air and ground assault attack on South Ossetia 's main city , Tskhinvali .
Within days , Russian forces swept the Georgians out of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia , briefly pursuing them into Georgia proper .
Russian domination
Russia formally recognised both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states after the war , followed by its Latin - American allies Venezuela and Nicaragua and a few Pacific island states .
In April 2009 , Russia bolstered its position in South Ossetia by signing a five - year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper , as well as those of Abkhazia .
In 2015 Russia started to put more pressure on Georgia over South Ossetia .
It signed an " alliance and integration agreement " with South Ossetia that abolished border checkpoints .
Georgia viewed this as a closer step towards Russian annexation of the region , and expressed further concern when Russian forces pushed the border fence 1.5 km further into Georgia proper - a short distance from the country 's main west - east highway .

Dear Friend of GATA and Gold :
The U.S. Mint has suspended sales of American eagle gold coins and is refusing orders from dealers , two coin and bullion dealers confirmed Thursday .
The mint 's suspension of gold coin sales follows its tight rationing of sales of silver eagle coins , begun in May , when sales to the public were terminated and sales to the mint 's 13 authorized dealers were tightly limited .
Word of the mint 's suspension of gold coin sales came from the American Precious Metals Exchange in Edmond , Oklahoma , ( http://apmexdealer.blogspot.com/2008/08/news-alert-us-mint-suspends-sale...) and from Centennial Precious Metals in Denver , Colorado .
The suspension is overwhelming evidence that the futures contract price of gold on the commodities exchanges is substantially below the physical market price and that , indeed , the commodities exchanges are being used as GATA long has maintained -- as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals , currency , and bond markets .
Michael Kosares , proprietor of Centennial Precious Metals and host of its Internet bulletin board , the USAGold Forum ( http://www.usagold.com/cpmforum/), explained Thursday :
" The U.S. Mint buys direct from the refiners , and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up , or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year .
I wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers .
The central banks are in a hunker - down mode as far as I can determine , and it's the mines that supply the refiners .
So if the mint , which buys from the refiners , is having a difficult time locating metal , what does that tell you ?
I keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber - band effect later in the year when the pre-holiday / festival season kicks off in September / October .
It may happen sooner .
One of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls Centennial Precious Metals gets from our U.S. - based Indian clientele .
Here 's a quote from my office 's report to me at the end of the day today : ' Today was a good day .
...
There must have been an Indian convention where someone was handing out USAGold business cards . '
That may give you a clue as to thinking in India proper and probably the rest of the Asian rim . "
That is , through their agents the bullion banks the Western central banks , desperate to prop up a corrupt and totteringt financial system , have put gold so much on sale that even the U.S.
Mint can't find any now .
The price reported from the commodities markets is a fiction -- a scary one , perhaps , but a fiction no less .
You can strike a blow at the market riggers who are defrauding the world -- just buy a little real metal .
The dealers listed at the bottom right of this dispatch will be glad to help you do it .

With NASA 'sannouncementthat aerospace firm Lockheed Martin will build its shuttle successor Orion , the agency is forging ahead with a test flight plan for the rockets to launchthose future vehicles spaceward .
NASA istargeting April 2009 to test the first stage of its
Ares I rocket , afive - segment booster evolved from its four - segment solid rocket boosters ( SRBs ) used to launch space shuttles into orbit .
The rocketwill launch astronaut crews into orbit to either dockat the International Space Station ( ISS ) or press onward to the Moon - though the latter would require rendezvous with a lunarlander and EarthDeparture Stage launched by the planned heavy - lift AresV rocket .
" It 's aproof of concept that we 're going to take this solid rocket motor that wasdesigned for the shuttle , and we 're going to use it in this new application , " said Jeff Hanley , manager of NASA 's Constellation program .
" We 're going to lookat the dynamics at the separations between the first stage and a facsimile ofthe upper stage . "
Known as Ares I - 1 , the first stage test will launch an inert - but instrumented - secondstage and mock - Orion vehicle to suborbital heights to evaluate the SRB 's thrust and roll control .
" We don' twant to put [ cryogenic propellant ] in this vehicle , " said Steven Cook , NASA 'sexploration launch projects manager , of the simulated second stage for Ares I - 1 .
" We just want to get it as dynamically similar as possible to the actual launchvehicle . "
NASA hasbudgeted about $ 300 million for the initial Ares I - 1 tests , which include the April 2009 launch from Pad 39B here at the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) , as wellas a second space shot six months later if necessary , Hanley added .
The final , two million - pound ( 907,184 - kilogram ) rocket is expected to be able to boost a 25 - ton payload into orbit and will be hauled to the launch pad atop NASA 'sMobile Launch Platform by an existing Crawler transport .
Hanley saidthe first full - up Ares I launch is expected to lift off in June 2012 , with thefirst orbital space shot with astronauts aboard slated for September 2014 .
Thatcrewed launch , he added , would be the third of four orbital test flights .
NASA 's AresI rocket will stand about 309 feet ( 94 meters ) tall and consists of primarilyof two stages capped by the Orion crew capsule and a four - engine escape tower .
According to a NASA description , Ares I 's first stage - the SRB - derived booster - is reusable , and propels Ares I to a speed of aboutMach 6.1 and an altitude of about 200,000 feet ( 60,960 meters ) beforeseparating 2.5 - minutes into flight and falling back to Earth on parachutes .
The second stageharbors the liquid oxygen / liquid hydrogen fueled J - 2X engine , an evolution ofNASA 's Apollo - era Saturn V J - 2 motor and the never - flown J - 2S version .
It isthat upper stage that will propel the Orion crew capsule to an altitude ofabout 63 miles before separating , with the spacecraft 's service modulecompleting the trip to a 185 - mile ( 297 - kilometer ) orbit .
An interstage segment connects the Ares I - 1 first stage withits simulated upper segment - which will fall into the Atlantic Ocean afterseparating - and also holds the roll control and separation engines for thetest flight , Cook said .
During thefirst
Ares I - 1 test , the first stage is expected to burn for about 130 seconds , reach a speed of about Mach 4 and an altitude of 250,000 feet ( 76,200 meters ) , Cook said .
Like thefour - segment SRBs used in space shuttle launches , the Ares I - 1 first stage will burn a star - shaped mix of the solid propellant polybutadiene acrylonitrile ( PBAN ) , though the final mix and rocket nozzle designs have yet to bedetermined , NASA officials said .
One of the five segments comprising the Ares I - 1 first stage will also be a dummy unit , since the first full - up booster will notbe ready until later in 2009 , they added .
" We believewe 'll be able to get enough similarity to be able to anchor our models , whichis really the reason for these flight tests , " Cook said , of the decision to usethe dummy SRB segment .
ATK Thiokolhas already ground - tested a five - segment SRB during a 2003 study of boosterperformance and margins for the shuttle program .
But Thiokol officials saidthat the goals of that test were quite different than those required tocrew - rate the Ares I rocket .
" The realproof in the pudding will be in this flight , " Cook said of the Ares I - 1 test .
" And we 'll see if we need to make any changes before we go into finalproduction . "

PRINCETON , NJ --
When Americans are asked what steps should be taken to reduce gas prices , no consensus appears , but somewhat surprisingly , a majority favor imposing price controls , by a 53 % to 45 % margin .
Americans also support releasing supplies from the federal government 's strategic petroleum reserve ( 58 % ) and drilling in U.S. coastal and wilderness areas now off limits ( 57 % ) .
On the other hand , a majority oppose rationing gasoline ( 79 % ) , re-instituting the 55 mph speed limit ( 56 % ) , and suspending the federal tax on gasoline for the summer ( 52 % ) .
Oil Companies as the " Villains "
Last week , the Congress called oil company executives to testify on Capitol Hill and then berated them about surging gas prices and their companies ' record profits .
While such actions might have a positive " jawboning " effect at best , they no doubt reflect the lawmakers ' sense of Americans ' growing frustration over increasing gas prices at the pump .
Ironically , the intensity with which Americans see oil companies as " gas price villains " may be fading a little , according to opinions respondents volunteered in a new Gallup Poll , conducted May 19 - 21 .
Over the past year , the percentage of Americans blaming the oil companies for skyrocketing gas prices fell from 34 % to 20 % ; the percentage pointing to oil refinery problems fell from 16 % to 9 % ; and those attributing the increase in prices to problems in the Middle East and the Iraq war fell from 13 % to 8 % .
On the other hand , the percentage of Americans suggesting prices are increasing as a result of the economic forces of supply and demand increased from 10 % to 15 % , while 6 % now point to speculators and 4 % to the shrinking value of the dollar and the poor U.S. economy -- both new reasons not even mentioned a year ago .
More Americans also mention crude oil prices , the shortage of oil supplies , and U.S. dependency on foreign oil .
Commentary
As gas prices continue to increase , the financial hardship they create not only affects more people but also increases the severity of hardship felt by those who can least afford it .
While the continuing surge in oil and gas prices has some basis in reality because of the limited supply and the increasing demand in such emerging countries as China and India , Congress also heard testimony last week explaining some of the ways these markets are being affected , and possibly manipulated , by new financial and speculative forces .
This makes for an explosive brew in an election year .
Frustrated by political deadlock and inaction , Americans are beginning to consider some more drastic efforts to control the surge in gas prices at the pump .
For example , a majority of Americans now support drilling in U.S. coastal and wilderness areas .
But the favorable margin of 57 % to 41 % does n't seem like enough of a consensus to break the energy policy deadlock in Congress .
More significantly -- and worrisome from an economic perspective -- a majority of Americans now support instituting controls on gas prices at the pump .
While the favorable margin of 53 % to 45 % does n't presage immediate , or even eventual , political action , it does suggest that record gas prices may be reaching a tipping point where Americans are willing to have the government intervene in the marketplace with the hope of providing some significant price relief at the pump .
While price controls may seem like a simple solution , economically , they simply do n't work over time .
Right now , gas in the United States is being rationed -- and supply and demand balanced -- by price .
In fact , significant " demand destruction " is taking place as Americans are driving less .
What price controls do is artificially hold down gas prices , preventing a further decline in the demand for gas while simultaneously reducing the incentive for companies to produce more .
Economic analysis suggests that the almost inevitable result of gas price controls would be gas rationing -- and no one who knows the history of the gas lines of the 1970s wants a recurrence .
For that matter , Americans oppose the idea of gas rationing by a 79 % to 20 % margin .
While Gallup 's new poll results suggest that the link between price controls and rationing might be a good and effective argument against the imposition of price controls on gas , Americans ' dissatisfaction with record gas prices may be reaching a tipping point where emotions may well supersede logic .
That is how wage and price controls became law in the United States in the 1970s .
Unless something is done to stop the hemorrhaging at the gas pump , it seems Americans and their political representatives might end up supporting some radical government interventions in the marketplace this election year in the hope they will provide at least some short - term relief at the pump .
Survey Methods

New York attorney Ray Beckerman , an outspoken critic of the Recording Industry Association of America , has acquired the ear of thousands of federal judges nationwide .
The American Bar Association 's " Judge 's Journal " summer issue is publishing his lengthy paper , Large Recording Companies v. The Defenseless ( .pdf ) .
The publisher of the blog , Recording Industry vs The People , does an excellent job of explaining the finer legal points of the RIAA 's litigation machine .
Beckerman , who defends people sued by the RIAA , chronicles RIAA litigation start to finish – from the investigative stage , to how the RIAA acquires the name of the ISP account holder to the payment of a few thousand dollars that usually settles a lawsuit out of court .
The bulk of the article deals in highly legal matters concerning venue , jurisdiction , dismissal , discovery , confidentiality , legal fees and default judgments .
It 's a must read for anybody who has ever been on a file sharing networks like Kazaa , and a must read about an area of litigation that has ensnared more than 20,000 defendants .

Suicides always leave behind sad and tough questions .
One big one is whether those who commit suicide have faulty genes .
It turns out that although they may have normal genes , child abuse may still have left its mark on the DNA in the brains of some , new research suggests .
About 30,000 people die by suicide each year in America .
While scientists also think other factors are involved with suicide , this new finding raises the possibility that detecting or even wiping out these markings could help prevent people from killing themselves .
Brain comparison
The researchers investigated the brains of 13 men who committed suicide .
All of them had experienced child abuse .
These were compared with the brains of 11 men who died of sudden unexpected causes and had no history of child abuse .
The scientists focused on a set of genes that are the blueprints for ribosomal RNA , or rRNA .
These molecules help synthesize proteins in cells .
Protein synthesis is critical for learning , memory and the building of new connections in the brain , among other things .
The genetic sequences for the rRNA were identical in both groups of men .
However , there were differences when it came to molecules latched onto these genes .
These so - called " epigenetic markings " can bind up a gene , essentially turning it off .
In the hippocampus , a brain region key to controlling responses to stress , the researchers found the rRNA genes in suicides were " hypermethylated , " possessing far higher levels of these markings than normal .
This in turn would have reduced levels of protein synthesis .
" Protein synthesis is required for many brain functions , and subtle differences at times of distress might affect connections in the brain that normally protect us from suicidal behavior , " said researcher Moshe Szyf , an epigeneticist at McGill University in Montreal .
While genes remain unchanged throughout a person 's life save for exceptional circumstances , epigenetic markings can be influenced by the environment , especially early in life .
It is possible that after traumatic events , chemicals released by pain or strong emotion could trigger a cascade of events that change these markings in the brain , as witnessed in these suicides .
First time
Neuroscientist Yogesh Dwivedi at the University of Illinois at Chicago , who did not participate in this study , said , " This is the very first time anyone has reported that genes in the brain can be regulated by environmental factors in cases of suicide .
This is very exciting work and promises a new era of research in suicide . "
Of course , there are many other factors linked with suicide .
" The presence of mental illness plays by far the largest role in risk for suicide , in more than 90 percent of cases , " said researcher Gustavo Turecki , a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at McGill .
" And males die by suicides much more frequently than women — here in Canada , it 's about a 4 to 1 ratio .
Then you have personality traits such as impulsivity and aggression playing a role , as well as substance abuse , and recent traumatic events , and social factors such as the level of access to support services , and of course genetic factors that may increase an individual 's predisposition to suicide . "
" What 's nice about our new work is that it helps understand how the environment interacts with a person 's biology to increase the risk for suicide , " Turecki added .
Dwivedi added that while many factors can play a role in suicide , " so far you cannot directly relate any of those factors to how likely [ it is that ] a person will commit suicide .
It will be very important to see whether this epigenetic work can help answer such a question . "
Suicide tests ?
The big questions now , Szyf said , " are whether scientists could detect similar changes in blood DNA — which could lead to diagnostic tests — and whether we could design interventions to erase these differences in epigenetic markings . "
" Epigenetic marks are reversible even in adults , " Szyf told LiveScience .
In light of this preliminary research , far more brains need to be analyzed , the researchers acknowledged .
In addition to also investigating women who killed themselves , Szyf noted , it would be especially interesting to look for any brain differences among suicides who had a documented history of child abuse and others who did not .
" It would also be very interesting to look at populations with a high incidence of suicide , such as the aboriginal population in Canada , " he added .
Investigating other genes or different regions of the brain for epigenetic marks could prove vital as well .
The scientists detailed their findings in the May 6 issue of the online journal PLoS ONE .
The researchers were funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health , the Human Frontier Science Program and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research .
Singer 's metal fence has heavy impact in Marin Marin County Barbed wire from Metallica 's Hetfield blocks access to popular hiking trails

James Hetfield co-founded the influential heavy metal band Metallica and , as its chief songwriter , helped pen and perform strident songs such as " Do n't Tread on Me . "
It might as well be his anthem for property rights in Marin County .
The Marin County resident has erected a barbed - wire fence on his property near San Rafael , cutting off a fire trail that locals say has been used for at least a half - century to access treasured hiking trails along scenic ridgelines .
Hetfield 's representatives have told county officials that the metal and barbed - wire fence is a response to vandalism on the property .
Nonetheless , the decision has infuriated the bikers , hikers and equestrians who use the trail .
Some locals say it also threatens a century - old county tradition of property owners giving public access to open space .
" This is really a slap in the face to the community , " said Connie Berto , 75 , who has been using the trail since the 1960s .
" It 's atrocious .
The fence is outrageous . "
The case exemplifies a trend in Marin County : New residents are buying properties that were private ranchlands but open to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts , said Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey , a 32 - year resident of the county who said he has used the trail many times .
" As real estate values have gone up and different folks have moved into the county , there 's a different sense of property rights , " Kinsey said .
" There 's a learning curve that has to take place with new owners about the historic use of the lands , while also respecting that these are private properties . "
" In every single town , from Sausalito to Novato , these historical uses exist .
Many people consider them to be public .
But all it takes is a change of owner to make an abrupt change , depending on the attitude of the property owner . "
Messages left with Hetfield 's manager , his band 's record label ( Warner Bros. Records ) and his contractor ( Redhorse Constructors Inc. ) were not successful in getting a comment .
Supervisor Kinsey said the county has negotiated several agreements with property owners to allow access for the public .
Kinsey cited Hetfield 's neighbor George Lucas as one such example .
Hetfield bought his land in unincorporated Marin County in 1999 , according to property records .
He planned to make a 14,000 - square - foot home as well as a 6,000 - square - foot studio , which also functioned as a caretaker 's home , according to a 2002 Associated Press story .
Kinsey said only the studio has been built .
In 2002 , Hetfield made a trade with the county that was beneficial to both sides .
He traded away the right to develop 44 homes on his property , which it had been zoned for , and gave an easement for 438 1/ 2 acres to be maintained as public space by the county .
In exchange , Hetfield received the right to build his home higher on the hillside and also larger - at a time when it was difficult to get approval for a 4,000 - square - foot home , Kinsey said .
At some point , Hetfield also obtained the Luiz Ranch , which contains the fire road that is under dispute .
The Luiz family had long had an open - but ad hoc - relationship with the public .
They even installed gates that latched closed behind hikers , preventing livestock from escaping .
Kinsey said it was part of county tradition that dates at least to the 19th century allowing public access to wildlands .
Though the Luiz Ranch Fire Road had been used by the public for decades , Kinsey said it was made an official part of the county trail system in 1983 .
Still , the relationship between the property owners and the public was mostly informal .
As former ranchlands have changed hands , the county has taken steps to ensure continued public access , said Kinsey , president of the Marin County Open Space District .
Sometimes the county buys the land needing access .
In other instances , the county has worked out easements where the county builds fences , puts up signs and does a certain amount of monitoring .
In one case of a particularly worried property owner , Kinsey said the county pays a landowner an amount - less than $ 10,000 a year - for the public to walk through .
In that case , the property owner has been satisfied to the extent that Kinsey hopes to secure a permanent easement .
In the case of Hetfield 's property , Kinsey said members of the public can sue if they can prove that there was continuous and broad public access to the road before 1972 .
" If that was necessary , there was a very well - documented history of use on this trail , " he said , noting that a lawsuit is an adversarial approach that ought to be only a last resort .
" We are n't even approaching that at this time .
" It makes sense to reach out to Mr. Hetfield and encourage him to meet with us and see if we can find a solution that will work for him and the community . "
I love this reassuring advice for contributors to Mozilla projects undergoing their first code review :
Bugzilla reviewers may seem to be harsh , accidentally .
They are n’t trying to be harsh or overly critical , they ’re just pointing out what needs to be changed , which usually means they ’re pointing out what ’s wrong with the current code , instead of pointing out what ’s right with it .
Usually they do n’t have lots of extra time in their life for reviews , so they just quickly write what needs to be fixed , without spending too much time thinking about the nicest way to say it .
Sometimes they also do n’t go into long explanations .
You ’re not a terrible programmer or a bad person .
All we ’re doing is telling you what ’s preventing us from checking the code into Bugzilla ’s main codebase .
I remember the first time that I , almost accidentally , asked somebody for an opinion on my code , a few years ago .
They automatically mailed back with about thirty different suggestions , all correct , and I was mortified .
Why had I been such an idiot ?
And why were they being so cruel and rude ?
Actually , thinking back on it , I think the first time that happened was when I wrote some code for .EXE when I was 21 , and had to bear about six months of readers writing in with an endless stream of bugs .
“ Dear .EXE , I spotted yet another error in your ‘ Printing in Columns ’ program from June ” …
I now , at some level , realise that having somebody else go over your code is both humiliating and the best way to learn .
And …
You know , this post was going to be about how I thought that was true for most people , and harp on philosophically about how personal and intimate coding is , and how pair programming is fraught with psychological drama .
But , if I am honest , as I write this , I must admit that this is mostly a personal bug I ’ve had up my arse ( weird anglo - american hybrid term ) for many years , rather than a common state of humanity .
I ’ve dodged a lot of things out of terror of criticism in my life .
My stand - up career was aborted really before it got started because of an incident with a Scottish lady screaming into my face while standing on a table near the stage .
NTK ’s wilful obscurity came from , in part , a desire that people not so much be insulted , than as to be unsure what was being said about them , exactly ( more on this in a future post ) .
I generally fiddle with projects for months to protect them from even the slightest possibility of a cruel word .
In parallel with this , I ’ve noticed something happen online a lot .
Some absolute idiot turns up on the Net , and asks absolutely idiotic questions , and generally bumbles loudly to themselves while everyone notes what a clod they are and shoots them down in flames .
Then , they start adapting to the criticisms , or facing them down , or disappear entirely and re-appear later in some other guise .
Through any of these processes , they end up transformed .
Soon , they ’re handing out advice to other idiots , or explaining what was actually utterly arcane to a far wider audience , or alternatively pursuing their dumb ideas to great success .
I first noticed this with a guy on Cix , who called himself Nildram , and who was rude , and argumentative , and obtuse and the biggest pain ( among a vast community of grumpy patrician carbuncular pains , I should say ) .
At first I patted myself on my back for being quiet and sensitive and afraid to make the kind of humiliating public mistakes he made .
And then I watched him just get better and better .
I learned from his mistakes too , but at one remove .
He ended up being the guy behind Nildram Broadband , which had the reputation of being one of the more responsive and customer - friendly ISPs .
This was what prompted the note I put at the end of Life Hacks , about the value of living some part of your life in public .
If you can identify what are the valid criticisms of your code or your ideas or your writing , and who are the trolls , and which are the other people just being temporarily stupid obtuse geniuses - in - waiting , you can parlay all that valid feedback and move from fool to slightly less fool in quick time .
What I do n’t know is how to stop the anticipation of that criticism , or the excessive idiocy of some of it , stop good people from becoming better .
Today I heard of the existence of a library that is badly needed , but the person who is writing it does n’t want to release it because “ it has n’t been tested enough ” .
Release it , and it will be !
I think my biggest encouragement to those who are scared of criticism to enter the public space is that if you do n’t , the public space will be filled with people who have no fear of their failings whatsoever .
And we all know what fools they are .
Effective Concurrency column a couple of weeks earlier than usual .
You can find it here : DDJ posted the nextcolumn a couple of weeks earlier than usual .
You can find it here : “ Lock - Free Code : A False Sense of Security ” , just went live on DDJ ’s site , and also appears in the print magazine .
This is a special column in a way , because I rarely critique someone else ’s published code .
However , mere weeks ago DDJ itself published an article with fundamentally broken code that tried to show how to write a simplified lock - free queue .
I corresponded with the author , Petru Marginean , and his main reviewer , Andrei Alexandrescu , to discuss the problems , and they have patched the code somewhat and added a disclaimer to the article .
But the issues need to be addressed , and so Petru kindly let me vivisect his code in public in this column ( and the next , not yet available , which will show how to do it right ) .
From the article :
[ Lock - free code is ] hard even for experts .
It ’s easy to write lock - free code that appears to work , but it ’s very difficult to write lock - free code that is correct and performs well .
Even good magazines and refereed journals have published a substantial amount of lock - free code that was actually broken in subtle ways and needed correction .
To illustrate , let ’s dissect some peer - reviewed lock - free code that was published here in DDJ just two months ago …
Finally , here are links to previous Effective Concurrency columns ( based on the magazine print issue dates ) :
Robot uprising
As seen in : WALL.E , Terminator Salvation , Transformers , Iron Man
Terminator 's John Connor should have painted his house in stripes .
According to robots expert Dr Robert Richardson of Leeds University , the best way to survive a robot uprising is to confuse them .
Robots have vision sensors which allow them to perceive you , so if one gets hold of you , you 're stuffed , he explains .
To avoid that happening , trick them into not knowing where you are .
Their vision systems struggle with complex things .
Patterns on straight lines in different orders can confuse them , so paint your room with lots of lines ; they wo n't know what 's going on .
However , their audio and thermal sensors could be difficult to escape from .
Robots have been used in Iraq but they were controlled by humans .
A robot uprising would be different .
The main problem is robots don t have the ability to reason , says Dr Richardson .
They won t know who s a friend and who 's a foe .
If it was to happen , surround yourself with technical people ; they'd know how to exploit any kinks in the armour .
Survival chances : you 're dead
Serial killer

Want to avoid being sliced and diced by a Michael Myers type ?
The best way to escape a movie - style slash and dash death is to have lots of friends on Facebook , according to top criminologist , professor David Wilson .
" If you have power , a voice , money and friends who'll notice if you disappear , then a serial killer wo n't touch you , " he reckons .
" Movie characters who are slaughtered by a serial killer have none of those things , which is why they 're picked off first .
Plus , if they look like us , we 're going to be more sympathetic , so with the exception of American Psycho , you do n't often see prostitutes or tramps being the focus of a serial killer . "
And Wilson , author of Hunting Evil : Inside The Ipswich Murders , says that once a serial killer has his night - vision goggles set on you , there 's not much you can do to stop him making a suit from your skin .
" Once they 're into a killing cycle , you wo n't know what 's going to happen , " he says .
" ' Act ' serial killers like Michael Myers do it quickly but ' process ' killers like Hannibal Lecter do it slowly .
Pleading for your life is what they want to hear so it 's only going to delay the inevitable . "
Survival chances : none
Alien invasions

Batten down the hatches and prepare for war if Aliens invade .
According to sci- fi author and theorist Darrell Bain , if alien earth intruders do arrive , they wo n't be playing nice .
" The chances of an alien invasion in our lifetime are very slim , but possible , " he admits .
" There is undoubtedly other life out there .
And if they do invade , they 're most likely going to be nasty .
It takes a competitive nature to devise space flight , especially space flight to other planets . "
And once they arrive , Darrell warns it will take more than Mel Gibson and a bottle of Volvic to send them packing .
" Mankind 's chances of survival against a hostile invasion are slim , " he says .
" But the more our technology progresses , the better our chances will be .
Our world is divided into nations competing against each other which will go against a unified defence , but on our side is our war - like nature . "
And for a chance of surviving a close encounter of any kind , Darrell has three pieces of advice .
" I 'm sure we 'd defend ourselves from a hostile attack every damn way we could by trying every weapon in our arsenal and then go on to devise others according to the nature of the aliens .
But if happened tomorrow , you should hide , prepare for guerrilla warfare or join the military . "
Survival chances : zilch
Car chase
As seen in : The Bourne Ultimatum , The Quantum Of Solace , Speed Racer , Vantage Point , Death Proof ; Harold And Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay ;
Whether you 're driving an Aston Martin or a Nissan Micra , the only way you 're going to win in a car chase is if you 've got good technique , according to British stuntman Terry Grant .
Terry , whose team of drivers were used by the James Bond producers for the forthcoming Quantum Of Solace , says it 's skill , not speed , that will shake off a pursuer .
" Being in a car chase is like a game of chess : do n't do anything rash , keep a cool head and you 'll come out on top , " he says .
" Speed is important but not as much as technique .
If you have a more powerful car , that will help if you 're going straight line .
If you have technique you can get away from someone driving a better car .
" A car chase is a battle , so you can slow them down , block them in , or trick them into crashing or giving you space .
If you 're doing the chasing and coming to a bend , accelerate before you get to the bend and nip in front of them . "
Terry says that where heroes like Jason Bourne go right and their assailants go wrong is by being observant .
" Be in control ; it 's all about your emotions , " he says .
" Do n't look at the end of your bonnet .
There are various things you can do to escape somebody if you know what 's coming up on the road ahead .
" If you 're being chased then aim for a motorway where you can put your foot down .
Or head for somewhere that 's not going to be clogged up by a lot of other cars .
Unless you 're out nicking cars and regularly being chased by police , the average driver probably would n't do well in a car chase ; 99 % will get caught or crash . "
Survival chances : poor
Interrogation
As seen in : Casino Royale , Jumper , Rendition , Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay
It would take more than Sharon Stone uncrossing her legs to stop former British Army intelligence operative Drew McAdam from getting the information he wants .
But McAdam says that what information you give up depends on who 's questioning you .
" Your survival depends on the interrogator , " he says .
" If they 're not bound by the Geneva Convention , like Bond 's captors in Casino Royale , you 're screwed .
They will do anything to get you to talk .
But if the interrogator is bound by rules then to beat him , decide what you can say and do n't expand on it at all , ever . "
McAdam says that interrogators are trained to spot signs of weakness .
" Most are trained in body language , so watch what you 're doing with your hands as they are the most expressive part of you , " he says .
" If you are hiding your palms , you 're lying through your teeth .
When you start showing them , you 're opening up .
Keep your body language closed : arms crossed , legs crossed .
Do n't fidget , keep your eyes straight ahead and be prepared for verbal sucker punches .
" The golden rule is to say , ' I 'm sorry , I ca n't answer that ' in the hope that person will get pissed off and interrogate someone else .
But if your interrogator is hostile , you stand no chance . "
Survival chances : only if you play ball
Held hostage
As seen in : Rambo , 10,000BC , Gone Baby Gone , The Hostage , The Negotiator , John Q , The Cottage
Annoy the guy who 's taken you hostage , and chances are you wo n't make it to the end credits .
And that 's also the case in real life , according to Jerry Garrett of the Texas Association Of Hostage Negotiators .
He 's trained negotiators around the world in the art of persuading hostage takers to set their victims free .
" Hostage situations are typically violent ; you should try to stay calm , " explains Jerry .
" It 's difficult but do n't become part of the problem .
Comply with the hostage takers ' demands and stay optimistic .
If they put you on the phone to the negotiator , give as much information as safely possible .
Avoid challenging or berating the taker - he 's under a great deal of pressure . "
And the rules are the same if you 're caught up in a bank raid .
" Hostage situations involving a botched robbery may lead to some opportunity of conversation but again , do n't become part of the problem .
If the hostage taker wants to talk , best to listen and not attempt to be their friend .
" And only escape if it is clear you can do it without injury .
But less than 5 % of hostage situations involve strangers - most are with people you know .
" Most hostage films are far - fetched ; there has n't been a film that properly sums up what we do .
And we 're not excited about teaching our techniques to the bad guys through movies .
Actual negotiations are really not that glamorous . "
Survival chances : good

The Schapelle Corby Nightmare
CLICK HERE TO LEARN HOW AND WHY AN INNOCENT SCHAPELLE
WAS BETRAYED BY HER OWN GOVERNMENT
It was meant to be a holiday : a two - week break to a tropical paradise to celebrate a sister 's birthday .
But for Schapelle Corby it ended up a never ending nightmare .
Arrested at Denpasar airport in 2004 after marijuana was found in her board bag , she had become the victim of every traveler 's darkest fear .
The drugs had been placed in her bag after she 'd checked it in and she was forced to face the consequences of someone else 's crime in a country where the penalties for drug smuggling are barbaric .
Her trial became a major news story , as it was glaringly obvious that the evidence she pleaded to be considered was being ignored , and thorough investigation she begged for was being shrugged off .
She was sentenced to a shocking 20 years in an Indonesian jail .
Her appeals were dismissed equally as lightly , with the end of the judicial process being reached in March 2008 .
Today , she remains in that squalid cell , as she will for countless years unless something is done .
She will miss the best years of her life , never have kids , never see them play .... the list is endless .
Despair and misery does n't even begin to describe it .
Whilst you are reading this , whilst you are sleeping , whilst you are travelling to work , or perhaps playing sport or watching TV ... tomorrow , next week , next year .... remember where Schapelle is .
She desperately needs you : she needs you to act for her , to speak out for her .
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
There is a significant amount of information about this shocking case on the internet .
Please do take the trouble to research , to understand how desperate this situation is .
Read our Introduction , then check out the Legal Assessment of the many breaches of Schapelle 's human and legal rights .
Also see the Schapelle Corby Facebook Group for further information and current developments .
Or perhaps you can simply view our own Short Video for a good introductory overview .
Then there is her book : yes , she wrote a book in that cell ( and paid heavily for it ) .
It was first published in Australia last year and is now available in the US and Europe : Schapelle 's Book At Amazon .
It is truly a traumatic read .
HOW YOU CAN HELP SCHAPELLE
There are a number of ways in which you can help Schapelle .
We have listed many of these on THIS PAGE
However , what if you are not based in Australia , as most of us are n't ?
Yes , of course you can still send packages to Shapelle , or make a donation .... but you can do more .
Tell your friends , colleagues and family about this .
Post links to this and the other Schapelle sites on forums , message boards , and social network sites .
And , IMPORTANTLY , contact the authorities .
Perhaps write to the Australian Embassy in your country : explain how you feel , and urge them NOT to forget her ... to prioritize her and use top level diplomacy as a matter of urgency ( link to AUSTRALIAN EMBASSIES ) .
These may sound like small things , but they truly are EVERYTHING to Schapelle .
YOU have to become her voice , because she has had hers taken away , along with her life .

Your physical fitness is more important than your weight in protecting your health , according to a new study conducted by researchers at the University of South Carolina and published in the Researchers followed 2,600 people over the age of 59 for 12 years , monitoring their physical fitness , obesity and mortality .
Participants were ranked for fitness based on how long they could walk on a treadmill as the incline increased .
Measures of obesity taken included body mass index , waist circumference and body fat percentage .
Participants were divided into fifths based on how well they scored on the treadmill test .
Those in the lowest fifth were four times more likely to die during the study period as those in the top fifth .
" Being fit provides protection against mortality in these men and women 60 and older , whether they 're normal weight , overweight or obese , " said researcher Stephen Blair .
Even a small difference in fitness translated into a large difference in mortality -- even when compared only with the next highest group , those in the lowest fitness group were still twice as likely to die .
Blair said this showed that overweight people should not be discouraged from exercising , even if they are out of shape and can only manage a little at first .
"
If you 're overweight or obese and you 're sedentary and unfit and you start taking three 10 - minute walks a day and you do that at least five days a week , you 're not going to lose an enormous amount of weight , " Blair said .
" You 're going to still be heavy .
But you 're going to be much healthier if you do that .
" Blair noted that it is still important to maintain a healthy weight and eat a good diet , particularly one high in fruits , vegetables and whole grains .
" But what happens all too often is we focus nearly exclusively on obesity and forget the activity and fitness part . "

College Football Quote of the Week
HOME
Pointing the way to a peaceful end for the tumultuous presidential primary campaign , some key supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton said Sunday that they accepted a new finish line in the race for delegates , a threshold Barack Obama could reach as soon as this week .
Obama aides said they expected him to surpass the 2,118 needed delegates after the final Democratic balloting finished Tuesday in South Dakota and Montana , and as more superdelegates backed the Illinois senator .
Moreover , a number of Clinton backers signaled Sunday that they were wary of the kind of protracted fight that some of her aides said they might wage in the coming months .
“ It would be most beneficial if we resolved this nomination sooner rather than later , ” said U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida , a high - profile superdelegate who backs Clinton .
“ The more time we have to get through a general - election period and the more time we have to prepare in advance of the convention , the better . ”

Some of Clinton ’s closest advisors want the New York senator to challenge the party ’s unusual decision Saturday to shift four of Clinton ’s Michigan delegates to Obama in an attempt to reflect how voters might have cast ballots and to allocate Michigan ’s uncommitted delegates to Obama , even though his name did not appear on the ballot in the state .
Even if Clinton won those delegates in a challenge , it would be unlikely to alter the outcome .
“ She ’ll do the right thing for America , and I do n’t think we ’re going to fight this at the convention , ” said Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell , a top Clinton supporter and party superdelegate , speaking on CBS .
“ Because even were we to win it , unless it ’s going to change enough delegates for Sen .
Clinton to get the nomination , then it would be a fight that would have no purpose . ”
Alice Huffman , a member of the rules panel and a superdelegate committed to Clinton , said she would not support an appeal if Obama had clearly won the delegate fight .
Advertisement
“ What ’s the point for a challenge , if a challenge does n’t change the status of anything ? ” asked Huffman , the president of the California branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People .
Such sentiments signaled that the Democratic Party might have vaulted a major hurdle in its quest to move beyond the competitive primary season and lay the groundwork for the fall campaign against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain .
That achievement came Saturday when the party ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee agreed to seat the disqualified Florida and Michigan delegations , but to halve their votes as punishment for holding their primaries early .
Clinton and her top aides conceded nothing Sunday , and even used their own mathematical formula to declare her the winner of the popular vote .
But she may begin feeling intense pressure from within her camp to stand down , should Obama cross the delegate threshold for victory .
“ I do n’t think anybody ’s going to have much tolerance ” for a convention fight , said Democratic strategist Bill Carrick , who is neutral in this race .
“ The big rationale for the Clinton campaign to continue among insiders and superdelegates was that they were going to get a big pickup of delegates from Florida and Michigan .
There was no big pickup . ”

The events Saturday had seemed to portend a more combative course -- with Clinton loyalists openly jeering members of the rules committee and vowing to take her cause to the floor of the party ’s national nominating convention this summer in Denver .
That is exactly the nightmare scenario that party strategists believe could doom their hopes by further antagonizing key constituencies such as African Americans , women and working - class whites .
The question of Florida and Michigan has hung over the campaign for months .
When Clinton fell behind Obama in the delegate count , she began to argue that the states should be fully counted .
Clinton had hoped that the party would not only restore the state ’s delegations but would allocate delegates based on her massive victories , perhaps even denying Obama any Michigan delegates because he had pulled his name from the ballot .
That , Clinton aides believed , would have helped pull her close enough to Obama that she could convince party superdelegates to hand her the nomination .

Saturday ’s ruling dashed those hopes .
Clinton picked up just 24 more pledged delegates than Obama from the two states .
Even with Clinton ’s decisive win in Puerto Rico , Obama is now within 47 delegates of victory .
Clinton needs 202.5 .
A top Obama advisor , former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) , said Sunday on NBC that the campaign expected superdelegates to come forward for Obama in the coming days .
Referring to the 2,118 goal , Daschle added , “ you ’re going to see , at the end of this week , a definitive moment . . . where he will have surpassed that number . ”
Obama , addressing supporters in South Dakota , said he had called Clinton to congratulate her on her Puerto Rico win -- but he also looked ahead to her role as a surrogate for him in the fall .
Advertisement
“ She ’s going to be a great asset when we go into November , ” he said .
Even as they agreed on the finish line , Clinton and her campaign showed no outward signs Sunday of acknowledging that she would not reach it .
In fact , they predicted that she would get there once superdelegates weighed in .
Clinton declared in a Puerto Rico victory speech that she was winning the popular vote and “ there can be no doubt ” that she was favored by more Americans -- although her calculations of results are widely disputed .
“ The decision will fall on the shoulders of those leaders in our party empowered by the rules to vote at the Democratic convention , ” she said , then directly addressed uncommitted superdelegates : “ I do not envy the decision you must make , but a decision has to be made . ”
Advertisement
Her aides continued to criticize the party ’s rules committee .
One top aide , Harold M. Ickes , a member of the panel , accused his colleagues of “ hijacking ” Clinton ’s Michigan ’s votes .
Even Wasserman Schultz , despite her hope for a swift resolution , called it a “ mistake ” for the rules committee to slash half the votes of her state ’s delegation .
She said she had heard from many upset constituents and predicted the party could have trouble revving up Florida activists in the fall .
Still , some Clinton backers said Sunday that Clinton might lose some avowed supporters if Obama clinched the nomination and yet she fought on .
Garry Shay , a rules committee member and Clinton superdelegate , said he would stick with her if she finished within 100 delegates of Obama .
Advertisement
But within 10 to 20 days , he added , “ I ’m going to reassess based upon the political reality . ”
Donna Brazile , an undeclared superdelegate and a rules committee member , hinted Sunday on ABC that within 72 hours she and many of her cohorts would declare loyalty to Obama “ because there ’s no question that the pressure is on to end this nomination fight . ”
“ The battle ’s over , ” she said .
“ We know the victor . ”
Even Ickes , legendary in the party for relishing a junkyard - dog brawl , acknowledged in a television interview that the whole race could end this week .
Advertisement
“ It ’ll be over when one candidate secures the number for the nomination , ” Ickes told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
When host Tim Russert asked if that could happen on Wednesday , Ickes said : “ It could .
Anything could happen . ”

Scientists have developed and built a thumbnail sized microscope that magnifies without lenses .
They said it is one of the biggest innovations since the microscope was invented 500 years ago .
They believe it could be mass produced for less than £ 5 and , powered by sunlight , could help doctors in the developing world diagnose conditions such as malaria , or help in the detection of water - borne parasites .
The " microscopic microscope " has the same magnifying power as a top - quality device , yet is far easier to carry around in the field , said Changhuie Yang , an assistant professor at the California Institute of Technology , where it was built .

" The whole thing is truly compact , it could be put in a cell phone , and it can use just sunlight for illumination , which makes it very appealing for Third World applications , " he said .
" Our research has been motivated by the fact that microscopes have been around since the 16th century , yet their basic design has undergone very little change and has proven prohibitively expensive to miniaturise .
Our new design operates on a different principle and allows us to do away with lenses and bulky optical elements . "

There are lots of great progressive politicians , but when the P - I ’s Gregory Roberts asked me why the national netroots had so enthusiastically embraced Darcy Burner , I replied : “ She ’s one of us .
Deep down she ’s a geek . ”
Burner ’s spokesman Sandeep Kaushik hates that quote ( as he reminded me last night ) , but that ’s because he does n’t come from the tech world where the word has become such a term of endearment that it frequently pops up in flattering self - descriptions on online dating services .
I do come from that world — or at least , my life has strangely meandered through it — and while like Darcy , I may not fit the usual geek stereotype , I ’m enough of one to instantly know the meaning of the code on Darcy ’s t- shirt .
“ < / war > ” … that ’s XML for “ end war . ”
And the fact that this was the shirt that Darcy was wearing at 7 AM when she and her family fled their burning house , tells us in the netroots all we need to know about Darcy Burner .
We ’ve asked a lot of Darcy , and I ’ve never known a politician who has worked harder to deliver .
It was a grueling race in 2006 , and after briefly pausing to digest her narrow loss , she got right back to work .
But now she needs to take a few days off to tend to her family and herself … to literally get her house in order .
And that ’s where we all can help .
Darcy needs to raise about $ 150,000 this July to keep pace with Dave Reichert and her own 2006 fundraising , and every day she takes off makes her campaign budget that much harder to hit .
That ’s about $ 5,000 a day .
And that ’s why I ’m joining with bloggers nationwide to ask our readers to contribute what they can today , to help give Darcy the breathing room she needs to tend to her own affairs without worrying about neglecting her campaign .
Every $ 5,000 increment we raise represents a day that Darcy wo n’t have to dedicate to her own fundraising efforts .
It is a gift more precious than money ; it is a gift of time .
Darcy has selflessly requested that you donate money to your local animal shelter or Firefighter ’s Benevolent Society , but she needs our help as well .
So please give Darcy the time to get her house in order , so that come November , she can help us get our House in order too .
Give Darcy some time :
UPDATE :
So far we ’ve raised over $ 25,000 $ 35,000 $ 50,000 $ 65,000 $ 85,000 this morning today via Act Blue , nationwide .
That ’s roughly equal to five seven ten thirteen seventeen days of July fundraising .
Please keep up the good work , and give today .
Despite how badly GM wants to dump the Hummer , a looming global recession ( and of course high oil prices ) may be putting the kibosh on that plan .
General Motors ( GM ) had been in preliminary talks with automakers across Asia ( including those in India and Russia ) regarding the sale of its Hummer division .
But now Chinese SUV maker Hunan Changfeng has broken off talks with GM and no longer has any interest in purchasing the gas - guzzler .
Their remarks do not bode well for GM .
According to a Reuters source , Changfeng chose not to proceed because " the Hummer is way too expensive for the Chinese military and demand from civilian buyers is not big enough to justify a purchase , especially with oil prices running near an all - time high . "
The market leader in the Chinese auto industry , SAIC Motors , and the No. 3 player , Dongfeng , also have said they have little interest in the Hummer .
Considering that China is about the only global market left still purchasing Hummers , these develoments are not encouraging for GM 's planned sale .
Now it 's up to a Russian billionaire , an Indian automaker ( Mahindra and Mahindra ) or a Turkish private equity fund to come through .

Sauna has long been a cottage industry in Finland and the entire Northern hemisphere , with Scandinavians and Russians claiming to have used saunas for cleansing and relaxation for over 2,500 years .
Saunas are the new Prius , with various studies claiming a positive influence on general health .
A recent study ( 1 ) conducted in 41 healthy volunteers and presented in Dermatology says that regular sauna also has a positive effect on skin physiology .
Well , duh , you may think , every sauna aficionado has said that all along .
True , but it was never scientifically proven until now .
Kowatzki , et al at the University of Jena say they have demonstrated that regular sauna leads to a more stable epidermal barrier function , an increase in stratum corneum hydration and faster recovery of both elevated water loss and skin pH .
Even better , they say heart beat rate and ionic concentration in sweat as well as epidermal blood perfusion was like any other sort of body training - the more you do it , the more your skin and heart seem to benefit .
Sauna - the sport
Like anything that can be beneficial in moderation , some people will make it an extreme sport .
See you in Finland !
If you are n't aware , the Sauna World Championships are being held this weekend in Heinola , Finland .
At 110 degrees Celsius ( 230 Fahrenheit ) you probably would n't last long .
Even the winners in the mens and womens divisions will only last around 12 and 10 minutes , respectively .
And they 're pros .
The good news is you are n't stuck sitting around for 8 days without knowing who 's going to win , like some other sporting event this weekend , namely that thing called The Olympics .
And in Heinola you are sure to win if you bet on someone with a difficult name to pronounce to emerge victorious .
A 230 degree Fahrenheit trip to Hell too much for you ?
A nicer hot spring might do the trick .
Here are 5 terrific locations to take a relaxing dip without all the sweaty large men staring you down .
Top 5 locations to take a nice hot bath
Icaria in Greece .
By its name you can guess that the name ( and the heat ) is related to the wayward son of Daedalus .
The hot springs here have been used for healing goodness since 2,000 BC .
BONUS : They are also known for being the most radioactive springs in Europe .
Aguas Calientes in Peru , with varying springs of different temperatures and altitudes , is delightful this time of year .
BONUS : Visit Machu Picchu while you are there .
Pretend to sacrifice your sister for fun .
Like monkeys ?
Japan ’s Jigokudani Monkey Park in Nagana Prefecture has ' snow monkeys '( Macaque Fuscata ) on display taking a dip in their own special place .
No , you can't bathe with them .
Human springs are just down the way though , so you can do your own macaquing around .
Feel like making an Olympics protest without getting clubbed by police ?
Yangbajing in Tibet has terrific hot springs at 14,000 feet in the air .
Enrage the Communist Chinese and get some relaxation in at the same time .
Finally , check out Geysir in the Haukadalur valley , Iceland .
It 's the oldest geyser in the world , keeping you hot since 1294 .
So stay fit and learn a history fact at the same time .
Ca n't swing a plane ticket to those ideal locations ?
Here 's how to make your own sauna , according to expert Finnish specifications .
Facing
West is all you really need to know .

Aug. 6 , 2008 -- Smoking pot may help relieve pain in patients with HIV - related neuropathy , a form of nerve damage that leads to burning and tingling sensations , which can be hard to treat with traditional medications .
" Neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in HIV patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management , " researcher Ronald J. Ellis , MD , PhD , associate professor of neurosciences at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine , says in a news release .
Ellis and colleagues compared medical marijuana to a placebo ( fake drug ) in 28 patients with HIV - related neuropathic pain that was not adequately controlled by pain medications , including opioids .
The team randomly assigned each participant to smoke either medical marijuana ( cannabis ) or a cigarette that resembled marijuana but did not contain the drug 's active chemical , THC .
The National Institute on Drug Abuse supplied both products .
The participants smoked the material four times a day for five straight days , then abstained for two weeks , and then followed the same experiment again .
Each person also continued to take prescribed painkillers during the trial .
Smoking the pot provided much greater pain relief than smoking the placebo .
Forty - six percent of participants had clinically meaningful pain relief with pot compared to 18 % with placebo .
Pain relief varied from " strong " to " mild to moderate . "
The researchers say that medical marijuana significantly reduces HIV - related neuropathic pain when added to the patient 's already - prescribed pain management regimen and may be an " effective option for pain relief " in those whose pain is not controlled with current medications .
The findings , which appear online in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology , add to a growing body of evidence that shows that medical marijuana can be a potent painkiller for patients with neuropathy .
However , the substance can have a negative impact on certain mental skills .
Ellis ' team also warns that long - term smoking of cannabis can cause lung problems .
Alternative delivery methods are approved in Great Britain and Canada and are being considered by the U.S. , according to background information in the journal article .
Code signing is a technology for associating a cryptographically secure signature with your application ’s executable code .
This signature makes it possible for the operating system or other services to make confident assumptions of authenticity based on the unique signature which you ’ve supplied .
Thus , code signing is a technology which is rather useless in itself , but which can be utilized by other services to achieve specific goals .
Starting with Mac OS X 10.5 , Apple built some features into the operating system which take advantage of code signing , including some features which make accessing secure items from the keychain less of a nuisance .
In particular , consider the scenario in which an application asks permission from the user to access items in the keychain .
Once the user gives permission to “ always allow , ” the application can thereafter obtain a secret value from the keychain without user intervention .
This is very handy for internet passwords , etc .
But once the application changes , e.g. a new version comes out , the user must be asked again to permit the access .
This is to ensure that malicious code has n’t been snuck into the application .
But with code signing , the users permission can be expanded to cover any release of the application that was signed by the same certificate .
The idea is that if users approve one version of an application , then they ’ll likely approve the next version , as long as they are guaranteed it came from the same developer .
I have so far not signed any of my publicly released applications .
I may do so soon , because these conveniences would remove one more tedious task for users who are updating to the newest versions of my applications .
But the user who has it worst of all is me myself , as I ’m constantly revising the application , leading the system to request new approvals every time my changed application accesses the keychain .
To get around these constant requests , I finally decided to at take advantage of code signing during the development phase .
What does that mean ?
It means I ’m committing to signing my own code for my own internal purposes , but not yet committing to signing publicly shipped products .
From Zero To Code Signed In 300 Seconds
With Xcode 3.0 , code signing is easy , but takes a little work to set up .
Since I just went through the somewhat tedious task myself , I thought I ’d share with you how it ’s done easily and predictably :
Establish a self - signing certificate .
Apple offers simple instructions for how to do this with the Apple - provided Keychain Access utility .
When you create the certificate , you ’ll be asked to give it a name .
Name it whatever you like , for instance “ My Cert ” .
The certificate is stored in your keychain , where it can be easily referenced by name .
Add a custom build phase to Xcode .
Xcode will not automatically sign your code , but it ’s easy enough to add a build phase that does .
Select your target in Xcode and choose “ Project -> New Build Phase -> New Run Script Build Phase ” from the main menu .
Paste in the following script : if [ [ $ {CONFIGURATION} == " Debug " ] ] then # -f means force to re-sign even if already signed codesign -f -s " My Cert " " $ {BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR} /$ { WRAPPER_NAME} / " fi Observe that the “ My Cert ” text can obviously be changed to whatever you ended up naming your certificate .
Also notice that because of my hesitation to ship a code signed application yet , I am restricting the action to only the Debug build configuration .
If you ’re ready to go public , just remove the test and the code signing will happen for all build configurations .
There ’s no step 3 !
Enjoy .
Constantly approving those keychain approval dialogs is one of the things that I just fell into the habit of tediously doing .
Thanks to Apple ’s code signing efforts in 10.5 , there ’s no longer any reason for me to do that .
Hopefully if you use the keychain in your own development products , you ’ll find this productivity upgrade useful as well .
Daffodils
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills ,
When all at once I saw a crowd ,
A host of golden daffodils ,
Beside the lake , beneath the trees
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze .
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way ,
They stretched in never - ending line
Along the margin of a bay :
Ten thousand saw I at a glance
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance .
The waves beside them danced , but they
Out - did the sparkling waves in glee :-
A Poet could not but be gay
In such a jocund company !
I gazed - and gazed - but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought .
For oft , when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood ,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude ;
And then my heart with pleasure fills
And dances with the daffodils .
Coração
Ó vida porque passas tão de repente ?
Tem calma e vai devagar ,
Deixa amadurecer e viver tua gente
Porque lá no céu já há pouco lugar !
Queremos ver , sentir e provar
Todas as maravilhas da nossa Terra
Por isso , deixa - nos , ouvir e escutar
P'ra ver se a gente não erra !
É certo que não somos fieis
A este bem precioso - " a vida " ,
Exageramos e abusamos de todas as leis ,
E depois lá se vai , toda perdida !
O ser " Homem " mexe e modifica
Tudo aquilo que lhe convém
E depois se glorifica
De todo o bem material que já tem !
Aug 17 , 2008 | The True Olympians
Update : The Danes won the gold !
Here ’s a story to remember :
Qingdao , China –
The 49er skiff is a dinghy boat race that has officially been recognized as an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
On Sunday , the weather was particularly horrendous – high winds and torrential rain made the seas very choppy , but despite it all , ten teams raced to the finish ..
er.. wave .
But the Danes were in a bit of a problem – the mast on their skiff snapped shortly before the race began , so they went back to port and rushed to borrow another , and the Croats were gracious enough to pass theirs along – “ Here , well , since we ’re not racing today , why not give ours to the jolly Danes , eh , what do you think ? ” .
Det er hvad der sker !
With boats capsizing left and right in the waves , the Danes , despite finishing seventh in the race , stood on top for overall rankings .
They would ’ve gotten their gold had it not been for complaints rendered against them – not by their competitors , mind you , but by the race measurement committee – that they could not win using another nationalities ’ boat .
“ Those Croats were mighty nice , eh ? ”
And so while Jonas Warrer and Martin Kirketerp Ibsen of team Denmark may ( or may not ) get their gold medals , Petar Cupac ( left ) and Pavle Kostov ( right ) from team Croatia may very well just deserve one of their own for their great show of sportsmanship .

The vi program is a powerful text editor .
William Joy , co-founder of Sun Microsystems , originally wrote the vi editor in 1976 for an early version of Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) UNIX .
Rumor has it that Bill wrote vi in a weekend , but he says the claim is untrue .
The program was named after the visual command in the extended line editor for UNIX — ex , for short .
The vi editor is an extremely powerful editor , with several features that many do n't know even exist .
Vi is a modal editor , meaning that the program produces different results when other settings are placed on the program .
There are three distinct modes in vi : command , insert ( or input ) , and line .
When operating in insert mode , text is written to a temporary file being edited ; while in normal mode , the same keystrokes provoke commands embedded in the editor .
To enter insert mode , simply press the I key ; to exit to command mode , press Escape .
( I explain line mode in further detail later in this article . )
For example , in insert mode , if a you type the string 10dd , that string would be written to the temporary file , as shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 .
Typing dd in insert mode
However , if you were in command mode , the string 10dd would delete the 10 lines from the temporary file starting from where the cursor is currently placed , as shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 .
Typing dd in command mode
Another example is cursor movement .
In command mode , the keys H , J , K , and L move the cursor left , down , up , and right , respectively , as shown in Figure 3 .
In insert mode , these letters are displayed , instead .
Figure 3 . Cursor movement in vi
Typically , UNIX users either use vi or another editor called Editor Macros ( Emacs ) written by Richard Stallman in 1976 .
Many choose vi , however , because it 's lightweight , starts faster , and uses less memory .
What is Vim ?
Vim , or Vi Improved , is an extended version of vi written by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 .
The editor was originally designed for the Amiga computer but soon spread through UNIX in 1992 .
Like vi , Vim is based on command mode and insert mode as a text user interface ( TUI ) — shown in Figure 4 .
Figure 4 . The Vim TUI
However , it does offer a graphical user interface ( GUI ) appropriately named gVim — shown in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 . The Vim GUI
Vim commands
Internal commands within Vim are similar to those within the vi editor .
Table 1 provides the cursor movement commands within Vim .
Table 1 .
Vim commands for effecting cursor movement
Command Action h Move cursor left j , Plus Sign (+ ) , Enter , or Return Move cursor down k , Minus Sign (-)
Move cursor up l Move cursor right }
Move cursor to the end of the current paragraph {
Move cursor to the beginning of the current paragraph )
Move cursor to the end of the current sentence ( Move cursor to the beginning of the current sentence ^
Move to the first non-blank character in the current line $ Move to the end of the current line 0 ( zero ) Move to the beginning of the current line w or W Move to the beginning of the next word b or B Move to the beginning of the previous word e
Move to the end of the next word H Move to the first line of the screen M
Move to the middle line of the screen L Move to the last line of the screen G
Move to the end of the file gg Move to the beginning of the file :n
Move to line n
Table 2 shows the Vim commands for deleting text .
Table 2 .
Vim commands for deleting text
Command Action d Delete region selected dd Delete the entire current line 10dd Delete 10 lines , starting with the current line dw Delete words from the current position onward db Delete words from the left of the current cursor position backwards dl Delete the character at the current cursor position dh Delete the character to the left of the current cursor position d0 ( zero )
Delete text from the current cursor position to the beginning of the line D | d$ Delete the entire line starting at the current cursor position x
Delete the character at the cursor 's current position X Delete the character before the cursor 's current position
Table 3 provides several other useful Vim commands .
Table 3 . Common Vim commands
Command Action ih Enter insert mode and insert at the current cursor position I Enter insert mode and insert at the beginning of the current line a Enter insert mode and append after the cursor A Enter insert mode and append to the end of the current line c Change the region selected C Change the entire line starting at the cursor 's current position o Create a new blank line beneath the line in which the cursor is currently located and move the cursor to the beginning of the new blank line O Create a new blank line above the line in which the cursor is currently located and move the cursor to the beginning of the new blank line r Replace a single character at the cursor 's current position R Replace multiple characters starting at the cursor 's current position and ending when exiting insert mode < Esc >
Exit insert or visual mode > or < Tab >
Indent to the right the region selected < Indent to the left the region selected v Start highlighting characters V Start highlighting entire lines yy Yank / Copy the current line into memory 10yy Yank / Copy 10 lines starting with the current line into memory p
Put text yanked or deleted ; if characters were yanked ( yw dw , or D ) , put the characters after the cursor 's current position .
If lines were yanked , put the lines below the cursor 's current line .
P Same as p , but place characters before the cursor 's current position or lines above the cursor 's current line u
Undo the last change < Ctrl > R Redo /< pattern >
Search for the next pattern found , and place the cursor at the beginning of the pattern found ?< pattern >
Search for the previous pattern found , and place the cursor at the beginning of the pattern found n Repeat the last search N Repeat the last search , but reverse the search direction !< cmd > Execute < cmd > outside the Vim session
Line mode
Although command and insert modes are widely used , line mode is equally powerful but sometimes not fully understood or used .
Line mode enters into a line editor , allowing you to process commands on single or multiple lines .
Considering that vi was named after the ex editor , it 's only fitting that line mode puts you into an ex editor .
To enter line mode , from command mode , simply type a colon ( : ) .
The cursor then moves to the lower - left corner of the window .
When you resume typing , all text appears after the colon at the bottom of the window .
When you click Enter , the line mode command is evaluated and executed .
If you decide not to execute the line entered in line mode , click Escape to return to command mode .
When working with the line mode of the editor , keep two styles of commands in mind .
First , when you type a command , vi or Vim executes the command as is .
If the command executed pertains to modifying data , the current line will be the target .
However , with the second method , you can supply line numbers to process the specified lines .
To enter lines , after the colon , type the line number or range of lines to process , separating the start and end range with a comma ( , ) .
For example , to process only line 23 , the command would begin with :23 .
If you want to modify lines 2319 through 3819 , you would type :2319,3819 .
To process a command from a starting position of line 45 to the end of the file , replace the last line argument with a dollar sign ( $ ) — that is , : 45 , $ .
The following commands are only the beginning of what you can execute in line mode :
:w < file name > :
Write the file to disk .
If an argument is supplied , the editor attempts to write the data to < file name > .
Note :
If you supply an argument and < file name > exists , the editor will not overwrite the existing file 's data .
Write the file to disk .
If an argument is supplied , the editor attempts to write the data to < file name >.
:w! < file name > :
Write the file to disk and overwrite any data in the file .
Write the file to disk and overwrite any data in the file .
:< x > , <y > w < file name > :
Write lines < x > through < y > to < file name > .
Write lines < x > through < y > to < file name > .
:q : Attempt to exit the editor without saving .
Note :
If data has been modified , the editor will not exit until the file has been saved or you exit without saving .
Attempt to exit the editor without saving .
:q ! : Exit the editor without attempting to write the file to disk .
Exit the editor without attempting to write the file to disk .
:n : If editing multiple files , begin editing the next file in the edit list .
If editing multiple files , begin editing the next file in the edit list .
:e < file name > : Edit < file name >.
Edit < file name >.
:e# :
If editing two files , switch between files .
If editing two files , switch between files .
:s/<str1>/<str2>/ : Replace the first occurrence of < str1 > with < str2 > on the current line .
Replace the first occurrence of < str1 > with < str2 > on the current line .
:1 , $ s/< str1>/< str2>/g : Starting at line 1 and continuing throughout the file , replace < str1 > with < str2 > globally .
Starting at line 1 and continuing throughout the file , replace < str1 > with < str2 > globally .
:r < file name > : Read < file name > into the current editor session .
Read < file name > into the current editor session .
:< x >, <y > d : Delete lines < x > through <y >.
Delete lines < x > through < y >. :< x >, <y > y :
Yank lines < x > through <y >.
Differences between vi and Vim
Although vi and Vim do have the same look and feel , they definitely have differences .
The following are just a few differences between these two powerful text editors :
vimscript : Using the internal scripting language vimscript , Vim allows complex scripts to add extended functionality to the editor .
In addition to vimscript , Vim supports Perl , Python , Ruby , Tcl , and other languages .

vimdiff : A useful command called vimdiff is bundled with the Vim package .
Using vimdiff , you can display multiple files next to each other , similar to sdiff , as shown in Figure 6 .

Editing a compressed file :
To conserve space on a system , administrators often compress log files or other large files .
It never fails : A file is compressed , and then someone asks you , " Hey , can you take a look at this log from two months ago ? "
Rather than decompressing the file , and then editing it with vi , Vim can edit the compressed file .
Vim can handle editing files compressed with bzip2 , gzip , and zip .

Editing an archived file : Vim also has the ability to edit files concatenated by tar .
When editing a . tar file , Vim displays a handy screen allowing you to select which file in the archive you want to edit , as shown in Figure 7 .
When you finish editing the file , simply save and exit the file normally ( : wq ) , and Vim returns to the display , allowing you to select another file to edit in the archive , or you can quit from the selection window ( :q ) .
Figure 7 .
Selecting which file to edit in an archived file using Vim
In the example shown in Figure 8 , four ASCII text files were archived using the tar command , and then Vim was used to select the second file in the archive to edit .
Figure 8 .

Vim also has the ability to edit files concatenated by .

When you finish editing the file , simply save and exit the file normally ( ) , and Vim returns to the display , allowing you to select another file to edit in the archive , or you can quit from the selection window ( ) .
Split windows :
Rather than switching back and forth from window to window while editing multiple files , gVim allows you to open several windows from existing files as well as create new files on the fly , as Figure 9 shows .

Rather than switching back and forth from window to window while editing multiple files , gVim allows you to open several windows from existing files as well as create new files on the fly , as Figure 9 shows .
Syntax highlights :
Debugging someone 's shell script or other code that the editor did n't write originally can feel like an overwhelming task .
Thankfully , Vim has helped alleviate some of the headaches that come with editing someone else 's code .
Using Vim , you can color - coad blocks of code , making debugging much easier in shell scripts as well as in other programming languages , as Figure 10 shows .
Figure 10 .

Last cursor position :
When editing a file , it 's sometimes necessary to exit the file and perform other tasks .
But when you 're ready to return to the file , you 've forgotten where you left off !
Not to worry : Vim remembers the last cursor position when exiting a file .
This becomes extremely helpful when modifying files that are several thousands of lines long .

Multiple undo/redo operations :
In the past , vi only allowed you to undo your last change when editing a file .
This was a great start , but it needed to be increased .
Sometimes , when writing scripts or other code , what may seem like a good idea turns out not to be the best way to handle an issue , so you must be able to back out of the last 10 changes you 've made in the file .
Vim allows you to do just this .

Vim allows you to do just this .
Visual mode : Vim allows for certain blocks of text to be selected using " visual " mode .
Using this mode , you can select any amount of text within the file being edited , and then use a single command to affect the highlighted text .
For example , if the middle of a paragraph of text must be removed , you simply type v to enter visual mode , move the cursor through the text to be modified , then type d to delete the highlighted text .
How do I get Vim ?
Now that you 've seen a few of the enhancements and differences between vi and Vim , you 're probably saying , " I want Vim !
Where do I get it ? "
Good news : Vim has been ported to several different operating systems .
Here are just a few of the platforms to which Vim has been ported :
Amiga
AIX
BSD
Cygwin
IBM OS /2 ®
Linux
Apple Mac OS and Mac OS X
Microsoft® MS - DOS ®
Microsoft Windows ® 95 though Windows Vista®
Microsoft Windows CE
OpenVMS
Vim on Windows
So , you saw that Vim is available for Windows in the previous section , and now you 're saying , " I can use Vim on Windows ?
I want that ! "
You 're in luck !
Simply download the latest version ( currently version 7.1 ) of Vim , ported to Windows , from the Vim Web site .
The easiest method is to download the self - installing executable file , execute it , and follow the steps .
When installed , you can right - click a file , click Edit with Vim ( as shown in Figure 11 below , and violà !
you 're now editing the file in Vim in Windows !
Figure 11 .
Editing a file with Vim in Windows
Now that you 've installed Vim on your Windows computer , you can enjoy the genius behind Vim and forget about all the other text editors in Windows .
Conclusion
The vi editor started to pave the way for text editors in UNIX , and Vim has continued along this path .
After reading this article , my hope is that you 've learned some new things about the Vim editor , how to use its many features to help make your life easier , and appreciate how such a simple concept as an editor has proven a stable and robust application in the UNIX world and now most other operating systems .
I trust that if you have n't used Vim much , after learning the ins and outs of the editor , you 'll agree that no other editor can compare .

It is now 19 months since I speculated that the Sun was then close to the minimum in its approximately 11 - year cycle of activity .
In fact , solar activity , as measured by ( among other factors ) the number of sunspots , has continued at a low ebb and solar experts at a recent international workshop have suggested that the minimum may not have occurred until March this year .
This can only be confirmed after several further months of observation .
Certainly , the Sun 's disc has been pristine and spotless over many days of late .
Such was the state last Friday when observers in Russia and China were able to admire the outer regions of the Sun 's atmosphere , the corona , during a total eclipse .
Shaped largely by magnetic field lines , this can spill out chaotically in all directions around the disc when spots are plentiful , as during " our " eclipse in 1999 .
Last Friday , though , the corona stretched mainly to the east and west of the disc , taking on the much more quiescent form typical near solar minimum .
The experts offer two predictions as to how solar activity will progress .
One is that there will be a rapid climb to a maximum in October 2011 , perhaps at a level to rival that of 2001 .
The second envisages a slower climb to a lower peak in August 2012 .
Either way , satellites in low orbit are about to experience greater atmospheric drag , and reduced lifetimes , as the increasing solar activity energises and expands the outer layers of the Earth 's atmosphere .
Astronomers have discovered nearly a dozen new stellar rivers — strings of moving stars — over the disk of the Milky Way .
The streams , which seem to represent smaller galaxies torn apart by our own , come from scans of the velocities of about a quarter million stars in our galaxy made for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
Prior scans had turned up a few narrow rivers such as one extending from the star cluster NGC 5466 , 76,000 light - years away , that covers 45 degrees across the northern sky .
The 11 new entries form a tangle that 's harder to separate .
Researchers believe that the streams arose separately when neighboring star clusters known as dwarf galaxies were drawn apart like taffy by the Milky Way 's larger gravitational field .
They say the new findings , reported at a conference this week , could be used to improve models of galaxies colliding with and cannibalizing one another .
It was government intervention in the financial markets , which is now supposed to save the situation , that created the problem in the first place .
Laws and regulations pressured lending institutions to lend to people that they were not lending to , given the economic realities .
The Community Reinvestment
Act forced them to lend in places where they did not want to send their money , and where neither they nor the politicians wanted to walk .
Now that this whole situation has blown up in everybody 's face , the government intervention that brought on this disaster in is supposed to save the day .
Politics is largely the process of taking credit and putting the blame on others — regardless of what the facts may be .
Politicians get away with this to the extent that we gullibly accept their words and look to them as political messiahs .

An article in The Economist headlined “ The Craze for Teaching Chinese May Be a Misguided Fad ” inspired debate amongst all kinds of people , showing up everywhere from Omniglot to a Chinese law blog .
The debate has two basic camps : those who think everyone in the world speaks English , and those who believe China ’s about to hit its peak and become the next superpower .
With the Internet allowing cross-cultural communication on one hand , and blue - shirted men trying to plant Best Buy franchises all over the world on the other , people are slowly but surely getting nervous that there is not yet a lingua franca to fall back on .
But before weighing in on the English / Chinese debate , I have to ask a question .
Whatever happened to Esperanto ?
I think I first heard of Esperanto as a joke , probably on Saturday Night Live or a similar show .
When I saw it on the sidebar of Wikipedia , right between “ English ” and “ Español , ” I realized it was a real language .
I ’m assuming that most people reading this have about as much education on Esperanto as I did right then , so here ’s some background .
It was created by a man named L. L. Zamenhof , and has about 1000 native speakers .
Esperanto - advocating websites claim it to be designed for ease of learning by everyone in the world .
It uses the Roman alphabet with various accents , and features conjugations most similar to Spanish .
The name is close to the Spanish word for “ hoping , ” which is “ esperando . ”
It looks like Spanish , but with a lot of clumsy k’s mixed in .
( I ’m not a big fan of the letter K , probably from seeing it tackily replacing c’s for my whole life .
Krispy Kreme , etc. )
It is obviously influenced by Roman languages , and from the small amount of Russian that I had to learn to get through A Clockwork Orange , there were some Eastern European elements .
After reading enough background to figure out the basic structure , I ca n’t see how it would be easier than Spanish itself .
You may not know it from being bored during high school Spanish class , but it is one of the simplest , clearest languages possible .
Every letter is always pronounced the same ( with the exception of g and c , and some regional differences ) .
Verb conjugations are constant and methodical .
The pronunciation is relatively staccato , meaning the beginning and ending of words are easy to hear and clearly emphasized , unlike French and Portuguese .
I wo n’t bore you with any more details , but it seems unnecessary to create a derivation of Spanish that is n’t apparently simpler and is n’t already spoken by about 400 million people .
I ’m also skeptical about how much enthusiasm the collective speakers of the world can whip up for a language that has no real history .
Esperanto was created in the 1880s , and has n’t nodded its head far into any culture .
Knowing that a language was the medium for the works of greats like Dante , Freud , or Jean Paul Sartre has probably been the impetus for thousands of people to choose one over the other in school .
So am I implying that Spanish be the lingua franca ?
Not necessarily .
Many languages would be simpler to teach than both English and Chinese .
Korean , for example , has a painstakingly designed phonetic system of syllables written to look like the shape of the mouth when speaking them .
It is said that most people of any language can learn the Korean writing system in about three hours .
Catalan , spoken in Spain , is a blend of Spanish , Portuguese , Italian and French ( that is a somewhat crude definition of Catalan , but not incorrect ) that would be simple for anyone with a background in Romance languages to learn .
But ultimately , I realize that the language that will catch on the most is the one belonging to the most culturally domineering nation .
It ’s possible that Chinese could surpass English as a lingua franca .
The argument that English is easier than Chinese is probably only true to those who already speak English .
Sure Chinese uses four different tones ( I am referring to Mandarin , not Cantonese , which has more ) and uses an ideographic writing system , but the tones make Chinese very musical , and thus its phrases are easier to memorize .
I ’ve studied both Chinese and Japanese , and discovered that ideograms are much easier to read than foreign alphabets .
I could never just look at a Japanese word and know what it meant without reading through it , but all Chinese words read that way , because their meaning is hinted at by the elements of the character .
English , on the other hand , has such inconsistent spelling that some linguists have called it partially ideographic as well , meaning that a word is learned by memorizing how it looks , not necessarily how it ’s read or pronounced .
( Like “ laughter . ” )
Verb conjugations use systems from many different linguistic backgrounds , and are hard to predict without routine memorization .
( Eat / ate , love / loved . )
So how likely is it that your future children are going to be hyped - up to learn Chinese ?
Despite all the linguistic jargon I ’ve shoved at you , money is probably the best indicator .
Nobody in my high school Spanish class really learned much Spanish .
When we learned the Spanish equivalent of I / Me , “ Yo / Me , ” everyone grabbed onto the familiar word “ me ” and ditched “ Yo ” for the rest of the term .
( From then on , everyone was saying things like , “ me ate cereal for breakfast . ” )
It ’s not that they were dim , they just could n’t foresee knowing Spanish as benefitting them in the future , and did n’t want to exert mental energy to do so .
Kids in my Chinese class are a different story .
Let ’s just say most are business majors , and they do n’t mind hollowing out a bit of space in their long - term memories to fit in some phrases that could add another zero to their future income .
Sorry , Esperanto , unless a territory of native speakers finds a gold mine , I doubt people will be saying “ kiel vi fartas ” ( their unfortunate phrase for “ how are you doing ? ” ) to you .
China Launches Its First Chicken Manure - Biogas Plant
August 7th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
In the race to implement new energy sources , farms have an advantage : lots of manure .
A large chicken farm north of Beijing is taking advantage of this fact by using its chicken manure to generate power and heat .
And this is n’t just a small - time farm — the 3 million chickens on the farm produce 220 tons of manure and 170 tons of wastewater each day .
The Deqingyuan Chicken Farm Waste Utilization Plant , which is replacing a coal - fired plant , will reduce CO2 emissions by 95,000 tons a year .
It will also provide 14,600 MWh of electricity each year .
The plant will feature an anaerobic digester to treat waste material , which will produce biogas that will then power 2 GE Jenbacher gas engines .
Heat generated from the process will be used in the waste fermentation process and to warm the farm in the winter .
But the project wo n’t just benefit the farm — it will also help reduce electricity shortages in the region .
While any facility containing 3 million chickens probably does n’t treat its animal residents very well , at least this one sets an example for other farms looking to become more self - sufficient — and energy self - sufficiency should always be welcome in a growing country like China .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In August 1924 , the small nation of Georgia , occupied by Soviet Russia since 1921 , rose up against Soviet rule .
On Sept. 16 , 1924 , The Times of London reported on an appeal by the president of the Georgian Republic to the League of Nations .
While “ sympathetic reference to his country ’s efforts was made ” in the Assembly , the Times said , “ it is realized that the League is incapable of rendering material aid , and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon Soviet Russia . ”
“ Unlikely ” was an understatement .
Georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991 .
Today , the Vladimir Putins and Hu Jintaos and Mahmoud Ahmadinejads of the world  to say nothing of their junior counterparts in places like Sudan , Zimbabwe , Burma and North Korea  are no more likely than were Soviet leaders in 1924 to be swayed by “ moral influence . ”
Dictators are n’t moved by the claims of justice unarmed ; aggressors are n’t intimidated by diplomacy absent the credible threat of force ; fanatics are n’t deterred by the disapproval of men of moderation or refinement .
The good news is that today we do n’t face threats of the magnitude of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union .
Each of those regimes combined ruthless internal control , a willingness to engage in external aggression , and fervent adherence to an extreme ideology .
Today these elements do n’t coexist in one place .
Russia is aggressive , China despotic and Iran messianic  but none is as dangerous as the 20th - century totalitarian states .
The further good news is that 2008 has been , in one respect , an auspicious year for freedom and democracy .
In Iraq , we and our Iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists in what they have called the central front of their struggle .
This joint victory has the potential to weaken the jihadist impulse throughout the Middle East .

The projector can be used from a distance of up to 5 feet ( 150 cm ) and will project an image about 32 x 40 inches ( 80 cm x 100 cm ) .
This is said to be an “ actual use photo ” :
Chinavision says that the Tri-Band Touchscreen Mobile Phone with Projector will be “ available soon ” .
It ’s probably not an Apple or Nokia approval that they ’re waiting for .
Reader comment : Chinavasion says ,
Due to realizing that this cool gadget phone is actually * tri band * not dual band , the title changed and it can now be found here .
PS .
it is not a knock - off of anything – it is an original “ outrageous ” Chinese gadget mashup , aka Chinavasion ’s speciality 😉

Now THIS is what I ’m talking about ( transcript follows ) :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oLLZawdWA0]
Here is the text of what Obama said :
But the fact of the matter is that John McCain is offering more of the same .
He said a while back that he thought that we had made great progress economically during the years that George Bush has been in office .
Now , that raised some eyebrows .
Great progress economically .
Who is he talking to ?
And it turns out that you get a sense of who he ’s talking to because some of you saw the Saddleback Forum with Rick Warren .
He was asked , well , who do you consider rich ?
And he thought about it for a second , I do n’t know .
Maybe if you make $ 5 million .
$ 5 million , then you ’re rich .
Which means , I guess , if you ’re only making $ 3 million a year then you ’re middle class .
I guess that ’s what he meant .
His top economic adviser said the other day that Americans should stop complaining ; they ’ve become a nation of whiners .
That all these economic problems everybody is talking about is just a mental recession .
And if you would just change your mind , everything would be okay .
Somebody ’s been laid off , their plant ’s closed and gone to Mexico or China , change your mind .
It ’s all good .
Then , yesterday , he was asked again , what do you think about the economy ?
He says , Well , I think the economy is fundamentally strong ; said the economy is fundamentally strong .
Now , this puzzled me .
I was confused as to what he meant .
But then there was another interview – this is yesterday , same day – where somebody asked John McCain , how many houses do you have ?
And he said , I ’m not sure .
I ’ll have to check with my staff .
True quote .
I ’m not sure .
I ’ll have to check with my staff .
So they asked his staff , and he said , at least four .
At least four .
Now , think about that .
I guess if you think that being rich means you ’ve got to make $ 5 million and if you do n’t know how many houses you have , then it ’s not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong .
But if you ’re like me , and you ’ve got one house , or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they do n’t lose their home , you might have a different perspective .
And by the way , the answer is John McCain has seven homes .
So there ’s just a fundamental gap of understanding between John McCain ’s world and what people are going through every single day here in America .
And you do n’t have to be – you do n’t have to be a Nobel Prize Laureate economist .
You just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we ca n’t afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that George Bush has put in place .

1.1 FreeBSD 's make
Make : to fit , intend , or destine by or as if by creating www.m-v.com
A common and essential utility for Unix software development , make is a nifty bookkeeping utility that keeps track of all file dependencies .
Managing such project details as dependencies can be very time consuming and may even stall development .
Dependencies tracking can become particularly difficult when multiple developers collaborate on a project .
Indeed , the proper use of make can help speed up application development and also increase productivity .
Originally designed to manage the maintenance of application builds , you can use make to perform a variety of additional tasks by creating a sequence of Unix shell commands based on a target 's dependencies .
These dependencies can be defined in any number of ways - including source files to compile , needed libraries , shell commands and other targets .
Make has a litany of flavors , including GNU make and System V make .
Not all features discussed below are present in every version of make , and the one to use will depend on your personal taste .
We 'll focus on the make that ships with FreeBSD ( known also as bmake or pmake ) , epecially how to use it to compile and upgrade a FreeBSD system , known as make world .
While we focus on FreeBSD make , everything discussed here will work across the various BSD distributions .
We 'll cover basic file layout and the syntax of a Makefile first .
If that 's too basic for you , skip ahead to the working example at the end of the chapter .
( Note that the code samples inline are meant to illustrate our discussion of make targets and dependencies ; they 're not usually working code . )
Of course , as with any utility , first consult the man page to get a formal overview , details , and a review of make 's available command line options .
And , as with any utility , the best way to learn make is to use it .
Create some small source files ( in any language ) and then try some of the examples listed .
We hope that by the end of this chapter you 'll understand not just make 's syntactical rules , but also how it works .
1.2 Makefile Layout
Generally , you use make by specifying a targets and its dependencies by giving it a Makefile to read .
Once run , make searches for a file named Makefile or makefile , in that order .
This Makefile is commonly put in the root directory for a project ; to specify an alternative Makefile , enter it on the command line with the -f ( filename ) option .
make -f OtherMakefile
1.3 Syntax
The structure of a Makefile includes four basic lines , all of which can be extended by adding a ' \ ' character to the end and continuing on the next line ( similar to shell programming ) .
Comments begin with a pound sign ' # ' , and run until the ending newline .
########################################
# Simple Makefile with comment example # ########################################
# when run , it will just echo hello all : echo " hello "
bash $ make bash $ make all bash $ make < target name >
1.4 Targets
You can specify targets in any number of ways , but the most common ways are as object files or a project name .
Project names should not contain white space or punctuation marks , though this is only a convention ; some white space and punctuation marks are tolerated .
The name must start at the beginning of a new line and end with a single colon ( : ) , double colon ( : : ) , or an exclamation point ( ! ) .
myprog : < some commands to the compile myprog targer > another : : < some commands to the compile another target > sample !
< some commands to the compile sample target >
Follow these target names with the needed dependencies including names , variables or other targets .
If you have many dependencies , use a ' \ ' character followed by a newline to separate them .
All dependencies must be defined within the Makefile or exist as external files , or make wo n't know how to complete that dependency .
Some examples are :
all : driver.cpp network_class.cpp file_io_class.cpp network_libs.cpp file_io_libs.cpp all : myprog.o myprog.o:
In the above example all and myprog .o are the targets to make .
Notice that myprog.o is both a target and a dependency .
Make will first go to myprog.o and execute its commands , then return to ' all ' and execute its commands .
This sequence is make 's basic foundation .
By convention the all : target is the highest of your targets , and is meant to be the root from which make will branch out to find what it needs to complete the all : target .
The all : target is not a requirement , though .
If it 's not there , make will simply chose the first target listed , and only act on that one unless you specify a target on the command line .
We suggest you use the all : target in projects that have a central application to be maintained or built ; this is a popular convention for targets and will help you avoid mistakes and unnecessary tasks .
The sequence of the dependencies shown in the above example is a simple one .
Here 's an example of a more complex and flexible set of sequenced dependencies , sans the commands for the specific targets :
all : myprog . o lib lib : lex lex : myprog.o : app.h
Notice in this example , the all : target has 2 dependencies : myprog.o and lib .
Both are targets and make will first go to compile myprog .o.
When make evaluates myprog.o , there 's a dependency on app.h .
Although app.h is not defined in this makefile , the file app.h is a header file located in the current directory .
Once the commands for myprog.o are completed , make will return to all : , then process the next dependency , in this case lib .
The dependency lib itself has a dependency , lex , so make will first complete lex : before it returns to complete lib .
NOTE : As you can see , these dependencies can be very long and deeply nested .
If you have a large Makefile , be sure to keep it well organized , with your targets in order .
1.5 Evaluation Rules
Dependencies are evaluated by strict rules which depend on how the target names end .
Once make decides that the rules are met make will create that specific target by execution of the associated commands ( i.e. compile that target ) .
For example , the advantage of using the single colon : is more fine grained control over which targets would need to be compiled .
That is , you could specify if a specific target file needed to be re-compiled every time or only if its source files are out - dated .
The rules are based on the ending characters , as below .
If the target name ends with a single colon ( :) that target will be created by the following two rules :
If the target does not exist , as with the target named all : in our example above , make will create it .
If any of the source files have a more recent timestamp than the current target .
In our examples above the myprog . o would be made if the apps.h or the myprog .c file had a more recent timestamp .
This is easy to force by using the touch command touch myprog.
c
If the target name ends with a double colon ( : :) it will be created by the following three rules .
If any of the source files have timestamps that are more recent than the current target .
The target does not exist .
The target has no source files associated with it .
When targets end with bang (! ) the target will always be created once make has created all of its needed dependencies .
You can only use wildcard expressions for targets , ? , * , and [ ] as part of the final component of the target or source and only to describe an existing file .
For example :
myprog.[oc ]
Also , expressions using curly braces , {} , may not be needed to describe an existing file .
For example :
myprog.[oc ]
Also , expressions using curly braces , {} , may not be needed to describe an existing file .
As in this example :
{ mypgog , test}.o # the expression above would match myprog . o test .o only
One final note : variable expansions are done in directory order and not alphabetically , as they would be in shell expansions .
For example , if you have some type of dependency for your targets based on alphabetical order then the following expansion might not be correct :
{dprog , aprog , bprog , cprog}.cpp
1.6 Variables
Make 's ability to use variable is of singular importance .
For example , if you have a source file called a.c and for some reason you need to change its name to b.c .
Normally , you would then have to re-write every instance of a.c in your make file to b.c .
However if you used the following
MYSRC = a.c
Then you would only need to update that single line with the new name , as in :
MYSRC = b.c
You save time , hence meeting the first role of make : Project management .
Variables are referenced by using $ ( < varliable name > ) or a single $ but this method is not widely used and therefore not recommended .
$ ( GCC ) = /usr/local/bin/gcc
There are four different classes of variables for make , which we list below in the order that they are searched .
( Make 's search continues until it reaches the first instance of a value . )
Local values :
These are values assigned to a specific target .
Command line : Command line variables are given to make on the command line .
Global : Global variables are assigned inside the Makefile or any included Makefiles .
You 'll see these most frequently in a Makefile .
Environment : Environment variables are set outside the Makefile in the shell that is running make .
These variable can be defined inside the Makefile with the following five operators :
The equals sign " = " is the most commonly used operator , and similar to those in shell .
The values are assigned directly to the variable .
For example : VAR = < value >
The plus equals sign " += " is the append assignment , where the variable is assigned by appending to the current value .
For example : VAR += < value to append >
The question mark equals sign " ?= " is a conditional assignment and will only assign the value if it not yet set .
Conditionals are helpful in pre-appending values to a string value .
For exampe : VAR ?= < value if unset >
The colon equals sign " := " is the expansion assignment .
The value will be expanded before assigning it to the value given ; the expansion is normally done when the value is referenced .
For example : VAR := < value to expand >
The bang equals sign " != " is a shell command assignment .
The value will be assigned the result of the command , after it is expanded and sent to the shell for execution .
If the result has new lines they will be replaced with spaces .
For example : VAR != < shell command to execute >
NOTE : Some variables are defined by an external system wide Makefile ( found in /etc/make.conf or /etc/defaults/make.conf ) .
If you run into problems trying to set a variable from the environment , check these system wide file settings .
A full example is :
#####################
#
Example make file #
#####################
CURDIR != pwd CFLAGS ?= -g CFLAGS += - Wall - O2 all : echo $ CFLAGS ####################### bash$ CFLAGS= " -g - Wall " make
In the example above , the CURDIR is set to the result from the shell command pwd .
( Note that the backtick command ( i.e. `` ) for these assignments is not needed . )
The CFLAGS value first will be set to -g only if it 's unset , and then it will be append - Wall - O2 regardless of its current value .
1.7 Commands
Make is nothing without commands , and it is only by passing commands to make that it can perform its tasks .
Make can only execute the commands and evaluate its success if the commands are successful , based on the shell 's exit status evaluation .
So , if the command fails and the shell returns an error , then make will quit with an error and stop at that point .
Make can be thought of as just another command - it can't actually interact with other commands other than to run them .
Commands must be associated with a target , and any target can have multiple commands .
For example :
# example for an all - install target all - install : $ ( CC ) $ ( CFLAGS ) $ ( MYSRC ) cp $ ( MYPROG ) $ ( INSTALL_DIR ) echo " Finished the build and install "
Each command must follow a target on a new line and must have a tab before the command line starts , as shown above .
For the most part , commands can be anything that is a valid shell command , and commands often include variables .
For example :
CPP = - g++ CFLAGS = - Wall - O2 myprog.o $ ( CPP ) $ ( CFLAGS ) -c myprog.c
The example below tells make to compile myprog .c using the given values .
These commands can be longer than one line and can be written to perform other tasks .
This is important because compilers can take a number of command line options , environment settings , defines and so on , like so :
CLFAGS = $ ( LINK_FLAGS ) $ ( LINK_LIBS ) $ ( OTHER_LIBS ) \ $ ( OPTIMIZER_FLAGS ) $ ( DEFINES ) $ ( NO_KERNEL ) $ ( OBJS ) \ $ ( CPU_TYPE_FLAGS ) $ ( USE_MY_MALLOC ) $ ( UDEFINES ) \ $ ( SRC_FILE ) $ ( OTHER_SRC_FILES )
The example below tells make to remove all the object files , core files and the application , then to move the log file over , which is handy .
CPP = - g++ CFLAGS = - Wall - O2 APP = myapp DATE != date +%m%d%y_%H_%M LOG = debug myprog.o : $ ( CPP ) $ ( CFLAGS ) - c myprog.c rm -f *.o *. core $ ( APP ) mv $ ( LOG ) .log $ ( LOG ) _$( DATE ) .log clean rm -f *.o *. core $ ( APP ) mv $ ( LOG ) .log $ ( LOG ) _$( DATE ) .log
However if there 's no log file , then make will error out and quit .
To avoid this , precede the command with a " - " sign .
By adding a minus sign before a command you tell make to execute that command and to ignore errors .
( Make will still print the error though . )
Thus , make will continue even if a command has an error after execution .
For example :
clean - rm -f *.o *.core $ ( APP ) - mv $ ( LOG ) .log $ ( LOG ) _$( DATE ) .log
This would cause make to ignore the rm and mv errors if they occured .
You can also tell make to suppress the output of commands like the ' echo ' shell command .
Echo tells make to print out the entire command including the echo statement and then to run the command and print the string to the screen :
echo $ ( SOME_DEFINED_STRING )
To avoid this place an at symbol " @ " in front of the echo command , which tells make to print out only the string , like so :
@echo $ ( SOME_DEFINED_STRING )
Both the " - " and " @ " operators can be used with variables as well as commands as strings , but make sure you properly reference the variable command .
Here 's how to use the @ operator for commands :
ECHO = echo MESSAGE = " Print this message " msg : : @$( ECHO ) $ ( MESSAGE )
1.8 Conditional Statements ( # if , #ifndef etc.. )
If you 're familiar with C and C++ , you already know about conditional pre-processor directives .
The versatile make has a similar feature .
The conditional statements let you choose which parts of the Makefile are processed .
These conditional statements can be nested up to a depth of 30 and can be placed anywhere inside the Makefile .
Each statement must be prefixed with a period (. ) and the conditional block must end with a .endif .
The conditional statements allow for logical operators , logical AND ' && ' , logical OR ' || ' and the entire statement can be negated with the ' !' operator .
The '!' operator has the highest precedence , followed by logical AND and lastly logical OR .
Parentheses can be used to specify the order of precedence .
Relational operators are also available '>' , '>=' , ' <' , '< =' , ' == ' and '!=' .
These operators can be used on decimal and hexadecimal values .
For strings the ' == ' , and '!= ' operators can be used .
If no operator is given , the value is compared with 0 .
In the example below , if the VER variable has been assigned then the conditions are tested .
Note that if the VER variable is not assigned then the last .else clause will evaluate to true and assign TAG the value of 2.4_stable .
. if $ ( VER ) >= 2.4 TAG = 2.4_current .elif $ ( VER ) == 2.3 TAG = 2.3 _release .else TAG = 2.4_stable .endif
Conditional statements can test variables or can be used with the following function style expressions .
Some of these have short hand notations .
We list the short hand notations for compatibility issues .
The long hand is much more implicit and widely understood , but takes longer to type .
When using short hand notations , you do n't need the parentheses .
Also , the short hand can be mixed with if / else statements along with other short hand statements :
make ( < arg > ) short hand [ .ifmake , .ifnmake , .elifmake , .elifnmake ]
. if make ( debug ) CFLAGS += - g .elif make ( production ) CFLAGS += - O2 .endif
In the example above , make will take a target name as its argument .
The value will be true if the target was given on the command line or if its the default target to make .
The example below will assign the values to the CFLAGS according to the rules of the make ( ) expression :
Here 's the same code in short hand notation :
. ifmake debug CFLAGS += -g .elifmake production CFLAGS += - O2 .endif
This will take a target name as its argument .
The value will be true only if the target has been defined .
There is n't a short hand notation for this expression .
For example :
. if target ( debug ) FILES += $ ( DEBUG_FILES ) .endif
The example above will append to the FILES variable if the debug target returns true .
empty ( < arg > )
This will take a variable for its argument and allows for possible modifiers .
The value is true when the variable expansion would result in an empty string .
There is no short hand for this expression .
Also note that you do n't need to reference the value when using the expression , VAR not $ ( VAR ) .
For example :
. if empty ( CFLAGS ) CFLAGS = - Wall -g .endif
The following example will take a variable for its argument .
The value is true only if the variable has been defined :
.if defined ( OS_VER ) .if $ ( OS_VER ) == 4.4 DIRS += /usr/local/4.4-STABLE_src .endif .else DIRS += /usr/src .endif
Here 's the short hand notation :
.ifdef OS_VER . if $ ( OS_VER ) == 4.4 DIRS += /usr/local/4.4-STABLE_src . endif .else OS_VER = 3.2 DIRS += /usr/src .endif
As you can see , make allows for both nested conditionals and the define expression .
Unlike C , indentations of if statements and variable assignments are not allowed .
For visual clarity of your conditional blocks , you can have white space after the period , and before the if .
Here 's an example :
. if $ ( DEBUG ) == 1 $ ( CFLAGS ) = - g . ifndef $ ( DEBUG_FLAGS ) $ ( FLAGS ) = $ ( DEBUG_FLAGS ) .
endif .endif
The example below shows how to use exists and how to add the conditional statements to a target .
If the tmp directory exists then make will run the - rm tmp / *.o commands .
As you can see in this example , the .if statements will only be evaluated in the clean target ; the commands run must follow the normal command syntax .
clean : - rm -f *.o *. core .if exists ( tmp ) - rm tmp /*.o .endif
1.9 System Make Files , Templates , and the .include Directive
One great feature of C is the manifest pre-processor directive , better know as the #include .
This feature has been implemented in make , too .
The difference is , if you want to include another Makefile then you should include it at the bottom and not at the top like in C , because variables are assigned in order .
Makefiles in Makefiles can get confusing , the basic syntax to include a Makefile is simple .
Note that the period (. ) must precede the word include .
The basic syntax is :
. include file name
To specify a Makefile located in the system make directory , use angle brackets :
.include < file name >
To specify files located in the current directory or one specified with the - I command line option , use double quotes , similar to the C #include :
.include " file name "
In the following example , if the project.mk has the variable CFLAGS defined , it will be overwritten by the newer declaration .
This can cause a bit of trouble when including more than one Makefile .
.include " ../project.mk "
CFLAGS = -g
FreeBSD systems have a number of system Makefiles that can be included , with routines for various tasks .
On most FreeBSD systems you 'll find them in the /usr / share / mk / directory .
However , there is a /etc / defaults / make .conf which can be overwritten by /etc/ make.conf .
( See man make . conf for more details . )
This is a brief listing of a few that are commonly used .
If you are going to heavy kernel programming or applications porting , use and take advantage of Makefile .
They 're in the form of bsd .< type >.mk , where the < type > stands for what it is used for .
bsd.dep.mk :
This is a very helpfull include file that will handle Makefile dependencies
bsd.port.mk :
This is included and used when building ports of applications .
The good thing about using the .include directive is that you can break your project Makefile in pieces .
For example , your a project could have a main make file that is included into all the other sub - make files .
This main make file could contain the compiler variable along with its needed flags .
That way each make file would not need to specify the compiler or needed flags , and simply reference the named compiler .
These commonly used pieces can then be used in other Makefile and modification to these routines will then be common across all Makefile .
1.10 Advanced Options
Advanced make options exist for further flexibility .
We suggest a thorough read of the make man page for a deep understanding of make .
The following options are the ones we use most often .
Local variables
Make has local variables that are specifically defined and only have scope within the current target .
These seven are listed below with their system V compatible older notation .
( The system V older notation is n't recommended ; we only list it for backward compatibility . )
This variables value will be the name of the target :
. TARGET
old style notation : '@ '
This variable contains the list for all the sources of this current target :
. ALLSRC
old style notation : '>'
This variable is the implied source for this target .
Its value is the name and path of the source file for the target .
( This will be demonstrated in the .SUFFIX section below . )
. IMPSRC
old style notation : '< '
This variable holds the list of sources that have been determined to be out of date :
. OODATE
old style notation : '?'
This variables value is the file name with out the suffix or path :
. PREFIX
old style notation : '*'
This variables value will be the name of the archive file :
. ARCHIVE
old style notation : '!'
This variables value is the name of the archive member :
. MEMBER
old style notation : '% '
When using these local variables in dependency lines , only .
TARGET , . PREFIX , .ARCHIVE , and .MEMBER may have values for that target .
Another nifty directive is :
.undef < variable >
This is handy when you want to undefine a variable .
Note that only global variables can be undefined .
For example :
.ifdef DEBUG .undef RELEASE .endif
1.11 Transformation Rules ( suffix rules )
Transformation rules specify how a target is to be created .
You can use these rules - to save time in writing a rule for each object file .
The syntax is simple : '. SUFFIXES : ( suffix list )
Note that several different suffixes can share the same transformation suffix ( .cpp , .cc , .c can all produce a .o transformation ) .
If no suffixes are listed then make will delete all previous ones .
This can be very confusing is you have multiple .
SUFFIXES rules ; we advise using only one and keeping it at the bottom of the Makefile .
Consider what 's listed inside the .SUFFIXES block as similar to targets to understand its structure :
. SUFFIXES : .cpp .c .o .sh .c.o : $ ( CC ) $ ( CFLAGS ) -c $ {.IMPSRC} .cpp.o : $ ( CPP ) $ ( CXXFLAGS ) -c $ {.IMPSRC} .sh : cp $ {.IMPSRC} $ {.TARGET} chmod +x $ {. TARGET}
These rules listed above will compile the C and C++ source .
However for the .sh : rule will also tell make how to create the shell script as well .
Note that listing a shell script as a target in this example will require it to be listed with out the .sh extension ; however , the shell script must exist with a .sh suffix .
If we list the install_script as a target without the .sh suffix as a dependency , there should be a shell script called install_script.sh with the proper .sh suffix .
That is , if a file can be listed as a target and as long as that file exists , then make will only create the targets that it deems out of date with that file , and make will not create that file .
The example below illustrates this ; for more information , see the example for apps .h :
all : install_script $ ( OBJS ) $ ( CPP ) $ ( CFLAGS ) -o $ ( APP ) $ ( OBJS ) $ ( LINK )
1.12 Useful Command Line Options
Here is a list of a few command line options that are very handy to know and use .
This is not a full listing , so refer to the man page for others .
- D <variable name to define >
This option will define a variable from the command line , which is handy when you have .ifdef statements in your Makefile .
For example :
.ifdef DEBUG CFLAGS += -g -D__DEBUG__ .endif
Then when you run the command make -D DEBUG , make will set the proper CFLAGS and compile your application with your debug statements .
- E < variable name to override >
This option will override the Makefile variable assignment with the environment value instead .
Before you use this option be sure to set the environment variable according to your shell .
For example :
bash $ CFLAGS= " - O2 - Wall " make -E CFLAGS
Similar to its capitalized counterpart , -e will override all variables inside the Makefile with the environment values .
If no environment variables are defined , however , then the values will be assigned normally .
-f < makefile to use >
This will allow you to specify the Makefile on the command line , helpful if you need multiple Makefiles .
For example :
bash $ make -f Makefile .
BSD
This flag allows you to specify how many jobs make can spawn .
Normally make spawns only one , but for a very large project and to make your hardware earn its keep , use four , as in :
make -j 4 world
If you exceed four , sometimes it'll take longer to execute , though it may be entertaining to some to watch the CPU spike with six or more jobs specified .
-n
Handy when debugging a Makefile , this option allows you to find out exactly which commands make will be running without make actually executing them .
For large projects with many commands , redirect the output to an external file or all the commands will just blow by .
Here 's how :
bash $ make -n >> make_debug.log 2>&1
Using this option will print the variables value , based on the global context .
Also make will not build any targets .
You can specify multiple - V options on the command line , as in :
make -V CFLAGS -V LINK -V OBJS
1.13 A final example
The Makefile listed below , is an example of a reusable Makefile .
When you include it , it will know how to compile C++ source files from the .SUFFIXES rules listed .
It will also know how to install the application and clean up the development directory .
By no means is this a very comprehensible Makefile , but a good example of creating a generic template style Makefile that can contain common routines for development .
This will not only save time from having to retype these common rules over for every Makefile created , but will allow the developer to reuse known good routines as well .

Prodded by several comments , I have finally decided to write up some my thoughts on time management here .
I actually have been drafting something about this subject for a while , but I soon realised that my own experience with time management is still very much a work in progress ( you should see my backlog of papers that need writing up ) and I do n’t yet have a coherent or definitive philosophy on this topic ( other than my advice on writing papers , for instance my page on rapid prototyping ) .
Also , I can only talk about my own personal experiences , which probably do not generalise to all personality types or work situations , though perhaps readers may wish to contribute their own thoughts , experiences , or suggestions in the comments here .
[ I should also add that I do n’t always follow my own advice on these matters , often to my own regret . ]
I can maybe make some unorganised comments , though .
Firstly , I am very lucky to have some excellent collaborators who put a lot of effort into our joint papers ; many of the papers appearing recently on this blog , for instance , were to a large extent handled by co-authors .
Generally , I find that papers written in collaboration take longer than singly - authored papers , but the net effort expended per author is significantly less ( and the quality of writing higher ) .
Also , I find that I can work on many joint papers in parallel ( since the ball is often in another co-author ’s court , or is pending some other development ) , but only on one single - authored paper at a time .
[ For reasons having to do with the academic calendar , many more of these papers get finished during the summer than any other time of year , but many of these projects have actually been gestating for quite some time .
( There should be a joint paper appearing shortly which we have been working on for about three or four years , for instance ; and I have been thinking about the global regularity problem for wave maps problem on and off ( mostly off ) since about 2000 . )
So a paper being released every week does not actually correspond to a week being the time needed to conceive and then write up a paper ; there is in fact quite a long pipeline of development which mostly happens out of public view . ]
Another thing is that my ability to do any serious mathematics fluctuates greatly from day to day ; sometimes I can think hard on a problem for an hour , other times I feel ready to type up the full details of a sketch that I or my coauthors already wrote , and other times I only feel qualified to respond to email and do errands , or just to take a walk or even a nap .
I find it very helpful to organise my time to match this fluctuation : for instance , if I have a free afternoon , and feel inspired to do so , I might close my office door , shut off the internet , and begin typing on a languishing paper ; or if not , I go and work on a week ’s worth of email , referee a paper , write a blog article , or whatever else seems suited to my current levels of energy and enthusiasm .
It is fortunate in mathematics that a large fraction of one ’s work ( with the notable exception of teaching , which one then has to build one ’s schedule around ) can be flexibly moved from one time slot to another in this manner .
[ A corollary to this is that one should deal with tasks before they become so urgent that they have to be done immediately , thus disrupting one ’s time flexibility . ]
It helps a lot here to be able to honestly and accurately evaluate your work potential ( a function of your location , your current level of motivation and energy , your upcoming duties and commitments , availability of resources , and the expected level of distraction ) for a given period of time into the future ( e.g. the rest of the day ) : being either overconfident or underconfident about what you can achieve leads to taking on either more or less than you can properly handle , both of which lead to inefficiencies ( I have learned both sides of this from direct experience ) .
While I have a large number of things on my “ to do ” list , at various levels of complexity , difficulty , and length , when it comes to any task requiring dedicated thought , I try to focus on it exclusively , postponing or shutting out everything else ; I find that multitasking only works for me when none of the tasks requires more than a fraction of my attention ( in particular , it seems to work best when I am not inspired to do any one particular task ) .
Quite often , these tasks take longer to complete than I have the energy , time , or patience for , in which case one has to find a natural break point ( e.g. proving a key lemma in a paper that one is writing up , or writing down a full sketch of some idea that just came up in conversation or on the blackboard or scratch paper ) where one can safely set the task aside and forget about it for a while , and be able to resume later without losing one ’s place .
The thing to avoid is to drop a task when it is only partially finished , without any good “ closure ” ; it then either gets lost , or weighs on one ’s mind and prevents one from fully thinking about something else , or has to be redone from an earlier point when one picks it up again .
But one does n’t have to finish each task off completely as it comes , as long as it can be picked up later .
A mundane example : when I get around to writing physical letters ( usually a low priority , when I do n’t feel ready to do serious mathematics ) , I type them , print them out , seal them in an envelope , and then deposit them in my “ out ” tray , but I generally do n’t mail them ( or process any other paperwork in my out tray ) until it piles up and I have nothing better to do , at which point I go out and deal with all of it at once .
[ I find that a particularly good time for doing this is when my computer needs to reboot or is somehow not easily usable . ]
More generally , tasks that require little concentration seem to be best done in batches if possible , while tasks that require a lot of concentration seem to be best done individually , with as few distractions as one can manage .
Related to the point about “ closure ” is the desirability of being able to chop up an extremely long task into smaller , self - contained ones , ideally each with its own immediate “ payoff ” .
To give one example : I doubt I would ever attempt to write ( let alone finish ) the equivalent of my 19 or so lectures on the Poincaré conjecture if I had decided to write one enormous article or monograph rather than 19 reasonably manageable and self - supporting shorter pieces .
( It helped also to “ paint myself into a corner ” a little bit here by announcing the lectures in advance , and building up some momentum , to stop myself from abandoning the project half - way . )
[ One very nice thing about modern text editors , including the one on this blog , is that it is very easy to save a draft at some intermediate stage and flesh it out or polish it later , which greatly assists the task of writing long papers by chopping up this task into a sequence of much smaller tasks , as discussed above .
I am quite impressed by mathematicians from before the computer era who were able to meticulously write out high - quality papers and even books ; even with good secretarial support , I would find this extremely difficult to do myself . ]
It also makes good sense to invest a serious amount of time and effort into learning any skill that you are likely to use repeatedly in the future .
A good example in mathematics is LaTeX : if you plan to write a lot of papers , it makes sense to go beyond the bare minimum of skill needed to jerry - rig whatever you need to write your paper , and go out and seriously learn how to make tables , figures , arrays , etc .
Recently I ’ve been playing with using prerecorded macros to type out a standard block of LaTeX code ( e.g. \ begin{theorem} … \end {theorem} \ begin{proof} … \end{proof} ) in a few keystrokes ; the actual time saved per instance is probably minimal , but it presumably adds up over time , and in any event feels like you ’re being efficient , which is good for morale ( which becomes important when writing a long paper ) .
There are also many situations in which it makes tactical sense to defer , delay , delegate , or procrastinate on any given task , and go work on something else instead in the meantime ; not everything is equally important , and also a given task may in fact become much easier ( and be completed in a much better way ) if one waits for one ’s own skills to get stronger , or for other events to happen that reduce the importance or need for the task in the first place .
My current papers on wave maps , for instance , have been delayed for years , much to my own personal frustration , but in retrospect I can see that it was actually a good idea to let those papers sit for a while , as the project as I had originally conceived it was a technical nightmare , and it really was necessary to wait for the technology and understanding in the field to improve before being able to tackle it in a relatively civilised manner .
[ Perhaps this very article on time management is an example of this , also .
There are also a number of other draft articles hidden in this blog that I felt were not quite working at the time , and are awaiting some further inspiration to complete .
It seems that not every idea or topic for an article necessarily leads to a viable end product ; cf. “ use the wastebasket “ . ]
My final suggestion is to pick some sort of organisational system and make a real effort to stick to it ; a half - hearted system is probably worse than no system at all .
[ A corollary to this is not to try to make an overly ambitious system ab nihilo that one is unlikely to follow faithfully ; it is probably better to let such systems evolve over time . ]
I have my own system involving a PDA synchronised to my laptop , my email account , some in trays , out trays , and other designated spots in my office , and a “ reserved ” blackboard , that probably only I can understand completely , and I do n’t think I can even explain it properly here , but I ’m used to it now and it seems to work well enough ( though I sure hope nobody ever erases that blackboard ! ) .
The choice of system though is presumably a very personal matter and I would n’t be able to advise on what would work best for anyone other than myself .
But I do find that such systems free up a lot of memory ; if I do n’t have to worry about what I ’m supposed to be doing at 3 pm on Tuesday , or what work needs to be done on X , Y , and Z for purposes A , B , and C , I can devote more of my attention to trying to understand a mathematical argument , or proving a tricky lemma , or whatever else I need to work on .
[ I also find it psychologically satisfying to be able to physically cross off an item from my organisational system , which can be a useful motivation when one feels otherwise uninspired to deal with something . ]
On the other hand , one should not obsess too much about such systems ; as a rule of thumb , I would say to devote about 1 - 5 % of your productive time to time management , and 95 - 99 % of your productive time to actual work .
Oh , and one final disclaimer : sometimes one should abandon one ’s own rules and allow for serendipity .
There have been many times , for instance , when I had planned to work on something during my lunch hour ( grabbing something quick to eat ) , when I was interrupted by a colleague or visitor to go out to eat .
It has often happened that I got a lot more out of that lunch ( mathematically or otherwise ) than I would have back at the office , though not in the way I would have anticipated .
And it was more enjoyable , too .
( Similarly with skipping talks at conferences ( or skipping conferences altogether ) to go work on one ’s own papers , etc . )

The software most likely to steal elections is the BALLOT DEFINITION SOFTWARE loaded onto paper - based optical - scan and DRE ( usually , touch - screen ) voting machines in county elections offices across the U.S. just before the machines are sealed with security tape and transported to election polling locations .
And yet , the frightening reality is that there is little or no oversight of that software itself , nor of the people --- usually sub-contractors , who could be anyone from a non-U.S. citizen , to a criminal , to a political party operative --- who program that ballot definition software .
Moreover , there is little or no testing of such software , despite the fact that it stores the ballot positions for all candidates and initiatives on every ballot , on every voting machine , and tallies the votes for all of them on election day .
For all of the concerns about election fraud , via the electronic voting systems in use across the nation today , and the eye on the source code for the software itself , few seem to have their eye on the ballot definition software , which can --- even on e-voting systems where the hardware , and main program software has been tested , certified , and audited --- succeed in flipping an election without detection , either by error , or on purpose .
Concerned yet ?
Read on ...
What is Ballot Definition Software ?
Ballot definition software is constructed for each election and defines the ballot positions for each candidate and proposition for each voting precinct .
Miami -Dade County in Florida [ PDF ] , for example , has 750 voting precincts and usually requires several hundred unique ballot definitions for federal general elections .
As Ellen Theisen of VotersUnite.org attempted to warn in her 2004 study , ballot definition software creates the ballot image that people see on the screens of every brand of DRE / touch - screen voting machine .
DRE / touch - screen and paper - based optical scan machines use ballot position coordinates , also coded in the software , to determine how finger touches on the touch - screen , or marks on the paper ballot , are mapped to candidate positions on the ballot .
The software tabulates finger touches and marks on paper ballots as candidate votes and then stores those tabulated vote counts in the machine ’s “ virtual ballot box ” , the data memory card itself .
Finally , ballot definition software then tallies final election results when the polls close on Election Day .
Public Inspection of Ballots , Ballot Boxes and Ballot Counting
All DRE / touch - screen and paper - based op - scan manufacturers and vendors hold that all software , including the ballot definition software , is proprietary and confidential ( a trade secret ) and may not be inspected by county election officers , election judges , candidates or citizen election observers .
Moreover , judges have accepted this proprietary and confidential argument .
For example , presiding Florida Circuit Court Judge William L. Gary denied plaintiff Christine Jennings ’ motion to allow review of the software code for the DRE / touch - screen machines used in the contested 2006 U.S.
House race between Democrat Christine Jennings and Republican Vern Buchanan for Florida 's 13th district where 18,000 votes mysteriously went missing from the machines .
Many states have , within their election code , laws that give public observers the right to inspect ballot boxes to make sure they are empty and to inspect ballots to make sure they are accurate and complete before the polls open on Election Day .
( Example : New Hampshire Election Code Section 658:36 Inspection of Ballot Box –
At the opening of the polls , the ballot box shall be publicly opened and shown to be empty ; and the election officers shall ascertain that fact by a personal examination of the box .
eff. July 1 , 1979 )
Many states also have within their election code laws that allow public observers to watch election clerks open ballot boxes and count the ballots at the end of the Election Day .
That ballot and ballot box inspection laws are on the books of most states --- due to a long and dismal history of election fraud , in both rural areas and big cities --- demonstrates that every election process used throughout history has been exploited by corrupt elements .
Ballots and ballot boxes constructed of software and silicon , therefore , are no different in practical purpose and democratic significance than ballots and ballot boxes constructed of paper and metal .
Election inspection and observation law is the guarantee for democracy ;
The laws guarantee that election judges , candidates and citizens have the right to inspect ballots and ballot boxes and observe ballot counting as democratic insurance for fair and true elections .
Activist Judges , such as Florida Circuit Court Judge William L. Gary , who accept the voting machine industry ’s " proprietary " and " confidential " arguments and rule that ballot definition software may not be inspected by county election officers , election judges , candidates or election observers , in fact , create new election law from the bench that runs contrary to ballot and ballot box inspection and ballot count observation laws already on the books of nearly every state .
DRE Voting Machines Used in Over One Third of U.S .
In the November 2006 general election there were 1,142 counties using DRE / touch - screen voting machines ( 36.63 percent of all 3089 U.S. counties ) and 1,752 counties using optical scanners .
This tabulates to 2,894 counties and 161,111 voting precincts that depended on ballot definition software written in the weeks just before each election .
Touch - screen voting machines are identified as direct recording electronic ( DRE ) devices because voter ballot selections on the touch screen are directly recorded as ballot tally counts on data memory cards .
No paper ballot or other reliable record of voter intent remains after voters step away from DRE voting machines .
When ballot tally count anomalies arise , such as in the 200 FL - 13 race where 18,000 votes went missing from DRE machines , no ballot recount is possible .
In precincts using paper - based op - scan counting machines , voters mark paper ballots , which are scanned , counted and stored in actual , physical ballot boxes .
Paper ballots , which remain after voters leave the polling place , can be hand counted and compared to op - scan tallies when , and if , ballot count anomalies arise .
For the 2008 primary and general election season , the use of DRE / touch - screen voting machines has decreased slightly , while the use of optical - scanners has increased across the U.S.
While the numbers have shifted slightly over the past two years , the total number of election jurisdictions using some type of electronic machine running ballot definition software at polling places or the central elections office for ballot tabulation continues to increase .
Who Creates Ballot Software for Each Election ?
The task of creating ballot definition and tallying software is so large and complex that many counties contract the work to voting machine vendors or consulting / programming companies .
Most vendor and consulting companies themselves do not maintain a staff of programmers large enough to write all the ballot definition software for all the voting precincts of all their county elections office customers across the U.S.
Therefore , the work is often assigned to yet another layer of temporary or sub - contracted programmers .
These sub -contractors may , or may not , be U.S. citizens .
Who checks the credentials of all these contract programmers writing " last minute " ballot software ?
Who asks if contract programmers work for a foreign government , other foreign interest , political party or candidate up for election ?
Who asks if they have criminal records ?
Who checks to make sure they do not have connections to a Karl Rove - type political operative ?
Who performs detailed audits or certification testing of the ballot definition software they write ?
The frightening answer to all questions is - no one !
Who Certifies that Ballot Software is Error Free ?
You 'll not like the answer to that question either .
Paper - based op - scan and DRE / touch - screen voting machines all have some form of firmware software that controls basic hardware functions and Operating System ( OS ) software , something like the Microsoft Windows system that runs on your home computer .
Together , those elements provide the application system operating environment .
Election Application System ( EAS ) software , which runs within the operating environment , supports and controls the operation of ballot definition software .
Voluntary voting system standards [ PDF ] , developed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) and the National Association of State Election Directors ( NASED ) , require that the specific versions of all software , including firmware , OS and EAS , that runs in voting machines on election day , must be subjected to a software audit and be stored in escrow .
The software packages that programmers use to create ballot definition software modules , however , are not subject to these auditing and escrow rules .
County and state election officials and voting machine industry representatives often insist that voting machine software is “ certified ” and secure because the Firmware , OS and EAS software has been audited ( if meagerly , at the federal level ) and is stored in escrow by a software auditing company .
Even at that , not all states and voting machine manufacturers fully comply with the EAC and NASED regulations to audit the exact versions of software that run in voting machines on election day .
While some version of the firmware , OS and EAS software for some voting machine manufactures ’ equipment may be audited and stored in escrow , ballot definition software , hurriedly written in the weeks just before each election , is not independently audited .
Ballot definition software is not submitted to any independent testing laboratory for audit and often it is not directly tested [ PDF ] by county election officials , as VotersUnite 's Theisen warned , to little notice , so many years ago .
Furthermore , memory cards / modules , on which ballot definition software is delivered to county elections offices , can also carry other software components that can update --- secretly , as necessary --- firmware , OS and EAS software as the ballot software is loaded onto each and every voting machine .
Even if the version of firmware , OS and EAS software installed on voting machines is the audited and certified version , such updates from memory cards / modules invalidate the audit , unless they have been scrupulously logged , audited and tested .
But that does n't happen .
County election officials across the U.S. all too often do not carefully inspect those memory cards / modules to know exactly what software components may be loaded onto their voting machines .
In fact , it is the contractors who often load the memory card / module contents onto voting machines .
After elections , it has become nearly impossible for citizens to inspect those memory cards to ensure they were accurate , error and fraud - free , as we saw after New Hampshire 's recent primary when even the candidates who paid for recounts , were denied the ability to inspect the memory cards used across the entire state to count some 80 % of the votes .
Those election jurisdictions that do test their ballot definition software , often simply execute a testing procedure written by the same contractor that delivered their ballot definition software .
Yes , the person that writes the ballot definition software often creates its certifying test procedure .
A few counties across the U.S. do construct their own test procedures to augment the test procedures delivered by their contractors .
But even when these basic function testing procedures are executed , they are run in a “ test election ” mode rather than the actual Election Day mode , so the ballot definition software is never subjected to a true Election Day field test .
For those who know how computer work , and how to hack them , it 's a simple trick for malicious software to determine what day and time it is , and what mode the computer may be in , before determining if an embedded hack routine should run , or lay dormant until the moment it 's actually needed .
For the 2006 general election then , some significant portion of 2,894 County Election Administrators implicitly trusted some programmer , likely unknown to them , to write 100 % accurate , honest and bug free ballot definition software for their 161,111 voting precincts .
Election Judges , candidates and citizens in those 161,111 voting precincts were not allowed to inspect the ballots and ballot boxes or observe the ballot count .
Had the [ DRE touch - screen voting machine ] ballots and ballot boxes used in Florida 's 2006 13th district U.S.
House race been scrupulously inspected , perhaps 18,000 votes would not have gone missing on election day .
Is Ballot Software Safe ?
After 50 years of software research and practical experience , computer scientists fully understand how vulnerable all software , particularly election software , is to inadvertent bug malfunction or malicious perversion .
Given optical ballot scanner and DRE touch - screen voting systems use freshly written ballot definition software for each and every election , which at best is only lightly tested , computer scientists know with certainty the probability of software “ bug ” malfunction is extremely high where software is not rigorously audited , tested and controlled .
Yet county and state election officials and Judges who little understand the science of computer software , so far , dismiss all warnings from the community of computer scientists that the probability of inadvertent bug malfunction or malicious software perversion is very high for electronic voting systems .
Even when voting machine system error seems the more probable explanation when ballot count anomalies do occur , voting machine industry executives immediately threaten legal action against anyone connected to any attempt to inspect any part of the software ballot box .
So far , when ballot count anomalies arise , particularly in precincts using DRE / touch - screen voting machines , the courts have held that the corporate interest in proprietary and confidential software copyright laws overrides the public interest in election laws that mandate transparent public inspection of ballots , ballot boxes and ballot counting !
Candidates and the public have no right to inspect DRE machine software ballot boxes .
In precincts using paper ballots with ballot count op - scan systems , candidates and the public are at least able to inspect and recount the paper ballots when questions arise ... presuming the chain - of - custody for those ballots has been secured , but that 's another matter entirely .
Conclusion
The frightening truth is , local election officials often make no effort to rigorously certify that ballot definition software , freshly written just before each election , is accurate and bug free or that someone in the software chain of custody did not nefariously insert a few extra lines of software code that activates only on election day to flip votes or rig vote totals , before then self - deleting itself at the end of the election day .
The more that unchecked and untested software is used in the administration of elections , the more election officials --- and the citizenry who allows it --- hand control of elections over to unchecked and unseen computer programmers .
It is so easy for a political partisan or foreign government to entice or direct contract programmers writing or handling ballot definition software to stuff the software ballot box as they perform their legitimate duties .
Even just a few motivated partisan programmers each working independently could easily throw an election !
Worse , given that many of the systems in use today have been found as vulnerable to viruses as your home computer ( arguably , even moreso , since they do not use anti-virus software with regular updates ) , it could require only a single programmer to flip an entire election .
Six years after George W. Bush signed the Help American Vote Act of 2002 ( HAVA ) , allocating some $ 3.8 billion of taxpayer money , most of which was directed straight to electronic voting machine corporations , elections are less transparent and less secure than ever before .
DRE voting is more dangerous than paper - ballot systems because it opens the door to wholesale errors and cheating .
A single bug , or malicious software instance installed by a single individual , can be distributed to thousands of machines , which could then undetectably change a very large number of votes .
This is the opinion of such prestigious institutions as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Institute of Standards and Technology [ PDF ] and the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law [ PDF ] - ( Press Release and U.S. Senate hearing Written Testimony ) .
A few states and counties , too few , have heard these warnings and are studying the possibility of switching back to a paper - ballot based election system .
Paper ballots are not a magical guarantee of accurate and fraud - free elections .
Indeed , there is a long history of error and election fraud with paper ballots , but with DRE voting , where the software ballot , ballot box and ballot tally are hidden from public scrutiny , it is nearly impossible to prove , or even detect , systematic election fraud .
With a hand - marked paper record of each voter 's intent , along with laws already on the books of many states for public scrutiny of paper ballot election processes , we , the citizens of a free democracy , have at least a chance to detect and deter systematic election fraud through proper oversight and auditing of those paper ballots marked by voters .
We must also tell our elected representatives that they must enact laws to clearly mandate that the public 's interest in election laws that allow for the public inspection of all aspects of our public elections , must override the corporate interest in proprietary and confidential corporate software copyright laws !

McClatchy :
WASHINGTON — Alice Rocchio is an office manager at the New York headquarters of the Hess Corp. , drives a 1993 Chevy Cavalier and lives in an apartment in Queens , N.Y. , with her husband , Pasquale , an Amtrak foreman .
Despite what appears to be a middle - class lifestyle , the couple has written $ 61,600 in checks to John McCain 's presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee , most of it within days of McCain 's decision to endorse offshore oil drilling .
A former FEC official said that it 's possible that the Rocchios had the means to make those hefty contributions — their first reported donations to a federal campaign .
But the official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said that their donations also could trigger a complaint or otherwise catch the eyes of the agency 's enforcement staff , tasked to ensure that companies or wealthy individuals do n't illegally circumvent contribution limits by using employees or other third parties as " conduits ' ' for cash .
Read on ...
TPM has been all over this story and it now appears that the Rocchios are n't the only ones who are under the microscope for questionable donations to McCain and the RNC .
And is it a coincidence that only a week after donations from a major American oil company low level employee , Flip Flop McCain changes his attitude on off - shore drilling ?
On top of that , in a TPM update , the Rocchios are renters and that their donations exceed the median household income for the area they live in .
Late Update :
There 's a bit of dispute over whether Flushing , Queens , should be described as " middle class " or " lower middle class . "
It turns out that the median household income in the Rocchios ' zip code is $ 58,069 .

Barr makes FISA play for Obama supporters Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday July 4 , 2008
Print This Email This When Democratic Presidential Candidate Barack Obama angered his Netroots - base of support over agreeing to vote for the GOP - sanctioned amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the Associated Press ran a story claiming his compromise gives Republicans ' ammo . '
Republicans , it would seem , are not the only group belied by the news .
If the campaign 2008 truism maintains , and Obama indeed leached significant support from Ron Paul at the moment of primary truth , then Libertarian Presidential Nominee Bob Barr , the former Republican congressman from Georgia who runs with Paul 's blessing , is making a power play to win them back .
" Sen. Barack Obama has reaffirmed his refusal to live up to his promise to oppose the Bush administration , which violated the law by conducting warrantless surveillance of Americans ' telephone calls , " said Barr in a July 4 media release .
" Unfortunately , the Democrats also were more enablers of government abuse than defenders of American liberty . "
Obama , said Barr , promised change .
" But when the Democratic congressional leadership decided to concede to almost all of the administration 's demands in rewriting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , Sen.
Obama went along with the crowd . "
On Obama 's own social networking Web site , a group of supporters lobbying the senator for a no vote on the FISA amendments have amassed in greater numbers than groups formed officially by the campaign itself .
The group 's founder , liberal blogger and activist Mike Stark , called the move a " stiff arm to the people that care about the Constitution . "
" It 's left a question in a lot of people 's mind about how committed he really is to change , " Stark told RAW STORY .
Barr 's release , distributed on PR News Wire , aims to draw a parallel between the two parties , and offer an alternative with a distinct Ron Paul , libertarian appeal .
" We cannot trust either the Republican or Democratic parties to defend the privacy and civil liberties of Americans , which demonstrates the bankruptcy of the two major parties , " said Barr . " ...
It should be obvious to all that only the Libertarian Party provides an alternative in November . "
An Obama spokesman recently attempted an explaination of the candidate 's position to The New York Times .
Greg Craig , a Washington lawyer who advises the Obama campaign , said Tuesday in an interview that Mr. Obama had decided to support the compromise FISA legislation only after concluding it was the best deal possible .
" This was a deliberative process , and not something that was shooting from the hip , " Mr. Craig said .
" Obviously , there was an element of whats possible here .
But he concluded that with FISA expiring , that it was better to get a compromise than letting the law expire . "
" Of course I 'm going to vote for him in November , " said Stark .
But " we 're keeping score , and there 's going to be a time when he needs us .
...
We have long memories . "
The senate vote on amending FISA is scheduled for Tuesday .
Apple 's security team has long been shrouded in secrecy , and the discussion would have been one of the headline attractions at Black Hat , which is being held this week in Las Vegas .
Jeff Moss , director of the Black hat conference , which is owned by ChannelWeb parent company UBM , said Apple 's marketing team was behind the decision to pull the plug on the presentation , which was titled ' Meet the Apple Security Experts . '
" We had a lot of people from government agencies saying they 'd love to know more about the security engineers at Apple , because it 's such an opaque company , " said Moss .
Kevin Finisterre , a security researcher who has discovered numerous vulnerabilities in Apple products , says Apple 's marketing team has often made the task of reporting security issues a difficult one .
" I found that when I reported a bug , and #91 ; Apple ' sand #93 ; security team could not even really talk to me , because the conversation was not approved , " Finisterre said in an email .
" They were also not able to give me realistic dates on when patches would come out , for similar reasons . "
Although Apple representatives did n't respond to requests for comment , it 's possible that Apple simply had second thoughts about its security engineers facing a crowd of security experts that includes the likes of H.D. Moore , L.M.H , and Finisterre , all of whom have highlighted Apple vulnerabilities in the past , most notably in the Month Of Apple Bugs .
Anthony Russo , my partner in the March 1971 leak of secret government archives ( The Pentagon Papers ) exposed how successive U.S. administrations manipulated America into the Vietnam War , died August 5 , 2008 at his home in Suffolk , Virginia .
Tony Russo came to be my best friend at Rand after I came back from Vietnam in 1967 , and we became even closer after he left .
He was fired from Rand , despite my efforts to keep him , for the best of reasons :
He had , in classified reports , analyzed the class basis of the Vietnam conflict , and he had exposed the widespread use of torture by our Vietnamese forces , with American involvement .
I learned more from Tony than from anyone else about the nature of the National Liberation Front , some members of which had impressed him deeply when he interviewed them about a Rand research project .
He was brilliant and funny , with a very original and creative mind .
He was also very warm â€ ” more likeable than me , as many who attended our trial discovered .
Just before I decided to copy the Pentagon Papers , with Tonyâ€™s help , he made a suggestion that played a key role in my decision .
Tony did not know that the Pentagon Papers were being held at Rand , or were in my safe , or even that I had worked on the study , because I was under orders not to tell anyone .
But I did tell him in late September 1969 that I had been reading a study ( which later became the basis of the Pentagon Papers ) that revealed a lot of high - level lying .
He said to me , â€ œYou ought to put that out .â€ 
This was an extraordinary thing for someone who had until recently held a top secret clearance to say to anyone , least of all to someone who still had a clearance .
In fact , I never heard of such a suggestion being made before or since ( except of course by me , later ) .
A week after this conversation , with other events working on my mind , I called him up and said , â€ œTony , do you know a study that I mentioned last week ?
Well , Iâ€™ve got it , and I think I will put it out .
Can you help ?â€ 
I donâ€™t think there was anyone else in the world with past official experience I wouldâ€™ve gone to with that request , no matter how close a friend they were .
I knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me .
I asked him if he knew where we could find a Xerox machine , and within an hour he got back to me with the word that his then - girlfriend had a machine in her office we could use .
We started either that night or the next , we were never able to recall which .
If he had not found that machine , that very week , before Nixon had committed himself to staying in Vietnam in a speech on November 3rd , I donâ€™t think I would have taken the route I did , because it simply wouldnâ€™t have seemed promising enough .
As it was , Tony took the exact same risks I did of prosecution .
Frankly , at the time , I didnâ€™t think that was true ; I thought I was the only one at risk .
But I was mistaken , as it turned out , when Tony was indicted on three felony counts in the fall of 1971 .
One further note :
It is frequently said in relation to the current trial of the former AIPAC employees that theirs is the first prosecution of someone for a leak who was not an official and did not have a clearance .
That is false .
Tony Russo was indicted on the exact same charges , with the exact same status .
As is the case with the AIPAC employees , if he had been convicted on that basis , every journalist and even every newspaper reader who had possession of information that had been disclosed without authorization ( that is , â€˜leakedâ€™ ) would be equally subject to prosecution .
So it was crucial for freedom of speech , freedom of the press , and the publicâ€™s need to know that Tony was not convicted in our trial , by reason of governmental misconduct .
Our friendship was strained later ( not so much during the trial , as far as I was concerned , but by some events shortly after the trial ) , and we saw each other only intermittently over the next 30 years .
In the last few years , on several occasions when he was gravely ill , we did meet , and had very warm conversations which I appreciated .
The fact is I will be eternally grateful to Tony for his courage and partnership in what proved to be a useful action .
He set an example of willingness to risk everything for his country and for the Vietnam that he loved that very few , unfortunately , have emulated .
I only hope that others will continue to be inspired by it .
Zipperについては
を見てほしいのですが、簡単に言うと副作用を使わずに実装された双方向リストみたいな感じです。
例。
# zipperを作る zipper = Zipper.make ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) # 最初は、0番目にカーソルがある zipper.get #=> 1 # nextを呼ぶと、1番目にカーソルが移動する zipper.next.get #=> 2
んで書き換えもできるのですが、「副作用なし」なので、書き換えると丸ごと別のzipperができます。
orig = Zipper.make ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) copy1 = orig.next.set ( 100 ) copy2 = orig.next.set ( 200 ) copy1.to_a #= > [ 1 , 100 , 3 ] copy2.to_a # = > [ 1 , 200 , 3 ]
「 なんだか遅そう」って？それがO(1)、つまりどんなに長くなっても同じ時間で行えるのがZipperの凄いところなんです。
試しにこんなテストを書いてみました。
it " Zipperは、大量にコピーしてそれぞれ書き換えたりしてもへっちゃら！ " do original = Zipper.make (*( 0..10000 ) .to_a ) # 長さ10000 のzipperを作って、 zippers = ( 0..10000 ) .map{|i| # それを10000個 、 original.next.set ( i ) # 1 箇所ずつ書き換えて複製する } zippers [ 99 ] .get .
should == 99 zippers [ 1234 ] .get .
should == 1234 end
二次元配列でこれをやると10000 * 10000なので凄い時間がかかりそうですが 、Zipperでは0.5秒で終わります(僕のMacBook調べ ) 。

Trollop : Simple Yet Powerful Command Line Option Processor
By Peter Cooper
Trollop is a command - line argument processing library for Ruby .
Developer William Morgan says Trollop is " designed to provide the maximal amount of GNU - style argument processing in the minimum number of lines of code . "
It makes a refreshing change to the more popular , but generally scary , cmdparse .
The homepage features some examples of its usage .
Once you 've installed trollop with the usual gem install trollop , you could write :
require ' trollop ' opts = Trollop :: options do opt : http_1_0 , " Force HTTP /1.0 " opt : http_1_1 , " Force HTTP /1.1 " opt : hide_referer , " Hide referer " , : default => true opt : connections , " Set number of simultaneous connections " , : default => 2 end p opts
Running the script with no command line options would result in opt becoming :
{ :http_1_0= > false , :http_1_1= > false , :hide_referer= > true , : connections= > 2 , : help= > false }
You also get a - - help ( or - h ) option for free that describes how to use the options :
Options : -- http-1-0 , -h : Force HTTP/1.0 -- http -1-1 , -t : Force HTTP /1.1 -- hide - referer , -i : Hide referer ( default : true ) -- connections , -c :
Set number of simultaneous connections ( default : 2 ) --help , -e : Show this message
Note that trollop takes care of assigning the short - hand individual letter options , assigning the next letter within the string if the previous ones are taken .
Another option is Optiflag , which present a more DSL - esque solution .
Its official homepage features some compelling examples , though the simplicity of Trollop appeals to me more for some reason .

High gas prices are nothing new to those that live in Southern California .
But there is something surreal about seeing prices quickly approach $ 5 per gallon .
In fact , as you scroll through the list of your local gas station options , you ’ll already see $ 5 a gallon for diesel serving as a highlight of coming attractions .
Has high energy prices impacted the price of homes ?
We were already having a housing bust before prices even started to decline .
The Los Angeles median home peak price hit when oil was $ 79 a barrel :
( click for sharper image )
Of course , as typical in any economy , unintended factors normally impact other sectors without the benefit of foresight .
It was hard for the travel industry to see online businesses such as Expedia or Travelocity take out a major chunk of their business .
It was also challenging for newspapers to compete with online classifieds like those provided through Craigslist .
The idea of Peak Oil is n’t something that is new .
In fact , the theory has been floating around for decades .
Yet this may be the real deal .
The fact that oil has stayed over $ 100 a barrel since January of 2008 only signifies that something radical may be happening .
The world consumes over 84 million barrels of oil a day .
Over 20 million of that is in the United States alone .
Growing economies like those in China , India , and Russia are now consuming more and more oil so there is a true demand that is pushing prices up .
Peak oil does n’t mean we ’ve ran out of oil but it simply means global production and refining capacity can no longer keep up with worldwide demand .
Prices in Los Angeles County are now down 23 % on a year over year basis .
It may come as no surprise to many that those in Los Angeles drive a lot .
It is also no surprise that prices in Los Angeles are some of the highest in the nation .
Take a look at the current average per gallon :
Today 4.572
Yesterday 4.581
One Week Ago 4.602
One Month Ago 4.160
One Year Ago 3.085
* Source : Gasbuddy.com
Higher gas prices are only contributing as an additional source for falling housing prices .
More money is now being consumed on fuel and is allowing for less discretionary spending .
Home prices in counties like Riverside and San Bernardino are taking it doubly on the chin with higher fuel prices .
Many working class families with the hope of owning a home moved out into these areas and commuted into Los Angeles County to work .
Now , this is not an option for many .
That is why prices in these counties are now down by :
Riverside : - 28.6 % ( $ 290,000 )
San Bernardino : - 30.8 % ( $ 250,250 )
A few years ago , a home for under $ 300,000 in Southern California was almost unheard of .
Now , this is a common occurrence .
If fuel prices are to remain at current levels , it is only a mathematical certainty that people will be unable to commute from such long distances .
Just to do some basic math , we ’ll contrast $ 2 a gallon gas with the current $ 4.57 a gallon gas .
Many people would commute 60 miles each way from San Bernardino to Los Angeles County to work .
Let us assume they were driving a truck that could get 17 MPG :
120 miles per day
600 miles per week
Cost for week of gas ( 35.29 gallons needed ) :
@ $ 2 a gallon : $ 70.58
@ $ 4.57 a gallon : $ 161.27
Do this a few times over a month , and you are now spending $ 400 to $ 500 more a month while your income has remained the same .
Now imagine this family in an adjustable mortgage which was extremely popular here in California .
Now , you have rising fuel costs and a rising housing payment while the economic situation is deteriorating quickly in the state .
This is strike one , two , and three .
Unfortunately this is simply adding fuel to the housing pain .
Expect things to continue for the foreseeable future .

WhatLanguage : Ruby Library To Detect The Language Of A Text
By Peter Cooper
WhatLanguage is a library by Peter Cooper ( disclaimer : yes , that 's me ) that makes it quick and easy to determine what language a supplied text is written in .
It 's pretty accurate on anything from a short sentence up to several paragraphs in all of the languages supplied with the library ( Dutch , English , Farsi , Russian , French , German , Portuguese , Spanish , Pinyin ) and adding languages of your own choosing is n't difficult .
The library works by checking for the presence of words with bloom filters built from dictionaries based upon each source language .
We 've covered bloom filters on Ruby Inside before , but essentially they 're probabilistic data structures based upon hashing a large set of content .
They 're ideal in situations where you want to check set memberships but the threat of false positives is acceptable in return for significant memory savings ( and a 250 KB bloom filter is a lot nicer to deal with than a 14MB + dictionary ) .
WhatLanguage is available from GitHub ( and can be installed as a gem from there with gem install peterc - whatlanguage ) or from RubyForge with a simpler gem install whatlanguage .
Once installed , usage is simple :
require ' whatlanguage ' " Je suis un homme " . language wl = WhatLanguage .
new ( : all ) wl .
language ( " Je suis un homme " ) wl . process_text ( " this is a test of whatlanguage 's great language detection features " )
I wrote the library initially a year ago but have only just made it available for public use , so if there are unforeseen bugs to fix or things that really need to be added , fork it on GitHub and get playing .
Wall Street is bracing for regional and small banks to fess up to large losses from their mounting volume of soured construction loans made primarily to home builders .
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , $ 45.4 billion of the $ 631.8 billion in construction loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter were delinquent .
When banks announce second - quarter results in coming weeks , they are expected to report sharp increases in loans that builders can't repay .
Banks are also facing intensifying pressure from federal ...

Three prominent advocates of antidepressant use by children received millions of dollars from antidepressant manufacturers , casting into question the integrity of their already - controversial research .
The New York Times reported Saturday that Harvard University psychiatrists Joseph Biederman and Timothy Wilens received $ 1.6 million each from drug companies between 2000 and 2007 .
Thomas Spencer , another Harvard psychiatrist , received $ 1 million .
The payments were uncovered by Congressional investigators searching for conflict - of - interest violations .
Federal law requires researchers who receive National Institutes of Health funding to report annual outside earnings above $ 10,000 to their universities .
Biederman , Wilens and Spencer all took NIH money , but never reported the full extent of their drug company income .
That the researchers ' results were influenced by the payments is n't clear , but the situation is ugly .
Biederman has a very high profile ; as the Times describes , he
is one of the most influential researchers in child psychiatry and is widely admired for focusing the field ’s attention on its most troubled young patients .
Although many of his studies are small and often financed by drug makers , his work helped to fuel a controversial 40 - fold increase from 1994 to 2003 in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder ... and a rapid rise in the use of antipsychotic medicines in children .
Childhood antidepressant use is hotly debated by scientists : it 's not clear whether they work as well in kids as in adults , and the drugs may have profound effects on still - developing brains .
Senator Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , leader of the Congressional investigation , has pushed for a national registry of commercial payments to researchers .

Turley : Attorney General Mukasey acting ' without principle ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 13 , 2008
Print This Email This
The announcement by Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Tuesday that he regards illegal hiring practices in the Department of Justice only as violations of civil service laws and not as crimes came under withering criticism from legal expert Jonathan Turley on MSNBC 's Countdown .
" The attorney general would have had a lot more credibility if he actually prosecuted government officials on occasion , " Turley told Keith Olbermann .
" He said he would not prosecute what is defined as a war crime in the case of torture .
He would not prosecute on the electronic surveillance crimes .
...
He has been standing in the way of investigations .
And now ... he 's just saying , ' You know , they got away and what can I do about that ? ' "
" He is not prosecuting government officials , " Turley summed up , " and I 'm afraid he 's doing it without principle . "
Turley also noted that , while he agreed with Mukasey that " it would be unfair " to dismiss all the Justice Department personnel who were hired as the result of partisan decision - making , he has a particular concern with the immigration judges .
" It 's clear that the standards used to select those judges were not based on the merits and were based on their political alliances and associations , " Turley stated .
" Those are people rendering decisions over the lives of others . "
In response to a question from Olbermann about whether Mukasey is " just another Bush hack , " Turley replied , " It 's not fair to call him a sycophant like Alberto Gonzales , but he is a remarkable cynic . "
" He seems to believe that he has the discretion not just to prosecute but to define what crimes are , " Turley explained .
" He is treating himself as the sole decision - maker .
...
In so doing , he 's making a wonderful argument for re-instating the independent counsel act . "
Turley added that although the recent rejection by an appeals court of Valerie Plame 's civil suit against government officials responsible for her outing may have been legally correct , it provides another argument for restoring the independent counsel act .
" It shows that there is no independent basis to protect people like Plame , " Turley emphasized .
" She was done wrong . "

Cable and satellite broadcasters have long relied on a special set of three narrow statutory licenses that Congress gave them years ago to help prop up the pay - TV industry in its infancy .
The licenses ( found in sections 111 , 119 , and 122 of the Copyright Act ) allow the pay - TV providers to grab certain over - the - air signals from local broadcasters or from far - off " superstations " like WGN in Chicago and transmit them over their own networks without asking permission .
They have to pay , but the amount is fixed by Congress and is likely below market rates .
A new report from the Copyright Office ( PDF ) suggests that this system should come to an end , and that it should not be extended to Internet broadcasters .
As examples of the ways in which Congress intervenes with remarkable specificity on behalf of particular industries , the three licenses in question are matchless .
They were enacted in the early years of cable and then , later , in the early years of satellite .
Retransmission issues were still contentious and broadcasters had all the power ; if they thought that cable or satellite looked like a threat to their own over - the - air transmissions , they might simply refuse to sign a retransmission deal .
And what cable or satellite service could gain traction without offering the major networks ?
The Congressional carve - outs were about more than creating competition , though ; they were also about supporting localism , as much of the rest of the programming on cable and satellite was national .
Today , of course , the power positions are reversed .
Pay - TV has become the norm , with over - the - air broadcasting declining in popularity .
Given the success of the cable and satellite industries , a new 200 + page report from the Copyright Office this week suggests that they no longer need the boost provided by sections 111 and 119 ( satellite 's license for local stations will apparently remain ) .
Instead , market agreements and rates should be the order of the day .
The Copyright Office also found that AT&T's U - Verse and Verizon 's FiOS TV services qualify for the current licenses despite not actually being cable or satellite operators .
Nevertheless , because their systems are functionally similar to those offerings , " both AT&T and Verizon 's operations can be viewed as cable systems and consequently , they may use the Section 111 license to retransmit broadcast signals , provided that they adhere to all of the FCC 's broadcast signal carriage rules , " said the Copyright Office .
Internet broadcasters , however , are n't given the same latitude to retransmit local TV onto the ' Net .
Why is it okay for AT&T to do so , using the same protocol , but not webcasters ?
" First , there are serious questions about signal security that need to be addressed , " said the Copyright Office .
" Second , the United States has entered into a number of Free Trade Agreements with several international trading partners that include provisions prohibiting statutory licensing for the retransmission of broadcast content over the Internet .
Third , carriage of programming on the Internet has been subject to marketplace negotiations and private licensing with some degree of success .
As such , there is no market failure warranting the application of a statutory license in this context . "
While the report is of interest only to those with a passion for the intricacies of copyright law , it is notable for mentioning BitTorrent , Joost , and Slingbox ... positively .
All three are described as making legal Internet video possible and showing the vibrancy of the market .
Mozilla Labs this week took steps to open up its idea factory to wider outside input , asking for community help to develop the next big ideas that might power future browsers .
Like any good research lab , the goal is not an immediate product but a set of innovative ideas that can be played with and debated without the pressure of an immediate implementation .
Mozilla Labs ' " concepts " can consist of three parts : ideas , mockups , or prototypes .
The idea of throwing open the lab to more voices was all about hearing from ... new voices ( surprise ! ) , so Mozilla wants to make sure that plenty of people can contribute , even if they can't hack code .
" You do n’t have to be a software engineer to get involved , and you do n’t have to program , " says the announcement .
" Everyone is welcome to participate .
We ’re particularly interested in engaging with designers who have not typically been involved with open - source projects .
And we ’re biasing towards broad participation , not finished implementations . "
Ideas are simple text descriptions of a new concept .
They 're meant to be thrown out by anyone , then talked about and possibly taken to the next level , which is the mockup .
Mockups turn ideas into pictures or video clips that illustrate how the idea might look and operate in practice .
Finally , prototypes are fully interactive implementations of ideas , though they may not be " fully functional or pretty . "
To illustrate the process , Mozilla commissioned three videos from UI designers , each showing possible ideas for browser development .
While the " Bookmarking & History Concept " and " Mobile Concept " are both quite cool , the " Aurora " idea from Adaptive Path is certainly the most radical potential change to the browser 's look and feel .
Each concept is highly visual and therefore difficult to explain in words , but all three are worth a look .
The Aurora concept
For now , " contributing " a concept is something of a nebulous process .
According to Mozilla , users should just " use your favorite method of sharing an concept with the world .
If it ’s an idea , blog about it .
If it ’s a mockup , put it on Flickr .
If it ’s a prototype , host it on your web site . "
The organization promises more structure is coming soon , however .
A future bookmarking system ?
Mozilla wants to encourage outside innovation in other ways , too , including contests like the recent " Extend Firefox 3 " challenge .
The contest , which will give away a Macbook Air and other prizes any day now , seeks to recognize the best third - party extensions to Firefox 3 .
While Firefox 3 - specific contests are directly related to the browser , the broader call for " concepts " is not .
The ideas developed could easily be gleaned by rivals , but Mozilla is n't worried .
One of the odd benefits of being an open - source developer is that you do n't need to be ( and ca n't be ) as secretive as most in - house commercial development .
While the concepts shown so far may never see release , they do provide more evidence of how the revitalized Mozilla has been driving browser innovation in the last few years .
And not all of that innovation comes from Mozilla itself — AT&T has used the Mozilla codebase as the foundation for its experimental Pogo browser , which seems to be working through visual ideas that are at least superficially similar to some of Mozilla 's concepts .
It is the PM 's first public suggestion of a deadline for US withdrawal from Iraq Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has raised the prospect of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq .
It comes as the US attempts to push through a new security deal before the end of 2008 , when the UN mandate allowing a US presence in Iraq expires .
The Pentagon has played down the suggestion of a withdrawal timetable .
But correspondents say Iraqi MPs would be more likely to back Mr Maliki if the deal includes such a timetable .
The US and Iraqi governments have been negotiating a detailed bilateral Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) since March and it was supposed to be concluded this month .
Many Iraqis want to see an end to the American military presence in their country , but are fearful of the consequences for security .
In renewed violence on Monday , a female suicide bomber killed nine people and wounded 12 others in an attack on a market in the al - Mafraq area west of Baquba in Diyala province , about 50 km ( 30 miles ) north - east of the Iraqi capital , Baghdad .
Respect for sovereignty A statement from Mr Maliki 's office quoted him as telling Arab ambassadors in the UAE : " The direction we are taking is to have a memorandum of understanding either for the departure of the forces or to have a timetable for their withdrawal . "
" The negotiations are still continuing with the American side , but in any case the basis for the agreement will be respect for the sovereignty of Iraq . "
It was the first time that the prime minister had specifically suggested the setting of a timetable for a US withdrawal .
US Pentagon official Bryan Whitman played down Mr Maliki 's suggestion .
" Timelines tend to be artificial in nature , " he told reporters .
" In a situation where things are as dynamic as they are in Iraq ... it 's usually best to look at these things based on conditions on the ground . "
The American position has always been that setting a timetable for withdrawal gives an advantage to insurgents who have been battling US - led forces since the 2003 invasion which overthrow Saddam Hussein .
A possible withdrawal from Iraq has become a major issue in the US presidential election campaign and could also figure prominently in local elections in Iraq in October .

What are these ?
I think that Joel Satalin can add another chapter to his book Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal after reading this story .
I mean , really , a child ’s veggie stand shut down for lack of permits ?
What ’s next , no lemonade stands or car wash fundraisers ?
ABC News via ABA Journal :
Call it a rite of passage : children by the roadside peddling their homemade goodies to adults who are more than eager to drop a few cents into a makeshift cashbox .
But Katie and Sabrina Lewis ’ veggie stand , in the town of Clayton , Calif. , where they sold homegrown watermelons for $ 1 , has been shuttered by town officials who told the girls ’ parents that their daughters ’ venture violated local zoning ordinances .
“ I think that they ’re wrong , ” dad Mike Lewis said of the town officials .
“ Kids should be able to be kids . ”
Of course kids should be able to be kids !
I think that this touches on a separate issue as well , one not mentioned in the article .
Should n’t people have the right to sell the food that they produced on their ( albeit small ) piece of land ?
How does a roadside veggie stand devalue our neighborhoods ?
Especially when it is selling organic food much cheaper than one can find in the “ super ” grocery store .
The last question is , what kind of ultra-conformist calls the mayor to complain about an “ illegal ” activity like this ?
But Clayton Mayor Gregory Manning said he first heard of the girls ’ operation this past April , after two residents called to ask if it was legal .
Two months later , a police officer was sent to the stand to tell the Lewises that the girls were violating zoning regulations that prohibit commercial activities in a residential area .
The stand also violates health regulations , he said , which state that food ca n’t be sold without a permit .
Please check out the full ABC News article ( video too ) .
If you feel compelled , here is the phone number for the City of Clayton government office – ( 925 ) 673-7300 .
Be civil and constructive if you call .
Du har med all säkerhet hört talas om betting online någon gång , kanske har du undrat vad det egentligen innebär ?
Betting är egentligen bara det engelska ordet för vadslagning och vadslagning , ja det innebär ju att man helt enkelt satsar pengar på att något ska inträffa eller inte inträffa .
Alltså handlar betting online om att man satsar pengar på ett resultat som man tror att man vet kommer att inträffa .
Här på Bettingonlinebetting vill vi ge dig all information du kan behöva för att själv börja spela på odds online
De talar nämligen om två viktiga saker för dig ; dels hur sannolikt endera resultaten är och dels hur mycket pengar du kan vinna om du får rätt på din satsning på ett resultat .
Med tanke på hur många olika spelbolag det finns på marknaden som har bettingsajter så kan det här löna sig att titta på några olika .
Det är nämligen så att oddsen på samma evenemang / match och samma resultat kan skilja sig ganska mycket mellan de olika bolagen .
Då är det bra att jämföra lite innan man bestämmer sig för var man ska göra sin satsning .
Det kan helt enkelt vara så att det lönar sig bättre att satsa på ett resultat någon annanstans än man först tänkt .
En gigantisk marknad
Eftersom att det är en så stor marknad och det därmed finns så många olika spelbolag som erbjuder betting online så är det ganska viktigt att kolla så att man spelar på en seriös bettingsajt .
Att man spelar hos ett säkert spelbolag helt enkelt och här är det bra att kolla upp den informationen innan man för över några pengar till ett spelkonto så klart .
Det bästa sättet att göra det på är att kolla upp spelbolagets spellicens .
Den ska finnas lättillgänglig på sajten och det ska stå klart och tydligt var någonstans i världen den är utfärdad .
Först och främst vill du att den ska vara från ett land inom EU så att du slipper vinstskatt .
För det andra vill du inte att den ska vara utfärdad i ett mindre land eller ett land som är svartlistat .
För att ta reda på vilka länder som är svartlistade är det bara att söka på spellicens och landets namn så kommer du att hitta sajter som berättar vilka man inte kan lita på .
Vi rekommenderar alltid att man som nybörjare vänder sig till de större och väletablerade spelbolagen i början .
Det finns flera som är väldigt bra , seriösa och har ett brett spelutbud med bra odds : Unibet , Betsson , Ladbrokes med flera och alla är tillgängliga på svenska .

Vinn på odds på nätet
När man spelar på odds , casinospel eller andra hasardspel , oavsett om det är online eller via ett landbaserat kasino samt ombud , vill man som spelar vinna .
Det är inget konstigt , detta kanske även är en till anledningarna varför man började spela från start och det är ju inte märkligt .
Varje dag eller i alla fall varje vecka hör vi spelare som vunnit drömvinsten i flera hundratusen kronor och den summan är kanske inte riktigt möjligt när du spelar odds online .
Istället handlar det här mer om att vinna lite extra pengar som kan vara gott att ha och om du spelar under en helsäsong , ja då kan vi prata om drömvinster .
Svenska casinon har oftast legat framkant när det kommer till att ha grymma odds och chans till fina vinster !
I Sverige har odds och sport alltid varit något som folk tyckt är intressant .
Det kan man se bland annat i de olika ATG butikerna , där man har sen många år tillbaka kunnat betta på häst och fotboll , då oftast via Stryktipset eller liknade från Svenska Spel .
Detta var innan bomen av alla online casinon och betting bolagen dök upp .
Man får inte heller glömma bort tipslördag som brukade sändas vid 15 tiden på lördagar .
Här visades det oftast en fotbollsmatch från Engelska Premier Leauge och i pausen kunde man kolla på trav , t.ex . V75 , för att sedan fortsätta kolla på sin fotbollsmatch .
Många hade innan matchen börjat gå ner till ATG butiken eller loggat in på något av de olika svenska casino som finns att tillgå för att hitta något bra odds och göra lördagen extra spännande .
Vem vet , ditt lag och din häst kanske vinner och gör din plånbok lite tjockare och gladare !
Och som vi skrev , idag kan man sköta bettingen utan problem via något av de olika svenska betting och spelbolag som finns där ute .
Många av dessa spelbolag erbjuder även livespel och live stream så man kan betta samtidigt som man kollar !
Något som blir allt mer populärt nu för tiden är att betta på olika onlinespel , esport kallas det för .
Det gäller allts å proffesionella matcher i olika slags datorspel .
Många trodde att detta inte var något som skulle bli populärt alls och att datorspel inte kan räknas som en sport men så är alltså inte fallet .
I nuläget är det en stor mängd tävlingar runt om i landet och esport är till och med nationalsporten Sydkorea !
Då Sverige ligger i framkant med teknik är det kanse inte helt överrasknde att vi även har några spelare uppe i toppen .
Att betta på esport är något som växer allt mer och mer varje år och numera finns det till och med casinon som specificerar sig på just esport istället för andra mer klassiska sporter .
Ungdomarna som var intresserade i början är nu vuxna och intresset bara växer för varje år .
Vad för saker kan påverka din spelupplevelse ?
Det finns saker som kan komma att påverka dina vinster och din upplevelse på betting via online betting .
Det finns till exempel ett omsättningskrav som man måste uppfylla innan man kan ta ut sin vinst , vilket vanligtvis endast är en ( 1 ) gång men om du har tagit emot en bonus kan det vara upp till tio gånger beloppet samt om du spelar slots kan det gå ända upp till 50 gånger .
Det här är surt men nödvändigt för att undvika att spelare har ett medlemskap och spelkonto för att spara undan pengar .
Så när du väl gör en insättning kommer den att behöva spelas upp minst en gång .
Sedan finns det något som heter
Rake , vilket är vanligt på alla spelsajter och du kanske har hört talas om begreppet i samband med poker .
Det är en avgift som spelbolaget tar ut oavsett och det är som ett sätt att ta lite av din insats för att kunna underhålla sajten och de spel som du roar dig med .

Att kombinera sport med exempelvis kasinospel som roulette , black jack , poker och spelautomater är precis vad en casino expert gör .
Prova dig fram du också , du är välkommen hos alla internetcasinon , det är vi säkra på !
Asked for his expert opinion of the practice , law professor Joseph Little of the University of Florida overcame a tragic handicap — decades of legal training — to offer a sensible assessment : “ It sounds like robbery to me . ”
That ’s from The Highway to Serfdom , a bit of exposition over at Pro Libertate about the state of law enforcement in this nation as regards the practice of “ asset forfeiture ” .
For those of you who have not had enough ( formal or informal ) legal training ( or perhaps simply cynicism ) drummed into you in this life to recognize what “ asset forfeiture ” means , its a euphemism for the practice of looting and pillaging by the police forces of your own communities and government .
The sort of “ conflict of interest ” ( I put it in quotes because it ’s only a conflict if the police actually intend to protect us from bad people — an increasingly debatable conclusion , these days ) this represents is simply a grander version of probably the biggest problem I have with things like speeding tickets .
The moment you monetize law enforcement procedures like this , you provide strong incentives for law enforcement and the courts to seek out ways to criminalize everyone ’s behavior , to the extent possible .
At the absolute most , it might be okay to allow seized assets to be used to defray the costs of the specific law enforcement operation that resulted in that seizure — but it certainly is n’t a good idea to ever allow the money gained from such a transaction to exceed the costs of the transaction itself .
Protections like that exist in our Constitution , but they ’re subject to interpretation by the courts .
As a result , those protections of our rights are simply not very damned strong , and are easily violated with impunity .
Much of the Constitution is that way — the obvious intent is violated daily , with impunity , because of the manner in which the words used to express that intent is so well - suited to misinterpretation with the help of well - paid lawyers .
I ’m depressed now .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Bush spokesman Scott McClellan should testify under oath on Capitol Hill about his explosive new book in which he sharply criticizes his old boss , a Democratic congressman said Friday .
A book by Scott McClellan has sparked a strong backlash from his former White House colleagues .
Rep. Robert Wexler , D - Florida , said McClellan , who served as the president 's press secretary before leaving the White House in 2006 , would be able to provide valuable insight into a number of issues that the House Judiciary Committee is investigating .
McClellan said Friday that he would be willing to testify .
The committee is looking into the use of prewar intelligence , whether politics was behind the firing of eight U.S. attorneys in 2006 and the leaking of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson 's identity , Wexler said .
" The administration has always called for different kinds of privileges to avoid their officials testifying , but because Mr. McClellan has put all this information in a book , these privileges , I do not believe , would be available to the administration , so we would have a free flow of information , " Wexler said .
Watch Wexler call for McClellan to testify »
Wexler is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee .
As White House spokesman , McClellan defended Bush 's policies during much of the war in Iraq , the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the scandal that followed the leak of Plame Wilson 's identity .
He said Thursday that the latter episode was a " defining moment that caused me to become dismayed and disillusioned with the way things were going in Washington , D.C. "
In the book , McClellan said he was specifically lied to about White House staff members ' involvement in the leaking of Plame Wilson 's identity , including former Bush adviser Karl Rove and Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff .
Watch Cheney talk about McClellan »
Libby was convicted of lying to investigators and a grand jury about his involvement in the CIA leak case .
Bush commuted his sentence .
McClellan also wrote that Bush told him that he had authorized the leaking of Plame Wilson 's identity to the press .
McClellan said he would would be happy to appear before Congress about how the CIA operative 's identity was leaked .
" I 'm glad to share my views , " McClellan said .
" I think I 've made them very clear in the book .
...
Essentially everything I know on that leak episode is written in the book -- what I was told by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
" When I was knowingly misled but only learned that much later , that 's really when I started to become disillusioned at the White House . "
Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino , however , said Friday that the White House says it could invoke executive privilege and prevent McClellan from testifying before the committee , but it has not decided whether to do so .
Watch the White House slam McClellan 's book »
" The law would allow for that , " Perino said , " but by saying that I am not suggesting that 's what would happen or not .
" We do n't have a formal request yet , " she said .
" It 's not a decision we would make prior to getting a formal request . "
But Wexler said that any White House claims of executive privilege would be invalid because McClellan had put much of the information in the public domain with book and multiple television appearances .

McClellan 's new memoir , " What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , " is scheduled for publication Monday .
In it he says the administration became mired in " propaganda " and political spin and played loose with the truth at times .
Read excerpts from the book »
In his book , McClellan wrote that President Bush decided to go war with Iraq shortly after the September 11 attacks and then ordered his aides to make the arguments for it .
" I think very early on , a few months after September 11 , he made a decision that we 're going to confront Saddam Hussein , and if Hussein does n't come fully clean , then we 're going to go to war .
There was really no flexibility in his approach , " McClellan said on NBC's " Today " show Thursday , referring to the former Iraqi dictator .
" Then it was put on the advisers : How do we go about implementing this ; how do we go about doing this ? "

Wexler said McClellan should testify because the public has a right to know what went on behind closed doors .
" The American people deserve to know under oath what is true and what is n't [ and ] what this administration engaged in in terms of a conspiracy to obstruct justice , " Wexler said .
CNN 's Ed Henry contributed to this report .

White House does n't deny McClellan 's Bush - to - Libby leak allegation Eric Brewer

In Scott McClellan 's recent statements to the press regarding his apostasy , he says that one of the things that pushed him over the edge was the revelation on April 6 , 2006 , that President Bush had secretly authorized the selective release to reporters of classified information , something that both the president and his then - spokesman McClellan had been vigorously condemning in their public statements about the Valerie Plame leak case .
" I walk onto Air Force One and a reporter had yelled a question to the president trying to ask him a question about this revelation that had come out during the [ Libby ] legal proceedings , " McClellan told the Today Show 's Meredith Viera on Thursday morning .
" The revelation was that it was the president who had authorized , or enabled , Scooter Libby to go out there and talk about this information .
And I told the president that that 's what the reporter was asking .
He was saying that you , yourself , were the one that authorized the leaking of this information .
And he said , ' Yeah , I did . '
And I was kinda taken aback . "
So " taken aback " evidently that he announced his resignation thirteen days later .
At Friday 's morning gaggle in the White House briefing room I asked Press Secretary Dana Perino whether McClellan 's claim about what Bush said to him on Air Force One was true .
The classified information McClellan was talking about was the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iraq , portions of which were leaked to reporters in the summer of 2003 as part of the Bush administration 's counter - attack on Joe Wilson , who had accused the White House of using twisted intelligence to support the invasion of Iraq .
Yesterday , another reporter asked a similar question , but had interpreted Scott 's remark as referring to the Plame leak , which is not a claim McClellan explicitly makes .
Today I asked Perino the following question ( note : the gaggle was off - camera , and no official transcript was provided by the White House ) : Me : Yesterday you were asked about Scott 's assertion that in early April 2006 he relayed to President Bush a reporter 's question about whether the president had personally authorized Scooter Libby 's leaking of classified information , to which the president replied , according to Scott , " Yeah , I did . "
Did the president make that statement ?
Perino :
The question I got was whether or not the president had authorized the leaking of Valerie Plame 's identity .
That 's not what the book says .
That 's what the question was , that 's not what the book says .
And that 's the question that I did n't answer because I knew that 's not what the book says .
Me : But can you answer my question , right now ?
Perino : I did n't understand your question , because you asked me about a question I was asked yesterday that was mischaracterized .
Me : Well , Scott has asserted that in early April of 2006 he relayed to President Bush a reporter 's question about whether the president had personally authorized Scooter Libby 's leaking of classified information , to which the president replied , according to Scott , " Yeah , I did . "
Did the president say " Yeah , I did " to Scott ?
Perino : I have no idea whether he said that or not .
Me : Well , have you asked him ?
Perino :
No , I have n't .
And I think it 's kind of unreasonable to expect anyone to remember a specific conversation like that .
But let me just say one thing .
That 's commenting specifically on the Libby and Plame case .
Because it 's still a matter of civil litigation , I 'm not going to get myself embroiled in that .
I do n't think there 's anything improper about pushing back on the public record when it needs to be pushed back on .
And the case that you 're talking about is the NIE on Iraq , and that was declassified .
At least that 's the story put out by the Bush administration and by Scooter Libby , who was convicted of two counts of perjury , one count of making false statements to the FBI , and one count of obstruction of justice .
In reality , the NIE was " officially declassified " ( those are Scott McClellan 's words , by the way ) on July 18 , ten days after Scooter Libby leaked it to the New York Times 's Judy Miller in their meeting in the St. Regis Hotel .
But there was something else that Scooter leaked to Judy at that July 8 meeting .
As firedoglake 's Marcy Wheeler has pointed out , Scooter Libby was asked to leak something to Judy Miller on July 8 that was so unprecedented , so hush - hush , so on the Q.T. , that he was n't willing to do it until he had gotten assurances from Vice President Cheney that the president himself had authorized it .
It does n't make sense that he would have been that worried about leaking the NIE , because he had already leaked the NIE twice before , to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post on June 27 , and to David Sanger of the New York Times on July 2 .
So what was it then that made Scooter so nervous ?
The other thing he leaked to Judy that day at the St. Regis was that Joe Wilson 's wife , Valerie Plame , worked for the CIA .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first reporter to ask about the Downing Street memo and the Pentagon analysts scandal at White House briefings .
Human rights group charges : US continues “ renditions ” and operates a floating gulag
By David Walsh
3 June 2008
In a new report , the human rights organization Reprieve ( UK ) alleges that the US government has continued its program of “ rendition ” and secret imprisonment — despite a claim by George W. Bush in 2006 that the illegal practices had been stopped — and also that it holds an unknown number of “ ghost ” detainees aboard US navy vessels .
The report has not been issued , but Reprieve made a press release available Monday and the Guardian in Britain carried a story the same day providing some of the study ’s details .
According to the Guardian , the rights group “ claims there have been more than 200 new cases of rendition [ handing prisoners over to regimes likely to torture them ] since 2006 . ”
Reprieve points to Bush ’s statement on September 6 , 2006 that “ the secret prisons are now empty , ” and says this is not true .
Reprieve and other human rights groups , writes the newspaper , “ have uncovered over 200 new cases of rendition and secret detention .
Many prisoners remain unaccounted for , held without any legal protection . ”
In its press release , Reprieve cites the comment of its director , Clive Stafford Smith : “ By its own admission , the US government is currently detaining at least 26,000 people without trial in secret prisons , and information suggests up to 80,000 have been ‘ through the system ’ since 2001 .
The US government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are , where they are , and what has been done to them . ”
As for the detainees held on US ships , Reprieve alleges in its statement that as many as 17 ships have been employed as “ floating prisons ” since 2001 , and that the “ prisoners have been interrogated under torturous conditions before being rendered to other , often undisclosed locations . ”
The details have emerged from various sources , including the US military and Bush administration officials , the Council of Europe , parliamentary bodies and journalists , “ as well as the testimonies of prisoners themselves . ”
Ships that are known to have held prisoners include the USS Bataan and the USS Peleliu .
An additional 15 ships operating around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , used as a military base by the UK and the US , are suspected by Reprieve of being involved in the practice .
The Guardian notes that the forthcoming human rights report “ will raise particular concerns over the activities of the USS Ashland and the time it spent off Somalia in early 2007 conducting maritime security operations in an effort to capture al - Qaida terrorists . ”
At that time many individuals were abducted by Somali , Kenyan and Ethiopian forces and interrogated by what were most likely FBI and CIA agents .
“ Ultimately more than 100 individuals were ‘ disappeared ’ to prisons in locations including Kenya , Somalia , Ethiopia , Djibouti and Guantánamo Bay .
Reprieve believes prisoners may have also been held for interrogation on the USS Ashland and other ships in the Gulf of Aden during this time , ” reports the Guardian .
Prisoners believed by Reprieve to have been imprisoned on board US ships include Ibn Al Sheikh Al Libi , Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef , John Walker Lindh , and David Hicks .
Sheikh Al Libi , the alleged number three in Al Qaeda , was captured in Afghanistan in late 2001 .
He was handed over to the US and held on the USS Bataan .
According to Reprieve , “ Information derived from Sheikh Al Libi under torture in Egypt — later recanted and admitted by the Administration to be false — was relied upon by George Bush and Colin Powell as justification for going to war in Iraq .
Instead of being taken to Guantánamo Bay in September 2006 with the fourteen other ‘ high - value detainees ’ , Sheikh Al Libi was returned to Libya where he is apparently being held incommunicado and is dying of untreated tuberculosis . ”
The Guardian provides the account of a former Guantánamo detainee who passed on another inmate ’s description of being held on board an amphibious assault ship : “ One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me .
He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship .
They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship .
The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV .
The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo . ”
The allegations about an American “ floating gulag ” are not new .
In June 2004 Human Rights First issued a report ( “ Ending Secret Detentions ” ) on the network of secret global prisons operated by the US .
It alleged that in addition to the notorious US military prisons at Guantánamo , Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan and Abu Ghraib , “ there are detention facilities that multiple sources have reported are maintained by the United States in various officially undisclosed locations , including facilities in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Jordan , on the British possession of Diego Garcia , and on U.S. war ships at sea . ”
US officials refused to confirm or deny the existence of such facilities .
A year later the UN ’s special rapporteur on terrorism , Manfred Nowak , told the Agence France Presse wire service in June 2005 that there were “ very , very serious accusations that the United States is maintaining secret camps , notably on ships , ” adding that the vessels were believed to be in the Indian Ocean region .
The AFP commented : “ The use of prison ships would allow investigators to interrogate people secretly and in international waters out of the reach of US law , British security expert Francis Tusa said .
“ ‘ This opens the door to very tough interrogations on key prisoners before it even has been revealed that they have been captured , ’ said Tusa , an editor for the British magazine Jane ’s Intelligence Review . ”
The American media has been largely uninterested in the existence of a global network of torture facilities , but the Washington Post did carry a piece in December 2004 on a secret ‘ camp within a camp ’ at Guantánamo , in which it commented in passing , “ CIA detention facilities have been located on an off - limits corner of the Bagram air base in Afghanistan , on ships at sea and on Britain ’s Diego Garcia island in the Indian Ocean . ”
However , in November 2005 , in a more extensive piece on the CIA ’s secret prisons , a Post reporter wrote : “ One early idea was to keep them on ships in international waters , but that was discarded for security and logistics reasons . ”
This seems to have been a piece of misinformation .
In response to Reprieve ’s new allegations , a US navy spokesman , Commander Jeffrey Gordon , told the Guardian : “ There are no detention facilities on US navy ships . ”
Gordon qualified this denial by adding that it was a matter of public record that certain individuals had been put on ships “ for a few days ” during what he termed the initial days of detention .
( In one of the few cases whose details are known , John Walker Lindh was held for nearly six weeks on two US navy vessels . )
Gordon “ declined to comment on reports that US naval vessels stationed in or near Diego Garcia had been used as ‘ prison ships . ’ ”
Such denials , of course , are meaningless .
They contradict comments made previously by US military spokespeople .
In December 2001 , for example , General Tommy Franks acknowledged that the US was holding Lindh on one of its vessels , when he told the press , “ We will continue to control him on the Peleliu until the determination is made regarding whether we handle him within the military or whether he is handled on the civilian side . ”
Also in 2001 , questioned about the purpose of detaining prisoners on ships , Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem , spokesman for the US joint chiefs of staff , admitted the practice , when he replied , “ I do n’t know the specifics .
Central command determines for either medical considerations , for the protection of those individuals , for the isolation in the sense of not having forces that would try to come get somebody out of a detention centre , for a security aspect , and obviously an interest to continue interrogation . ”
Reprieve ’s Stafford Smith commented this week , “ The US administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers .
We will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their human rights . ”
On August 24 , 2001 , Microsoft released to manufacturing the final version of Windows XP .
6 years and 11 months later , a new version of XP has gone gold , this time for the OLPC XO computer , also known as the " $ 100 laptop . "
Originally designed to run Linux , the OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child ) XO laptop is targeted at developing nations and those too poor to afford proper computers for education .
The device , which went on sale publicly in November for $ 200 , features wireless connectivity , a built - in camera and a keyboard designed to change languages .
Initial deployments have begun in Afghanistan , Haiti , Mexico , Mongolia , Peru , Rwanda , and Uruguay , as well as in Birmingham , Ala .
However , sales have been much lower than expected , with well under 1 million XOs ordered to date .
OLPC hopes to change that with Microsoft 's help .

The Redmond company announced it was testing a version of XP on the XO last December , citing a desire to provide a " high- quality Windows experience " on OLPC 's devices .
But the limited field trial was far from a sure thing until May , when OLPC announced a deal with Microsoft to ship XP .
Microsoft spent a year modifying XP to ensure it would work on the XO laptops without problems .
But OLPC had work to do as well , including boosting the memory and making hardware adjustments .
The switch from Linux will increase the production costs of the XO from $ 188 to a little over $ 200 .
XP itself will cost $ 3 per each XO shipped .
One of the reasons for offering the low - cost laptop with a slimmed down edition of XP is that buyers were hesitant to adopt the Linux version running software known as " Sugar . "
Sugar operates with a special interface that utilizes symbols instead of words , making the ability to read not a requirement for use .
But while Sugar may work well in small African villages , more developed countries and school systems who signed on as early buyers wanted something similar to a full - fledged computing environment .
With XP on the XO , students can learn the basics and become familiar with Windows and Office , which will help them later in life .
There are plans to release a dual - boot version of the XO , with both Linux and Windows , although no specific timeframe has been set .
" There seems to be more and more momentum around the idea of getting low cost laptops into the hands of children to transform education , and that is a good thing , " remarked Microsoft 's James Utzschneider in a blog posting .
" Windows on the XO looks like it is on track for availability in these types of national educational PC deals in September . "
Existing XO buyers , who took part in the November sale , will not receive Windows .
Although Microsoft did n't specify why , it 's likely due to the different hardware and additional memory required by XP .

This will probably go down in journalism history as one of the classics and Google will never live this down .
Plus you ’ve probably still got the crazies in Georgia , USA hiding in the bushes with their shotguns waiting for the Russian tanks to come rumbling past muttering to themselves “ that Google map thingie said they were coming !
Gotta stay vigilant ! ”
Google Maps , when used in an Associated Press Report about the Georgia conflict ( that ’s the Georgia near Russia ) , got mixed up and decided to use Georgia in the United States instead .
Therefore , the story ended up looking like this :
General confusion reigned .
One USA Georgia resident got worked up and posted a question on Yahoo Answers asking where the tanks were .
Even today , if you put “ Russians invade Georgia ” into Google Maps , you ’ll get this .
But Google should n’t be too embarrassed .
UK ’s Sky News made exactly the same mistake .
Be sure to check out their disclaimer at the bottom :
So if you ’re living in Georgia , you ’d best pack and start heading for the border !
According to Google and Wikipedia , you ’re about to be visited by the Russian Army !
Soy products contain chemicals mimicking female hormones A regular diet of even modest amounts of food containing soy may halve sperm concentrations , suggest scientists .
The study , published in the journal Human Reproduction , found 41 million fewer sperm per millilitre of semen after just one portion every two days .
The authors said plant oestrogens in foods such as tofu , soy mince or milk may interfere with hormonal signals .
However , a UK expert stressed that most men in Asia eat more soy - based products with no fertility problems .
Oestrogenic compounds in food or the environment have been of concern for a number of years , but we have mostly thought that it was boys exposed in the uterus before birth who were most at risk
Dr Allan Pacey
Sheffield University Animal studies have suggested that large quantities of soy chemicals in food could affect fertility , but other studies looking at consumption in humans have had contradictory findings .
The Harvard School of Public Health study looked at the diets of 99 men who had attended a fertility clinic with their partners and provided a semen sample .
The men were divided into four groups depending on how much soy they ate , and when the sperm concentration of men eating the most soy was compared with those eating the least , there was a significant difference .
The " normal " sperm concentration for a man is between 80 and 120 million per millilitre , and the average of men who ate on average a portion of soy - based food every other day was 41 million fewer .
Dr Jorge Chavarro , who led the study , said that chemicals called isoflavones in the soy might be affecting sperm production .
These chemicals can have similar effects to the human hormone oestrogen .
Dr Chavarro noticed that overweight or obese men seemed even more prone to this effect , which may reflect the fact that higher levels of body fat can also lead to increased oestrogen production in men .
Worried men
However , the study pointed out that soy consumption in many parts of Asia was significantly higher than even the maximum found in these volunteers .
Dr Allan Pacey , a senior lecturer in andrology from the University of Sheffield , said that if soy genuinely had a detrimental effect on sperm production , fertility might well be affected in those regions , and there was no evidence that this was the case .
" Many men are obviously worried about whether their lifestyle or diet could affect their fertility by lowering their sperm count .
" Oestrogenic compounds in food or the environment have been of concern for a number of years , but we have mostly thought that it was boys exposed in the uterus before birth who were most at risk .
" We will have to look at adult diet more closely , although the fact that such large parts of the world have soy food as a major part of their diet and do n't appear to suffer any greater infertility rates than those on western diets suggests that any effect is quite small . "

Police drag a Tibetan protester by her hair as she tries to reach a Chinese consular office in Kathmandu August 10 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Gopal Chitrakar
KATHMANDU ( Reuters ) - Nepali police kicked Tibetan protesters and beat them with batons on Sunday before detaining some 230 people marching to a Chinese consular office in Kathmandu , police and witnesses said .
At least two people were seen bleeding from their heads after a scuffle broke out with riot police trying to protect the walled Chinese office .
At least 10 people were injured .
Police said they had rounded up 230 protesters for opposing the Chinese crackdown in Tibet in March and shouting “ Long live the Dalai Lama ” and “ Shame , shame , China , shame ” .
Monks and nuns were among those held .
Nepal is home to more than 20,000 Tibetans who fled Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 .
But the country bars them from engaging in political activities against Beijing .
Kathmandu says
Tibet is part of China , its influential neighbour and trade partner , and has cracked down on near - daily protests against Beijing since the past five months .
Those detained are usually released the same day .
On Friday , authorities detained more than 1,300 Tibetans who protested in Kathmandu as the Olympic Games opened in Beijing .

Compared to colorful designs where catchy colors help the design to stand out , in black - and - white designs the ability to stand out depends only on its ability to communicate rather than on its appealing visual presentation .
Indeed , beautiful black and white photography does n’t attract with its play of colors .
Here close attention to composition , lighting , perspective and the context it is shot in are important .
Hence , before considering the photos presented below please prepare some patience and time .
This post presents some truly excellent examples of beautiful black - and - white photography .
Notice : this post is n’t supposed to showcase the best black - and - white - photos of world ’s best photographers ; please see it as a modest attempt to inspire designers for experimenting with black and white instead of using a variety of vibrant colors all the time .

Very good points .
@ Tests or How simple is simple enough ?
- Requiring unit tests is a huge barrier .
- Keeping unit tests around , i.e. designing the application for testability , requires some abstractions ( e.g. Gallery PhpVm ) which raise the barrier and add bumps to the learning curve .
- Accepting but not requiring tests will lead to breakage of existing tests and a lot of maintenance work for the few that declare to keep the tests up to date .
- Dropping unit tests is bad in the long term .
Even when the core application is slimmed down , we 'll need test automation for QA .
- Drupal , typo3 and other open source PHP projects have started without test automation and some of them have added or are adding tests right now and are willing to require tests for all core code submissions .
I think the key is to keep the core code / the official core project reasonably small .
We do n't have to dumb down the code design of the core application .
It 's sufficient if we make it a lot simpler than it is now .
And there is a lot of potential to make it simpler without getting rid of useful abstractions and design patterns .
We can then design the core with proper abstractions , designing for testability and still provide a reasonably simple code base .
The goal would be that you could do pretty much everything with Gallery without having to modify the code base of the core .
Much more code would live outside of the core application .
I guess there could be a list of officially maintained plugins ( not part of the core project ) and 3rd party plugins .
For the core project we 'd still require tests , for official and 3rd party plugins we'd have maintainers that have their own authority on how to ensure QA , with or without test automation .
There are lessons we can learn from typo3 and other projects in putting processes into place for code and security reviews of non-core code .
End users could then decide to only use 3rd party plugin releases that have been audited for quality and security .
And there are lessons to be learned from projects that have started with usability and simplicity in mind like Zenphoto .
You can start too simple ( no internationalization , no plugin system ) and then get into problems when you need to add all the features people are asking for .
We learned some of those lessons with G1 already .
@three months : I think 3 months is unrealistic to implement a lot of drastic changes .
If you had 2 - 4 full time engineers you could do it in 1 - 2 months .
If you have ~3 engineers working on and off 5 - 15 h a week on this project and have many other things on their mind , then you need a lot more time .
Either way , let 's talk about the time frame later .
Let 's first talk about things that we'd like to change .
Let 's come up with UI ideas , features that should be in there .
And then let 's talk how the UI and those features should be backed by an application / framework .
And then we can talk about how to tackle this , incrementally or not .
@what future do we want to have ?
Everything that has been said is very true .
G2 is too complex , G2 needs a thriving developer community to survive and making things simpler is they key to get there .
Say we achieve all that .
We release the next generation ( NG ) version of Gallery .
Gallery - NG is a pleasure to use , it 's simpler to hack , easier to maintain , etc .
Where do you see the project in 2 years ?
Despite being such a great product , will there still be a market for Gallery ?
I find myself recommending Flickr , picasaweb and other photo hosting services to people that just want to share their images and do n't have any technical background .
Even with neat auto installers , even an easy to install web application requires maintenance ( upgrades ) and it requires more technical knowledge to create a webhosting account than to create a Flickr account .
Gallery ( 1 ) was once the best and easiest way to share your photos on the web .
That was at a time before there were social networks and photo sharingwebsites .
Things have changed and the target audience for self hosted web applications is much smaller today .
Is it smaller in absolute numbers ?
I do n't know .
And for people who prefer having their own website but do n't want to deal with all the maintenance , there are thin solutions that let you present your Flickr / picasaweb photo albums on your own website .
So who is still interested in Gallery ?
What 's the audience we want to target this simplified Gallery application for ?
Your mom ?
No , she'd be a user of a photo hosting service .
Well , unless you 're the maintainer of that service , based on Gallery - NG .
* It 's about people who enjoy freedom .
Freedom not to be limited by the design or feature limitations of a photo service .
Freedom to post any kind of photo / video without worrying that the service cancels your account or deletes your photos without notice .
It 's about people who would like to build their own website and may even have fun doing the occasional upgrades and discovering new features and improvements .
It 's about people who host their own ( small ? ) community website .
Integration features are key in this segment .
Scalability as well .
*
The bulk of the market is using social websites and photo sharing services .
It 's a niche .
But an important niche . < sidenote >
As a sidenote , I see G2 as a special purpose CMS , or application specific CMS .
It 's got most of the infrastructure to be a step away from a really nice CMS , but it never made that step .
It did n't because it 's too complex to attract a larger developer community to thrive a diversification into other markets .
So this Gallery - NG will probably be farther away from being a CMS .
It would be simpler , even more application specific .
</ sidenote >
So , that 's what 's left of the market after taking social websites and photo sharing services into account .
What about general purpose content management systems ( CMS ) ?
CMS are growing into Gallery 's market as well .
Although we invested quite a lot of effort into designing G2 for integration , we are very far from doing an excellent job in this regard .
Mostly because integration is too complex .
I can take the bulk of the blame for that , yay !
And Gallery did n't provide the more modern means to integrate ( RSS , RESTful APIs , etc. ) .
When talking about integration , there are basically two markets : - Integration into mostly static websites , mostly for presentation ( displaying an album , or a slideshow on some website ) .
- Tight integration with a CMS assuming responsibilities for all matters related to photo ( or even media ) management .
My efforts have been mostly targeting the latter market .
Mostly , we made tight integration possible , but still too complex .
I 'd define success as most PHP CMS using Gallery for photo ( or even media ) management and presentation .
Everything else leads to too much duplication and segmentation of effort .
If the bulk of the talent pool could innovate based on the same code base , everyone would get a lot more out their investment .
That 's not where we are .
CMS are implementing their own image / media management solutions .
So let 's look into the future again .
2 years from now , CMS like drupal are still growing their community at an impressive rate and they 'll come with excellent image management features and all the other goodness that their CMS community provides ( mature core project , tons and tons of docs and books , groups working on usability , security , scalability , you name it ) .
They'd have learned their lessons as well and provide application specific installation profiles ( similar to Eclipse , that 's where Drupal is headed ) and thus provide an easy to install Gallery application without having to configure all the CMS options / plugins to get there .
> From the niche that is left after taking photo hosting services into account , what would be left after taking such CMS solutions into account as well ?
Remember what 's left after taking services into account ( see above ) .
Integration is key for most of the remaining users .
It 's going to be hard to compete for this shrinking market .
It 's a fight at two fronts .
Our declared goal is to provide a " best of breed " product and to seamlessly integrate with applications from other areas .
Either we 'd need to give up on tight integration and focus on providing the RSS , REST APIs for integration with small websites , social networking websites etc .
And we 'd lose another piece of the market .
Or we 'd need to keep the gap between our solution and what general purpose CMS can provide reasonably large , else there 's not much incentive to jump through the hoops required to maintain and integrate multiple applications .
And we 'd need to focus even more on tight integration ( this is not about RSS , REST , more about session , user management , search integration , content management features ( e.g. providing some album / item to the CMS via an API ) , template systems , etc. ) .
Which might be at odds with our goal of simplifying things and which certainly requires quite some development effort .
Conclusion : Gallery as a project might not grow much even though we might be doing everything right .
That 's because the niche in which we operate is a shrinking piece of the market , fighting service oriented solutions on one front and CMS solutions on the other .
I see a lot of reasons to believe that Gallery will be more fun to work on in the future that we all envision .
And that might be enough reason to make these things happen .
No matter whether Gallery 's niche is shrinking , no matter whether there 's much potential to grow Gallery 's market share .
So , what future do we want to have ?
Do you want to spend time working in this niche ?
What 's your definition of this niche market , who are the customers you 'd like to have ?
As a developer / contributor , you have to find an answer to that question yourself .
As for integration matters , I think more discussion is needed .
We 'll know more once we talk more concrete about the design of Gallery - NG .

David , Rosenberg , Merrill Lynch 's chief North American economist , says the US Remains Firmly In Recession .
Merrill Lynch ’s David Rosenberg , the first economist from a major bank to declare a US recession was underway back in early January , argues that recent unemployment figures show yet more evidence that the US economy is a deep recession .
My Comment
It is highly improbably for jobs to decline 7 consecutive months and to not be in recession .
Now Canada is following suit with a shocking loss of 55,000 jobs in July .
Please see Canada , Japan Head For Recession for more on the Canadian jobs story .
Pointing to last week ’s news that employment has now declined for six months in a row , Mr Rosenberg , Merrill ’s chief North American economist , says that “ at no time in the past 50 years has this happened without the economy being in an official recession . ”
My Comment
Americans need radical surgery to revive country 's economy
The US economy is in recession .
Period .
And it has been in a recession since January .
This is the mantra of David Rosenberg , the first Wall Street economist to predict America 's current economic woes , back in January , and perhaps one of the most bearish in the economic fraternity .
" The path to financial ruin is littered with calls of a bottom , and I do n't think you want to confuse intermediate bottoms with fundamental bottoms ; I think that is quite a dangerous game to play , " he warns .
" I think what separates my call , say from the consensus , is that I do n't necessarily think this is going to be a mild flash in the pan .
I think this is going to be a long recession . "
" This is an epic event ; we 're talking about the end of a 20 - year secular credit expansion that went absolutely parabolic from 2001 - 2007 . "
But more importantly , Rosenberg argues , is what must take place in the household sector - a sector already ravaged by rising fuel prices , a stagnant housing market and rising levels of unemployment .
In spite of all those problems , Americans are beginning to reduce their debt exposure - as seen in the savings rate , which rose from 0.3 pc to 2.6 pc in the last three months , the third steepest quarterly increase since the Second World War .
Before the US economy can truly begin to expand again , Rosenberg believes the savings rate must rise to pre-bubble levels of 8 pc , that the US housing stocks must fall to below eight months ' supply , and that the household interest coverage ratio must fall from 14 pc to 10.5 pc .
" It 's important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require .
We will probably have to eliminate $ 2 trillion of household debt to get there , " he predicts , saying this will happen either through debt being written off , as major financial institutions continue to do , or for consumers themselves to shrink their own " balance sheets " .
" American households own more than $ 4 trillion of consumer durable goods .
So something tells me that is going to be a venue for shrinking the household side of the balance sheet .
" We 're talking about the silverware , the old antique couch in the basement , unwanted or expensive art , " he goes on .
" This is the future , the future is frugality .
This is the future , the future is frugality

Credit is contracting by any reasonable measure .
It would be contracting at a stunning rate if marked to market .
And from a practical standpoint marked to market is how it must be considered , even if there is no direct measure ( which I might add is on purpose ) .
Instead it is still hidden in marked to fantasy level 3 assets and in SIVs and other off balance sheet vehicles .
See Not Practical To Tell The Truth for this line of reasoning .
M3 is simply not a reasonable measure of credit , nor is MZM .
Inquiring minds will want read Bank Credit Is Contracting for more details .
Trillions of dollars of housing wealth has been wiped out , yet laughably some still talk of hyperinflation .
There has never been a hyperinflation in history where land prices have fallen like they are now .
In fact , there has never been hyperinflation where land prices have declined at all , barring some obscure war zone perhaps .
Bank writeoffs have hit $ 500 billion and $ 2 Trillion is coming .

Auto sales were generally dismal across the board , with Honda the only bright spot as reported in an Auto Makers Report by the Wall Street Journal .
The declines were exacerbated fewer selling days ; there were 24 selling days last month , compared with 27 in June 2007 .
Ford reported 173,462 light - vehicle sales for June , compared with 240,354 a year earlier .
Toyota sold 193,234 vehicles in June , compared with 245,739 a year earlier .
For the second quarter , GM produced 835,000 vehicles , down 307,000 vehicles or 27 % from a year ago .
Looking ahead , GM now expects third - quarter production of 900,000 vehicles , down from its prior view of 1.1 million , amid slashing trucks production by about 209,000 .
Chrysler 's sales slumped to 117,457 from 183,347 , with car sales tumbling 49 % to 29,858 and truck sales decreasing 30 % to 87,599 .
President Jim Press said despite U.S. consumer confidence being at a 16 - year low , " Chrysler is fighting back and making progress by continuing to invest in our products and aligning our volume with the market . "

" Good Morning , Governor , how might we … "
" Mr. President , I realize you are a busy man so let ’s get down to brass tacks …we are calling the ball and withdrawing our support of your Administration and the Federal government in DC .
Effective immediately , we have coordinated to place all outgoing receipts to the IRS in a caged account here in Boise … "
" Governor , you ca n’t do that … "
" Please do n’t interrupt while I am speaking as we are from this point onward peers in the family of nations .
I hope you have reviewed the diplomatic instruments we sent by courier last night to Department of State which delineates the terms of our divorce . "
" I did receive those and you have no earthly idea the can of whoop - … "
" Please , sir , maintain the decorum of these proceedings so we can move forward to an amicable separation .
I give you my personal assurance on the safety and well - being of all Federal personnel we have detained for immediate repatriation to the remainder of these United States .
Any non-law enforcement Federal personnel who wish to remain behind will be permitted to do so . "
" I hope you have thought through the consequences of what you are embarking on . "
" Mr. President , we have had over two hundred years to give the rulers on the Potomac a chance but that time has expired .
Effective immediately , all so - called Federal lands now belong to the nation of Idaho and we will dispose of these lands at our leisure .
In the interest of burying the hatchet , we will not seek compensation for the seizure , abuse and tenure of Federal practices on the aforementioned land and call the balance even . "
" Those are my lands , Governor … "
" In actuality , they belong to neither of us , sir .
On to other business , I have alerted my National Guard forces to establish checkpoints at all the main arterials in and out of Idaho .
All National Guard forces deployed overseas will return home in the next 48 hours .
I would also caution you on the use of military force to convince Idaho and its citizens to forcibly return to the yoke of the Union .
Idaho has a well - deserved reputation as a rather well - equipped state in firearms possession and use .
As Yamamoto said , you may find a rifle behind every blade of grass . "
" Are you threatening the president of the United States ? "
" No , sir , I am simply making an observation about the hazards of one country invading another . "
" You are land - locked , Governor and wholly dependent on federal subsidy for a great deal of employment and infrastructure in Idaho . "
" No longer , the tremendous tax burden across the spectrum formally imposed in our nation as a subject State in your country is now effectively terminated and we are going to unleash the free market to address all of our former shortcomings as a result of the overarching government supremacism practiced here before .
In telephone conversations with my neighboring governors , we are on the verge of Confederation negotiations that will pave the way for Idaho embassies in British Columbia , Montana , Utah and Wyoming .
We do intend on opening a consular office in DC as soon as we can ensure the diplomatic baggage containing sufficient weapons assures our safety in the greater DC metropolitan area for our diplomatic personnel . "
" Governor , what Constitutional right do you have to secede from the US ? "
" Mr. President , the behavior you have exhibited toward the Constitution has been at best characterized by active neglect and abhorrence for the restraint on governance in the Bill of Rights .
I am rather surprised you would resort to assuming the document in any way has weight in Washington , DC .
I would suggest my rights extend as far as our ability to throw off what has become a government of occupation instead of cooperation .
We resign , sir and wish to go in peace . "
" I will use every measure in my arsenal to force you back into the fold . "
" Mr. President , thank you for the heads - up but we have taken certain precautions to ensure that any rash measures on your part have a disproportionate impact in the DC / Virginia corridor .
Please do n’t press us on the issue .
I would like to offer one more rather moderate important proposal to our future business .
These United States as administered by DC are now essentially bankrupt .
War on the world , out of control spending and borrowing , debt and deficit , non-funded future liabilities in the tens of trillions and a banking infrastructure rotten at every level has pushed the US to an economic abyss from which it cannot shrink .
We will provide you a demonstration project of tiny government , free banking and a formerly enslaved citizenry unleashed to realize their potential with no government interference .
We simply wish to go our own way untethered from the Remora Nation DC came to symbolize . "
" Governor , this conversation is over . "
" Good day , Mr. President . "

My recent piece on the death of neckties generated far more critical mail than anything else I have written for LRC .
Most of the mail contained one of two common threads : some wrote that I was " unlibertarian " for expressing a fondness for ties ; while the others complained that an expectation for someone to wear a tie ( presumably , by anyone in any situation ) is a suppression of " individual liberty . "
Since it appears that some may have misconceptions about what libertarianism is — and what it is not , let ’s examine these two fundamental misunderstandings in more detail .
1. Libertarianism is not necessarily a moral endorsement for all voluntary behavior .
Libertarianism is only a political philosophy ; it has nothing to do with religion , other types of philosophy , morality outside of politics , etc .
It seeks only to address the question of when it is permissible for one person to initiate force against another — and the conclusion it draws is " never . "
This conclusion is based mostly on the rationale that everyone is born , by virtue of being a human being , with a natural right to control their own lives , bodies , and property , so long as they are not infringing on anyone else ’s body or property .
But it ’s also based , to a lesser extent , on the pragmatic fact that force is the least efficient way of accomplishing anything , and it produces all kinds of unintended , adverse consequences ( like black markets ) .
So , while they may disagree on the details of how best to bring it about ( no government , one kind of government vs. another , etc. ) , all libertarians , by definition , believe in liberty , which is a condition where everyone is legally free to do as they please , so long as they are not committing tangible damage to anyone ’s body or property .
As Murray Rothbard wrote in his essay , Six Myths About Libertarianism , " The fact is that libertarianism is not and does not pretend to be a complete moral , or aesthetic theory ; it is only a political theory , that is , the important subset of moral theory that deals with the proper role of violence in social life .
Political theory deals with what is proper or improper for government to do , and government is distinguished from every other group in society as being the institution of organized violence .
Libertarianism holds that the only proper role of violence is to defend person and property against violence , that any use of violence that goes beyond such just defense is itself aggressive , unjust , and criminal .
Libertarianism , therefore , is a theory which states that everyone should be free of violent invasion , should he free to do as he sees fit except invade the person or property of another .
What a person does with his or her life is vital and important , but is simply irrelevant to libertarianism .
" It should not be surprising , therefore , that there are libertarians who are indeed hedonists and devotees of alternative life - styles , and that there are also libertarians who are firm adherents of u2018 bourgeois ’ conventional or religious morality .
There are libertarian libertines and there are libertarians who cleave firmly to the disciplines of natural or religious law .
There are other libertarians who have no moral theory at all apart from the imperative of non-violation of rights .
That is because libertarianism per se has no general or personal moral theory .
Libertarianism does not offer a way of life ; it offers liberty , so that each person is free to adopt and act upon his own values and moral principles .
Libertarians agree with Lord Acton that u2018liberty is the highest political end ’ — not necessarily the highest end on everyone ’s personal scale of values . "
There are numerous behaviors that libertarians believe should be legal — such as prostitution , recreational drug use , smoking , gambling , eating an unhealthy diet , drinking alcohol excessively , etc. — that they may also regard variously as unwise , self - destructive , immoral , unethical , gross , etc .
It ’s ludicrous to assert that , if you ’re a libertarian , you ca n’t have any opinions , preferences , likes , dislikes , etc. about any of the peaceful , voluntary behavior you believe should be legal , and with which you have no desire to forcibly interfere .
Using ties as an example , it would be unlibertarian of me to wish for the government to force men to wear ties , or not wear them ( except for government employees , which would be the government ’s implied prerogative under a voluntary , employer - employee contract ) .
Of course , I do not advocate any such thing , nor did I even hint at it in my article .
By contrast , it is in no way unlibertarian for me to wish that more men chose to wear ties ; to bemoan the erosion of standards of proper attire in society ; or even to wish that voluntary establishments on the market , like employers and restaurants , would institute stricter dress codes on their property .
2. Libertarianism is not an exaltation of individual liberty above all — especially not above property rights .
Indeed , it could not be , because individual liberty and property rights are indistinguishable .
Again , libertarianism is only a political philosophy , so it advocates individual liberty as it relates to the State .
( Anyone outside of the political system who initiates force against others is , by definition , a criminal . )
Libertarianism has nothing to do with individual liberty outside of politics .
Further , individual liberty is not only compatible with property rights ; it is wedded indivisibly to it .
One person ’s unfettered individual liberty ends where another person ’s property begins .
In Chapter 15 of The Ethics of Liberty , Murray Rothbard wrote , " Liberals generally wish to preserve the concept of u2018 rights ’ for such u2018 human ’ rights as freedom of speech , while denying the concept to private property .
And yet , on the contrary the concept of u2018 rights ’ only makes sense as property rights .
For not only are there no human rights which are not also property rights , but the former rights lose their absoluteness and clarity and become fuzzy and vulnerable when property rights are not used as the standard . "
As an example of this , if an employer required his employees to wear any clothes during their working hours , would any sane person assert that the employer is infringing on an employee ’s " individual liberty " to walk around naked anywhere he wants ?
Obviously not , because the employee has no such " right " on someone else ’s property ; the best he can have is the privilege , given by the property owner .
Likewise , how can an employer be said to infringe on an employee ’s " individual liberty " by requiring a certain kind of clothing , such as a necktie , during working hours on the employer ’s property , in the context of a voluntary relationship ?
He cannot ; under the libertarian concept of property rights , an employee has as much " individual liberty " to flout his employer ’s dress code on his employer ’s property as he has to punch his employer in the face for no reason .
But , if the employee does n’t like his employer ’s rules , he still has all the individual liberty in the world in such a situation — to exit the employer ’s property and find another job .
Conclusion
Libertarianism is not a philosophy of morality or a guide to proper behavior .
It is simply a political philosophy that holds that everyone should be legally free ( in other words , free from coercion ) to do as they please , so long as they do n’t violate anyone ’s body or property ( in other words , so long as they do n’t initiate coercion against anyone else ) ; and that the State , if it should exist , should be bound by the same rules as the rest of society .
And that philosophy of liberty is grounded in property rights — not in unfettered individual liberty , regardless of the property owner ’s wishes .

Smaller bars are better .
Wow .
I compared WebKit ’s new Squirrel Fish bytecode JavaScript interpreter against Tamarin , the JIT JavaScript engine currently in Flash 9 and in development for Firefox .
On the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark , Squirrel Fish is at least 1.9 times faster than Tamarin with tracing turned on ; 1.8 times faster than vanilla Tamarin , the same engine used in Flash 9 .
When you add type annotations to Tamarin ( Squirrel Fish does n’t support them ) , Tamarin gets a little faster , but is still slower than Squirrel Fish on these benchmarks .
Keep in mind , Squirrel Fish ’s reported times include source compilation , while Tamarin is executing pre-compiled bytecode outside the test .
First Impressions
I can imagine the “ performance per watt ” power consumption for Squirrel Fish is also much lower .
Good for my iPhone ’s battery life .
I think I ’m wrong about the importance of JITs .
At least until Squirrel Fish has gone through a few rounds of optimizations .
ECMAScript 4 type annotations can clearly help in performance critical code , but most of the web executes in untyped , vanilla JavaScript .
Notes on my tests : Running SunSpider , tamarin - tracing , tamarin - central , and Squirrel Fish all pulled from source on 2008 - 06 - 02 .
I ran the test on a 2.4 Ghz iMac .
Raw numbers from the comparison runs are available here .
Running your own version of the tests
To reproduce these tests , build WebKit , build tamarin - tracing and tamarin - central from Mozilla.org , and install the Flex SDK for a bytecode compiler .
Then ,
Set up your environment as follows : DYLDFRAMEWORKPATH="~/jsbench/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release "
ASC=" ~/jsbench/asc.jar "
GLOBALABC="~/jsbench/tamarin-tracing/core/builtin_full.abc "
Create a “ timer.js ” file that adds getTimer to the SunSpider benchmark : function getTimer ( ) { return new Date ( ) ; } Create a “ jscore ” script that will run the original SunSpider AS source files instead of the ABC bytecode files : #!/bin/sh ~/jsbench/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/testkjs -f ~/jsbench/timer.js -f echo $ 1 | sed s/abc / as/
And call the runtests .py script in the SunSpider test / performance sub- directory : ./runtests.py -- avm ~/research / jsbench/jscore --avm2 ~/research/jsbench/tracing-avmshell ./runtests.py -- avm ~/research / jsbench/jscore --avm2 ~/research/jsbench/central-avmshell

Sometimes the bad news is the good news .
So it is with the report that retail sales are down by 0.1 percent in July , the sharpest drop in many months .
Why good news ?
It means that consumers are starting to cut back .
They could be going into less debt .
They might be saving more .
They are being more careful about long - term plans pending short - term trends .
These are all preconditions for recovery .
It ’s only bad news if one adopts the crude theory that economies are sustained by consumer spending .
The truth is nearly the opposite .
Consumer spending is the final payoff for the less visible foundation of growth , which is real saving and investment — that is , making the choice for the future over the present .
What declines in retail spending indicate is a coming to terms with reality .
I ’ll state again what everyone familiar with the Mises - Hayek business cycle knows : the downturn is a response to an artificially inflated economic structure .
Loose credit , courtesy of the Federal Reserve , has been sucked into certain sectors and industries in a way that can not be sustained .
The response of sell - offs and business failures represents an injection of reality into an unreal bubble .
Far from being something to regret , the economic downturn should cause us to breathe a sigh of relief .
And by the way , this is not new knowledge .
F.A. Hayek spelled all this out in his amazing writings between the wars , now recently collected and available for the first time in decades in a new book published by the Mises Institute : Prices and Production and Other Works .
These essays explain not only the Depression but also our current plight , which stems from the same root in a Fed - driven banking system that turns credit on and off like a monkey playing with a fire hydrant .
It does damage by sending false signals to investors .
But the free market will not be fooled in the long run .
And what we are seeing now is the market process .
Nonetheless , the stock markets took the retail news as a bad sign that the stimulus package — you might have received a check in the mail — did n’t work .
Sure enough , the media are crowing that the rebate was a bust .
Surely , the economy would have bounced back by now if Bush had been right !
This kind of commentary amounts to nothing but political one - upmanship .
That so - called stimulus is nothing compared with the vast reach of global capital markets .
This is n’t the 20th century when small decisions made in Washington have huge effects .
For anyone to believe that the pathetic stimulus can actually swing macroeconomic trends is like believing that leaning this way or that on the Titanic would cause it to sink or float .
In any case , listen , folks : there are no controlled experiments in economics and social science generally .
We have no idea based on the evidence alone whether the stimulus worked or did n’t work .
How much lower might the economy have sunk without it ?
Or what if the economy had bounced back due to some cause completely unrelated to the tax rebate ?
It is not as simple as it is in the natural sciences .
You ca n’t isolate a control and then change one element to a duplicate and compare the results .
The issue is that human beings have volition .
They are not atoms , rocks , or planets .
Given that there are so many of them moving and choosing at once , there is zero chance that you can empirically isolate the factors that go into events in a way that teases out the cause of anything .
Brush away all the econometric modeling and you end up with the real basis for why people conclude this or that policy “ worked ” or “ did n’t work . ”
It comes down to politics .
This is one reason we should resist any government program no matter how much we think it will or wo n’t work .
In the end , we ca n’t really know the relationship of cause and effect .
So how can we know what is true and what is not in the social sciences ?
You have to use your noggin .
There is a long tradition of economics that argues that the way to economic truth comes via deductive logic that is then applied to the real world .
This is precisely the path that Hayek took in his writings .
And this is why his model continues to apply to the world around us .
He was n’t arguing that loose credit caused only one cycle in one country .
He was arguing that whenever and wherever credit is expanded beyond market dictates by a central bank , the result will be economic distortion .
In the end , reading his book will profit you more than reading all the ridiculous business - page speculations about the political cause of trends .
Once you understand this , you too will see that what appears to be bad news is often good news .
The opposite is also true .
So - called good news can foreshadow worsening times .
The only way to really discern the difference is to study , think , and pay very little attention to the numbskulls who give running commentary on the government statistics of the day .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil prices , which have hit record levels , are not driven by speculation and will stay high , pushed upwards by sustained demand , the head of Total 's TOTF .
PA exploration and production business said on Tuesday .
“ We would anticipate very robust prices , ” Yves - Louis Darricarrere told the Reuters Global Energy Summit .
U.S. crude in May hit a record of $ 135.09 a barrel and was close to $ 126 a barrel on Tuesday .
“ I do n’t share the view that the price is resulting from speculation , ” Darricarrere said further .
“ I have many reasons .
What we have is clearly demand which is still sustained and which has been very much sustained . ”
Other factors included the lack of spare production capacity and political unrest in oil - producing countries .
Demand is faltering in developed countries , where growth is slowing after several years of economic strength , but any slowdown there would be offset by rising consumption in China , India , the Middle East and “ hopefully Africa as well ” .
He said that if 10 million extra people in Asia bought a car , even if it were a fuel - efficient Tata car , that would add up to substantial demand .
“ All these countries have the right to develop .
All that will certainly continue to increase demand , ” he said .

A former high - ranking Justice Department official was accused Monday of criminal conflict of interest in the latest case stemming from the investigation of disgraced GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Robert Coughlin was deputy chief of staff of the Justice Department ’s criminal division — the same division handling the Abramoff probe — before resigning a year ago , citing personal reasons .
He was due in federal court in Washington on Tuesday for a plea hearing .
Prosecutors accused Coughlin in court papers Monday of providing assistance from 2001 - 2003 to a lobbyist and the lobbyist ’s firm while receiving gifts from the firm and discussing prospective employment there .
The lobbyist is n’t named but The Associated Press has previously reported that Coughlin was lobbied during the period in question by Kevin Ring , a member of Abramoff ’s lobbying team who also is under investigation .
At the time Coughlin worked for the Justice Department ’s office of legislative affairs and its office of intergovernmental and public liaison , and Ring worked for Abramoff ’s Greenberg Traurig firm .
Coughlin talked with Ring about going to work for Greenberg , according to an attorney with knowledge of the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation .
Ring also provided Coughlin with meals and tickets to events , the AP has reported .
Attorneys for Coughlin declined comment and Ring ’s attorney did n’t immediately return a call for comment .
The investigation of Coughlin ’s conduct was handled by federal prosecutors in Maryland because of his ties at Justice Department headquarters .
The document filed in court Monday is known as an information and is normally filed as part of a plea deal .
Ring and Coughlin worked together for John Ashcroft when he was a Republican senator from Missouri , before he became attorney general in 2001 .
Ring lobbied Coughlin and other Justice Department officials on a variety of issues , including getting federal money for a jail for the Choctaw tribe .
The Justice Department probe of Abramoff and his team of lobbyists has led to convictions of a dozen people , including former Rep. Bob Ney , R- Ohio , and former Deputy Interior Secretary Steven Griles .
At least one current member of Congress , Rep. John Doolittle , R - Calif. , remains under investigation .
Ring worked for Doolittle , who is retiring from Congress at the end of this year , before going to work for Abramoff .
Abramoff is serving prison time for a criminal case out of Florida and has not yet been sentenced on charges of mail fraud , conspiracy and tax evasion stemming from the influence - peddling scandal in Washington .
Associated Press writers Lara Jakes Jordan and Matt Apuzzo contributed to this report .

Stocks ended a volatile session in the red on Tuesday , despite a sharp drop in oil prices , after economic policy makers issued dour predictions and skepticism arose about the government ’s efforts to shore up the nation ’s financial sector .
The Dow Jones industrial average ended below 11,000 for the first time in two years , and the broader Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index declined 1.1 percent .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the beleaguered mortgage finance giants , fell for the fifth day in a row , despite attempts by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to reassure investors about the government ’s rescue plan for the companies .
Freddie Mac shares lost 26 percent , and Fannie Mae ended down 27 percent .
Battered bank stocks also closed mostly in the red , although Lehman Brothers managed a 7 percent gain .

Chevy Volt 2010 Unveiled in Transformers 2 Spy Footage
August 29th , 2008 by Courtney Carlisle Bolton
Thank goodness for over eager car buffs and Transformer fans – this morning , our friends at Jalopnik posted some great “ spy ” pics of the yet - to - be- released 2010 Chevy Volt and got some great video of it in it ’s break out role in Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
Much more aerodynamic and traditional than the uber - sleek concept picture , this cobalt blue Chevy Volt featured in a chase scene video here , looks road ready for consumers .
Check out those wheels … wonder if those will come standard ?
The highly touted and much discussed Volt uses a lithium - ion battery with a variety of range - extending onboard power sources and a common 110 – volt household plug .
For someone who drives less than 40 miles a day , Chevy Volt will use zero gasoline and produce zero emissions .
It will also fight alongside Optimus Prime to save the world from the Decepticons .
Somebody better tell Bill Reinert over at Toyota not to count the Chevy Volt out just yet …

There can be few things scarier than having your vehicle breakdown in an area where you do not speak the language .
It pays to be prepared if touring Europe , breakdown insurance can not only give you peace of mind , it can help bridge that linguistic gap .
You wo n’t have to worry about dealing with an auto mechanic who does n’t speak your language or trying to explain to someone who has little or no English the events that led up to your vehicle ceasing to function .
Excitement and Fun
Europe has it all when it comes to vacationing .
There are historical monuments , artworks , theaters , beaches and so much more .
But if your primary language is English and you do not speak other languages , it can be just a little scary to engage in a motor tour all on your own .
Breakdown coverage can bridge that gap .
Most companies that provide European breakdown policies have an English - speaking helpline team , and some even provide for emergency accommodation and alternative travel options .
This can be extremely beneficial if you are entering or exiting a country where you do not speak the language .
Fringe Benefits
In addition to the obvious benefits , which include a mechanic who will come to you and assist with getting your vehicle either repaired or towed , European breakdown policies sometimes include assistance with travel plans , and provide dual recovery – a policy that will get you to your planned destination and home again , so your vacation is not ruined .
It can also help bring your vehicle home if it must be left at a repair shop when you return home .
What Vehicles are Covered
In addition to covering passenger vehicles , companies often provide coverage for motorcycles , motorhomes , and caravans .
This includes coverage for your caravan when it is parked in an RV park .
More than that , some policies include replacing leisure batteries , and even include a two - year warranty for the replacement .
Standard Coverage , of Course
You will , of course , receive the standard coverage as well as the bells and whistles .
A standard breakdown insurance policy will send a licensed , certified mechanic to you with an assortment of standard supplies and parts .
If the necessary part is not available or if the repair cannot be taken care of in a timely or safe manner by the roadside , your vehicle will be towed to a local repair facility .
Depending upon the type of coverage that you have , and the age of your vehicle , your insurance might even pay for a large part of the repair bill , especially if it is a big - ticket item such as a transmission or motor that requires repair .
Confidence when You Travel
European breakdown insurance policies come in different sorts and lengths of time .
You can take out a policy just for that special trip , or you can maintain one for the year around .
Having a policy in place means that you can drive with confidence , needing only to focus on controlling your vehicle and watching out for the other drivers .
Of course , you will want to have your standard vehicle policy , which should include both liability and collision coverage , neither of which are included in your breakdown insurance policy , although they might all go together as a bundle .
Why it is Always a Good Idea to Have Coverage
You might be the best driver in the world , and be very conscientious about upkeep on your vehicle , but insurance is about being prepared for the unexpected and having a little security in an uncertain world , and there is nothing wrong with that .
John Pilger and Joshua Frank have written on Obama ’s centrist positions and I would like to add my supporting views .
Senator Obama ’s views of late toward Iran and the Arab - Israeli conflict are not shifts to the center or flip - flopping in his policies .
The senator has always viewed Iran as a threat to world peace and has always supported Israel and current Israeli policy toward the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip .
Now , he merely expands on his already expressed beliefs that somehow were ignored or forgotten by his die - hard supporters .
He is also on track with the Democratic Party leadership in Congress .
Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published two articles in the New Yorker magazine which laid out the collusion of both Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and the Senate , and the fact that they are aware of current military action against Iran .
In his book , Audacity of Hope , published in 2006 , Senator Obama wrote , “ Our dependence on oil … undermines our national security .
A large portion of the $ 800 million we spend on foreign oil every day goes to some of the world ’s most volatile regimes  Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , Venezuela , and , indirectly at least , Iran …
We need to maintain a strategic force posture that allows us to manage threats posed by rogue nations like North Korea and Iran … and to meet the challenges presented by potential rivals like China . ”
In a March 2007 speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , Obama blamed Hezbollah for the violence in Lebanon and , in turn , blamed Iran for supplying Hezbollah ; claiming Iran is a major threat to world peace .
Then , in October 2007 , Senator Obama criticized Senator Hillary Clinton voting in favor of a resolution to allow President Bush a “ blank check ” to attack Iran .
Obama opposed the resolution which called an Iranian military unit a terrorist organization .
He nevertheless views Iran as a threat to world peace .
In his June 4 , 2008 speech before AIPAC , he continued the claim that , “ Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad ’s regime is a threat to all of us …
The danger from Iran is grave , it is real , and my goal will be to eliminate this threat …
Finally , let there be no doubt : I will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally Israel .
Sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation .
But that only makes diplomacy more important . ”
He continued to describe himself as a “ friend of Israel ” and a supporter of AIPAC .
He proclaimed a bond between the United States and Israel that is “ rooted in the shared values ” of the two nations .
His concerns extended to Holocaust deniers , such as President Ahmadinejad of Iran and “ terrorist groups and political leaders committed to Israel ’s destruction …
Those who threaten Israel threaten us , ” Obama stated .
He will make sure Israel is armed to deal with any “ threat . ”
These views parallel the mainstream of Democratic Party thinking .
So , rather than surprise , it is important that critics realize that Obama is merely expanding on his statements and has always held a centrist policy with regards to Iran .
While I am not a huge fan of cartoons – adult or otherwise , I have seen most of the ones on this list and do have many fond memories of watching cartoons as a child .
I hope this list will be a nice trip down memory lane for many of our readers !

Starring the Warner siblings , Yakko , Wakko , and Dot , the Animaniacs was a variety show style cartoon usually consisting of anywhere from 1 to 3 segments .
Though the most notable are the Warner siblings , there was a wide variety of characters with each pair or set acting in its own plot .
Due to a large audience of adults , making up over 20 % of the viewers , The Animaniacs led to one of the first Internet - based fandom cultures .
The show lasted 99 episodes , put out the movie Wakko ’s Big Wish , and spawned another successful cartoon Pinky and the Brain .
6 Ren and Stimpy
Production Period : 1991 - 1996 , later 2003
Channel : Nickelodeon , later Spike TV
This series follows the duo of the neurotic asthma hound Chihuahua Ren , and simple minded Manx cat Stimpy as they get caught in nonsensical adventures .
The show ’s violence and scatological humor , along with slow production times , led original creator John Kricfalusi to be fired in 1992 .
Games Animation took over in 1993 with a “ lighter , gut funny type of show ” instead of “ truly frightening ” episodes .
In 2003 Kricfalusi re-launched the series as Rend and Stimpy “ Adult Party Cartoon ” on Spike - TV .
This new version explored more adult themes , including a more explicitly homosexual relationship between the two main characters , and produced only 3 of 9 promised episodes before being removed .

After 4 seasons and 52 episodes on Nickelodeon , he show was bought in 1996 by Disney , and aired on ABC .
Releasing it as “ The Brand Spanking New ! Doug ” , and later “ Disney ’s Doug ” , the show many noticeable changes , and was far less popular with old audiences .
Disney produced 3 seasons , and 64 episodes .
A movie was also spawned by Disney , entitled “ Dougs First Movie ” .
3 Hey Arnold !
Production Period : 1996 -2004
Channel : Nickelodeon
Arnold is a fourth - grader who lives with his Grandma and Granddad in a boarding house in the fiction city of Hillwood ( which highly resembles New York ) .
Arnold is often caught up in a predicament , or helping a school mate with a personal problem .
Originally a comic started in 1986 , a claymation episode got it picked up by Nickelodeon , where it was formed into cel- animation and had 5 seasons and 100 episodes .
In 2003 they released a movie named “ Hey Arnold ! : The Movie ”
2 X- Men
Production Period : 1992-1997
Channel : Fox Kids
Staring the original early 90 ’s comic cast drawn my Jim Lee , the cartoons follows the same story line as the comics .

This is one of the longest lasting shows on Fox Kids running 5 seasons and 76 episodes , second only to Batman , and is also one of Americas most viewed and highest rated morning programs in history .
1 Rocko’s Modern Life
Production Period : 1993 -1996
Channel : Nickelodeon
Following the wallaby Rocko , and his surreal life in the city of O - Town , the cartoon was laced with double entendres , sexual innuendo , and written by a guy who had little to no experience with cartoons or kids .
The shows success mostly came from the fact that it was aimed at kids and their parents , and every story was “ funny ” and “ strong ” .
The animation was very unique , with no parallel lines , hand painted backgrounds , odd colors , and oddly shaped anthropomorphic animal characters .
The original writer and creator Joe Murray could no longer continue the constant work and handed the show off to someone else after the 3rd season , but still reviewed every episode .
Even though Murray encouraged the show to continue , they stopped after the 4th season , with 52 episodes behind it .

" MapReduce " は Google のバックエンドで利用されている並列計算システムです。検索エンジンのインデックス作成をはじめとする、大規模な入力データに対するバッチ処理を想定して作られたシステムです。
MapReduce の面白いところは、map ( ) と reduce ( )
という二つの関数の組み合わせを定義するだけで、大規模データに対する様々な計算問題を解決することができる点です。
Perl によるデモ - MapReduce :: Lite MapReduce は、ネットワーク上での複数ホストでの分散 / テラバイト級のデータを扱う前提 / 冗長性などを放棄して、map( ) と reduce ( ) の組み合わせにより多数の問題を解くフレームワーク部分のみに絞ってみた場合にはそれほど難しくはありません。(もちろん、この前提では、役にも立ちません。) 単一ホスト上で動作させることを前提に Perl で MapReduce のこのコア部分を MapReduce :: Lite として実装してみました 。MapReduce :: Lite という名前とは裏腹に 、Moose と ithreads を使っているので非常にヘビーです。ソースコードは github で公開しています 。
http://github.com/naoya/mapreduce-lite/tree/master この MapReduce :: Lite を使って Apache のアクセスログを解析し、あるログファイルに含まれる HTTP ステータスコードの出現回数を数えてみます 。MapReduce を操作するプログラマになりきった気持ちで、以下のようなログ解析用のコードを書きます。
#!/usr/bin/env/perl package Analog :: Mapper ; use Moose ; with ' MapReduce : : Lite : : Mapper ' ; sub map { my ( $ self , $ key , $ value ) = @_ ; my @elements = split / \s+ / , $ value ; if ( $ elements [ 8 ] ) { $ self - > emit ( $ elements [ 8 ] , 1 ) ; } } package Analog : : Reducer ; use Moose ; with ' MapReduce : : Lite : : Reducer ' ; sub reduce { my ( $ self , $ key , $ values ) = @_ ; $ self - > emit ( $ key , $ values - > size ) ; } package main ; use FindBin : : libs ; use MapReduce : : Lite ; my $ spec = MapReduce : : Lite:: Spec->new ( intermidate_dir => " ./tmp " ) ; for ( @ ARGV ) { my $ in = $ spec -> create_input ; $ in -> file ( $ _ ) ; $ in->mapper ( ' Analog : : Mapper ' ) ; } $ spec->out -> reducer ( ' Analog : : Reducer ' ) ; $ spec->out -> num_tasks ( 3 ) ; mapreduce ( $ spec ) ; Analog : : Mapper に map ( ) を 、 Analog :: Reducer に reduce ( ) を定義します。 map ( ) には ( ログのファイル名 => ログの一行 ) のペアが渡ってくるので、行を解析してステータスコードに相当する箇所を取り出し、先の
Google 論文の例に同じく ( ステータスコード => 1 ) というペアにして emit します 。
reduce ( ) の引数には key - values ペアが渡ってきます。values は
List :: RubyLike ( 参考 : http://d.hatena.ne.jp/naoya/20080419/1208579525) になっているので、size メソッドでリストの要素数を数えて emit します。
main 部分では 、MapReduce :: Lite に計算命令を出すためにパラメータを調整します。 このスクリプトを analog.pl として実行すると、 [ naoya@colinux MapReduce - Lite ] % perl examples / analog.pl /var/log/httpd/access_log 200 => 4606 304 => 262 404 => 24 500 => 43 という出力が得られます。 もう一つ別に、/etc/passwd から各列の単語の出現回数を数えるプログラムも作ってみました。
#!/usr/bin/env/perl package TermCount :: Mapper ; use Moose ; with ' MapReduce : : Lite :: Mapper ' ; sub map { my ( $ self , $ key , $ value ) = @_ ; for ( split / : / , $ value ) { next unless $ _ ; if (! m! ^ \d+ $ ! ) { $ self - > emit ( $ _ => 1 ) ; } } } package TermCount : : Reducer ; use Moose ; with ' MapReduce : : Lite : : Reducer ' ; sub reduce { my ( $ self , $ key , $ values ) = @_ ; $ self - > emit ( $ key => $ values - > size ) ; } package main ; use FindBin : : libs ; use MapReduce : : Lite ; my $ spec = MapReduce : : Lite:: Spec->new ( intermidate_dir => " ./tmp " ) ; for ( @ ARGV ) { my $ in = $ spec -> create_input ; $ in -> file ( $ _ ) ; $ in->mapper ( ' TermCount : : Mapper ' ) ; } $ spec->out -> reducer ( ' TermCount : : Reducer ' ) ; $ spec->out -> num_tasks ( 1 ) ; mapreduce ( $ spec ) ; map ( ) では /etc / passwd の各行を " : " で split して列に分けて emit、reduce ( ) では例によって 1 の数を数えます。 [ naoya@colinux MapReduce - Lite ] % perl examples / termcount.pl /etc / passwd | tail proxy => 2 root => 2 sshd => 1 sync => 2 sys => 2 telnetd => 1 uml - net => 1 uucp => 2 www-data => 2 x => 26 という出力が得られます。左が列の単語、右が出現回数です。
ところでこの単語の出現回数出力、ちょっと手を加えるだけで検索エンジンの転置インデックスが作れることが分かります。map の emit 時に ( 単語 => 1 ) ではなく ( 単語 => ドキュメン トID ) とします。reduce では ( 単語 => ドキュメン トIDのリスト ) とします。出力は単語順に並べられているので、これだけでごくシンプルではありますが、転置インデックスの完成です。MapReduce が検索エンジンのインデックスを作成するのに有効であることが分かります。
GFS と MapReduce さて、この単一ホストでのみ動作する実装から、大規模並列処理が可能になるまでにどのようなハードルがあるかを考察してみます。 まず、入力ファイルがテラバイト級であった場合です。実はここが一番難しいところです。
Google では入力ファイルを 64MB 程度の chunk に分断して、それを各計算機 の
Map タスクの入力とします。この時ある特定のホストのローカルに保存された1TBのファイルを 64MB に分断してネットワークで配送するのでは、1TB のディスク I / Oとネットワーク I/ O が発生し、そこがボトルネックになってしまいます
。Google では分散ファイルシステムの GFS のノードと MapReduce のノードが同一のホストで動作します 。GFS には巨大なファイルが分散されて保存されています。MapReduce は、極力対象の入力ファイルをローカルに持つ GFS のノードを選び、そのホストに MapReduce のワーカーを担当させる方法で、最適化を行います。 すなわち 、MapReduce は GFS のような分散ファイルシステムとセットであるのが大前提ということになります。
タスクの分散 次に、ネットワーク上での分散です。ここはそれほど難しくないでしょう。ネットワーク上にマスタのホストを用意し、各計算ノード( ワーカー ) はマスタへ接続します。マスタはクライアントから計算要求を受け取ったら、入力ファイルの分割、Map、Reduce など各タスクを、計算の状態遷移に合わせてワーカーに指示を出します。 試しに MapReduce :: Lite の実装をベースにネットワーク対応のコードも書いてみましたが、まずまず動作しています。( こちらはまだ公開していません。)
Shuffle フェーズ Map がはき出した key - value ペアを 、Reduce 用のデータに集約する処理も考慮すべき点です。 Google の MapReduce ではこの処理 は Shuffle と呼ばれています。ネットワーク上のデータ転送のボトルネックを回避するために、Mapper は key - value ペアを小さな中間ファイルとしてローカルのディスクに書き込みます。Reducer は、Mapper のローカルから RPC でその中間ファイルを取得します。このとき 、Mapper は特定の分割関数 ( key に対するハッシュ関数の結果 に Reducer の数の mod を取ったもの ) に従い中間ファイルを分割して保存しておき、Reducer はマスタの指示により、その分割されたファイル群から自分自身が必要とする中間ファイルだけを取得するようになっています。
Reducer は中間ファイルを集め終わった後、それらをキーによってソートします。データの数が膨大になると、このソートのアルゴリズムが律速になるように思います。2004年時点の
Google のシステムではメモリにフィットする場合はメモリ内でソート、そうでない場合は二次記憶を使う外部ソートアルゴリズムを利用していたようです。
MapReduce :: Lite ではメモリ内での処理に限定して 、Tie :: Hash :: Sorted を使っています 。
冗長性の確保 冗長性の確保も悩ましい問題です。 マスタがタスクのキューになり、ワーカーの故障を検知したら他のワーカーにタスクを割り振るなどの実装を行うことになるでしょう。ここでもやはり
GFS が鍵になります 。GFS ではあるデータを分散して冗長に持っていますから、仮にあるホストが故障しても、他のホストが同一のデータを持っていることを保証します。GFS と MapReduce がペアになることで、入力データの分散と冗長性の確保が可能になります。 マスタの冗長性確保も考慮すべき問題です。おそらく
MySQL のバイナリログのような形で、タスクの履歴を共有しておき、一方が故障した場合にはもう一方が履歴から処理を再開する、などの実装を行うことになるでしょう。
その他 他にも考慮すべき問題があります。低速なマシンにタスクが割り当てられてしまった場合への対処、イレギュラーな入力によりプログラムがエラーになっても計算が継続できるような仕組み、ネットワーク上でのコマンド/データのやりとりに利用するプロトコルなどなどです。
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan ’s ruling coalition will move to impeach President Pervez Musharraf on charges of plunging the country into a political and economic crisis , party leaders said on Thursday .
They also warned Musharraf , a former general who first came to power in a 1999 military coup , against any attempt to dismiss the government .
The move is likely to deepen political uncertainty in the nuclear - armed Muslim nation , a key U.S. ally which already faces a faltering economy and a threat from Islamist militants .
The situation has taken a toll on Pakistani markets , with the main share index at its weakest in almost two years and the rupee headed back towards all - time lows posted in early July .
Asif Ali Zardari , widower of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and head of the coalition , said parliament would be called immediately to begin impeachment proceedings .
“ The coalition leaders believe that it has become imperative to move for impeachment , ” Zardari told a news conference with his coalition partner , former prime minister Nawaz Sharif .
Musharraf ’s spokesman was not immediately available but his allies say he will fight the impeachment .
“ We elected him and now we will support him to defeat this move , ” Kamil Ali Agha , a leader of the main pro-Musharraf party said .
“ The president will face the impeachment , ” he said when asked whether Musharraf had any plans to step down .
The response of the powerful army to the prospect of a humiliating exit for its former chief will be crucial .
Army commanders met in the garrison city of Rawalpindi , close to Islamabad , on Thursday but a military official said it was a routine meeting .
Musharraf seized power as a general in 1999 by toppling Sharif and effectively ruled Pakistan single - handedly for eight years .
His position weakened after he stepped down as chief of the army , which has run Pakistan for more than half of its 61 years of independence .
He has become increasingly unpopular at home and lost parliamentary support after his allies suffered a defeat in February elections but he has resisted calls to stand down .

“ The economic policies pursued by General Musharraf during the last 8 years have brought Pakistan to the brink of critical economic impasse , ” a joint statement read by Zardari said .
“ He has worked to undermine the transition to democracy . ”

ON THE BORDER
Some analysts say the jockeying for political power has distracted leaders from dealing with Pakistan ’s economic problems and the effort to control Islamic militants , especially along the border with Afghanistan .
The United States and the Afghanistan government say the border areas are shelters for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters .
Musharraf has previously said he would resign rather than face impeachment .
Both Zardari and Sharif warned him against trying to dismiss parliament , as some opposition figures fear .
Under the Pakistani constitution , a president can be ousted if an impeachment motion wins a two - thirds majority of the combined strength of the National Assembly and Senate .
Zardari was confident the motion would be passed with an overwhelming majority .
“ We have votes and we also have the courage , ” he said .
Analysts said while a motion could be tabled this month it could take several weeks before it was put to a vote .
The ruling coalition enjoys a comfortable majority in the National Assembly but the Senate is dominated by Musharraf ’s allies , though coalition officials claim many of them had assured they would support the impeachment motion .
Shortly before the announcement of the impeachment decision , the foreign ministry said Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani , instead of Musharraf , would leave for China on Thursday to attend opening ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics .
On Thursday , Pakistani stocks had nudged up 0.3 percent , closing at 9,707.29 on turnover of 88.5 million shares , kept in check by anticipation of the formal announcement of the impeachment by the ruling parties .
Micheal Jackson and several other artists plan to take on The Pirate Bay .
The king of pop hired the infamous ' Web Sheriff ' to protect his rights .
" Hey Michael - do you want us to pay you in small kids maybe ? " was the first response of Pirate Bay admin Brokep .
The Web Sheriff announced today that Michael Jackson joined the Village People , UB40 and the rights holders of Bob Marley ’s music , in an attempt to get compensation for the losses they allegedly suffered at the hands of the popular BitTorrent website .
Pirate Bay ’s Brokep commented on the announcement by saying : “ The common thing for all of these artists of course is that no one listens to them anymore . ”
This is not the first time the Sheriff , aka John Giacobbi , has clashed with the Pirate Bay folks .
Last November he announced that he planned to sue them in the U.S. , France and Sweden for infringing the rights of Prince .
Web Sheriff will demand $ 100 million dollars in compensation , slightly less than the MPAA asked for last week .
Adding them both together amounts to a record breaking claim .
“ The good thing about this is that we just broke TorrentSpy ’s lawsuit .
Maybe time to call Guinness , we like to break world records and we just broke one I think , ” Brokep writes .
In the meantime , The Web Sheriff is still trying to get ABBA on board .
“ It would also be good / appropriate if the members of ABBA could take up the fight against these pirates , as they personify the Swedish music industry ’s successes and are renowned ambassadors for Sweden , contrary to The Pirate Bay . ” he said previously .
Again , Brokep disagrees , he sees The Pirate Bay as Sweden ’s true ambassadors .
“ All over digg.com and other cool social networks there is always the comment “ last place on earth with true freedom is Sweden ” or ‘ I really want to move to Sweden ’ , ” he wrote a few months ago .
It will be interesting to see how this develops , for now , all the Web Sheriff has ever done is making threats .
You would think that he must know by now that this has no effect on The Pirate Bay team .
Warner Bros .
Pictures today announced that it has moved back the release date ofto Summer 2009 .
The sixth installment of the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise will now open day - and - date domestically and in the major international markets on July 17 , 2009 .
The announcement was made by Alan Horn , President and Chief Operating Officer , Warner Bros .
In making the announcement , Mr. Horn stated , “ Our reasons for shifting ‘ Half - Blood Prince ’ to summer are twofold : we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release , as proven by the success of our last Harry Potter film , which is the second - highest grossing film in the franchise , behind only the first installment .
Additionally , like every other studio , we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers ’ strike , which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films — changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of .
We agreed the best strategy was to moveto July , where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid-summer .
” Jeff Robinov , President of Warner Bros.
Motion Picture Group , confirmed , “ The release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future Harry Potter films .
Post - production onwas completed on time , and the studio ’s release plans for the two - partwill not be affected by this change .
We know Harry Potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen .
In fact , the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between ‘ Half - Blood Prince ’ and the first part of .
” Commenting on the release date change for , David Heyman , the producer of all the Harry Potter films , offered , “ When Jeff Robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of ‘ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ’ to July 2009 , it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience .
I am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of David Yates and our incomparable cast ; I believe we have developed and pushed the series further still .
We are all looking forward to sharing it with Harry Potter fans around the world , even if we have to wait just a bit longer .
” David Yates , the director of bothandand who will also helm , added , “ It has been a joy to work on .
Dan , Rupert and Emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom , and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to Hogwarts .
Even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film , we are already beginning preparations on the final two films — we start filming in February — and I am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve .
” In , Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was .
Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle , but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching .
Meanwhile , the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts .
Love is in the air , but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again .

John McCain says he plans to consult with Democratic Rep. John Lewis when he ’s president .
That ’s news to Lewis .
During Saturday ’s presidential forum at Rick Warren ’s California megachurch , John McCain was asked to name the “ three wisest people ” he would “ rely heavily on ” if elected president .
He did n’t cite close confidantes Phil Gramm and Randy Scheunemann , possibly because they have gotten McCain into trouble politically .
Instead McCain chose Gen. David Petraeus ; former eBay CEO Meg Whitman , one of his economic advisers ; and Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga. ) , a leading figure in the civil rights movement .
This is not the first time McCain has invoked Lewis ’ name on the campaign trail .
Earlier this year , in Selma , Alabama , he told the story of civil rights marchers trying to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a 1965 march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery .
Waiting at the crest of the bridge were a brigade of police and state troopers who meted out an attacks so violent that the day is known today as Bloody Sunday .
Central in McCain ’s telling was John Lewis , a man of just 25 who was at the front of the march and absorbed the first blow .
Millions of Americans , McCain noted , “ watched brave John Lewis fall . ”
But even though McCain has now repeatedly cited Lewis as a role model and potential adviser , McCain has not established a relationship with the Georgia Democrat in the 22 years they have served in Congress together .
At the time of McCain ’s Selma speech , a Lewis associate told my colleague David Corn that McCain has never been close to Lewis .
Lewis was not told about McCain ’s speech in Selma in advance , nor was he invited to attend .
In response to McCain ’s latest invocation of his name , Rep. Lewis said in a statement requested by Mother Jones , “ I cannot stop one human being , even a presidential candidate , from admiring the courage and sacrifice of peaceful protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge or making comments about it . ”
But , he added , “ Sen. McCain and I are colleagues in the US Congress , not confidantes .
He does not consult me .
And I do not consult him . ”
It took McCain years to fully embrace the goals that Lewis was fighting for on Bloody Sunday .
In 1983 , McCain voted against making Martin Luther King Jr. ’s birthday a national holiday , in opposition to most members of Congress , including many of his Republican colleagues .
In 1987 , the governor of Arizona repealed the state ’s recognition of King ; McCain supported the move .
It was only in 1990 , 25 years after Lewis marched in Alabama , when Arizona reversed its decision that McCain changed his own stance on the issue .
And there are , of course , the fundamental differences between John McCain ’s political philosophy and the goals of Lewis and his fellow marchers .
Lewis hoped that the federal government would use its influence to protect the rights of disenfranchised individuals ; he sought an expanded role for government because of what he believed was government ’s power to do good .
It explains , in part , why Lewis is a Democrat today and supports Barack Obama for president .
McCain , on the other hand , is a fanatical enemy of government spending and has said , “ I ’ve found over time that less government involvement is better . ”
It ’s a philosophy that would have left Lewis and his cohorts out in the cold .
The Bugatti Veyron just lost its last claim to fame .
Having already been dethroned as the fastest car on the planet , the $ 1.4 million Veyron and its more expensive roadster sibling are no longer the world 's most expensive rides .
That title now rests with the One - 77 , the $ 2.3 million hand - made coupe Aston Martin will sell next year .
No more than 77 will be built , a figure that makes Bugatti's run of 300 Veyrons look mass - market and just beats the 80 Veyron roadsters in exclusivity .
A British bookie already is laying odds on who'll get the first one .
Paying $ 2.3 million for anything that does n't have wings is beyond excessive , but then , those few who get a One - 77 are n't buying a car .
They are , according to Aston Martin , buying An Experience .
Autocar says buyers will be invited to the factory in Gaydon , where they 'll meet with designers and engineers to develop the car to their exact specifications .
" It 's a very special car for customers who want to take the bespoke experience to a higher level , " company chairman David Richard told Autocar .
" Every car will be entirely individual . "
Aston Martin is n't saying much about the One - 77 , a code name for the as - yet - unnamed coupe , but the project started about 15 months ago .
The hand - hammered aluminum bodywork retains the general profile of the gorgeous DB9 but is more muscular .
It covers a carbon fiber chassis and a 7.0 - liter V12 engine said to produce 650 horsepower .
Top speed is estimated at 220 mph and 60 mph arrives in 3.5 seconds .
Those figures are well short of the 253 mph and 2.5 seconds the Bugatti has hit , but Aston Martin CEO Ulrich Benz says the company is n't " doing a Veyron . "
Instead , the company 's flagship will highlight its latest technology , raising the possibility future Astons will make greater use of carbon fiber and other advancements developed for the One - 77 .
The company reportedly has identified 500 or so potential customers and will bring a One - 77 to their homes – when you 're spending that kind of money , you are n't expected to actually visit a showroom .
So who 's on the list ?
The bookies at William Hill Casinos have opened betting and David Beckham is their 9 - 4 favorite to be first in line .
Singer Jay Kay of Jamiroquai is second at 3 - 1 , while the odds on Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich stand at 7 - 2 .
As for Aston Martin 's decision to build just 77 , it 's said to have stemmed from Bez 's belief that seven is a lucky number .
It certainly is for those fortunate enough to get one .

McCain to angry mom of veteran : ' I do n't disagree ' with draft RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008

An audience member at a McCain town hall meeting in Las Cruces , New Mexico on Wednesday indicted the VA 's treatment of veterans and expressed worry that unless the draft was reinstituted , the United States would n't have the manpower to " chase bin Laden right to the gates of Hell and push him in . "
" Disabled veterans , especially in this state , have horrible conditions , " the woman said .
" Their medical is substandard .
They drive four hours one way to Albuquerque for a simple doctor 's appointment , which is often cancelled .
Our VA hospital is dirty , it 's understaffed , it 's running on maximum overload .
The prescription medicines are ten years behind standard medical care .
We have 700 claims stacked up at the VA office in Albuquerque .
Some of them are ten -- seven years old , waiting to be processed .
In the meantime , people are homeless .
My son is an officer in the Air Force , I 'm a vet , and I was raised in a military family .
And I think it 's a sorry state of affairs when we have illegal aliens , having a Medicaid card , that can access specialist top physicians -- the best of medical -- and our vets can't even get to a doctor .
" And these are the people we tied yellow ribbons for , and Bush patted on the back .
If we do n't reenact the draft , I do n't think we 'll have anyone to chase bin Laden to the gates of Hell . "
" Ma'am , " the Senator responded , " let me say that I do n't disagree with anything you said .
Thank you , and I am grateful for your support of all of our veterans . "

Impeachment is Not Enough
Indict all of the US government officials and their allies who planned and carried out the 9/11 attacks
Impeachment is Not Enough
A preponderance of evidence shows that the highest officials of the Bush Administration , in collusion with many other officials from the Pentagon , CIA , FBI , FEMA , NSA , NORAD , New York City officials , air - traffic contollers , airline executives , controlled demolitions experts , computer graphics technicians , media executives , and others together planned and committed the horrible attacks of 9/11/2001 against the Pentagon and the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City .
The 9/11 attacks were immediately blamed on some bogus ' Arab highjackers ' , a half dozen of whom were later confirmed to be still alive , and therefore innocent , after the 9/11 attacks .
The false - flag 9/11 attacks provided the excuse for the US government 's ' War on Terrorism ' , the chief purpose of which is for the USA to gain control of the lucrative oil fields of the Middle East .
A secondary purpose is to increase the taxation of US citizens for Defense spending in support of the USA 's enormous Military / Industrial Complex , and a tertiary purpose is to establish justification of the enactment of Police State measures within the USA under the vast , far - reaching , and politically ambiguous umbrella of ' Homeland Security ' .
When the rights of freedom of speech and assembly are curtailed for the citizens of the USA , the US government will be able to pursue its agenda of world domination without the domestic distraction of dissident opinions , protests , and demonstrations .
The Pentagon , CIA , FBI , and other agencies and officials of the US government have perpetrated many crimes , assassinations , and false - flag bombings and attacks against US citizens and US interests during the past fifty years , including , but by no means limited to , the State political assassinations of John Fitzgerald Kennedy , Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy , and Martin Luther King ; the 1988 Berlin Disco bombing ; the 1993 World Trade Center bombing ; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing ; and the anthrax letter attacks of October 2001 .
The US government and its allies also committed the Bali bombings of 2002 and 2005 ; the Madrid train bombings of 2004 ; the London 7/7/2005 bombings ; and the recent spate of bombings in Ahmedabad , Jaipur , Bangalore , and at the Indian Embassy in Kabul during the summer of 2008 .
Since the end of World War Two , fanatic right - wing ideologues with corporate connections have gradually gained complete control of the US military , the US intelligence agencies , the US government , and the USA 's ' Mainstream Media ' .
Fascism in the USA is not merely a current threat posed by the Republican Administration of George W. Bush ; it is an already - accomplished situation that has been many decades in the making .
Fascism in the USA is actually a ' done deal ' .
The USA 's long descent into fascism cannot be halted or stopped merely by electing a member of the Democrat Party to the Presidency , or by electing a Democrat majority to Congress .
The infiltration and control of the US government by right - wing extremists is far too advanced and complete -- they manipulate our elected officials like puppets on a string , and a great many of our elected officials are themselves part of the fascist establishment .
The right - wing takeover of the US government has been a gradual and very successful fascist coup that will not be reversed without a very serious and deadly struggle .
Given the history of extreme and indiscriminate violence shown by the ruling junta of the USA , it appears quite obvious to me that restoring democracy to the USA would inevitably require a violent armed Revolution in which the American people are opposed against the forces of the US government and the US military .
As a US citizen and as a human being , I personally consider the killing of innocent people in foreign countries by the CIA , the US military , and their puppets in support of the economic interests of multinational US - based corporations to be totally immoral and intolerable , and I consider it my solemn duty to oppose US aggression and Imperialism in any way that I can .
US government and Mass Media propaganda promote a climate in which the actions and activities of US troops abroad are regarded as beyond reproach , but there is nothing noble or ' heroic ' about unprovoked military aggression and genocide against vulnerable and innocent foreign populations .
George W. Bush , George H. Bush , Jeb , Neil , and Marvin Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Condaleezza Rice , Karl Rove , Wolfowitz , Perle , Powell , Armitage , Ashcroft , Abrams , Adelman , Feith , Bolton , Libby , Kissinger , Mueller , Tenet , Goss , Giuliani , Hayden , Chertoff , Baker , and many hundreds of other individuals working for the White House , CIA , FBI , FEMA , the Pentagon , NSA , NORAD , the airline industry , and the US news media together planned and executed the 9/11 attacks .
All of the above - named and their accomplices need to be tried for Treason and Mass Murder , with the death penalty as the just and very necessary reward for their conviction of those crimes .
We need a Nuremberg - style trial for Treason and Mass Murder for all of the members of the US government , the US military , the US intelligence agencies , and their civilian accomplices in the airline industry and the news media who participated in the murderous crimes of 9/11 .
The death penalty should be applied to all of the principals and their accomplices , even if that means executing several hundred or even several thousand people , because crimes of this magnitude against the American people and the US Republic cannot go unpunished , and the punishment must be extreme to send a message that the American people will not tolerate such Treason -- not now or in the future .
If allowed to remain unpunished and at liberty , these individuals represent a grave threat to the safety and security of all Americans .
If convicted of the heinous crimes of 9/11 , the death penalty is the only way to ensure that they or their allies will not somehow manage to attack America and Americans again .
The executions should be performed in public and be internationally televized for the entire world to witness .
I do realize that there are some very worthy reasons to oppose capital punishment in many situations .
However , it is also quite apparent to me that any show of clemency that might be given to the US government perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks leaves open the possibility that they and their sympathizers could revive their subversion of American democracy and their violence toward peace - loving Americans .
That is why I advocate a policy of capital punishment without any consideration of mercy , plea - bargaining , or probation for the US government perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and their allies .
No one in or out of the US government should be exempt from prosecution and capital punishment for the Treasonous attacks of 9/11 .
The planners and participants in the 9/11 attacks within the US government and their accomplices must not be allowed to protect themselves behind the specious excuse of " National Security . "
The true security and survival of our Republic depends entirely on this .

" As for that VP talk all the time , I ’ll tell you , I still ca n’t answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does everyday ? "
Do we really need someone like this a heartbeat away from the Presidency ?
Especially given that McCain turned 72 today ?
Especially someone under investigation for abuse of power less than two years into office ?
That really is more of the same .

Response to The UK Guardian Hit Piece
Crimes of the State
Mr. Monbiot has taken the standard media attack approach : conflate the internet film " Loose Change " with the subject of September 11th US government complicity .
How brave to redo the same smear that has gone around for several years now focusing on the easily challenged claims , and ignoring the full breadth ( and breathtaking amount ) of evidence .
DISTURBING FACTS ABOUT THE 9/11 ATTACKS
1 . The president of the United States , when informed that a second plane had struck the World Trade Center , continued to read about a pet goat .
2 . This same president was moved from his high rise hotel in Genoa Italy two months previously for security reasons , because of a known al Qaeda plot for hijacking and " crashing an airliner into the Genoa summit of industrialized nations . "
The assumption in July 2001 was that there existed a plot that " terrorists would try to crash a plane to kill Bush and other leaders " ( LA Times , 9-27-01 ) .
3 . The Secret Service did not secure the president , even though his location was publicly disclosed in the press for days before the school photo op on 9/11 .
This was a break in standard operating procedures that left the president vulnerable in the middle of a purported " attack " on America .
4. NORAD has told three different and conflicting stories explaining why no jet fighters intercepted any of the four hijacked airliners .
5. Vice President Richard Cheney was placed in charge of anti-terrorism training and military preparedness exercises by Bush on May 8 , 2001 .
This gave him command authority during the 9/11 attacks because as many as nine war game exercises involving military and intelligence agencies were occurring simultaneously .
6 . The military 's " Air Piracy " regulations were rewritten on June 1st 2001 to require the " Secretary of Defense " to give " approval " for military escort aircraft in the event of a hijacking .
Donald Rumsfeld gave no " approval " that day .
7 . More than an hour and fifteen minutes after the first hijacking was reported by FAA , the US military headquarters at the Pentagon was struck without any defensive action taken to stop the attack .
The impact was on the west side , for some reason the only side that had been " hardened " with blast - proof windows and specially reinforced walls .
None of the highest ranking military leadership were located on that side .
8. ( TRANSCRIPT ) Air Force General Richard Myers : " When it became clear what the threat was , we did scramble fighter aircraft , AWACS , radar aircraft and tanker aircraft to begin to establish orbits in case other aircraft showed up in the FAA system that were hijacked ... "
Senator Carl Levin : " Was that order that you just described given before or after the Pentagon was struck ?
Do you know ? "
Air Force General Richard Myers : " That order , to the best of my knowledge , was after the Pentagon was struck . "
Reality intrudes .
It became " clear what the threat was , " the moment the first hijacked airliner struck the North Tower at 8:46 am .
This congressional testimony is inexcusable and grounds for investigation into criminal negligence , dereliction of duty , and treason .
9 . " President Bush personally asked Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle Tuesday to limit the congressional investigation into the events of September 11 ... " ... " Tuesday 's discussion followed a rare call to Daschle from Vice President Dick Cheney last Friday to make the same request . "
10 . The Project For a New American Century , which wrote of the need for a " catastrophic and catalyzing event , like a new Pearl Harbor , " had members throughout the top of the government on 9/11 including Cheney , Rumsfeld , Perle , Wolfowitz , Feith , Bolton , Armitage , Abrams , Wurmser , as well as Bush 's brother , the governor of Florida , Jeb .
11 . Four days before 9/11 , Jeb Bush activated the Florida National Guard , " Based on the potential massive damage to life and property that may result from an act of terrorism at a Florida port . " ( Executive Order 01-261 ) .
12 . On 9/11 Jeb Bush declared a " State of Emergency " in Florida ( E.O. 01-262 ) .
" I hereby delegate to the Department of Law Enforcement the operational authority to coordinate and direct the law enforcement resources and other resources of any and all state , regional and local governmental agencies ... "
And by 2 am on 9/12/01 , Jeb Bush was reported to have confiscated the police records in Venice , FL related to the Huffman Aviation flight school .
Two rental trucks full of these records drove onto a C - 130 military aircraft at Sarasota Airport and flew out with Jeb Bush aboard .
13 . Huffman Aviation flight school , where Mohamed Atta and other alleged hijackers trained , had a Lear jet seized by the DEA with " 43 pounds of heroin " onboard .
No one was ever prosecuted in connection with the " biggest drug seizure in central Florida history . "
14 . The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States ( " 9/11 Commission " ) was a blatant and obvious cover - up under the control of Bush administration member and " Executive Director " Phillip Zelikow .
This cover - up can be proven easily with one example : the time of Dick Cheney 's arrival at the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ( " PEOC bunker " ) .
Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta testified under oath that Cheney was present at 9:20 am and issuing " orders " related to the plane that struck the Pentagon .
Mineta 's testimony was completely omitted from their final report , and a fraudulent time of 9:58 am for Cheney 's arrival was given instead ( book pg 40 / .pdf file pg 57 ) .
15 . The 9/11 Commission was originally only given $ 3 million to investigate the greatest terrorist attacks on US soil in our history .
The Bush administration then witheld requested documents forcing the Commissioners to issue subpoenas to FAA and the Department of Defense .
16 .
So many lies were told by Bush administration officials regarding warnings before the attacks , that it is difficult to count them .
Ari Fleischer 's two word response , " No warnings , " aboard Air Force One on 9/11 , sums up the administration 's claim .
17 . Contrary to the Bush administration 's claim : " Newspapers in Germany , France , Russia and London reported in the months before September 11th of a blizzard of warnings delivered to the Bush administration from all points on the compass .
The German intelligence service BND warned American and Israeli agencies that terrorists were planning to hijack commercial aircraft and use them as weapons to attack important American targets .
Egypt warned of a similar plane - based plot against Bush during the G - 8 summit in Genoa last June [ 2001 ] , a warning taken so seriously that anti-aircraft batteries were placed around Columbus Airport in Italy .
Last August [ 2001 ] , Russian intelligence services notified the CIA that 25 terrorist pilots had been trained for suicide missions , and Putin himself confirmed that this warning was delivered ' in the strongest possible terms ' specifically regarding threats to airports and government buildings . "
- Newsweek , May 20 , 2002
18 . In July of 2001 , CIA Director George Tenet and CIA counterterrorism chief J. Cofer Black claim to have made a detailed presentation and warned National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Attorney General John Ashcroft of imminent attacks on US soil by Al Qaeda operatives .
This was also omitted from the 9/11 Commission Report .
19 .
Many more warnings stretching back to the early 1990s were known to intelligence agencies and to FBI .
These warnings expose as a lie National Security Advisor Rice 's response : " I do n't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center , take another one and slam it into the Pentagon ; that they would try to use an airplane as a missile , a hijacked airplane as a missile . "
20 . March 7 , 2001 : " The Russian Permanent Mission at the United Nations secretly submits “ an unprecedentedly detailed report ” to the UN Security Council about bin Laden , his whereabouts , details of his al - Qaeda network , Afghan drug running , and Taliban connections to Pakistan and the ISI .
The report provides “ a listing of all bin Laden ’s bases , his government contacts and foreign advisers , ” and enough information to potentially locate and kill him .
It is said to contain an “ astonishing degree of information . ”
The US fails to use the information in any noticable manner .
Alex Standish , the editor of the highly respected Jane ’s Intelligence Review , concludes that the attacks of 9/11 were less of an American intelligence failure than the result of “ a political decision not to act against bin Laden . ” [ Jane 's Intelligence Review , 10/5/2001 ; Times of India , 10/8/2001 ]
21 . On August 6 , 2001 a CIA briefer went to Bush 's Crawford ranch to read the president a briefing called , " Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US " ( 2 redacted pages out of 11 reported ) .
After the briefing , Bush told the CIA man , " All right .
You 've covered your ass , now . "
Bush then went fishing .
22 . Minneapolis FBI Agent and Legal Advisor Colleen Rowley ( 21 year veteran ) said that the FBI Headquarters Special Supervisory Agent , " seemed to have been consistently , almost deliberately thwarting the Minneapolis FBI agents ' efforts ... continued to , almost inexplicably , throw up roadblocks and undermine Minneapolis ' by - now desperate efforts to obtain a FISA search warrant , long after the French intelligence service provided its information and probable cause became clear .
... Even after the attacks had begun , the SSA in question was still attempting to block the search of Moussaoui 's computer , characterizing the World Trade Center attacks as a mere coincidence .
... HQ personnel never disclosed to the Minneapolis agents that the Phoenix Division had , only approximately three weeks earlier , warned of Al Qaeda operatives in flight schools seeking flight training for terrorist purposes ! "
23 . FBI Special Agent Robert Wright ( 12 year veteran ) said : " “ [ T ] here existed a concerted effort on the part of agents conducting counterterrorism intelligence investigations to insulate the subjects of their investigations from criminal investigation and prosecution . ”
...
“ The supervisor ... started yelling at me : ‘ You will not open criminal investigations .
I forbid any of you .
You will not open criminal investigations against any of these intelligence subjects . ’ ” ... " ( T ) here is virtually no effort on the part of the FBI ’s International Terrorism Unit to neutralize known and suspected terrorists residing within the United States . "
" A lawyer speaking for ( FBI Special Agent ) Wright after 9/11 will blame Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Michael Chertoff for refusing to take Wright ’s concerns seriously before 9/11 . "
Chertoff will later be appointed to become head of the Orwellian - named Department of Homeland Security .
" Larry Klayman , one of two lawyers now representing [ FBI Agent ]
Wright , later says he calls the Justice Department a few days after 9/11 and asks that Wright be allowed to present his issues to Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Klayman claims he receives a reply from Michael Chertoff , then head of the Criminal division , who refuses to meet with Wright and says , “ We are tired of conspiracy theories . ”
FBI Agent Wright says at his press conference : “ Corruption is knowing when something is not being done , knowing when the American people are being left unprotected and when you make a decision not to do something to protect the American people ...
And you effectively allow 9/11 to occur .
That is the ultimate form of government corruption — dereliction of duty .
That ’s subject in the military to prosecution , to court martial ....
Frankly , if not treason . ”
24 . FBI Agent Harry Samit , who before 9/11 sent 70 communications to supervisors warning them of Moussauoi 's plan to hijack a commercial jet and crash it -- to no avail -- has said , “ ... ( I ) f you ’re not going to advance this the FISA route , or if you do n’t believe we have enough for a FISA , I shudder to think — and that ’s all I got out .
And [ Supervisory Special Agent Mike Maltbie ] cut me off and said , ‘ You will not question the unit chief [ David Frasca ] and you will not question me .
We ’ve been through a lot .
We know what ’s going on .
You will not question us . ’ ”
25 . On July 10 , 2001 FBI Agents in Phoenix AZ issued a memo to FBIHQ requesting that headquarters investigate flight schools across the U.S. to look for middle eastern flight students connected to international terrorist organizations .
Nothing was done , and the information was not shared .
26 . " The [ FBI Inspector General ] report attributes the inaction and inattention to the lack of resources committed to anti-terrorist activities in the summer of 2001 .
For instance , there was only a single research analyst assigned to the FBI ’s Bin Laden Unit in 2001 , and she was transferred to another unit in July 2001 . "
27 . " Although the FBI 's counterterrorism budget tripled during the mid-1990s , its counterterrorism spending stayed fairly constant between fiscal years 1998 and 2001 " ... " Then - acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard said he appealed to Ashcroft for more money for counterterrorism but on Sept 10 , 2001 , one day before the attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people , Ashcroft rejected the appeal . "
28 . " At issue is a July 5 , 2001 , meeting between Ashcroft and acting FBI Director Tom Pickard . "
" ' Mr. Ashcroft told you that he did not want to hear about this anymore , ' Democratic commission member Richard Ben-Veniste asked on April 13 .
' Is that correct ? ' "
" ' That is correct , ' Pickard replied . "
... " ( A ) nother senior FBI official tells NBC News he vividly recalls Pickard returning from the meeting that day furious that Ashcroft had cut short the terrorism briefing .
Several sources familiar with the investigation say Garcia confirmed to the commission that Ashcroft did indeed dismiss Pickard 's warnings about al - Qaida . "
29 . FBI Translator Sibel Edmonds has become the most gagged whistleblower in the country 's history .
In a letter to 9/11 Commissioner Thomas Kean , she said , " “ If Counterintelligence receives information that contains money laundering , illegal arms sale , and illegal drug activities , directly linked to terrorist activities ; and if that information involves certain nations , certain semi- legit organizations , and ties to certain lucrative or political relations in this country , then , that information is not shared with Counterterrorism , regardless of the possible severe consequences .
In certain cases , frustrated FBI agents cited ‘ direct pressure by the State Department , ’ and in other cases ‘ sensitive diplomatic relations ’ is cited .
... Your hearings did not include questions regarding these unspoken and unwritten policies and practices .
Despite your full awareness and understanding of certain criminal conduct that connects to certain terrorist related activities , committed by certain US officials and high - level government employees , you have not proposed criminal investigations into this conduct , although under the laws of this country you are required to do so . "
Another FBI translator , who had been " shielding " the targets of FBI investigations , told Sibel Edmonds : " “ Why are you doing this , Sibel ?
Why do n’t you just drop it ?
You know there could be serious consequences .
Why put your family in Turkey in danger over this ? ” Sibel Edmonds ' sister was reportedly sought by Turkish police shortly after this incident .
30 .
The FBI 's top Al Qaeda investigator , John O'Neill , " resigned in July of 2001 in protest over the obstruction of terrorist investigations . "
31 . Two of the alleged hijackers lived openly in San Diego with an FBI informant for over a year : " The FBI inspector general ’s report reveals for the first time that the CIA not only failed to inform the FBI about [ Al ]
Mihdhar , but that CIA officials intervened to suppress a memorandum drafted by an FBI agent detailed to the CIA - run Counter - Terrorism Center ( CTC ) , who wanted to notify the FBI about the suspected terrorist with a US visa . "
" One FBI official familiar with the case will later complain , “ [ The CIA ] purposely hid [ Almihdhar ] from the FBI , purposely refused to tell the bureau .
... And that ’s why September 11 happened .
... They have blood on their hands . ”
[ Bamford , 2004 , pp. 224 , A Pretext for War : 9/11 , Iraq , and the Abuse of America 's Intelligence Agencies ]
32 . The 9/11 Commission , at the orchestration of Bush administration member and " Executive Director " Phillip Zelikow , wrote : “ To date , the US government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks .
... Ultimately the question of the origin of the funds is of little practical significance . ”
33 .
The Times of India reported that Indian Intelligence had traced the wire transfers of over $ 100,000 from British born terrorist and reported MI6 and ISI asset Omar Saeed Sheikh in the UAE to Mohamed Atta in Florida , on the orders of the head of Pakistani intelligence Lt. General Mahmoud Ahmad .
This was reportedly confirmed by the FBI .
The Pakistani ISI chief Ahmad resigned immediately , but he has never been sought by US authorities for funding and participating in the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
34 . ISI chief Lt. General Mahmoud Ahmad was in Washington DC the week prior to 9/11 , meeting with CIA Director George Tenet and other high ranking US officials including Tenet 's replacement at CIA Porter Goss .
35 . During the ISI chief 's stay in Washington , Osama bin Laden was reportedly admitted to the Pakistani military hospital in Rawalpindi on September 10 , 2001 by CBS News .
36 . Osama bin Laden was also reportedly admitted to a US MILITARY HOSPITAL in Dubai , UAE , in July of 2001 for kidney dialysis treatment .
There bin Laden is said to have met with the CIA station chief , Larry Mitchell .
37 . Senator Bob Graham , head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said : " I was surprised at the evidence that there were foreign governments [ Plural ! ] involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States . " ... " I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing -- although that was part of it -- by a sovereign foreign government and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down , make the further case , or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true . "
38 . Senator Bob Graham also said : " High officials in [ the Saudi Arabian ] government , who I assume were not just rogue officials acting on their own , made substantial contributions to the support and wellbeing of two of these terrorists and facilitated their ability to plan , practise and then execute the tragedy of September 11 . "
These investigations remain blocked , classified , covered - up and unresolved to this day by the Bush administration 's clear Obstruction of Justice .
39 . Senator and 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned , saying : " This is the most serious independent investigation since the Warren Commission .
And after watching History Channel shows on the Warren Commission last night , the Warren Commission blew it .
I 'm not going to be part of that .
I 'm not going to be part of looking at information only partially .
I 'm not going to be part of just coming to quick conclusions .
I 'm not going to be part of political pressure to do this or not do that .
I 'm not going to be part of that .
This is serious . "
40 .
At least 7 of the alleged " hijackers " were reported to be still alive .
Neither the FBI nor the 9/11 Commission corrected the identities , and the government has treated the issue of who exactly attacked America on September 11th as relatively unimportant .
The flight manifests released by the airlines did not contain any of the names of the hijackers ( who supposedly bought tickets just like everybody else ) , and there are discrepancies in the number of persons reported to be onboard the airliners .
This also has not been explained by officials , at all .
41 . The Dulles Airport security camera video released as evidence of hijackers has no time or date stamp , nor any other coded information , which suggests that it may not be authentic .
42 . The aircraft " black boxes " from the World Trade Center site were admittedly recovered by NYC Fireman Nicholas DeMassi .
The FBI , NTSB and the 9/11 Commission all deny they were ever recovered at all .
43 . Congress shoveled $ 15 Billion of taxpayer money to the airlines immediately after 9/11 as one of the first responses to the attacks .
44 . The autopsy report from the Pentagon crash site contains no mention of any of the hijackers .
45 . Up to 200 Israeli agents were arrested and detained in relation to September 11th .
This includes five Mossad agents who were celebrating the World Trade Center job with " cries of joy and mockery . "
The Justice Department ( sic ) released all of the Israelis , and the entire matter was made " classified . "
46 . " According to several Weehawken neighbors of the [ Israeli MOSSAD front operation ]
Urban Moving Systems warehouse , the FBI , upon searching the warehouse , discovered fertilizer , other chemicals for making explosives , pipes , caps , and traces of anthrax .
After anthrax was discovered , investigators wearing hazardous material suits went through the warehouse . "
47 . " On the night of the Sept. 11 attacks , the White House Medical Office dispensed [ the anthrax drug ] Cipro to staff accompanying Vice President Dick Cheney as he was secreted off to the safety of Camp David ... "
The public was not warned about anthrax or alerted about Cipro for another six weeks , when anthrax - laden letters were sent through the mail to top Democratic congressmen and to others .
48 . " Palestinians " were accused of committing the 9/11 attacks by Israeli MOSSAD operatives .
One of the arrested MOSSAD agents told the police , “ We are Israelis , we are not your problem .
Your problems are our problem .
Palestinians are the problem . ”
A phone call to the " Jersey City Police Department ... claimed ' Palestinians ' in Arab clothes were seen celebrating the attacks . "
Was this MOSSAD referring to their own covert agents ?
At 9:43 am on 9/11 , " Abu Dhabi television reports it received a call from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , claiming responsibility for crashing two planes into the WTC .
However leading officials later deny the claim . "
49 . Israeli instant messaging firm Odigo received warnings of the World Trade Center attacks 2 hours before they occurred .
50 . Zim American / Israeli Shipping broke its lease in the World Trade Center and evacuated one week before the attacks .
The company is 49 % owned by the Israeli government .
51 . Although the Israeli government sent MOSSAD officers to " warn " the U.S. about imminent terror attacks in August 2001 : " ' They had no specific information about what was being planned but linked the plot to Osama bin Laden and told the Americans that there were strong grounds for suspecting Iraqi involvement , ' said a senior Israeli security official . "
Mixing Osama bin Laden together with his enemy Saddam Hussein has been a ridiculous propaganda exercise , and exposed as such .
52 . Fire has never , before or after 9/11 , caused a steel - framed building to completely collapse .
Three gigantic steel - framed skyscrapers were alleged to have collapsed from the effects of fire , including the 47 story building 7 which was not hit by a plane .
The Twin Towers and building 7 displayed numerous characteristics of controlled demolition including free fall speed , collapsing into footprints , pulverization of all the concrete , and the sounds and appearances of explosive charges , as reported by many eyewitnesses .
Needless to say , this has not been investigated officially , because officials refuse to admit the possibility existed at all .
53 . " Fire Engineering [ Magazine ] has good reason to believe that the " official investigation " blessed by FEMA and run by the American Society of Civil Engineers is a half - baked farce that may already have been commandeered by political forces whose primary interests , to put it mildly , lie far afield of full disclosure .
Except for the marginal benefit obtained from a three - day , visual walk - through of evidence sites conducted by ASCE investigation committee members - described by one close source as a " tourist trip " - no one 's checking the evidence for anything . "
54 . " ' The decision to rapidly recycle the steel columns , beams and trusses from the WTC in the days immediately after 9/11 means definitive answers may never be known . '[ NY Times ]
The next week , Fire Engineering magazine said : ' We are literally treating the steel removed from the site like garbage , not like crucial fire scene evidence ... The destruction and removal of evidence must stop immediately . ' " ( Griffin )
55 . Ben Fountain , who worked in the South Tower , told People Magazine , " Over the past few weeks we'd been evacuated a number of times , which is unusual .
I think they had an inkling something was going on . "
56 . On Thursday , September 6 , 2001 bomb - sniffing dogs were removed and the security threat level at the World Trade Center was downgraded .
57 . Scott Forbes who worked in the South Tower described a " power down " on the weekend before 9/11 , which was corroborated by WTC janitor William Rodriquez in his RICO lawsuit .
The power down knocked out communications , computer systems , and security cameras .
Numerous workmen were reported , and the sounds of heavy construction , and a pervasive grey dust was found on the 97th floor by Forbes .
58 . William Rodriguez also reported bombs in the basement levels and on various floors .
After describing a series of explosions , Rodriguez heard that floor 65 had completely collapsed ( nowhere near the plane impact zone ) .
Rodriguez also claims to have heard construction on floor 34 affter the plane impacts , a floor that was n't in use .
59 .
President Bush 's brother Marvin Bush had been a director for Securacom ( now Stratasec ) that was in charge of security for the WTC , United Airlines and Dulles Airport ( where Flight 77 originated ) .
An Israeli security firm , ICTS International had security responsibilities at Boston Logan airport and other airports involved in the September 11th attacks .
60 . On September 10 , 2001 Willie Brown , the mayor of San Francisco , received a warning not to fly .
He credited who he called " my security people at the airport . "
No FAA warnings had been issued however " in recent days . "
61 . " On Sept. 10 , NEWSWEEK has learned , a group of top Pentagon officials suddenly canceled travel plans for the next morning , apparently because of security concerns . "
62 . " The author Salman Rushdie believes that US authorities knew of an imminent terrorist strike when they banned him from taking internal flights in Canada and the US only a week before the attacks .
On September 3 the Federal Aviation Authority made an emergency ruling to prevent Mr Rushdie from flying unless airlines complied with strict and costly security measures . "
63 . " The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it provided 15 warnings to airlines regarding possible terrorist attacks -- including al Qaeda hijackings -- in the months leading up to September 11 .
... The FAA mentioned Osama bin Laden or al Qaeda in alerts the agency sent to domestic airlines . "
At this same time , July 2001 , the FAA inexplicably terminated a firearms certification program for commercial airline pilots , which had made it legal for pilots to be armed since 1961 .
64 . A military data mining operation called Able Danger created a presentation chart in 2000 that allegedly included four future 9/11 hijackers .
Their recommendation to send the data to the FBI was thwarted by military lawyers and by higher ranking officers .
Yellow stickers were placed over the photographs of Mohamed Atta and the others .
Although this information was brought directly to several of the 9 - 11 Commissioners , including Phillip Zelikow , it was never mentioned in their final report .
65 . Purported " lead hijacker " Mohamed Atta was already known to US intelligence when he was living in Germany .
" He is 'reportedly observed buying large quantities of chemicals in Frankfurt , apparently for the production of explosives [ and / or ] for biological warfare . ' ...' The US agents reported to have trailed Atta are said to have failed to inform the German authorities about their investigation , ' even as the Germans are investigating many of his associates . "
66 . " Military records show that hijackers Saeed and Ahmed Alghamdi listed their address on driver licenses and car registrations as 10 Radford Blvd. , a base roadway where residences for foreign - military flight trainees are located , according to Newsweek ( 9-15-2001 ) ... ( A ) now - mysteriously deceased , Pensacola naval flight instructor from the Royal Saudi Air Force had the same name [ Alghamdi ] and also lived and worked at the U.S. naval air base . "
67 . " U.S. military sources have given the FBI information that suggests five of the alleged hijackers of the planes that were used in [ the 9/11 ] terror attacks received training at secure U.S. military installations in the 1990s . "
68 . " Ali Mohamed was involved with most of the major al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests : ... the 1993 WTC bombing , the African Embassy bombings in 1998 and , even though he was arrested in late 1998 , [ Peter ]
Lance proposes that he also helped train some of the 9/11 hijackers in hijacking techniques .
Astoundingly , Mohamed participated in these operations while also being a U.S. citizen , being enlisted in the U.S. military , ... and being an FBI informant in California .
Importantly , ... he also had ties to the CIA . "
69 .
While " Loose Change " is attacked for getting some things incorrect , the film does correctly describe Operation Northwoods , which was approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 .
The military planners expressly said : " We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area , in other Florida cities and even in Washington [ DC ] .
... Harassment of civil air , attacks on surface shipping , and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions .
... We could sink a boatload of Cubans enroute to Florida ( real or simulated ) .
... At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers , all boarded under carefully prepared aliases . "
70 .
And , while Operation Northwoods was not implemented , another U.S. state - sponsored terror campaign called Operation Gladio did murder innocent civilians across Europe at the orchestration of the CIA ( BBC Documentary on Operation Gladio / torrent ) .

4 of 7 McCain 's money Net Worth : $ 40.4 million
Where he got it
McCain would n't exactly be poor were he on his own .
As a senator he earns $ 165,200 a year , and he has a $ 54,000 Navy pension .
And then there 's publishing .
" Faith of My Fathers , " his autobiography , was on bestseller lists for 24 weeks in 1999 .
Since then he has produced about a book a year , recently " Hard Call , " about good decisions and how historic figures made them .
In 2006 he took in about $ 225,000 in royalties , but over the years , income from books has totaled about $ 1.7 million , all of which he has donated to charity .
He can afford to be generous .
His wife Cindy is the chairman of Hensley & Co. , the Anheuser - Busch beer distribution business she inherited from her father .
As an only child , Cindy is in charge of the family trusts .
Although she only has to report that she has a salary of $ 1,000 or more , her income from investments in 2006 came to about $ 3.7 million .
Where it goes
Except for checking accounts , all the McCain assets are in Cindy 's name or those of their dependent children .
Nearly $ 5 million sits in two generation - skipping trusts .
She receives the income , but the principal passes to her heirs .
One holds mostly J.P. Morgan mutual funds and Anheuser - Busch stock , while a second trust has only Arizona municipal bonds .
Other trusts that benefit Cindy contain a variety of stocks , bonds and mutual funds .
She also owns shares in two large medical buildings in Phoenix , a guesthouse near the couple 's home in Sedona and an investment property in Coronado Beach , Calif .
Another $ 6 million in J.P. Morgan funds is held in the name of their four children .
How he could do better
In the Navy , McCain no doubt learned to keep things tidy , and the couple 's finances are shipshape .
They - and Cindy 's father - " have clearly given a great deal of thought to their estate , " says Christopher Cordaro , wealth manager at RegentAtlantic Capital .
Cordaro has just one worry : " Everything except $ 50,000 is in her name or in trust for her and the children , " he says .
" I 'd advise the senator to keep Cindy very happy - or have a good prenuptial agreement . "

The civil aviation director in Honduras has disappeared after authorities accused him of issuing pilot licences without those involved being tested .
Guillermo Seamann allegedly issued a total of 39 certificates to pilots and mechanics from Venezuela and Peru .
Authorities said the applicants never came to Honduras but used local lawyers to obtain the licences .
An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Seamann after he failed to show up at his office on Tuesday .
Charter flights
A spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , Melvin Duarte , said Mr Seamann had been under investigation for a month .
Mr Seamann is accused of abuse of authority and , if found guilty , could face a jail term of eight years .
It was not clear whether it was a case of easing the application process or that the applicants did not have enough training .
It is not known what use the Venezuelans and Peruvians made of the licences , which were apparently also valid for flying outside Honduras , local media reported .
Mr Seamann has also been accused of improperly awarding permits to US charter companies to fly to Honduras .

Our academic language is on the verge of atrophy , he says .

Recently , a conference took place in Berlin with the lovely title , " Thought Researchers " .
It dealt with the issue of whether and how one can read thoughts and feelings directly from the brain with new techniques of neuroscience .
Gathered in the auditorium were scientists , representatives of foundations and the German National Ethics Council – even the Federal Criminal Police Office had sent a delegate .
All the speakers – six Germans , plus three from the United States and one from Great Britain – were outstanding .
And they all spoke either English or , in the case of a German speaker , now and then something similar .
Unusual word - choices and serpentine sentences can make a speech seem more brilliant than it actually is .
But who in the audience spoke English ?
No one .
And even the four foreign guest speakers could easily have understood a lecture in German , because simultaneous translation was available over headsets that were readily on hand .
As someone from the sponsoring foundation told me , of course it would be better if the local guests would simply speak German .
This would increase the public resonance .
But the professors had another idea .
Their argument : People only take a conference seriously when English is the official language .
Now , one could muse over the confidence of researchers who think their credibility is enhanced in a foreign language .
Or fume over the contempt for the public , if all that the organizers care about is their standing among peers .
After all , the " Thought Researchers " had received funds for a public event , not for an experts ' forum .
Five hundred hears ago , Luca Pacioli , a pioneer of modern mathematics and accounting , bade farewell to Latin as the language of contemporary science .
Galileo Galilei followed suit , 100 years later .
They wrote in Italian , and a significant part of their contribution was in creating new terminologies for their new ideas , in the vernacular .
Knowledge was to be accessible for all .
Today , scientists are headed towards a reversal of Pacioli 's revolution .
But how do they expect to win the sympathy of a public with which they no longer even have language in common ?
And will we soon reach a point where we no longer can discuss the results of new research in German because we can't find the vocabulary ?
Society is threatening to split :
On one side will be those who employ an elite language , and on the other , all those who miss out on the latest developments .
So the issue of whether German remains a language for science is not merely a question of national pride .
It has to do with something far more momentous : democracy .
Anyone who only encounters scientific research in a foreign language pays a heavy price , even if he is a master of the idiom .
" We are dumber in English " – this was the conclusion that researchers came to in Sweden and the Netherlands , where children were introduced to English on their first day of school .
Lectures in English are part of every subject , but nevertheless , the test results are about ten percent lower on average than in courses taught in the mother tongue .
In English seminars , students ask and answer fewer questions ; they give the overall impression of being somewhat more helpless .
Neither students nor teachers are generally aware of the problem , because they all overestimate their expertise in English .
By now , English is the sole language used in lectures in 250 out of 1,976 advanced educational fields in Germany ( " master 's degree " programmes ) .
Should this development continue , it would mean certain death for German as a language of research .
In Sweden 's most renowned university , in Uppsala , they already are considering offering more programmes in Swedish or returning completely to the mother tongue for basic studies .
Students and their instructors do n't only face comprehension problems .
Language also transmits an emotional connection with a subject .
And the more abstract a discipline , the more important this relationship .
I remember well my enthusiasm when I heard the wonderfully catchy algebraic terms like kernels ( amounts added to zero ) and rings ( amounts of numbers with specific links ) .
I could immediately picture these concepts .
In the utterly abstract field of quantum physics , Erwin Schrödinger coined the term of " Verschränkung " – most closely translated into English as entanglement – for little parts that , though far from one another , always keep the exact same distance from each other .
But unlike the English term , the German word tells me right away what is meant .
Einstein described the confusion of " Verschränkung " succinctly :
It must have to do with a " spukhafte Fernwirkung , " most closely translated as " long - distance ghostly effect " – a puzzle that preoccupied physicists to this day .
Such clarity is lost forever , if the concepts only are known by the closest English equivalent .
So what can be done ?
German should remain the language for seminars and lectures .
The counter - development – that people in the natural sciences , and increasingly also in the arts , only conduct international communication in English – is irreversible .
For researchers , it 's all about influence , which is greatest when everyone uses the same Lingua franca .
It should n't hurt German scientific language if , in the course of everyday research , publications appear in English .
Such articles almost always deal with tiny advances in knowledge – like the question of whether or not gene X is expressed under the influence of protein Y .
They are oriented towards a small audience , they seldom influence scientific concepts and they are , even if composed by native speakers , usually linguistically as outstanding as a manual for a DVD player .
But a pile of puzzle pieces is still not science .
Every discipline needs publications that show connections , transmit inspiring ideas and sketch out new concepts .
Such work is intended for colleagues beyond the narrow realms of one 's own field and broaden the circles of knowledge .
They are nourished by their use of language , because the author wants to lead the public through a distant and foreign territory , and thus wishes to be as convincing as possible .
In order to preserve German as the language of science , we should make an effort along these lines .
A little initiative is needed .
These days , researchers get prestige and money for publication in the most renowned possible international journal or for an appearance at an international conference of experts .
But they do n't get that for an elegantly formulated essay about the intellectual concepts underlying their work , or for a book that puts their own work in its context , and certainly not for a lecture in a joint lecture series .
Not only that , the preparation of such an article takes more effort than a hurriedly slapped - together piece in a trade journal .
And no one in our universities teaches how best to accomplish this task .
Yet scientists thrive on their ability to learn , and are receptive to rewards , just like any of us .
So you have to offer them incentives to work on their use of language , and also to mix with the general public .
Two measures could be taken immediately to induce a change in mood :
First of all , in the future , final papers in all departments should contain a multi-page summary in an easily understandable German .
This summary would be included in the exam grade .
In addition , applications for public funding must include an extensive synopsis that any interested layperson could understand .
Every researcher owes this to democracy .
Secondly , in the future there should be a generous prize to encourage the best scientists to write .
One could recognize German - language texts in various categories :
The best collection of academic writing ; the best essay ; the best research report ; the best textbook and then a best specialized book in both the natural sciences and the humanities .
The Sigmund Freud Prize of the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung ( the German Academy for Language and Composition ) cannot deliver what is needed .
One could ask a jury to select the best German academic texts and complie these in a year book - the USA has been doing this for ages .
In the final analysis , the question of whether and how to nurture language in the sciences depends on how we perceive the business of science as a whole .
It is easy to forget that research is far more than posing hypotheses , collecting data and disproving theories .
That is the daily work .
But there is a much bigger picture produced by this collective effort :
Science is also a narration by people who want to better understand and improve the world .
That is why the works of Darwin , Galileo and Einstein fascinate us to this day .
If we re-learn how to tell the story of science , then German will have a future as a language of science .

It does n’t .
Popping open the lid reveals a set of finely crafted action figures encased in black foam : Dr. Manhattan .
Rorschach .
Ozymandias .
Nite Owl. Silk Spectre .
The Comedian .
They ’re based on comic - book superheroes that are n’t exactly household names , but if the director of the sword - and - sandals smash 300 has his way , these characters will become icons as explosive as any state - of - the - art weapon .
” In my movie , Superman does n’t care about humanity , Batman ca n’t get it up , and the bad guy wants world peace , ” Snyder says with a smirk .
” Will Watchmen be the end of superhero movies ?
Probably not .
But it sure will kick them in the gut . ”
Watchmen wo n’t hit theaters till March 6 , 2009 , but Snyder and his cast are about to face a trial by fire :
On July 25 , they ’re screening special teaser footage for thousands in San Diego at the annual summit of cult pop , Comic - Con .
The movie is no kid - safe funny - book flick .
It ’s an R- rated , $ 100 million adaptation of the smartest , most subversive superhero story ever created .
Published by DC Comics in 1986 and routinely hailed by even mainstream critics as a literary masterpiece , Watchmen is many things — a jittery expression of Cold War anxiety , a chilling meditation on human nature , an intricate murder mystery .
But at its heart this sexy , violent , and politically charged 12 - issue saga , written by Alan Moore ( click to see our Q&A with him ) and drawn by Dave Gibbons , is an epic love letter to colorfully clad superpeople and a wicked satire about them .
Set in 1985 , but in an alternate reality where Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term as president and costumed crime - fighting has been outlawed , the story begins with the brutal murder of a retired superhero named the Comedian .
Another ex-superhero , the inkblot - masked Rorschach , believes that someone is trying to assassinate his former colleagues .
Is it a serial killer at work , or is there a global conspiracy involved ?
A twisty plot unfolds , enveloping an array of bizarre , damaged , and bracingly human fantasy people .
” We wanted to explore simple questions with not - so - simple answers , ” Gibbons says .
” What if superheroes really existed ?
How would they really think ?
And how would they really affect the world ? ”
Nearly two - thirds of Egyptian men admit to having sexually harassed women in the most populous Arab country and a majority say women themselves are to blame for their maltreatment , a survey shows .
The forms of harassment reported by Egyptian men , whose country attracts millions of foreign tourists each year , include touching or ogling women , shouting sexually explicit remarks , and exposing their genitals to women .
" Sexual harassment has become an overwhelming and very real problem experienced by all women in Egyptian society , often on a daily basis , " the report by the Egyptian Centre for Women 's Rights said .
Egyptian women and female visitors frequently complain of persistent sexual harassment on Egyptian streets , despite the socially conservative nature of the traditional Muslim society .
The behaviour could have repercussions for Egypt 's tourism industry , a major foreign income earner , with 98 per cent of foreign women saying they had experienced harassment in the country , the survey said .
The survey of more than 2,000 Egyptian men and women , as well as 109 foreign women , says the vast majority of Egyptians believe that sexual harassment in Egypt is on the rise , citing a worsening economic situation and a lack of awareness or religious values .

Majority of Americans support more drilling , more conservation Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday August 9 , 2008
Print This Email
This A new poll shows that a majority of Americans support more drilling even in protected areas ( 63 percent ) , while seven in 10 said they are trying to reduce their carbon footprint , mainly through using less electricity , driving less and recycling , ABC News reported .
The poll , a combined effort of ABC News , Stanford University and Planet Green , found that 44 percent favored building more nuclear power plants -- not a majority , but still higher than the number has been in 28 years .
Sixty - four percent of Americans rated " finding new energy sources " as more important than improving conservation .
Most Republicans support offshore drilling , while most Democrats do not .
Barack Obama shifted on this position last week , saying that he would consider more drilling as a possible compromise .
Support for alternative energy sources has been greater in past polls , while objections to offshore drilling and nuclear power have decreased , indicating the anxiety many feel about the deepening energy crisis .
This is good news for Senator John McCain , whose long - term vision for energy policy is to break foreign dependence by increasing domestic production and alternative energies , the Associated Press reported in a comparison of the two candidates ' positions .
Obama 's long - term vision also focuses on developing alternative energy sources , but opts for conservation rather than ramping up production .
Americans ' worries may be tied to global warming , of which 8 in 10 said was probably happening .
Two - thirds said the US government should act on the problem even if other countries do less , and a majority said they would support a cap - and - trade system that is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Senators John McCain and Barack Obama both support a cap - and - trade system , according to Newsweek .
Almost three - quarters of those surveyed believed global warming could only be overcome through individuals willing to make large lifestyle changes .
Obama and McCain have both preached that idea .
Obama : " Energy independence will require an all - hands - on - deck effort from America effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs ; from businesses and from every American citizen
All of us will need to buy more fuel - efficient cars and find ways to improve efficiency
We can do this because we are Americans .
We do the improbable . "
McCain : " Venture capitalists , corporate planners , small businesses and environmentalists [ are ] all working to the same good purpose Together , we will break the power of OPEC over the United States
That is what this country can do when we see a danger , and declare a purpose and , find the will to act . "

Beer heater in use
I 've written before about the importance of beer temperature , and creative ways of getting it right , such as using my laptop or a digital thermometer .
I 've been frustrated with the temperature at which beer is served in many places , and so dreamed of some kind of micro - wave based heater that would solve the problem for me .
Now I 've actually found a real beer heater .
My girlfriend and I had taken a weekend trip to Göteborg ( Gothenburg ) to relax , and one evening we were having dinner in a lovely pub there , called The Rover .
They have a great range of beer , including some of the best local microbreweries , excellent pub - style food , and very good service .
The beer , however , was too cold .
I said as much to my girlfriend , and was overheard by the bartend , who was passing by just then .
" Do you think the beer is too cold , " he asked .
Well , I could hardly deny it , so I reluctantly admitted I did find the beer a bit too cold .
Reluctantly because I 'd been so happy with everything thus far that I did n't really want to complain .
The bartender , however , was completely unfazed , and asked " Do you want me to fix it for you ? "
Now this had me interested , so I said " sure " , and he disappeared behind the bar for a while .
In a few moments he came back and asked me to take a sip of the completely full glass .
He then took a kind of metal cylinder and stuffed it in my beer , which is what you see in the photo above .
After a minute or so the beer had heated appreciably , and was ready for rating .
In the photo below I 've taken it out of the beer and replaced it in the holder , and unscrewed the cap .
It turns out that the top of the cylinder can be opened , so that you can pour hot water into it .
You then replace the cap and stick it in the beer .
Ingeniously simple !
The bartender had bought his from the gift shop at the Pilsner Urquell brewery in Plzeň .
In fact , he'd bought the last three in the shop .
So clearly this is what I need to take with me when I go beer hunting , right ?
Together with a thermos flask with hot water ?
On second thoughts , maybe not .
But it was kind of cool , anyway , and certainly an example of outstanding service to demanding customers .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Families who claim the corpses of more than 1,000 relatives were dismembered and sold in an illegal body - parts scandal sued funeral directors and others on Tuesday .
The class action suit represents hundreds of people who claim their relatives ’ body parts were harvested for medical use without their consent .
It charges seven individuals , and the funeral homes and human tissue services with which they worked , with conspiracy , negligence and the intentional infliction of emotional distress .
The seven were indicted by a grand jury last September and accused of harvesting bones , skin and tendons in unsanitary conditions , and selling them to hospitals with the risk that they could infect patients who received them .
The defendants allegedly made $ 3.8 million from sale of body parts obtained in Pennsylvania , New York and New Jersey between February 2004 and September 2005 in an operation that was “ ghoulish , greedy , dangerous and criminal , ” the grand jury ’s report said .
In all , the scheme took tissue from 1,007 bodies , including 244 from Philadelphia funeral homes .
The suit , filed in the Philadelphia Court of Common pleas , alleges that after removing parts from the corpses , the accused replaced harvested bone and tissue with foreign objects such as PVC piping “ so that bodies would still appear normal for their pending visitations , funerals , or post - mortem proceedings . ”
The defendants also falsified medical documents in order to take the body parts , including one claiming that the wife of a deceased man had given permission for his tissues to be harvested .
The man , James Bonner , had never been married to the woman named in the document , the suit says .
“ We must hold the responsible parties and their accomplices accountable , ” Larry Cohan , an attorney representing the families , said in a statement .
“ These families have experienced terrible suffering -- they deserve to know the truth and get on with their lives . ”
Plaintiffs ’ attorneys are also representing the families of “ hundreds ” of people who received body parts harvested in the operation .
Named in the suit are Michael Mastromarino , Christopher Aldorasi , Lee Cruceta , Kevin Vickers , Gerald Garzone , his brother Louis Garzone and James McCafferty .
Five of the accused face criminal charges at a trial scheduled to begin on September 2 .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Yes , a depression .
Spelled : D - e - p - r - e - s - s - i - o - n.
Wake up America , recessions do n't work any more .
Why ?
Get serious folks .
We had a 30 - month recession not long ago .
Eight years later the market 's still barely at its 2000 peak , a loser .
Worse , we 're back in a new recession .
But Washington politicians are keeping it a secret , feeding us doctored feel - good statistics as legendary political historian Kevin Phillips wrote in " Numbers Racket : Why the Economy is Worse Than We Know . "
So we blindly refuse to bite the bullet and stop our out - of - control spiral into collapse .
America needs a big wake - up call ... and it 's coming soon , whether you like it or not !
Last November we posted " 17 reasons America needs a recession . "
Today it 's far worse , and getting worse still .
See previous Paul B. Farrell .
Most economists predict it 'll take till 2010 to burn off our excess housing inventory .
RGE Monitor say Fannie and Freddie bailouts are n't working ; they 'll soon be " profoundly insolvent " and need to be " nationalized . "
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has no long - term plans , he 's a caretaker , plugging holes , anxious to get back to Wall Street 's money machine , running out the clock till he turns over the catastrophe he enflamed to a new bunch of politicians and their armies of 42,000 greedy lobbyists .
Lessons learned ?
Zero .
Why ?
Wall Street , Washington and Corporate America are a one - trick pony with one narrow - minded strategy : Economic g - r - o - w - t-h , bull markets , megabonuses .
In good times they tout " free markets . "
But when greed bombs , these big babies throw free market " principles " under the " Reagan Revolution " bus as their lobbyists go whining to Congress for megabillion taxpayer bailouts and access at the Fed casino 's discount window to siphon off more taxpayer money .
What hypocritical wimps !
Wall Street and its co-conspirators are doing such a miserable job , America needs a new strategy : Stop all the short - term " hole - plugging . "
Let go and let an old - fashioned " Good Depression " do the job that our happy - talking leaders refuse to do .
Let it clean house and reawaken America to basic values .
Otherwise a " Good Depression " will turn into a new " Great Depression . "
Here are seven strong reasons favoring this alternative strategy :
1. Yes , an honest diagnosis : soul sickness in American capitalism
America 's problems are not the economy , not markets , nor even politics .
The endless bickering campaign is distracting us from facing our real long - term problems .
Yes , our economic pains are real , but they 're just symptoms .
Since 2000 America has seen had a relentless , sickening overdose of bad news : stupidity , deceit , corruption and even evil behavior .
Americans are n-u - m-b , suffering post - traumatic shock syndrome .
The real problem is our thinking , our brains -- something deep in our cosmic soul , says Jack Bogle 's " The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism . "
We lost our values , our moral compass .
2 . Yes , time to admit this really is like the 1930's Great Depression
Comparing today with the Great Depression has become common sport .
In a Newsweek special " Seeing Shades of the 1930s , " Daniel Gross writes : 75 years ago " Wall Street , after two terms of a business - friendly Republican president , self - immolated on a pyre of greed , incompetence and excessive optimism . "
Like Dr. Scott Peck says in " The Road Less Traveled : " " Life is a series of problems .
Do we want to moan about them or solve them ? "
We need to grow up , stop whining , roll our sleeves up and solve real problems .
3 . Yes , a Good Depression would reveal self - destruct bubble - thinking
In a recent Atlantic article " Irrational Exuberance " author Robert Shiller warns : " Bubbles are primarily social phenomena .
Until we understand and address the psychology that fuels them , they 're going to keep forming . "
Housing inflated 85 % in a decade : " Historically unprecedented ... no rational basis for it . "
Today there 's a huge excess housing inventory , higher - credit mortgages are now in jeopardy , the write - offs are now projected at $ 2 trillion -- on top of a $ 3 trillion war , $ 10 trillion federal budget , and more .
Bubble - thinking is contagious ; it will trigger a pandemic .
Shiller says " few people seem immune to boom thinking .
The recent bubble grew so large partly because the very people responsible for the financial system 's oversight came to share the general public 's rosy expectations . "
Unfortunately our leaders are still ignoring the underlying problem : Nothing is being done about " our psychological vulnerability to bubble - thinking . "
Shiller then warns of a new megameltdown : " We recently lived through two epidemics of excessive financial optimism .
I believe we are close to a third episode , only this one will spread irrational pessimism and distrust -- not exuberance ... our economic problems will become much worse than they need to be , and our social problems will multiply . "
4 . Yes , a Good Depression will stir outrage , force real reforms
In a recent Wall Street Journal article , Jim Grant , Forbes columnist and respected editor of the Interest Rate Observer , framed his title as a question : " Why No Outrage ? "
Why ?
He notes : " Through history , outrageous financial behavior has been met with outrage .
But today Wall Street 's damaging recklessness has been met with near - silence , from a too tolerant populace . "
Tolerant ?
No , n-u-m-b!
" Human progress seems to be the likeliest culprit . "
Fear - driven , we prefer the devil we know to a new one .
Yet while " Wall Street may be sweating to fill out this year 's bonus pool , " Grant worries that Wall Street will run " itself and the rest of the American financial system right over a cliff . "
A Good Depression brings outrage .
5 . Yes , Good Depression forces Wall Street to think outside the box
In a great Bloomberg Markets feature , " No Easy Fix , " we 're told Wall Street 's " profit formula has hit a wall ...
Wall Street 's money - making machine is broken and efforts to repair it after the biggest losses in history are likely to undermine profits for years to come . "
Merrill Lynch is a good example :
It is selling 615 million new shares , a 38 % dilution , while hanging on to " $ 30.6 billion in crummy derivatives , " says Dennis Berman in the Wall Street Journal .
Merrill 's stock is about half the 2004 price of $ 55 .
Merrill " needs to come up with $ 2.8 billion in new profit , not sales , to get back to its 2004 per share earnings levels .
That 's $ 43,000 in new profit for each of Merrill 's 65,000 employees . "
Unfortunately , Merrill 's cash cows ( off - balance sheet gimmicks , derivatives , repackaged asset - backed securitization ) that made megabucks the past decade " have largely disappeared .
That puts the burden on Merrill 's old - line businesses -- brokerage , asset management and investment banking . "
Solutions ?
Cut costs , steal market share or " gradually start to take on more risk on Merrill 's trading desks , which produced the bulk of the $ 30 billion in losses the past 12 months . "
Warning : Expect more desperate , high - risk and stupid moves : A new BusinessWeek report says Wall Street 's already lobbying Congress to raid America 's $ 2.3 trillion " pension honey pot . "
Warning :
These are the same greed - is - good Gordon Gekkos that brought us the last two rapid - fire meltdowns .
Stop them before they turn the next into a Great Depression .
6 . Yes , a Good Depression can prevent America 's decline and fall
In " The Price of Liberty : Paying for America 's Wars , " Robert Hormats , Goldman Sachs international vice chairman , traces America 's wartime financing from the Revolutionary War to present .
Today we 're " relying on faith over experience , hoping that sustained growth will erase deficits and that the ballooning costs of Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid will be manageable in the coming decades without difficult reforms . "
Former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker put it in more ominous terms :
" There are striking similarities between America 's current situation and that of another great power from the past : Rome . "
They fell for three reasons " worth remembering : declining moral values and political civility at home , an overconfident and overextended military in foreign lands , and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government . "
And Pulitzer Prize winning geographer Jared Diamond takes an even broader historical view in " Collapse : How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail : " Many " civilizations share a sharp curve of decline .
Indeed , a society 's demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak population , wealth and power . "
He draws historical parallels with America in the past decade .
Warning : Wall Street 's next meltdown wo n't be a mere statistical recession .
Our monetary system , our financial system and our tax base are burning out .
Like our overextended military , we are handicapped in our ability to face new threats , much as were Rome , the Mayans and other great civilizations .
7. Yes , a Good Depression will shock America 's warring soul
President Bush said he 's a " war president . "
The American economy is a war economy driven by our warring soul .
We spend 54 % of the tax dollar on war , 47 % of the world 's total military spending .
A half century ago President Eisenhower warned of this " military industrial complex " that 's running America into bankruptcy .
Today , our economy thrives on war and disasters , generating such " spectacular profits that many people around the world " are convinced America 's " rich and powerful must be deliberately causing catastrophes so that they can exploit them " says Naomi Klein in " Shock Doctrine . "
Klein 's snapshot of Wall Street 's soul is disturbing : " An economic system that requires constant growth , while bucking almost all serious attempts at environmental regulation , generates a steady stream of disasters all on its own , whether military , economical or financial .
The appetite for easy , short profits offered by purely speculative investment has turned the stock , currency and real estate markets into crisis - creation machines "
Pray for a Good Depression ... before they trigger another Great Depression .
Paulson : Bush right when he said Wall Street ' got drunk ' and now has a ' hangover ' Associated Press
Published : Sunday August 10 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , a former investment firm executive , says " absolutely there 's a lot of truth " to President Bush 's comment that Wall Street " got drunk and now it 's got a hangover , " in understanding the current economic climate .
Paulson also is taking a wait - and - see approach on a possible second round of economic aid , an idea that congressional Democrats are pushing to a vote .
The $ 168 billion program of tax rebate checks that Bush signed into law in February was the right size to help the struggling economy this year , Paulson said .
He wants to see how it ends up helping the economy in the July through September period and worries about driving the budget deficit higher with a second plan .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to have the House vote on additional aid when lawmakers return in September from their summer vacation .
She believes more is needed to counter higher gasoline prices and other costs .
The economy is struggling to emerge from crises in the housing , financial and credit markets and cope with rising prices at the pump and grocery store .
Paulson , in a television interview broadcast Sunday , asserted that the country 's economic fundamentals are sound .
But asked about Bush 's remark , the former Goldman Sachs chairman and chief executive acknowledged Wall Street has played a role in the current downtown , particularly in its borrowing and lending practices .
" Absolutely there 's a lot of truth to what the president said .
And in terms of Wall Street , there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized , because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex , structured products , which were difficult to understand , " Paulson said .
" So there was excess leverage , excess complexity . "
The president , in an unguarded moment , made the comment at a political fundraiser in Houston last month after asking members of the audience to turn off their video cameras .
The request was ignored and a snippet wound up on a blog .
The media was barred from the event .
" There is no question about it .
Wall Street got drunk , " the president said .
" That 's one reason I asked you to turn off your TV cameras . "
" The question is , How long will it ( take to ) sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments ? "
Paulson has offered a 218 - page blueprint for overhauling regulation of the nation 's financial system .
The plan would create three super agencies with power over the financial industry .
It is the broadest proposal since the current system was formed in response to the biggest financial crisis of the last century , the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression .
" We have , of course , one priority getting through this period with as little damage , as little negative impact as possible on the economy .
But the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future , " Paulson .
But time is running out on the administration 's term - Bush leaves office in January - and Paulson said he would not continue serving as treasury secretary under the next president in hopes of seeing the new rules through .
He said the $ 168 billion stimulus effort has helped the economy and he wants to give the tax rebate checks more time to boost growth .
" We sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long - term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget .
So again , my view would be let 's see how this program works in the third quarter , " Paulson said .
He said the current focus is on the housing rescue bill that Bush recently signed .
It is designed to help 400,000 families avoid losing their homes to foreclosures and to provide a financial lifeline to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the mortgage companies that own or guarantee nearly half of the nation 's home mortgages .
The Democrats ' new aid plan could include additional tax rebates , heating and air - conditioning subsidies for the poor , public works projects , higher food stamp payments and aid to the states .
Paulson said it would take " well beyond the end of the year " to work through the serious problems in housing , an industry experiencing its worst downturn in more than two decades .
But Paulson repeated his belief that the nation 's economy remains fundamentally sound despite the mounting losses on bad mortgage loans that have shaken Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Back in April , McAfee launched an experiment designed as a tribute to Morgan Spurlock 's Super - Size Me documentary on eating nothing but McDonald 's food for 30 days .
Instead of fast food , however , McAfee gathered a group of some 50 volunteers from Australia , Brazil , France , Germany , Italy , Mexico , The Netherlands , Spain , the US , and the UK .
Once this elite group of sacrificial goats brave souls had been assembled , McAfee put them on a diet of pure spam .
No , we 're not referring to the creamy mounds of whipped pig nestled inside a pop - top container — although 30 days of eating it might make an interesting experiment in and of itself — but the kind of spam that arrives via your inbox and tempts you with online degrees , job offers , free XBox 360s , and magnanimous gifts from your great - uncle Dmitri back in Russia .
McAfee ran its S.P.A.M. ( Spammed Persistently All Month ) campaign from April 1 to May 1 .
There do n't appear to be any official details of how the contest was run , but five UK participants in the program were asked to blog about their experience on a daily basis .
Based on their early entries ( available here ) , it seems that McAfee distributed new laptops to the group specifically for the purposes of the experiment .
The volunteers then ran around the ' Net on their own , signing up for free offers , new web sites , and all the other various goodies the bowels of the Internet purport to offer .
The five bloggers chose different initial approaches .
Danielle started by googling for " free stuff , " Dan went for freebie funny clips , and Simon cut straight to the chase by hunting for Viagra .
It did n't take long for spam to start trickling in — multiple people report receiving spam within hours of registering at a site — and that trickle steadily grew into first a river and then a flood as the days passed .
At the end of 30 days , Simon had collected 7,084 spam emails , Danielle had 2,131 , and Vic was apparently just under 2,000 .
Simon 's decision to chase the Viagra market may not have done anything for his sex life , but it did substantially enlarge his inbox .
If you ever wanted concrete proof that the " Do n't share my information with other companies " and " Stop emailing me " options on a web site are often useless , it 's here .
It 's impossible to know which companies share data and which do n't , but registering with the " do not share my e-mail " option ticked did n't appear to reduce spam in any way .
Some of the bloggers reported a drop in the amount of spam they were receiving on a day - to - day basis when they unsubscribed from certain services , but the trend is not particularly strong .
The BBC ran a story and interview with Leslie Finlayson , who participated in the experiment .
She reports receiving 23,751 emails in three months ( the official experiment was only 30 days long ) , despite the fact that she began unsubscribing to services as early as the second week of the test .
As she states , " It would appear that reputable companies are selling on our e-mail addresses to less reputable companies , which then go along the line until you get this kind of rubbish coming through your inbox . "
McAfee 's experiment is an excellent example of how even the most basic safe surfing techniques can have a profound impact on a person 's overall " Internet experience . "
Leslie received an average of 264 spam e-mails per day , while Simon followed at 236 .
Even 2,000 e-mails in 30 days equates to 67 per day , and that 's enough to be annoying .
Keeping one 's e-mail address relatively private is a simple way to cut down on spam .

“ I say for a thousandth time that we are a friend of all people in the world , even Israelis and Americans , ” the daily newspaper Etemad quoted Esfandiar Rahim Mashai , the vice president for tourism , as saying .

Mr Fossett had about 100 world records to his name A team of 10 elite athletes and expert mountaineers has resumed the search for missing adventurer Steve Fossett .
The team is concentrating its efforts on remote wooded areas of Nevada near where Mr Fossett , 63 , was last seen , the Associated Press reported .
Multimillionaire businessman
Mr Fossett was declared legally dead in February , five months after he disappeared while flying solo over the Nevada desert .
Exhaustive searches have failed to find any trace of him or his plane .
Geologist and adventure racer Simon Donato , leading the latest search effort , has said they will search in wooded areas where wreckage could have been difficult to spot from the air .

" Whether we luck out and find the wreckage or not , at least our tracks will be preserved so that in the future if someone wants to give this a try they 'll know where we already were and they can got to the next mountain range over , " he said .
The area being searched is close to the ranch of hotel magnate Barron Hilton , at Yerington , from where Mr Fossett 's plane had taken off for a flight expected to last three hours .
The team will cover about 20 miles ( 32 km ) a day The rugged terrain includes mountain peaks between 10,000 ft ( 3,000 m ) and 11,000 ft ( 3,350 m ) .
Team members , who are paying their own way , have a base camp between the Bodie Hills and Sweetwater Mountains .
They began their search on Monday and hope to cover up to 20 miles ( 32 km ) every day until Friday or Saturday , depending on the terrain .
Mr Donato , 31 , said Mr Fossett was a hero to many people and he dismissed speculation that his disappearance might have been staged .
" We 're here on the premise that he did crash , unfortunately , " he said .
" I really respect him .
He has done so much . "
Following Mr Fossett 's disappearance , many private and military planes searched an area of about 20,000 square miles ( 51,800 sq km ) for him .
Ground searches were also carried out and other volunteers scoured high - resolution satellite photographs over the internet .
Widow ' not involved '
In August Robert Hyman , an American investor and mountaineer , plans to bring in a team of up to 15 climbers , mountain guides and others with local expertise to scour an area east of the section where Mr Donato will search .
Mr Hyman has said he will focus on the Wassuk Range of mountains .
Mr Fossett 's widow , Peggy , has issued a statement saying that she is not involved in the latest search and has " no further plans for additional searching " .
Steve Fossett had about 100 world records to his name .
In March 2005 , became the first person to fly a plane solo , non -stop around the globe .

Says criminal elements of the government “ can and will ” use bio-weapons to scare and terrorize Americans when it is politically convenient
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , August 22 , 2008
A former government biological weapons legislator appeared on the nationally syndicated Alex Jones show yesterday to discuss his detailed knowledge of the cover up of the 2001 anthrax attacks , which he is adamant were perpetrated by criminal elements of the US government in an attempt to foment a police state by killing off opposition to hardline post 9/11 legislation .
Dr Franics A. Boyle literally helped write the law with regards to terrorism , as he was responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism
Act of 1989 that was passed unanimously by both Houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bush Snr .
Professor Boyle teaches international law at the University of Illinois , Champaign .
He holds a Doctor of Law Magna Cum Laude as well as a Ph.D. in Political Science , both from Harvard University .
He has also served on the Board of Directors of Amnesty International ( 1988 -1992 ) , and represented Bosnia - Herzegovina at the World Court .
In light of the latest developments with the FBI Anthrax investigation , the professor joined Alex Jones on air to re-cap the story that made waves in late 2006 .
In October 2001 when the anthrax attacks took place and it was revealed that the spores were super weapons grade anthrax at one trillion spores per gram created with special electro- static treatment , Dr Boyle says it became obvious to him that there was nowhere it could have come from other than a government lab .
Dr Boyle proceeded to call a very high level official in the FBI who deals with terrorism and counter - terrorism , Spike Bowman , whom he had met at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School .
Dr Boyle went through all the names , the contractors and the labs for Anthrax work with the FBI ’s Bowman .
Bowman then informed Dr Boyle that the FBI was working with bio-lab Fort Detrick on the matter , to which he responded that Fort Detrick could really be the main problem .
“ I told Mr Bowman in October of 2001 that the only people that had the capability to do this would be those individuals working at either United States Government labs , or private contractors and things of this nature , and it obviously seemed to me that this was U.S. government related . ” the University of Illinois Professor told listeners .
It was documented at the time that the anthrax strain used was military grade .
This was later widely reported in 2002 in publications such as the New Scientist .
“ At that point I assumed good faith on the part of the FBI in this investigation because it had killed several people , it had shut down the United States Congress , which I think was probably the greatest political crime ever inflicted on our Republic in its history .
But then I read that the FBI had authorized the destruction of the U.S. government ’s Ames strain collection . ”
Boyle continued .
The destruction of the anthrax culture collection at Ames , IA . , from which the Ft. Detrick lab got its pathogens for U.S. biowarfare programs , was blatant destruction of evidence as it meant that there was no way of finding out which strain was sent to who to develop the larger breed of anthrax used in the attacks .
The trail of genetic evidence would have led directly back to a secret but officially - sponsored US government biowarfare program that was illegal and criminal .
“ I knew a cover up was underway because legitimate scientific researchers could have taken that collection and used it to genetically re-construct precisely where and when and how the weapon came from .
This was clearly a federal crime in its own right . ”
Boyle stated .
The Professor explained that the motive behind the
attacks was clear :
" I believe the first anthrax attack was designed
to ram through the PATRIOT ACT because Senators Daschle and Leahy
were holding it up and once the anthrax occurred it rammed right
through , indeed , on the renewal of the USA PATRIOT ACT , Senator
Feingold was holding it up and all of sudden out of nowhere some
white powdered substance appeared at one of the Senate office
buildings , and all of a sudden the renewal of the PATRIOT ACT
went through . "
The evidence becomes more compelling when you take
into consideration the fact that the White House
was on anthrax fighting antibiotics weeks prior to the attacks .
The professor stressed that a criminal cover up
took place and that it is ongoing :
" They are still doing it today , if you read
the investigation , the press conference they heard the other day ,
it does not add up , if you read the article in today ’s New York
Times it does not add up , it appears that the FBI set the investigation
up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they
were doing , they could not communicate with anyone else and only
communicated with and took samples from the FBI . "
" There is today in existence a stock pile of
super weapons grade anthrax that is under the control of the original
perpetrators of the anthrax attacks of October 2001 and that stock
pile can and will be used again when their masters decide it would
be politically convenient to scare and terrorize the American
people . "
" They could launch another attack on us , including
Congress , the Judiciary , the media . "
The professor warned .
" I think what we need to do now is insist upon a full scale
Congressional investigation , not some type of presidential commission
cover up along the lines of the 9/11 report . "
Professor Boyle
concluded .
Dr Boyle also covered the new evidence suggesting
that Dr Ivins , the man the FBI named as the leading suspect in
their investigation two weeks ago , has been used as a patsy in
the cover up .
" Ivins is only the latest dead microbiologist . "
Boyle stated , " You also have to tie into this the large numbers
of dead microbiologists that have appeared since around the summer
before these events , when the New York Times revealed the existence
of the covert anthrax weapons programs run by the CIA , and that
too is in the public record . "
Boyle stressed .

PALO ALTO , CALIF .
— It was perhaps the most highly touted press conference of the week , but it did n't reveal much in the way of evidence :
Three bigfoot enthusiasts announced today that a series of genetic tests performed on samples taken from a carcass they claim is a Sasquatch came back as a mixture of human and opossum .
In addition to the mixed DNA results , Tom Biscardi , Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer showed the audience two blurry photos , one of a solitary figure in mixed hardwood forest and another of the mouth of what appeared to be the tongue and teeth of a primate .
Nevertheless , fielding questions from a packed room in Palo Alto , the trio called their discovery groundbreaking and held to their claim that the animal they are currently holding in " an undisclosed location " is indeed the legendary bigfoot .
" We 're not bigfoot hunters originally , " Whitton said .
" We stumbled upon this creature .
It was a stroke of luck , I can tell you that . "
Whitton and Dyer said they discovered the carcass when they were hiking in a forest near their home sometime in June and that it has been stored in a large freezer since then .
They refused to say exactly where and when , stating only that it was in northern Georgia and that they captured video of several live animals .
They said when they found the carcass they hauled it into a truck and brought it to a freezer .
They then set up a Web site to offer tours into the area and made an announcement on a bigfoot enthusiast radio program .
That 's when Biscardi got involved , moved the animal to another location , and began contacting the media .
In the week before the press conference , Whitton and Dyer spent several days sparring with skeptics and created a YouTube video where they held a stuffed bear up to the camera and repeated their claims of having found a Sasquatch .
Meanwhile , Biscardi sent three samples of the carcass to biologist Curtis Nelson at the University of Minnesota for analysis .
In an e-mail , Nelson told Biscardi that most of DNA segments taken from two of the samples matched human DNA .
One came back as a likely match for an American opossum .
Biscardi said this is likely from a stomach sample and that the creature might have eaten an opossum .
He did not say why he had sampled from the stomach .
Despite Biscardi's assurances that soon he would bring in scientists from Stanford University and journalists from Fox News to inspect the body , scientists are skeptical that the find is legitimate .
" It 's about what I expected , " said Jeffrey Meldrum , a professor of anatomy and anthropology from Idaho State University in Pocatello who has studied the bigfoot phenomenon .
" Today they should have produced a physical piece of the corpse , if not the corpse itself .
Until they produce the body , it does n't matter . "
" What they should have done is contact a reputable scientist and have it examined at a known university , " said Benjamin Radford , who writes for the Skeptical Inquirer magazine and has followed bigfoot hunters for more than a decade .
" Instead , this whole thing is very cloak and dagger .
It all about , ' We have unnamed scientists working at an undisclosed location under armed guard . ' "
Meldrum said it 's still remotely possible the claims are genuine , but that the group 's behavior resembles that of previous hoaxes .
He said that even if the genetic testing had turned up some evidence that it was bigfoot , no one can verify where the animal was found .
Today 's pronouncement was not Biscardi 's first .
In 2005 he claimed that he had captured a Sasquatch .
The beast never materialized , and Biscardi said he had been swindled by a deranged attention - seeker .
Radford says hoaxers make money off tours through bigfoot country and with documentary films — a motivation Biscardi does n't discount .
When asked at the press conference how much money he expects to make from his alleged discovery , Biscardi said , " As much as I possibly can . "
He said , however , that he will satisfy all skeptics when he releases the actual body .
Earlier this week he invited Megyn Kelly of Fox News to Georgia to view the carcass .

Wolf now a real journalist 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
After Josh Wolf took a job as a general assignment reporter at the Palo Alto Daily Post last month , he had some choice words for critics who 've questioned his claim of being a journalist .
" If the haters who said I was n't a real journalist , are still lurking , " Wolf wrote on his blog , " I hope you do n't have too much indigestion after eating your words . ' "
Wolf , 26 , is the San Francisco video blogger who in 2006 began a 226 - day stint in federal prison for contempt after refusing to testify before a grand jury and hand over a videotape of a protest against a G - 8 summit he filmed in the Mission District in which a police officer was injured .
At the time , Wolf was harshly criticized by some mainstream journalists who suspected that the self - described " anarchist and activist " was a participant rather than an impartial news gatherer .
In a court filing , U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan dismissed Wolf as someone who needed " to come to grips with the fact that he was simply a person with a video camera who happened to record some public events . "
The case helped fuel the debate over the definition of what constitutes journalism - in an age of blog posts and video uploads by noncredentialed amateurs - and who is entitled to press protections , specifically journalists ' ability to maintain the confidentiality of an unnamed source or unpublished material .
For now ,
Wolf said the debate concerning his professional status can be put to rest .
" I felt like it was an irrelevant argument before , " Wolf said .
" But it feels like it 's much harder for them to make their point now that it 's how I earn my paycheck . "
From blog to print
The shift from only a blogger to a just - the - facts reporter at a 16,500 - circulation newspaper may seem counterintuitive at a time when newspapers and their staffs are shrinking .
Yet Wolf enjoys the lot of a small - town cub reporter at a traditional local newspaper , which does n't even maintain a Web site .
At the Palo Alto Daily Post , he files 10 to 15 stories a week written in standard newspaper style , devoid of personal analysis , and most of his stories are only a few hundred words long and fail to include what Wolf calls the " significant nuances " of his reporting .
" I could write 10,000 words on some stories , " Wolf said .
" But I think it 's understood you 're trying to get the facts of the story a reader can easily understand , and no story is free of minute details that are also important . "
For the Aug. 7 edition of the Post , Wolf penned items for the police blotter ( " First block of Embarcadero : Six windows were reported broken at 10:59 a.m. " ) , wrote a lead - up to the county fair ( Headline : " Cattle Drive Means it 's County Fair Time " ) and a short item on a homeless woman who was charged with writing threats to a police officer .
( Wolf had to use dashes in the family newspaper to convey the offensive word she used . )
Dave Price , the publisher and editor of the Post , said he first met Wolf after trying to dispatch a reporter for a prison interview with him in 2006 .
After Wolf 's release in April 2006 , Price said he wanted to meet " the legend among journalists " and , after a short trial period during which Wolf wrote a few stories , offered him a staff job .
Price said Wolf has displayed an ability to work as a traditional reporter , seeking out multiple sources and not allowing personal views to seep into his copy .
" That 's how you have to operate in this business , " Price said , who launched the paper in May to compete with Palo Alto Daily News , owned by the Denver chain MediaNews Group .
" And he 's shown he can do that . "
Wolf got his first taste of reporting when he worked on his school paper at Serrano High School in Southern California .
He wrote news briefs for the weekly Santa Barbara Independent during college and worked at Peralta Community College as a video producer before he collected his infamous video footage .
Activist or reporter ?
Christine Tatum , former president of the Society of Professional Journalists , who led many of the discussions in 2006 about whether Wolf should receive the national group 's support and financial backing , said debates centered on Wolf 's description of himself on his blog as an anarchist and activist , not a reporter .
" We did n't see ' journalist ' in that ( description ) , and that made us wonder , ' Were we getting behind a guy who was not there to gather news but who was involved ( in the protests ) ? ' " Tatum said .
" I can't speak for Josh , but there was this thinking going around at the time , ' Oh , man , down with the mainstream media . '
Yet , it was the mainstream media who was right there to help Josh out . "
Tatum said her group ultimately supported Wolf , making its largest donation ever of $ 31,000 to support his legal defense , after agreeing that his actions - gathering information for the intent to distribute it - constituted an act of journalism .
" There are very few easy poster children for good causes of journalism , " Tatum said , noting that every high - profile case , such as those involving Judith Miller and BALCO , has its areas of gray .
" It 's less important for people to debate who is a journalist and more important for people to consider : Is it journalism ? "
Forging a new rep
Even though the debate played out in newspaper columns and blogs and continues at length on Wolf 's Wikipedia discussion page where users haggle over his reputation - " If his only journalistic quality is that he runs around with a camera and films stuff , then a whole lot of teenagers can be considered journalists , " wrote one anonymous user - the question of professional status was irrelevant in federal court , said David Greene of Oakland 's First Amendment Project , one of Wolf 's attorneys .
Because shield laws that protect journalists from being forced to submit to subpoena power and turn over sources do not exist at the federal level , Wolf 's official job title was of little consequence .
To gain his release , Wolf and his attorneys eventually struck a deal in which he aired the entire videotape on his Web site but avoided testifying before a grand jury about his material .
( He also had to declare he did not know who was involved in injuring the police officer . )
Since his release , Wolf has worked as a video producer and a volunteer reporter at the Berkeley radio station KPFA .
He also unsuccessfully ran for mayor of San Francisco in 2007 , though he said that was " to make a statement " against the status quo and Mayor Gavin Newsom .
He 's also working on a side project , a live video news site called Local Live , where users will be alerted to updates via Twitter , a social networking site that limits exchanges to short posts , text messages or e-mail alerts .
Wolf envisions Local Live cameramen will receive texts from viewers , who will then be able to relay the queries at a press conference or a breaking news event .
But for now , though still blogging , Wolf is honing his chops in a medium that began in 1605 .
" The fact is that all journalism is based on solid writing , " Wolf said .
" And there is no better place to practice the fundamentals of journalism than at a local daily newspaper . "

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime recently released the executive summary of its annual Afghanistan Opium Survey .
The UN 's spin : land area devoted to opium production in Afghanistan dropped by about one - fifth from the year before , a dramatic decrease .
The rest of the story : 2008 's estimated opium crop was the second largest in Afghan history .
The Observer reported on Aug. 24 , 2008 ( " Helmand 's Fields Yield A Bumper Opium Harvest " ) that " New figures from the United Nations to be released this week are set to reveal that opium production in the southern regions of Afghanistan has soared .
The worst affected province is Helmand , where 7,000 British soldiers are deployed .
Officials are likely to stress successes in the north and east of the country , where the number of provinces free of poppy is set to rise .
Last year 13 provinces across the country were declared free of opium cultivation - largely in the relatively secure north .
However , there are fears that extreme hardship caused by drought and long - standing deep poverty in the newly poppy - free zones may threaten that progress .
' In the north , where there is a degree of legitimate government and political leadership , poppy production has been dropping , ' said Christina Oguz , representative in Afghanistan for the UN Office on Drugs and Crime .
' But the severe drought after a harsh winter means that , if we are to sustain the downward train , much more needs to be done . '
Oguz said it was critical that the Afghan government and the international community ' show that they will ensure food supplies and massive and targeted long and short - term development ' areas where farmers decided not to plant poppy last year .
' I am not sure that is going to happen , ' she said in an interview in Kabul . "
According to the Observer , " A second worrying development is the growing ' professionalisation ' of local drugs production , with mobile laboratories increasingly manufacturing high - quality heroin within Afghanistan .
Previously , opium was turned into heroin outside the country .
' Most of the labs which were round here have gone down to the south , ' said Shinwari .
In Helmand province , the extension of agricultural land that has been the result of recent development work has allowed further opium production .
However , the poppy harvest has been affected by a glut on the market which has lowered the price paid ' at the farm gate ' and high global wheat prices which have made other crops more attractive . "

DES MOINES , Iowa – Barack Obama shied away from triumphantly proclaiming total victory over Hillary Rodham Clinton last night , but he certainly annihilated the central reason she gives for staying in the race .
The Clinton team claims that Sen. Obama is nothing more than a black candidate with a sidecar of liberal academics .
This is why , the Clintons argue , white Democrats in working - class and rural states simply can’t pull the lever for this black guy with a foreign - sounding name .
And , the Clinton ’s implied reasoning goes , since she appeals so much to these racist white Democrats that are the “ backbone ” of the party , she would make a much better nominee against Republican Sen.
John McCain .
So what about the claim that because of opposition from working - class white Democrats , Obama ca n’t win in November ?
It is hard to imagine that the hostility of these white voters would be quite so stark had Sen .
Clinton not spent the past four months campaigning on precisely this schism .
Exit polling last night showed just how persuasive Clinton has been in convincing these voters that they should n’t back Obama .
Obama ’s inspired choice of venue last night – Des Moines – reminded everyone that once upon a time , rural and working - class white Democrats were pretty eager to get behind him as an agent of complete change in Washington .
Here in Iowa , where blacks make up less than three percent of the population , Democrats in January overwhelmingly chose an untested black man over the well - known Queen of the Party .
And so last night , Obama came back here once again to , yet again , put an end to the Clinton Dynasty .
What a long journey it ’s been .

Sometimes when merlyn or I consult on Perl projects , it turns out that the client expects a magic wand .
Somehow , because we have our names on books or speak at conferences , when we load code into an editor , that alone should magically fix things while at the same time not changing any code or any part of the process .
Randal has started calling this " chuck norris " - ing the code .
I do n't know if he invented the phrase , but it 's likely .
— Update Randal says he has n't heard anyone use it , so I say he 's the inventor .
Chuck Norris is a real , yet mythic and legendary figure for Americans .
He 's a kick ass martial arts guy who fought Bruce Lee in Meng long guo jiang .
In his various movies and TV series he saves the world through force of will and by just showing up .
Chuck Norris is the man who can do anything , and the universe is afraid of him .
Not just the people in the universe , the actual universe itself .
Chuck Norris 's abilities are collected in Chuck Norris Facts , which include :
Chuck Norris does n't read books .
He stares them down until he gets the information he wants .
Chuck Norris ’ hand is the only hand that can beat a Royal Flush .
Chuck Norris can lead a horse to water AND make it drink .
Chuck Norris does n’t wear a watch , HE decides what time it is .
When Stonehenge consults , we normally accept clients we think we can help .
We 're not firefighters or contractors ; we want to help people use Perl effectively .
We want to leave your work environment a better place through actual consulting ( where we discover and advise ) and training .
Typically , these situations are one of three situations :
Things are slow , and we do n't know why or how to fix it
Things take up too much memory , and we do n't know how to fix it
Things can be better , but we do n't know where to start
For most of our clients , this works out just fine .
We spend a concentrated amount of time looking at everything and can point the way .
It 's not always that the client does n't know , but that they need someone else to say it for them .
The tech people convince the managers by having us confirm what they have been saying .
In other cases , they just need a little push in the right direction .
For the occasional client , often a very big company , hires us and makes all the right noises about their commitment to improving their work process , yada yada , and we schedule a week to do the initial assessment .
These clients often do n't have test machines or even a test suite .
No big deal .
Those are things that we can fix .
However , there is this weird sub - group of companies who pay consultants for answers they never intend to use , even setting aside the situations that are just kick - backs , money laundering , and so on .
We ask about getting an account on the test machine , but they tell us that 's the same as the production machine .
Okay , so no test machines , mark that down for the report .
Next we want to run the test suite to benchmark the code .
We can't report where to ended if we did n't figure out where we started .
Some companies do n't have test suites .
That 's not a big deal .
Again , we 're here to help .
However , there 's a small group that also does n't want a test suite .
" We do n't have time to write tests " , yada yada .
They know what they need to do but have some social roadblocks to solve .
This brings us to another , even smaller group — the one that motivates this post .
This smaller group does n't want to change the code !
We can make all the recommendations we like , such as " use DBI instead of system calls to talk to the database " or " expat is a lot faster than regular expressions on 100 Mb files ! " , but that does n't matter .
Change is bad , and editing files is change , so editing files is bad .
We know how to commit to revision control , but not branch or revert , so do n't change anything !
Oh , and we all share the same working copy and we 're used to that so we 're going to keep doing that .
They want us to make everything better without changing anything ( anything at all ) , as if we could " chuck norris " the situation :
The system works because Chuck Norris tells it to work
Chuck Norris does n't need a test suite .
The test suite needs Chuck Norris .
CPUs run faster to get away from Chuck Norris
Chuck Norris normalizes all schema just by inserting random data
Chuck Norris can compile syntax errors
Packets travel faster than the speed of light for Chuck Norris , but he can still catch them
Chuck Norris has Internet 3
Check Norris can parse invalid XML
Chuck Norris can break Moore's Law
Chuck Norris 's brain is his revision control , and it works better than git
Most of all , though , " chuck norris " is now our code name for jobs where we were hired to do something specific which we are then not allowed to actually do :
Chuck Norris can fix everything without changing anything .
I like this phrase , and it might even be a way to bring up the subject with managers and other roadblocks without being so serious .
I hope that we do n't have more clients like that though . :)

Stretchable silicon camera next step to artificial retina
( Nanowerk News )
By combining stretchable optoelectronics and biologically inspired design , scientists have created a remarkable imaging device , with a layout based on the human eye .
As reported in the Aug. 7 issue of the journal Nature , researchers at the University of Illinois and Northwestern University have developed a high - performance , hemispherical " eye " camera using an array of single - crystalline silicon detectors and electronics , configured in a stretchable , interconnected mesh .
The work opens new possibilities for advanced camera design .
It also foreshadows artificial retinas for bionic eyes similar in concept to those in the movie " Terminator " and other popular science fiction .
" Conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well - developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects , " said John Rogers , the Flory - Founder Chair Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Illinois , and corresponding author of the paper .
" This approach allows us to put electronics in places where we could n't before , " Rogers said .
" We can now , for the first time , move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer - based systems . "
The camera 's design is based on that of the human eye , which has a simple , single - element lens and a hemispherical detector .
The camera integrates such a detector with a hemispherical cap and imaging lens , to yield a system with the overall size , shape and layout of the human eye .
To make the camera , the researchers begin by molding a thin rubber membrane in the shape of a hemisphere .
The rubber membrane is then stretched with a specialized mechanical stage to form a flat drumhead .
Next , a prefabricated focal plane array and associated electronics  created by conventional planar processing  are transferred from a silicon wafer to the tensioned , drumhead membrane .
When the tension is released , the membrane returns to its original shape .
This process compresses the focal plane array , causing specially designed electrical interconnects to delaminate from the rubber surface and form arcs , pinned on the ends by detector pixels .
These deformations accommodate strains associated with the planar to hemispherical transformation , without stressing the silicon , as confirmed by mechanics modeling performed by researchers at Northwestern .
The array package is then transfer printed to a matching hemispherical glass substrate .
Attaching a lens and connecting the camera to external electronics completes the assembly .
The camera has the size and shape of a human eye .
Over the last 20 years , many research groups have pursued electronic eye systems of this general type , but none has achieved a working camera .
" Optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view , improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses , " said Rogers , who also is a researcher at the Beckman Institute and at the university 's Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory .
The U.S. Department of Transportation hopes to excite interest in biofuels to help the ailing airline industry .
In order to do so , it joined hands with the X Prize Foundation to launch a competition to develop a new bio - jet fuel , with an estimated prize of 10 million dollars .

Global warming is an international problem , acknowledged by most the leaders of the world ’s industrialized nations .
Besides the environmental issues , reliance on oil has economic side effects as well as political implications .
However , there is some disagreement as to how these subjects should be approached .
Recently , the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) has been pushing an initiative to advance research of airline biofuels and recently transferred half a million dollars to the X Prize Foundation to help set up the new 10 million dollar prize .
Biofuel can be theoretically produced from any biological carbon source .
The most common by far is photosynthetic plants that capture solar energy .
Many different plants and plant - derived materials are currently used for biofuel manufacturing .
The most common use for biofuels is as liquid fuels for automotive transport , since the use of renewable biofuels provides increased independence from petroleum and enhances energy security .
The project has received the expected support from the airline industry , which faces insolvency due to the soaring cost of fuel .
Although some private efforts were made , such as billionaire Richard Bransen ’s efforts with Virgin Airlines , relatively little progress has been made so far .
The new prize corresponds with the Federal Aviation Administration ’s ( FAA ) new Next Generation air traffic modernization program , “ NextGen ” .
The growth program hopes to double air traffic by 2025 , while keeping carbon emissions constant , by adopting new fuels or more efficient designs .
The X Prize Foundation hopes the final prize will amount to over $ 10 million once it can secure a private sponsor .
U.S. Secretary of Transportation , Mary Peters , has stated : “ It will be a competition that everyone wins , because a breakthrough in alternative jet fuels is a potential game - changer that could bring lower airline fuel costs , greater U.S. energy independence , and cleaner air . ”
The move has been long coming .
The X Prize Foundation has been in talks with the DOT and FAA since the 90s .
After analyzing industry alternatives , the DOT and FAA finally decided that the X Prize was the best way to stimulate development in the industry .
The grant is among the first from a government organization to the X Prize Foundation .
Aviation prize rules will be set over the next 14 months and will be based on input from a panel of industry experts .
The X Prize Foundation will also try to secure private sponsors , hoping to launch the competition by 2011 and find a winner by 2016 .
Jason Morgan , senior director of prize development at the X Prize Foundation said : “ With all the discussion about global warming , the increasing cost of oil , and the increasing congestion everyone ’s feeling at the airport , we need to do something dramatic about it and we think it ’s the contest model . ”
TFOT has also covered the X Prize for green cars and the Google Lunar X PRIZE competition .
TFOT also recently covered the first hydrogen powered manned flight conducted in an aircraft modified by Boeing .
More information on the X Prize competition for aviation biofuels can be found on the foundation ’s website .
To accompany the article So you think humans are unique ?
we have selected six articles from the New Scientist archive that tell a similar story .
We have also asked the researchers involved to update us on their latest findings .
Plus , we have rounded up six videos of animals displaying ‘ human ’ abilities .
1. Culture
Art , theatre , literature , music , religion , architecture and cuisine – these are the things we generally associate with culture .
Clearly no other animal has anything approaching this level of cultural sophistication .
But culture at its core is simply the sum of a particular group ’s characteristic ways of living , learned from one another and passed down the generations , and other primate species undoubtedly have practices that are unique to groups , such as a certain way of greeting each other or obtaining food .
Even more convincing examples of animal cultures are found in cetaceans .
Killer whales , for example , fall into two distinct groups , residents and transients .
Although both live in the same waters and interbreed , they have very different social structures and lifestyles , distinct ways of communicating , different tastes in food and characteristic hunting techniques – all of which parents teach to offspring .
Read the original article : Culture shock ( 24 March 2001 )

Hal Whitehead , Dalhousie University writes :
“ Since our 2001 review , people have often considered culture as a potential explanation of the behavioural patterns that have turned up in their studies of whales and dolphins .
“ Our own work has concentrated on the non-vocal forms of sperm - whale culture .
The different cultural clans of sperm whales , although in basically the same areas , use these waters very differently , and are affected very differently by El Niño events .
They also have different reproductive rates .
“ In sperm whales , and likely other whales and dolphins , culture has the potential to affect population biology , and so issues as diverse as genetic evolution and the impacts of global warming on the species . ”
2. Mind reading
Perhaps the surest sign that an individual has insight into the mind of another is the ability to deceive .
To outwit someone you must understand their desires , intentions and motives – exactly the same ability that underpins the “ theory of mind ” .
This ability to attribute mental states to others was once thought unique to humans , emerging suddenly around the fifth year of life .
But the discovery that babies are capable of deception led experts to conclude that “ mind - reading ” skills develop gradually , and fuelled debate about whether they might be present in other primates .
Experiments in the 1990s indicated that great apes and some monkeys do understand deception , but that their understanding of the minds of others is probably implicit rather than explicit as it is in adult humans .
Read the original article : Liar ! Liar ! ( 14 February 1998 )
Marc Hauser , Harvard University , writes :
“ The tamarin work did n’t pan out , but there are now several studies that show evidence of theory of mind in primates , including work by Brian Hare , Josep Call , Mike Tomasello , Felix Warneken , Laurie Santos , Justin Wood , and myself on chimps , rhesus monkeys and tamarins .
There is nothing quite like a successful Sally - Anne test , but studies point to abilities such as seeing as a form of knowing , reading intentions and goals . ”
3. Tool use
Some chimps use rocks to crack nuts , others fish for termites with blades of grass and a gorilla has been seen gauging the depth of water with the equivalent of a dipstick , but no animal wields tools with quite the alacrity of the New Caledonian crow .
To extract tasty insects from crevices , they craft a selection of hooks and long , barbed tapers called stepped - cut tools , made by intricately cutting a pandanus leaf with their beaks .
What ’s more , experiments in the lab suggest that they understand the function of tools and deploy creativity and planning to construct them .
Nobody is suggesting that toolmaking has common origins in humans and crows , but there is a remarkable similarity in the ways in which their respective brains work .
Both are highly lateralised , revealed in the observation that most crows are right - beaked – cutting pandanus leaves using the right side of their beaks .
New Caledonian crows may force us to reassess the mental abilities of our first toolmaking ancestors .
Read the original article : Look , no hands ( 17 August 2002 )
Gavin Hunt at the University of Aukland , writes :
“ The general aim of our research on New Caledonian crows is to determine how a ‘ bird brain ’ can produce such complex tools and tool behaviour .
Since the New Scientist article appeared in 2002 , our team has focused on continuing to document tool manufacture and use in the wild ( New Zealand Journal of Zoology , vol 35 p 115 ) , the development of tool skills in free - living juveniles , the social behaviour and ecology of NC crows on the island of Maré , experimental work investigating NC crows ’ physical cognition and general intelligence , and neurological work .
“ Some of this work is being undertaken collaboratively with laboratories in Germany ( neurology ) and New Zealand ( genotyping ) .
A very similar study is also being carried out independently at the University of Oxford .
This parallel research has produced findings that are both confirmatory and conflicting . ”
Alex Kacelnik , University of Oxford , adds :
“ We now know for sure that genetics is involved in the tool - making abilities of new Caledonian crows .
We raised nestlings by hand and found that chicks that had never seen anybody handle objects of any kind started to use tools to extract food from crevices at a similar age to those who were exposed to human tutors using tools ( Animal Behaviour , vol 72 , p 1329 ) .
Clearly , observing others is not necessary for the tool use .
However chicks exposed to tutoring exhibit a greater intensity of tool - related activity .
Not surprisingly , genes and experience show a complex interaction .
“ We have also developed a new technique , consisting of loading tiny video cameras on free - ranging birds , so as to see what they see and document the precise use of tools in nature .
We have discovered that they use tools in loose soil , that they use a kind of tool not previously described ( grass stems ) , and that they hunt for vertebrates ( lizards ) .
All of this , together with laboratory analysis of their cognitive abilities is forming a richer picture of what the species can do . ”
4. Morality
A classic study in 1964 found that hungry rhesus monkeys would not take food they had been offered if doing so meant that another monkey received an electric shock .
The same is true of rats .
Does this indicate nascent morality ?
For decades , we have preferred to find alternative explanations , but recently ethologist Marc Bekoff from the University of Colorado at Boulder has championed the view that humans are not the only moral species .
He argues that morality is common in social mammals , and that during play they learn the rights and wrongs of social interaction , the “ moral norms that can then be extended to other situations such as sharing food , defending resources , grooming and giving care ” .
Read the original article : Virtuous nature ( 13 July 2002 )
Marc Bekoff , University of Colorado , writes :
“ Work published this year showed that animals are able to make social evaluations and these assessments are foundational for moral behaviour in animals other than humans .
Francys Subiaul of the George Washington University and his colleagues showed that captive chimpanzees are able to make judgments about the reputation of unfamiliar humans by observing their behaviour – whether they were generous or stingy in giving food to other humans .
The ability to make character judgments is just what we would expect to find in a species in which fairness and cooperation are important in interactions among group members ( Animal Cognition , DOI : 10.1007/s10071-008-0151 -6 ) . ”
5. Emotions
Emotions allow us to bond with others , regulate our social interactions and make it possible to behave flexibly in different situations .
We are not the only animals that need to do these things , so why should we be the only ones with emotions ?
There are many examples of apparent emotional behaviour in other animals .
Elephants caring for a crippled herd member seem to show empathy .
A funeral ritual performed by magpies suggests grief .
Was it spite that led a male baboon called Nick to take revenge on a rival by urinating on her ?
Divers who freed a humpback whale caught in a crab line describe its reaction as one of gratitude .
Then there ’s the excited dance chimps perform when faced with a waterfall – it looks distinctly awe - inspired .
These days , few doubt that animals have emotions , but whether they feel these consciously , as we do , is open to debate .

Do animals have emotions ?
( 23 May 2007 )
6. Personality
It ’s no surprise that animals that live under constant threat from predators are extra-cautious , while those that face fewer risks appear to be more reckless .
After all , such successful survival strategies would evolve by natural selection .
But the discovery that individuals of the same species , living under the same conditions , vary in their degree of boldness or caution is more remarkable .
In humans we would refer to such differences as personality traits .
From cowardly spiders and reckless salamanders to aggressive songbirds and fearless fish , we are finding that many animals are not as characterless as we might expect .
What ’s more , work with animals has led to the idea that personality traits evolve to help individuals survive in a wider variety of ecological niches , and this is influencing the way psychologists think about human personality .

The personality factor .
On July 31 , 2008 NASA crashed a mock - up of an Orion space capsule when a parachute failed .
The parachute system , which would be used to slow the Orion capsule to a soft touch down in the event of a launch abort , was tested by dropping the capsule out of the back of a C - 17 .
In the test , a number of " set - up " parachutes are deployed .
Some are used to pull the pallet out of the plane .
Then the capsule is pyrotechnically separated from the pallet , which has its own parachute recovery system .
The capsule then has a " programmer " parachute and two stabilizer parachutes that are used to set up the test configuration .
It was this programmer chute that failed to inflate properly causing the capsule to fall much faster then planned .
All this happened before the Orion parachute test could even begin .
When the programmer and stabilizer parachutes released , you could see the capsule ’s own drogue parachute deploy and then be immediately ripped away , sending the mock capsule into free fall .
The forces deployed the main parachutes .
Only one of the three main chutes held , but never inflated .
The result was a landing that " severely damaged the mock - up . "
One of the objectives of the drop test was to demonstrate the test procedure .
NASA engineers and managers are currently reviewing the test set - up , video and photos to determine what caused the programmer parachute to fail .

Clay Shirky 's posted a transcript of a recent talk he gave on " cognitive surplus " — the idea that automation gave us an enormous amount of free time to think and cogitate , and that sitcoms and other light entertainment from the past century were a way of absorbing that surplus , something we 're just shaking off now :
[ S ] he shook her head and said , " Where do people find the time ? "
That was her question .
And I just kind of snapped .
And I said , " No one who works in TV gets to ask that question .
You know where the time comes from .
It comes from the cognitive surplus you 've been masking for 50 years . "
So how big is that surplus ?
So if you take Wikipedia as a kind of unit , all of Wikipedia , the whole project–every page , every edit , every talk page , every line of code , in every language that Wikipedia exists in –that represents something like the cumulation of 100 million hours of human thought .
I worked this out with Martin Wattenberg at IBM ; it 's a back - of - the - envelope calculation , but it 's the right order of magnitude , about 100 million hours of thought .
And television watching ?
Two hundred billion hours , in the U.S. alone , every year .
Put another way , now that we have a unit , that 's 2,000 Wikipedia projects a year spent watching television .
Or put still another way , in the U.S. , we spend 100 million hours every weekend , just watching the ads .
This is a pretty big surplus .
People asking , " Where do they find the time ? " when they 're looking at things like Wikipedia do n't understand how tiny that entire project is , as a carve - out of this asset that 's finally being dragged into what Tim calls an architecture of participation .
Now , the interesting thing about a surplus like that is that society does n't know what to do with it at first–hence the gin , hence the sitcoms .
Because if people knew what to do with a surplus with reference to the existing social institutions , then it would n't be a surplus , would it ?
It 's precisely when no one has any idea how to deploy something that people have to start experimenting with it , in order for the surplus to get integrated , and the course of that integration can transform society .
The early phase for taking advantage of this cognitive surplus , the phase I think we 're still in , is all special cases .
The physics of participation is much more like the physics of weather than it is like the physics of gravity .
We know all the forces that combine to make these kinds of things work : there 's an interesting community over here , there 's an interesting sharing model over there , those people are collaborating on open source software .
But despite knowing the inputs , we can't predict the outputs yet because there 's so much complexity .

I have come to the conclusion that the Mont Pelerin Society is no longer an effective force for freedom , becoming instead another tool in behalf of US hegemony , ringing Russia with US military bases and puppet governments in the name of “ supporting democracy . ”
As far as I am aware , the MPS has not addressed the Bush administration ’s assault on US civil liberties or the disrespect the Bush administration has shown for the US Constitution and international law , particularly the Geneva Conventions .
Nor has the society taken exception to US wars of aggression in behalf of undeclared agendas .
I do n’t see how the society can function in behalf of liberty when its long - time Treasurer is so closely associated with the Republican Party , now thoroughly neoconized .
The alacrity with which the Heritage Foundation jumped on the Bush administration ’s propaganda bandwagon about “ the Russian invasion of Georgia ” epitomizes the new association of “ freedom ” with American hegemony .
As Secretary of State Rice put it ( according to Matthew Lee , AP News , August 18 , 16:17 EST ) , “ ‘ We are not going to allow Russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans - Atlantic structures ’ , she said , referring to Georgia and Ukraine , which have not yet joined NATO or the European Union but would like to . ”
But , of course , the US and its NATO allies are going to draw a line around Russia .
What does the Caucasus have to do with the North Atlantic ?
Why is NATO , which was created to keep the Soviet Army out of Western Europe , still around almost two decades after the disappearance of the Soviet Union ?
Why has its membership doubled , and why is it being extended to the Black Sea ?
Is Mongolia next ?
The US strategic objective — to ring Russia with bases and puppet states in order to exercise hegemony over Russia — will lead to war , the destruction of liberty and perhaps life on earth .
This gratuitously insane neoconservative foreign policy is one that will lead to nuclear war .
It stands in total contradiction to the alleged values of the Mont Pelerin Society .
As every great libertarian and the founding members of the MPS acknowledged , war is the greatest enemy of liberty .
The US used force to rip Kosovo out of Serbia and to hand it to Muslim drug runners in exchange for a US military base .
The US bombed Serbian civilians and accused the Serbians of war crimes .
South Ossetia has been autonomous since the early 1990s from which date Russian and Georgian peacekeepers have been in S. Ossetia .
The US puppet president of Georgia attacked S. Ossetian civilians with his American and Israeli trained and equipped army , killing about 2,000 and driving 30,000 into Russia , and the Georgian peacekeepers turned their weapons upon the Russian peacekeepers .
The American puppet , installed by the neocon National Endowment for Democracy , committed this war crime in order to ethnically cleanse S. Ossetia of Russians and to end the separatist movement in order to smooth Georgia ’s entrance into NATO .
The “ Russian invasion ” was a response to this US - sponsored war crime .
No real fact or truthful account can be found in the Heritage presentation or the US media .
I do not want to be associated with an organization that is a front for American hegemony and wars based on propaganda , lies , and deceit .
If Milton Friedman and F.A.
Hayek were still alive , I am certain they would join me in resignation .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - The Group of Eight wealthy nations are looking at investing more than $ 10 billion a year to support new technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , including carbon dioxide capture and storage ( CCS ) , a Japanese daily reported on Sunday .

A draft statement on economic issue is being considered for release at the July 7 - 9 summit of G8 leaders in Hokkaido , northern Japan , the business daily Nikkei said .
The G8 countries plan to fund research to develop CCS projects , which bury emissions from power plants , as a measure to help meet a global target to halve greenhouse gases by 2050 , Nikkei said .
The draft statement also includes an agreement to set national interim goals to reduce emissions by 2020 - 2030 , a step environmentalists and the EU say is vital , the Nikkei said , adding that no figures were included .
A Japanese government source told Reuters last week that the United States had yet to agree to a goal of reducing global emissions by 50 percent by mid-century .
The G8 leaders will share strong concern over rising crude oil prices , which are pushing up inflation and depressing the world economy , Nikkei said .
The leaders will call for oil - consuming and producing nations to cooperate more closely , the newspaper said .
Oil prices rose to a record near $ 143 a barrel on Friday .
Prices have jumped more than 45 percent this year , extending a six - year rise , as supply struggles to keep pace with rising demand from emerging economies such as China and India .
With regard to rising food prices , the G8 nations will provide assistance to developing countries to increase food production .
They will speak up against food export restrictions imposed by some producing countries , Nikkei said .
Separately , the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the G8 nations could agree to stand ready to release grain from national and private food reserves at times of food crisis .
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda pledged at a United Nations food summit this month to release at least 300,000 tonnes of imported rice from storage into the world market to ease the global food crisis and urged other countries to do likewise .
Quick , you ever heard of WiAV Solutions ?
You know , the owner or exclusive licensee of several vague patents on the use of GSM tech in smartphones ?
The company that does n't make anything or even have a web site , but files so many patent lawsuits that some companies have taken to pre-emptively filing suits for declaratory judgment against it ?
Yeah , well , get used to the name -- it 's just sued RIM , Apple and Palm for violating ten patents on things like detecting the difference between silence and voices , mobile device power management , and altering music to accommodate voices .
WiAV wants a permanent injunction on the sale of all devices that allegedly contain its tech , and not surprisingly , it 's asking for damages and attorney 's fees as well .
There are some procedural hurdles to jump through here -- WiAV is Mindspeed 's exclusive licensee for eight of the patents , not the outright owner , so it has to ask the court to join Mindspeed as a plaintiff as well -- and it does n't sound like any of the companies are talking just yet , so we would n't expect this one to get resolved any time soon .
[ Thanks , Becky ]

After publishing two best - selling memoirs , “ A Million Little Pieces ” and “ My Friend Leonard , ” which proved upon examination to be insufficiently factual , James Frey has brought forth a novel , “ Bright Shiny Morning , ” whose greatest problem ( though not its only one ) is that it ’s insufficiently fictional .
The offense in the case of the first two narratives , which tried to pass off fantasy as fact , was merely ethical .
But in the case of “ Bright Shiny Morning , ” which brims with facts but is lacking in credible fantasies , the failure is artistic  and thus , from a certain perspective , far more grievous .
Frey ’s “ memoirs , ” despite or because of their being made up , were at least somewhat stimulating in places .
His “ novel , ” which is n’t made up enough , is stupefying .
“ Bright Shiny Morning ” is about Los Angeles , a city whose peculiar role in modern American literature is to function not just as a setting but a character .
The main one , inevitably .
The lead .
When it comes to the city of broken dreams , literary custom has decreed that the city , not its dreamers , must take precedence .
It is n’t like this with Buffalo or Tucson or even , to the same extent , New York .
In those and a thousand other municipalities about which writers feel less compelled to moralize , people still act with a measure of seeming autonomy , but in Los Angeles human beings are treated by novelists as puny appendages of a vast colossus .
Free will is a cruel illusion there , at best , and corruption exerts an irresistible suction on anyone with a trace of worldly ambition .
To succeed , a person must lose his soul , and the people who keep their souls cannot succeed .
Frey is unswervingly loyal to these orthodoxies .
The stock assortment of yearning wannabes , maniacal somebodies and oppressed nonentities that he sacrifices to Los Angeles ’s tar pits have all played the same roles before in other scripts .
Dylan and Maddie , from small - town Ohio , play the doomed youngsters whose kin do n’t understand them , causing them to pile into an old truck and tear off like lemmings “ driving towards the glow . ”
Amberton Parker is the matinee idol whose manly posturing hides a terrible secret that any non-Amish American past age 12 will guess at the moment he strides onstage .
Esperanza is the Mexican servant girl whose job is to pick up after sadistic Anglos and , when the time comes , be seduced by one of them .
Then there ’s Joe , the drunken bum , who in his drunken bumness is strangely noble .
After ending up in Los Angeles for no good reason except that it ’s where drifters run out of continent , he “ stood on the sand staring across the ocean ” and “ heard one word  here here here . ”
This is one word repeated three times , of course , and that ’s because Frey ’s idea of meaningful prose  the kind that conveys not just information but feeling  is that it must possess lots of rhythm , rhythm , rhythm .
Minus the commas commas commas .

Karen Caldicott
Here is some of Frey ’s prose , ladled up from the huge pitcher in which he has blended events , ideas , dialogue and dozens of pages of Wikipedian trivia relating to everything from Los Angeles ’s freeways to its neighborhoods and street gangs into a sort of verbal fruit smoothie every sip of which has the same consistency .
This passage deals with Dylan eating supper in the flea - bag motel room where he and Maddie have landed after pursuing the elusive glow .
“ When he finishes his first helping he gets another , he finishes that gets another .
While he ’s working on the third she puts the pie in the oven warms it up .
By the time ’s finished with his fourth , and the bucket of chicken is empty , she has a piece of warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream ready for him .
He eats most of it with his hands when he ’s done he licks the plate clean he has another does the same thing .
When he ’s finished he leans back in his chair , rubs his stomach , speaks . ”
Today was the first day of RubyFringe here in Toronto Canada .
The conference put on by Unspace and they have done a great job .
Last night we enjoyed a get - together at the Amsterdam Brewery with free wine , beer and finger food .
I think everyone had a great time .
I am here partially for my own interests and to do some interviews on Sunday for InfoQ .
InfoQ has a large presence here at RubyFringe because they are a Toronto - based company and to support the local Ruby community .
InfoQ is videotaping all the sessions and will have all of the sessions in full on the InfoQ web site very soon , so please look for those as each session is well - worth viewing .
I missed a couple speakers so I can only give a little bit of information on the ones I watched .
The Speakers
Jay ’s talk was about writing telephony applications with Ruby .
He is the creator of the Adhearsion framework for creating VoIP applications with Ruby .
The story of his success with the VoIP and the creation of the framework was really interesting .
I do n’t personally have clients asking me for VoIP work but this framework look like a good place to start .
Jay has a great personality for presentations and makes the content very interesting .
I have never seen Dan talk and was not familiar with him at all but after his talk I was inspired to look at ideas and execution differently .
Dan talked more about how to approach creating applications from a business standpoint rather from a technological one .
He explained how his approach to finding a winning idea is to try many things and see what sticks because you never know .
An idea may be successful by surprise as he did with PayMe .
Tobias is known as a developer of Shopify but came to RubyFringe with a talk about using Memcached with black belt style and the talk was right on target .
He showed the crowd the basics of using it with Ruby but dove in right away to show us how to use it hardcore and take advantage of this great caching mechanism .
This is one of the Engine Yard guys who is focusing on Merb and all of the great smaller projects associated with it .
I think this was a great overview or preview of one of the many things Engine Yard is doing with their funding .
Y
Luke ’s talk focused on how a developer can go overboard with testing and how not to let this happen to you .
The talk takes on all of the excitement there is around Test Driven Development ( TDD ) and the ways developers get themselves so involved in testing that they can unnecessarily test too much .
The importance of testing is covered but Luke brings up the idea that we may be doing more than we have to sometimes and for some people not using tests and get by with it that it ’s OK .
Look for an interview with Luke on InfoQ coming shortly as we took time with Luke and tried to get some deeper incite into his ideas .
This was one of the talks I looked forward to most as Obie is one of the more prolific personalities in the Ruby community but I also knew this was not a technical talk .
This talk was about taking the proper approach from the sales side of consulting .
We too often get over involved with being a good technical person but neglect sales .
This is a good talk even for people like myself who has a good sales background and makes sure we do n’t forget what ’s important .
Things to keep in mind is :
Always be closing .
Make your hourly rate more than you think you are worth as clients will try to negotiate down .
Know when to say no and do n’t take all work that comes along .
Any chance you can get to hear Obie speak , you should do it .
Matt claims he is a nobody and is dumb and uses it to his advantage .
His talk was a really good one and made a lot of sense .
Although it did not include specific technical content , it has great advice .
In short Matt tells everyone to get out there , try stuff , fail and try some more .
It is commonsense and a well - known fact that if we do n’t try and fail that we will not achieve success .
Matt works with the fine folks at Highgroove Studios so he must be doing something right .
Jeremy who is the author of the Humble Little Ruby Book which is available for free from InfoQ is a good place for people to start learning Ruby .
His talk was a good talk giving developers perspective using frameworks that maybe a bit too big for our needs .
Jeremy explains it may be better just to create your own framework for you needs instead of being forced into the way large frameworks make you do your job .
Everyone in the community knows Zed , he is likely the most outspoken among anyone but he does have great points and is a really good speaker .
This is his last Ruby conference talk and he says he will not be doing any more Ruby or Rails development .
This was Zed ’s sendoff from the Ruby community and he did it in style .
He talked briefly about Ruby and moved on to music , a current passion of his .
Zed involved his audience in creating music on stage with a small guitar and sound machine into an HP subnotebook .
Zed gave a fair well song which included references to DHH and Chad Fowler .
The audience enjoyed the talk and cheered often .
Zed seems like a really bright guy and it is sad to see him go .
The songs will be available for download and free distribution .
The talks have been really good so far and I am confident this will continue tomorrow .

Extramarital Affair Ad Gets Axed
ESPN Says It Has Asked Affiliates to Pull an Ad for a Cheaters ' Matchmaking Service
ESPN is yanking a commercial for an infidelity matchmaking service .
Amy Phillips , a spokeswoman for ESPN -- which is owned by Disney , the parent company of ABC News -- said that the sports channel has asked its local affiliates to stop running an ad for AshleyMadison.com , a Web site that connects would - be cheaters with potential mates .
Phillips would not say why the channel decided to pull the ad .
Noel Biderman , the president of AshleyMadison.com , who learned of ESPN 's decision from an ABCNews.com reporter , said he felt that " a double standard " had been applied to his company with respect to advertising .
He said ESPN is " inundated " with advertisements for alcohol , a product " responsible for health issues and ultimately death . "
" Somehow I 'm immoral and everything else is OK , " he said .
AshleyMadison.com boasts a membership of more than 2.2 million .
For $ 49 , members can create profiles and send e-mails and instant messages to each other .
A slogan on the company 's homepage reads " Life is Short .
Have an Affair . "
The 35 - second commercial shows an unhappy - looking man lying in bed alongside a snoring woman .
As he gets up and leaves the bedroom , a narrator 's voice declares , " Most of us can recover from a one - night stand with the wrong woman , but not when it 's every night for the rest of our lives .
Is n't it time for AshleyMadison.com ? "
Biderman said that his company , which was based in Toronto , was spending more than $ 1 million this summer to run the ad on several television channels , including CNN , MSNBC , Fox , Fox News Channel and Spike .
But some of the networks on Friday distanced themselves from the ad .
A spokesman for Spike said he was n't sure if the network had ever run an ad for AshleyMadison.com but added that " if it did run , it would never run again . "
Representatives for both the Fox network and Fox News also said that the channels would never air the ad .
Robert Marich , the business editor at the trade magazine Broadcasting & Cable , said that just because a national network has disavowed an ad , it does n't mean its local affiliates or cable providers that carry their programs have done the same .
Marich said that both national television companies and local television stations each sell on - air advertising time .
Local stations and cable providers are often run by owners independent of the national networks , he said .
While national television companies have control over the commercials they run , he said , they do n't impose restrictions on or review the ads that their local stations air .
" In general , [ local ] TV stations set their own policies for what 's an acceptable ad or not because they 're responsible for what they put on their air , " he said .
Biderman said that the commercial represented the company 's third television campaign .
Previous Ashley Madison commercials -- which ran between 2003 and 2007 -- had usually aired after 11 p.m. at night and on programs with " desensitized " audiences such as the " Jerry Springer Show " and " Cheaters , " a reality show about infidelity .
It has also been advertised on Sirius satellite radio .
The new television campaign , he said , was designed to reach more people and would be aired during the day in some markets .
Unlike its last commercial , which showed a man and woman rolling around in bed , the new ad is " a little edgy " and " a lot more humorous , " Biderman said .
" We really wanted something that could sit in a sports property , that could sit in a news property , " he said .
The ad has run on ESPN's " Sports Center " program and Biderman said there were also plans for it to run during CNN's " Larry King Live " and " Anderson Cooper 360 . "
CNN did not return calls for comment Friday .
While the ad is sure to raise the ire of conservative and family values groups , media watchers disagree about the impact that the commercial may have on consumers and their attitudes toward infidelity .
Bob Garfield , an advertising critic for the magazine Advertising Age , said that a profusion of such ads could " normalize what was previously considered deviant behavior . "
" A 30 - second spot for human trafficking is probably just around the corner , " he said .
But Robert Thompson , the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University , said that when it comes to perceptions of infidelity , the Ashley Madison ad is " a drop in the bucket . "
" I think that idea is being normalized by our neighbors , what we hear other people doing , its depiction in literature , movies , everything else , " he said .
" This little television ad saying that people are in infidelity relationships is a tiny little piece . "
John Chapin , an associate professor of communications at Penn State University , said that the commercial is a reflection of infidelity in society today -- albeit a distorted one .
" It 's us but a little bit more exciting , a little bit more promiscuous , a little bit more interesting than what we really are , " he said .
" The commercial would n't exist if the culture was n't there , but it 's just punched up a notch . "
Biderman said he did not believe the company 's ads would prompt someone to cheat on his or her significant other .
" I maintain that in a 30 - second TV spot , I 'm not convincing anyone to engage in infidelity , " he said .
" I do n't have that power of persuasion . "
Understanding pages :
Over years we have invested heavily in our crawl and indexing system .
As a result we have a very large and very fresh index .
In addition to size and freshness , we have improved our index in other ways .
One of the key technologies we have developed to understand pages is associating important concepts to a page even when they are not obvious on the page .
We find the official homepage for Sprovieri Gallery in London for the Italian query [ galleria sprovieri londra ] , even though the official page does not have either London or Londra on it .
In the U.S. , a user searching for [ cool tech pc vancouver , wa ] finds the homepage www.cooltechpc.com even though the page does not mention anywhere that they are in Vancouver , WA .
Other technologies we have developed include distinctions between important and less important words in the page and the freshness of the information on the page .
Understanding queries :
It is critical that we understand what our users are looking for ( beyond just the few words in their query ) .
We have made several notable advances in this area including a best - in - class spelling suggestion system , an advanced synonyms system , and a very strong concept analysis system .
Did you mean : ; whereas someone searching for [
Most users have used our spelling suggestion system at one time or another .
It knows that someone searching for [ kofee annan ] is really searching for Mr. Kofi Annan , and is prompted : kofi annan ; whereas someone searching for [ kofee beans ] is actually looking for coffee beans .
Doing this internationally with very high accuracy is hard , and we do it well .
Doctor whereas in [ Drive .
A user looking for [ rear bumper repair .
For [ Air Base ; for the query query [ Bed and Breakfasts in Alberta , Canada .
We have developed this level of query understanding for almost one hundred different languages , which is what I am truly proud of .
Synonyms are the foundation of our query understanding work .
This is one of the hardest problems we are solving at Google .
Though sometimes obvious to humans , it is an unsolved problem in automatic language processing .
As a user , I do n't want to think too much about what words I should use in my queries .
Often I do n't even know what the right words are .
This is where our synonyms system comes into action .
Our synonyms system can do sophisticated query modifications , e.g. , it knows that the word ' Dr ' in the query [ Dr Zhivago ] stands forwhereas in [ Rodeo Dr ] it means .
A user looking for [ back bumper repair ] gets results aboutbumper repair .
For [ Ramstein ab ] , we automatically look for Ramstein ; for the query query [ b&b ab ] we search forin , Canada .
We have developed this level of query understanding for almosthundred different languages , which is what I am truly proud of .
For example , our algorithms understand that in the query [ New York Times .
We do n't just stop at identifying concepts ; we further enhance the query with the right concepts when , for instance , someone looking for [ impact of computers on society , or someone who searches for [ rain forest lesson plans .
Our query analysis algorithms have many such state - of - the - art techniques built into them , and once again , we do this internationally in almost every language we serve .
Another technology we use in our ranking system is concept identification .
Identifying critical concepts in the query allows us to return much more relevant results .
our algorithms understand that in the query [ new york times square church ] the user is looking for the well - known church in Times Square and not for articles from the .
We do n't just stop at identifying concepts ; we further enhance the query with the right concepts when , someone looking for [ PC and its impact on people ] is in fact looking for , or someone who searches for [ rainforest instructional activities for vocabulary ] is really looking for .
Our query analysis algorithms have many such state - of - the - art techniques built into them , and once again , we do this internationally in almost every language we serve .
Understanding user s :
Our work on interpreting user intent is aimed at returning results people really want , not just what they said in their query .
This work starts with a world class localization system , and adds to it our advanced personalization technology , and several other great strides we have made in interpreting user intent , e.g. Universal Search .
Canada , New Zealand , Israel , Japan , Russia , Saudi Arabia , For example , [ Côte d' Or ] is a geographic region in
Our clear focus on " best locally relevant results served globally " is reflected in our work on localization .
The same query typed in multiple countries may deserve completely different results .
A user looking for [ bank ] in the US should get American banks , whereas a user in the UK is either looking for the Bank Fashion line or for British financial institutions .
The results for this query should return local financial institutions in other English speaking countries like Australia South Africa .
The fun really starts when this query is typed in non-English - speaking countries like Egypt Switzerland .
Likewise the query [ football ] refers to entirely different sports in Australia , the UK , and the US .
These examples mostly show how we get the localized version of the same concept correctly ( financial institution , sport , etc. ) .
However , the same query can mean entirely different things in different countries . , [ Côte d' Or ] is a geographic region in France - but it is a large chocolate manufacturer in neighboring French - speaking Belgium ; and yes , we get that right too :-) .
Personalization is another strong feature in our search system which tailors search results to individual users .
Users who are logged - in while searching and have signed up for Web History get results that are more relevant for them than the general Google results .
For example , someone who does a lot football - related searches might get more football related results for [ giants ] , while other users might get results related to the baseball team .
Similarly , if you tend to prefer results from a particular shopping site , you will be more likely to get results from that site when you search for products .
Our evaluation shows that users who get personalized results find them to be more relevant than non-personalized results .
Another case of user intent can be observed for the query [ chevrolet magnum ] .
Magnum is actually made by Dodge and not Chevrolet .
So we present the results for Dodge Magnum with the prompt
See results for : dodge magnum in our result set .
Our work on Universal Search is another example of how we interpret user intent to give them what they ( sometimes ) really want .
Someone searching for [ bangalore ] not only gets the important web pages , they also get a map , a video showing street life , traffic , etc. in Bangalore -- watching this video I almost feel I am there :-) -- and at the time of writing there is relevant news and relevant blogs about Bangalore .
Finally let me briefly mention the latest advance we have made in search : Cross Language Information Retrieval ( CLIR ) .
CLIR allows users to first discover information that is not in their language , and then using Google 's translation technology , we make this information accessible .
I call this advance : give me what I want in any language .
A user looking for Tony Blair 's biography in Russia who types the query in Russian [ Тони Блэр биография ] is prompted at the bottom of our results to search the English web with :
New Zoning and Advertising Restrictions in Second Life
Today on their blog Linden Lab released a post about the Mainland in Second Life .
The mainland in Second Life now has over five thousand regions .
Linden Labs will more actively manage mainland areas from now on .
Abandoned land will be recycled more quickly and the goal will be stability .
And of course they want to stabalize the value of mainland virtual real estate .
Second Life Residential , Commercial , Advertising Crackdown
Subdivisions and marketing / advertising should see the hardest crackdowns .
I would compare it to a homeowners association .
The most surprising thing is the change of zoning creating residential areas , commercial areas , and no advertising areas .
I and many residents do not look forward to these changes as they are a further restriction on freedom which is what makes Second Life so great .
Denver police today moved against a group of protesters , arresting two near the group ’s “ convergence center ” north of downtown .
Police said they were drawn to the gathering place for the protest group Unconventional Denver at 4301 Brighton Blvd. after spotting what Lt. J. McDonald termed “ suspicious activity . ”
When police arrived , they determined there was no illegal activity “ but they found some items that might be used as weapons , ” McDonald said .
Standing near the house , Michael Gonzalez , 20 , of Seattle said he thinks the only suspicious activity was a man working on his mini bus in front of the house .
The bus runs on vegetable oil .
Several officers approached the owner of the bus , who was working on the oil filter , Gonzalez said .
The officers had Tasers in hand and ordered the van owner to put his hands above his head .
Seeing the police approaching , another person slowly walked toward the back end of the building , which has been rented by Unconventional Denver for the week , he said .
“ The cops grabbed him and slammed him on his head , ” Gonzalez said .
The officers seemed suspicious of the bus , which has a giant drum in the back used to hold the vegetable oil , Gonzalez said .
The officers also said that bricks laying on the dusty ground could be used as weapons , Gonzalez said .
“ The bricks were used to hold down banners that we were painting , ” he said .
“ They were n’t weapons .
They were paperweights . ”
Inside the building there is one room used as a meeting place , he said .
“ It was really intense , ” Gonzalez said .
The two men , whose names have not yet been released , were arrested for disobeying a lawful order .
Police then discussed whether to seek a search warrant for the house but decided they did not have probable cause for further search .
A march from the Denver Coliseum to the Pepsi Center after the Rage Against the Machine concert passed right by the house , and police maintained surveillance of it .

US - Russian tensions in Caucasus erupt into war
By Bill Van Auken
9 August 2008
Long - escalating tensions between Russia and the former Soviet republic of Georgia erupted into full - scale war Friday , leaving hundreds if not thousands of civilians dead and turning thousands more into refugees , forced to flee for their lives .
The immediate focus of the fighting is the attempt by Georgia to militarily seize control of the enclave of South Ossetia , which has existed as a de facto independent entity for the past 16 years , and Russia ’s armed intervention to counter this assault .
Underlying this military confrontation , however , are far broader conflicts .
Feeding the bloody confrontation in South Ossetia is US imperialism ’s drive to establish hegemony over the vast energy resources of Central Asia and the Caucasus through the assertion of American military power in the region .
The Russian ruling elite , for its part , is seeking to reassert its grip over a region that was ruled by Moscow for two centuries before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
This bitter rivalry between Washington and Moscow — the world ’s two greatest nuclear powers — lends the fighting in the Caucasus a particularly explosive and dangerous character .
The tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated in the recent period by the Bush administration ’s drive to incorporate Georgia into the NATO alliance , a move that Moscow sees as part of an attempt to establish a military encirclement of Russia .
The US - backed Georgian regime of President Mikheil Saakashvili sent massed military units into South Ossetia on Thursday morning , after claiming that South Ossetian military forces had shelled Georgian villages , supposedly violating a unilateral cease - fire declared by Tbilisi .
While the Georgian regime initially claimed it was carrying out a “ proportionate response , ” it quickly became clear that it had launched an all - out military offensive aimed at conquering the region .
Using artillery , tanks , truck - mounted multiple rocket launchers and war planes , the Georgian military laid siege to the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali .
Much of the city was reportedly in flames Friday .
The regional parliament building had burned down , the university was on fire , and the town ’s main hospital had been rendered inoperative by the bombardment .
The International Red Cross reported that ambulances were unable to reach the wounded .
“ As a result of many hours of shelling from heavy guns , the town is practically destroyed , ” Marat Kulakhmetov , the commander of Russian peacekeepers in the territory , told the Russian news service Interfax .
Eduard Kokoity , the South Ossetian leader , estimated late Friday that more than 1,400 civilians had been killed in the Georgian military assault .
“ I saw bodies lying on the streets , around ruined buildings , in cars , ” Lyudmila Ostayeva , 50 , told the Associated Press after fleeing the city with her family to a village near the Russian border .
“ It ’s impossible to count them now .
There is hardly a single building left undamaged . ”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov charged Georgia with utilizing massive violence with the aim of forcing the Ossetian population to flee .
“ We are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in South Ossetia , the number of refugees is climbing , the panic is growing , people are trying to save their lives , ” said Lavrov .
According to Moscow , among the dead were ten Russian peacekeepers , while 30 more were wounded in the shelling of their barracks by the Georgian forces .
The peacekeepers were deployed in the area as part of an agreement reached between Moscow , Tbilisi and South Ossetia to end the fighting that erupted following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the subsequent bid by the peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to separate from Georgia .
The inhabitants in both regions feared the newly independent Georgian regime would abolish their autonomous status .
Since then , however , Tbilisi has charged that the Russian troops are backing the South Ossetian forces .
Russia seized upon the deaths of its troops and the civilian casualties as the justification for sending a tank column and infantry into South Ossetia , where they have become engaged in fierce combat with Georgian units for control of Tskhinvali .
“ In accordance with the constitution and federal law , I , as president of Russia , am obliged to protect lives and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are located , ” Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told a meeting of his security council at the Kremlin .
“ We wo n’t allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished . ”
Meanwhile , Georgian authorities charged that Russian warplanes had struck the country ’s military bases , airfields and the main Black Sea port of Poti late Friday and early Saturday , killing some civilians .
Bombs reportedly fell on the capital of Tbilisi and on the area of the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan oil pipeline .
“ All day today , they ’ve been bombing Georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting ( the ) civilian population , and we have scores of wounded and dead among ( the ) civilian population all around the country , ” Saakashvili told the US news network , CNN .
Saakashvili announced that he had called up the country ’s reserves , while sources in Georgia said he was expected to announce the imposition of martial law .
The timing of the Georgian incursion , on a day when world attention was focused on the opening of the Olympics in Beijing , where both Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and US President George Bush are present , hardly seemed fortuitous .
Saakashvili , however , suggested that it was Russia that had chosen the date , calling it a “ brilliant moment to attack a small country ” and charging that the quick response by the Russian military demonstrated Moscow ’s preparations for an intervention .
The Georgian president declared that his country was “ looking with hope ” to the US .
The armed confrontation with Russia , he claimed , “ is not about Georgia anymore .
It ’s about America , its values ...
America stands up for those freedom - loving nations and supports them .
That ’s what America is all about . ”
Under the Bush administration , Washington has attempted to forge close ties with Georgia , particularly since the US - backed “ Rose Revolution ” that paved the way for Saakashvili ’s rise to power .
US imperialism ’s main interest in Georgia is as an American bridgehead into the oil and gas - rich Caspian Basin and as a strategic transit route for funneling energy supplies out of the region , while bypassing Russia .
To cement its ties with the Georgian regime , Washington has provided hundreds millions of dollars in military aid , while sending in large numbers of US military trainers for the country ’s growing armed forces .
Georgian troops , meanwhile , account for the third largest contingent participating in the US occupation of Iraq , numbering some 2,000 .
Tbilisi indicated Friday that it would seek US help in bringing at least 1,000 of these soldiers back to participate in the fighting in South Ossetia .
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov alluded to the US military support for Georgia , declaring , “ Now we see Georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors . ”
He added , “ I think our European and American colleagues ... should understand what is happening .
And I hope very much that they will reach the right conclusions . ”
Last month , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice paid a provocative visit to Tbilisi , denouncing Russia and reiterating US backing for Georgian NATO membership .
Washington ’s NATO allies in Western Europe , however , have greeted the proposal coolly , seeing it as an unnecessary provocation against Russia , upon which they depend for energy supplies .
Whether Rice during her visit gave an explicit green light for the intervention in South Ossetia , or whether the Georgian regime felt the demonstration of US support gave it the assurance of Washington ’s backing for such a military action , is not known .
In the wake of Friday ’s assault , Washington has stopped short of providing explicit support for the Georgian action , but has made it clear that it backs the position of its client state in the Caucasus .
The United Nations Security Council failed to support a Russian - backed resolution calling for an end to the fighting because of Washington ’s opposition to a clause calling on all sides to “ renounce the use of force . ”
The clear implication is that the US is backing Georgia ’s right to take military action .
Secretary of State Rice , meanwhile , issued a statement effectively condemning Russia , while providing tacit justification for Georgia ’s intervention .
“ We call on Russia to cease attacks on Georgia by aircraft and missiles , respect Georgia ’s territorial integrity , and withdraw its ground combat forces from Georgian soil , ” she said .
“ We underscore the international community ’s support for Georgia ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders . ”
The eruption of war in the Caucasus is the end product of the increasingly aggressive policy pursued by US imperialism in the wake of the dissolution of the USSR nearly 17 years ago .
Washington has systematically manipulated national conflicts in the region to further its own aim of military and economic hegemony .
This began with the bloody wars in the former Yugoslavia .
All of the arguments used by Washington to justify its support for Bosnia and Kosovo and its military assault on Serbia during the Balkan wars of the 1990s could be employed just as effectively to condemn Georgia ’s intervention and defend South Ossetia , as well as Russia ’s military intervention on its behalf .
In this case , however , Washington has elevated Georgia ’s “ territorial integrity ” as the paramount principle in the conflict , effectively justifying Georgia ’s military intervention and an assault on the province ’s Russian population that Moscow has branded as “ ethnic cleansing . ”
The apparent contradiction between these two policies only underscores the fact that US imperialism ’s supposed aversion to ethnic cleansing and the suppression of ethnic enclaves is entirely dependent upon who is doing it and whether or not it serves US strategic interests .
There is a direct link between this latest war and those waged by the US in the Balkans .
In February , the US and the West recognized Kosovo ’s “ independence ” based on its unilateral secession from Serbia , in direct violation of various UN resolutions .
The aim in backing this secession — as in its support for the suppression of similar secessionist entities in Georgia — was to further US military plans for the encirclement of Russia and the securing of access routes to the Caspian Basin .
In the run-up to Kosovo ’s unilateral declaration of independence , Moscow had repeatedly warned that it would set a precedent for similar actions by other territories in the former USSR — Abkhazia and South Ossetia , in particular .
In its aftermath , the Russian regime stepped up its support for both territories .
Now , the eruption of war in South Ossetia poses the threat of a regional conflagration that can bring the world ’s two biggest nuclear - armed powers , the US and Russia , into direct military confrontation , with the immense dangers that such a conflict poses to humanity .
The Price of Debt - Based " Prosperity " : Slow Erosion , Inevitable Decline ( August 27 , 2008 )
The sudden demise of Empire into chaos makes for a rousing made - for - TV movie , but empires actually decline in the most tedious fashion .
Decades or even hundreds of years pass as debts and profligacy mount , wars sap the will to maintain borders , water / food shortages , famine and pestilence reduce populations and a citizenry desperate for diversion and " answers " turns to circus and dark religious cults .
None of this is surprising to those who study animal populations .
When food is short , or a new disease or predator sweeps through , then the population drops dramatically .
Eventually , the rains return and food is again plentiful , and the population rises to beyond the carrying capacity of the locale .
As food becomes scarce , overcrowding creates tensions and enables new diseases to spread , and various " mental illnesses " / erratic behaviors become common as stress builds .
The population crashes / dies off to a level below sustainability and the cycle repeats .
( Barring the sudden arrival of a 20 - kilometer wide meteor . )
Hmm , sounds like the Anastazi , the Maya , 14th century Europe , etc .
As supplies get tight , then conflicts over the remaining resources arise , and the temptation to " eat your seed corn " i.e. bleed the future to sustain the present becomes ever higher .
And on that note , let 's take a look at the U.S. National Debt going back to 1940 , adjusted for " official " inflation :
Let 's take note of a few salient points on this chart .
1 . The huge deficit spending required to fund World War II in the 1940s is but a blip .
2 . From 1945 to 1980 , fully 35 years , the deficit / debt was remarkably stable when adjusted for inflation .
I can vividly recall the horror and outrage in the late 1970s when the Federal deficit ran up to the stupendous , fearful sum of $ 40 billion - - about $ 120 billion in today 's money .
Now we accept talk of a budget deficit 8 times as large ( $ 1 trillion ) with a barely stifled yawn .
3 . The " cut taxes , borrow and spend " era began in 1981 and has continued to this day , interrupted only briefly by the rising revenues created by the dot - com era circa 1998 - 2000 .
4 . Remember " the peace dividend " ?
That was the reduction of U.S. military spending after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 .
In terms of its share of GDP , defense spending dropped quite a bit .
But that reduction is n't even visible in this chart , is it ?
Proving once again that entitlements are driving the budget deficit .
5 . Regardless of falling military expenditures , the debt has risen in what looks like a " blow - off " similar to the dot - com stocks and the housing bubble just before those manias collapsed .
Only this bubble was a borrowing mania , not a speculative mania .
Nonetheless , the future of all blow - off peaks is the same : collapse .
Here is a laughably optimistic chart of future entitlement spending .
It 's laughable because it 's based on implausible assumptions with no connection to reality -- for instance , that Medicare will grow by 2 % per year when in reality it grows at least 6 % - 10 % per year .
What 's interesting about this chart is the interest paid on the debt we will have to take on to fund all these entitlements : notice how the interest dwarfs the actual entitlements spending .
By these absurdly euphoric assumptions -- taxes stay steady instead of plummeting in the coming Depression , Medicare barely rises despite the population drawing Medicare benefits doubling , etc. -- we 're only in trouble by 2040 , when the interest on all this colossal debt rises to 10 % of GDP - - $ 1.4 trillion in today 's money , or roughly half the entire Federal budget .
If interest rates rise , we wo n't even have to wait that long for interest to eat up half the budget .
As shown on the first chart , a rise in the interest rate back to the 9 % - 10 % would very quickly cause interest payments to rise in tandem with ballooning deficits to $ 1 trillion per year or more , effectively squeezing other government spending and private lending for business and mortgages .
Although we seem to have forgotten it , the pool of new capital available to borrow is not endless .
Every dollar that is invested in Treasury debt ( bonds ) is a dollar which is not available to private lending for business expansion or home mortgages .
You think the government budget battles are ugly now -- wait til $ 500 billion more has to be scraped from other spending to pay the exploding interest .
Though readers may well be tired of this chart , I reprint it here to illustrate two key points :
1. low interest rates in the U.S. are the result of massive intervention by the Chinese government banks ; all the other purported " reasons " are noise
2. interest rates run in cycles of 17 - 24 years , and the U.S. is just beginning a decades - long uptrend in interest rates .
Those who assume interest rates can stay low for decades to come due to deflation are missing the key macro- drivers of interest rates : risk , availablility of capital to borrow , and where that capital comes from : profits and savings .
Many are expecting the Gulf Oil states ' sovereign wealth funds ( SWFs ) to magically save the day by investing trillions in oil profits in the U.S.
Nice idea , but the Export Land Model of oil reveals that the amount of oil available to export will be dropping due to exploding domestic consumption , regardless of how much is pumped .
Fewer barrels sold means less money in SWFs .
And let 's not forget that many SWFs have already suffered stupendous losses in their initial " investing " in U.S. debt and financials .
The sheer scale of U.S. deficit spending dwarfs even Gulf State SWFs .
All the oil profits available for non-domestic investment are estimated at perhaps $ 500 billion a year -- about the current size of the U.S. Federal deficit .
That means if every single oil - profit dollar flows into Treasuries , a deficit of $ 1 trillion would require another $ 500 billion from somewhere else .
As China 's economy contracts along with all other global economies , that nation 's surplus of dollars will contract , too .
Less dollars piling up means less dollars available to soak up the endless flood of Treasuries ( i.e. deficit spending ) .
Astute readers Dr. K. and Craig M. both forwarded this article on how the Chinese are raising dollar reserves " through the back door " by forcing banks to increase capital reserves :
Beijing swells dollar reserves through stealth ( Telegraph.uk )
These tricks are not sustainable .
The game is about up .
Regardless of whether the dollar rises or falls , the enormous trade imbalances of the past decade will be resolved by a drying up of surplus dollars .
If the U.S. needs $ 1 trillion to fund its wars and entitlements , and another $ 1 trillion ( or 3 ) to fund its housing mortgages and business borrowing , there simply wo n't be enough dollars available to buy all this unimaginably vast new debt .
Recall that money is a commodity .
When there is less supply than demand , prices rise .
The cost of money will rise , and thus the interest paid to borrow will rise as well .
So where does that leave the beggared citizens ?
With trillions less in entitlements and funds available for war , space travel , energy grids , education , etc. etc .
The decline in government funds available for spending on entitlements is inevitable for purely demographic reasons ; in the long view , a slow erosion in " lifestyle " and standard of living is also inevitable .
When will the decline trigger some sort of revolution ?
Only when the unsustainability of the present model of " cut taxes and borrow and spend " runs aground on the shoals of insolvency and bankruptcy .
When the government can no longer pay its bills or borrow enough to do so , then the citizenry will face a revolution whether they want one or not .
It need not be a violent revolution , but it will be a revolutionary change in expectations and goals .
The current goal ( unstated due to denial ) is to game the system to extract as much as you can as an individual ; this impoverishing ethic will no longer work because the trough will be empty .
New must - read Readers Journals essay by Chris Sullins and Paul T. :
Dust and Shadow ( part 1 of his tour of duty in Iraq ) I mentally went through all my gear I had just prepared .
I was wearing part of it which included body armor with front and back ceramic plates , helmet , ballistic goggles lifted over the front lip of the helmet , a holstered pistol with spare mags , a Mossberg shotgun dangled by its sling from a carabiner clipped on my right shoulder strap , and pouches holding shotgun shells nested firmly to my front .
If we somehow got separated from the convoy or ended up on foot the most important piece of gear , my GPS unit , was also in a pouch .
Sergeant H stood nearby checking out the gear of the two young specialists we were rotating in for their first mission outside the wire .
It was 0400 and we would be lining up for the convoy at 0500 .
This moment in my memory was from sometime early in my deployment .
It held great anticipation for me at the time .
Now when I wake up at the same time I look back at it and wonder to myself WTF was I thinking . 
I Rise to Object ( Paul T. )
Well , I disagree with some of your discussion in " The Next Revolution " .
You will note that many prosperous OECD countries have a much higher safety net of benefits for the lowest quintile of their citizens than does the USA , so that has to raise some questions regarding what this country can afford .
I believe that you were much more on the money on an earlier essay that opined that the US was horribly mis-managed .

Those of you complaining about the lack of front camera and videoconferencing in the new iPhone , stop saying words .
This July 11 you will be able to buy the Apple Videoconferencing Kit for iPhone 3G at just $ 29 .
Press release and an exclusive leaked photo of the user manual — showing how it exactly works — right after the jump .

Apple introduces the iPhone 3G Videoconferencing Kit , ZOMG !
WWDC SAN FRANCISCO - June 11 , 2008 - Apple® today unveiled the Apple Videoconferencing Kit® , the world 's first videoconference accessory for the world 's best phone , the iPhone 3G .
Using a unique silicon - based mirror material and natural bamboo wood for its handle and base , the Apple Videoconferencing Kit measures an unprecedented 0.5 inches at its thinnest point .
Its low weight and unique shape — developed following strict Human Interface tests and anatomical studies — will allow the user to easily hold it in front of the iPhone 3G camera , allowing face - to - face video communication with users all around the world .
" We 've built the world 's best cellphone - again , " said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO and famed fried tofu fan .
" But it did n't feel ... complete .
So I said to Phil , hey !
Phil , yo !
Where 's the damn front camera ?
Can we do iChat AV with this shit ?
He said we could n't , but then ... then he pulled out his hand mirror and said : ' what about this ? ' "
Phil Schiller , senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing and Apple 's Cool Guy at Large , explained how it all went after that : " Steve thought it was ok , but he did n't like the pink plastic and shiny beads , so we asked Jon to come up with an evolution of the design . "
The team lead by Jonathan Ive was left with the challenge of making the Apple Videoconferencing Kit a reality : " We wanted the design to feel complete , as a whole holistic experience for the user , something that would talk from the inside , and be pure function .
It just feels that way now . "
The Apple Videoconferencing
Kit ultra-shiny surface allows for an extremely clear image , the best in its class , and can be easily customized using any kind of materials , from stickers to Crayola .
It will be available in July 11 for $ 29 .
Apple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh .
Today , Apple continues to lead the industry in innovation with its award - winning computers , OS X operating system and iLife and professional applications .
Apple is also spearheading the digital media revolution with its iPod portable music and video players and iTunes online store , and has entered the mobile phone market with its revolutionary iPhone .

Indeed , it looks like Apple keeps pushing the envelope .

For those of you who do n't get it , this is a criticism of the lack of front camera and video conferencing in the iPhone 3G .
Looking at the new model , I think it is clear that Apple has decided to milk the current iPhone for another year instead of actually pushing the envelope big time .
After all , why rush it when you are still entering the market and you can increase your margins ?
While I 'm sure that iChat AV - compatible videoconferencing will come to the iPhone , the fact is that Apple has decided we do n't need it , expanding the lifetime of the previous generation by adding 3G and new software , in order to get more return out of their original investment .
I can't blame them .
And it even makes sense from a development point of view , making sure that every step works before taking another .
However , as a consumer and gadget addict who wants it all , that does n't make me happy .
Setting up an online store is a great way to sell your products to your customers in a convenient way .
However , although online shopping is convenient , it does n’t always convert to huge sales .
In fact , studies show that the average rate for cart abandonment is 67.91 percent .
In general , the average rate varies between 60 to 80 percent .
This means that for every 100 people that visit your website , anywhere from 60 to 80 of them will leave without buying anything .
While this can be a disheartening statistic , there ’s plenty that you can do to improve your customers ’ online shopping experience so you get more conversions .
Check out this guide to learn what you can do to improve your customers ’ online shopping experience .
1. Focus on Appearance and Functionality
One of the most important things you can do to improve your customers ’ online shopping experience is to invest in your website ’s appearance and functionality .
First impressions matter and no one wants to spend time on a terrible looking website , no matter how great your products may be .
If your company is solely online , then your website is your first impression .
You do n’t have the opportunity to wow your customers with your personality or conversational skills , so how you present your website really matters .
In fact , studies show that 55 percent of website users spend less than 15 seconds on a website .
While there are a lot of reasons why someone may leave a website abruptly , a lot of the time , it has to do with the site ’s appearance and functionality .
So , to make sure you leave a good impression on your visitors , start by looking at how your brand feels as a whole .
Take a look at your color scheme , logo , taglines , and voice .
Make sure you ’re emphasizing the appeal of your homepage by properly balancing educational content and visuals .
2. Prioritize Mobile Responsiveness
Most of us do n’t let our cellphones out of our site .
Because of this , long gone are the days where one needed to hunker down behind a desktop or laptop in order to make online purchases .
Now , making online purchases is as easy making a few clicks on your phone .
In fact , studies show that 79 percent of smartphone users have made an online purchase in the last 6 months .
Without a doubt , mobile shopping is here to stay .
Therefore , it ’s very important to ensure that your website is mobile - friendly .
If it is n’t , your customers will quickly become frustrated and this will lead to cart abandonment .
Ensure that your website is functional across as many platforms as possible .
And , take time to consider how website layouts will transfer to a small screen .
For example , a quality photo on a website may be less effective when transferred to a mobile device .
3. Remember that Website Speed is Important
These days , people are used to instant gratification .
If your website is taking forever to load , customers are n’t going to have the patience to sit around and wait .
Instead , they ’ll just head to your competition ’s site which is much faster .
In fact , a website that takes 1 to 3 seconds to load can increase your bounce rate probability by 32 percent .
A website that takes up to 5 seconds to load can increase your bounce rate by 90 percent .
And , a website that takes up to ten seconds to load can increase your bounce rate by a whopping 123 percent !
To make sure you are n’t losing customers before they even take the chance to look at your site , you need to make sure your website is up to speed .
While incorporating third party displays and applications can be a good idea , make sure these things are n’t slowing down the speed of your website .
4. Make Checkout a Cinch
So , you ’ve gotten customers to your website .
You ’ve wowed them with your fast load times , functionality , and beautiful design .
So far so good .
But , when they go to check out , they run into an issue .
Are they going to email your customer service team because so far , everything has been great and they really want to buy from you ?
Or , are they going to abandon their cart and shop somewhere else ?
Unfortunately , the latter scenario is more likely to occur .
To make sure customers are n’t abandoning their carts at the last minute , you need to make the checkout process a cinch .
Here are some things you can do to make the checkout process easier for your customers :
Offer your customers the chance to buy immediately or continue shopping
Do n’t ask for payment information until the very end
Let customers know when they ’ve added a product to their cart
Use perpetual shopping carts ( aka , when a customer returns to the website , their cart should still be there )
Assist customers with discounts
Make sure your website accepts a variety of credit cards and payment methods ( ie , Paypal , Apple Pay , Google Wallet )
Consider accepting monthly installment payment solutions for your customers
The easier you make the checkout process for your customers , the more you will improve your product experience management ( PXM ) .
5. Make Use of Customer Reviews
When a customer is hesitant about buying a product , they often look at customer reviews in order to make a final decision .
In fact , 84 percent of people trust online customer reviews as much as they trust a personal recommendation .
Therefore , it ’s very important to make sure that your reviews are displayed prominently .
If your website is lacking reviews , then it ’s time to start reaching out to your customers for feedback .
You can send your customers follow - up emails after purchasing your product to remind them to leave a review .
Or , you can offer your customers incentives to leave reviews .
For example , some e-commerce stores offer their customers a certain number of points for every review they leave .
Then , customers can put these points toward their next purchase .
6. Befriend Free Shipping
We get it , constantly shipping out products costs money .
However , whether or not your company offers free shipping is often a deciding factor for customers .
If you ’re worried that free shipping on every product will set your business back to much , do n’t worry , you do n’t need to offer it all the time .
For example , you could offer free shipping to customers who spend over a certain amount .
Or , you could create a membership service like Amazon Prime in which a customer gets free shipping if they pay a small monthly subscription fee .
7. Make Use of Live Chat
No matter how seamless your website ’s online shopping experience is , there ’s a good chance that your customers are going to run into problems at some point or another .
When this happens , it ’s very important that your customers have a customer service agent at their disposal .
Otherwise , you risk losing their business .
While you should definitely have a customer service line and email that you respond to promptly , you should also consider adding live chat to your website .
Live chat ensures that customers receive the answers to their questions in a prompt manner .
Additionally , you should offer an extensive FAQ page for customers to turn to before they hop onto live chat .
8. Embrace Customer Photos
When a customer hesitates to buy a product online , it ’s oftentimes because they ’re unsure of how the product will look in real life .
To make it easier for customers to visualize products in person , we suggest making use of customer photos .
Sure , photos with models are great .
But , customer photos can give people a more authentic idea of what something will actually look like in person .
To get more customer photos , make sure there ’s a spot in the review section where a customer can add a photo if they wish .
Additionally , make sure any social media influencers you are working with are posting photos with products as well .
9. Make Filtering and Searching for Products a Breeze
Nobody wants to spend a lot of time searching through a website just to find one product .
Therefore , it ’s very important that you make filtering and searching for products a breeze .
For example , if you run a clothing e-commerce store , then a customer should be able to search by the type of clothing , size , color , price , and more .
Additionally , they should be able to type the name of the product they ’re looking for right into your website ’s search bar and get the results they ’re looking for .
Also , when your post information about your products on social media , make sure you provide links to the products .
10 . Offer Wishlists and Like Buttons
People often shop online in the same way they shop in - person .
That is , sometimes people are just there to browse and not really buy anything .
But , oftentimes , people are thinking about returning later to buy something once their next paycheck comes in or once they ’ve done more research on the product .
To make it easy for someone to come back to these products , make sure you have wishlists / like buttons on your website .
This way , a customer will have no trouble moving an item they like into their cart to purchase .

WASHINGTON , D.C. -- Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich has won another major poll among grassroots Party activists most likely to vote in caucuses and primaries , capturing 41 % of the vote from Progressive Democrats of America ( PDA ) , which has more than 80,000 members across the nation .
In the field of eight candidates , the Ohio Congressman was the overwhelming winner , easily out - pacing second - place finisher former Senator John Edwards , who received 26 % of the vote .
Senator Barack Obama came in third with 13 % , followed by Senator Hillary Clinton with 9 % , and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson with 5 % .
The other Democratic candidates were in the low single digits .
Kucinich was also the top vote - getter among PDA members in the early - voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire .
It is the third exceptionally strong finish by Kucinich in polls among active , grassroots Democrats .
Last month , he topped all other candidates in 47 of 50 states in a poll sponsored by Democracy for America ( DFA ) .
Also , a poll conducted by the progressive The Nation magazine showed Kucinich with 35 % of the vote , Obama second with 24 % and Edwards third with 13 % .
In last month ’s DFA poll , Kucinich received almost 32 % of the 150,000 - plus votes cast , more than Edwards and Obama combined .
There , too , he won both Iowa and New Hampshire .
In announcing today ’s results , PDA said , “ The Congressman 's showing indicates that Progressive Democrats are still in sync with the Kucinich agenda : Out of Iraq ; no attack on Iran , single - payer healthcare , fair trade , etc . ”
The poll was open only to PDA members , and the organization said it added “ extra layers of security ” to protect the integrity of the survey .
In an analysis of the recent polls in The Nation today , Washington correspondent John Nichols wrote that Kucinich ’s “ pointed opposition to the war in Iraq and outspoken advocacy of impeachment of Vice President Cheney has echoed the sentiments of the Democratic base ” and “ party activists who do the heavy lifting . ”
Nichols also noted , “ The DFA and PDA poll results give Kucinich an additional measure of credibility as he reaches out to key activists , including Democrats who are currently leaning toward other contenders ... ”
Kucinich ’s national and state - by - state poll numbers have risen noticeably in the past several weeks .
Not only is he the only Democratic candidate who voted against the Iraq war authorization in 2002 and every supplemental funding measure since , he also is the only Democratic candidate who voted against the Patriot Act .
And , his early opposition to hostile moves by the Administration towards Iran was validated earlier this week when the National Intelligence Estimate revealed that Iran had abandoned its nuclear weapons program four years ago .
Kucinich , sponsor of a resolution calling for impeachment proceedings against Cheney , has called for a Congressional investigation of the handling of the NIE findings by the Administration .
He said that such an investigation “ will further build the case for the impeachment of both the President and the Vice President . ”

Ms Maynard said the woman officer told her : " It 's obvious he [ Joshua ] has nothing to do with you " .
She said officers had told the family they had powers to hold them for up to nine hours under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act , but they were released after more than two hours .

Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination for president last night , propelling him to history as the first black standard - bearer for either major party .
“ Tonight , I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States , ” Obama said during a huge rally in St. Paul , Minn .
– the city where John McCain will accept the GOP nomination this summer .
Appearing overwhelmed , Obama paused for a long period as the crowd of roughly 17,000 people at the Xcel Energy Center erupted in wild applause and sign - waving .
Another 15,000 people were outside , and chants of “ Yes we can ! ” – Obama ’s catch phrase – were heard throughout his speech .
“ Tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another – a journey that will bring a new and better day to America . ”
Obama ’s victory will be made official with the vote of delegates at the Democratic convention in late August .
It sets up a race between a 46 - year - old opponent of the Iraq war and John McCain , a 71 - year - old former Vietnam prisoner of war and staunch supporter of the current US military mission .
In his remarks , Obama complimented Hillary Rodham Clinton and even mentioned her husband , Bill , who ’s been deeply critical of the Illinois senator .
Singling her out for praise for her stance on universal health care and poverty and calling her campaign “ barrier - breaking , ” he said , “ Our party and our country are better off because of her , and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton . ”
Obama took sharp aim at McCain , seeking promptly to paint him as a phony who ’s in lockstep with President Bush .
“ There are many words to describe John McCain ’s attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush ’s politics as bipartisan and new – but change is not one of them , ” he added .
He added , “ We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in – but start leaving we must . ”
And he condemned the chances of “ another election that ’s governed by fear , and innuendo , and vision .
“ What you wo n’t hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge , and patriotism as a bludgeon – that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge , but enemies to demonize , ” he added .
“ America , this is our moment . . . our time to torn the page on the politics of the past , ” he said , his voice rising as the crowd went wild .
Obama went into the day needing just over 40 delegates to hit the magic 2,118 number needed to clinch at the party convention – and capped the night with 2,144 after a drip - drip rollout of superdelegates throughout the day , an Associated Press tally found .
Obama will now need to bring back Clinton ’s backers – especially older white women , political experts said .
“ It ’s incredibly important , ” said political consultant Dan Gerstein .
“ One of the reasons George W. Bush was elected and re-elected president was on the strength of white women . . . whose feelings are the most bruised ” after Clinton ’s defeat .
Obama had suffered a string of losses in primary states the last two months .
He and Clinton had a split verdict in the last two primaries of the year yesterday .
With a majority of the vote counted , she won South Dakota by 55 - 44 percent ; Obama won Montana , 59 - 39 percent .
He ’ll head to Clinton ’s home turf for two fund - raisers in Manhattan tonight .
Officials with both candidates ’ campaigns insisted there are no plans for any joint appearance between them .
One of his first steps will be to unify a badly bruised party that ’s been split along racial and gender fault lines as the fight for the nomination between a black candidate and a female candidate stretched longer than anyone had imagined .
Obama will also look to bring in Clinton ’s major donors , sources said – some of whom had privately expressed concern that they had been treated as unnecessary in light of the Illinois senator ’s massive money juggernaut .
So far , several sources on both sides said , Obama ’s camp had basically refrained from any orchestrated poaching to avoid insulting Clinton while she ’s still in the hunt .
Clinton ’s national finance chairman , Hassan Nemazee , said it had been the appropriate way to handle things , adding , “ I would applaud them for the way they ’ve conducted themselves . ”

PALIN ’S GOVERNING STYLE … .
We all know that after she became governor of Alaska , Sarah Palin sold the executive jet on eBay and fired the chef at the governor ’s mansion .
But how is she at actually governing ?
Here ’s Anchorage Daily News reporter Gregg Erickson :
It is clear that she has not paid much attention to the nitty - gritty unglamorous work of government , of gaining consensus , and making difficult compromises .
She seems to be of the view that politics should be all rather simple … .
The Republican chair of the Alaska State House Finance budget subcommittee on Heath and Medicaid says he can’t find anyone in Palin ’s executive office who cares about helping bring that budget under control .
He is furious with her about that .
That would be Republican Mike Hawker , who confirms his opinion of Palin to the LA Times :
“ Her administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government , ” said Hawker , “ whether it be dealing with human services , public services , highways , all the routine aspects . ”
And Democrats agree !
Here ’s state senator Hollis French :
French faulted Palin for not helping the Legislature pass a bill to raise the benefits threshhold for children and pregnant women from 175 % of the poverty level to 200 % .
( Most states set them at 200 % to 250 % . )
“ She said she wanted to help us raise it , ” French said , “ but could n’t be bothered to do anything in the closing days of the Legislature , when she could have helped it through . ”
So in addition to not having much curiosity or interest in political affairs outside of Alaska , she apparently does n’t have much curiosity or interest in political affairs inside Alaska either .
Sounds like the perfect successor to W . No wonder McCain fell in love with her .
It was Sen. John McCain ’s staff who asked security at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts to remove people holding protest signs at the venue — not U.S. Secret Service agents , who were not involved in Carol Kreck ’s ouster from the galleria .
A video of the incident circulating widely on the Internet shows a DCPA security guard saying that he was told by the Secret Service to remove Kreck , who was holding a paper sign that said “ McCain = Bush . ”
But Thursday , after two days of being vilified by bloggers , letter writers and others , the Secret Service emphatically denied involvement .
“ Contrary to some recent reporting , the Secret Service had no involvement in Ms. Kreck being removed from the area , ” said Malcolm D. Wiley Sr. , spokesman for the Secret Service .
“ It was not done at our request or suggestion .
Any assertion to the contrary is inaccurate and inconsistent with our established policies and procedures . ”
That prompted the DCPA to re-examine the reasons its guard sought to have Kreck removed .
“ A representative of Senator John McCain ’s staff respectfully asked that the venue for its July 7 Town Hall Meeting , The Denver Center for the Performing Arts , not allow persons to display signage within the Arts Complex , ” DCPA officials said in a statement .
DCPA spokeswoman Suzanne Blandon said the guard who told Kreck to leave was “ simply mistaken ” in identifying the Secret Service as the agency that wanted her to leave .
Blandon said the guard did not intend to use the Secret Service as leverage and did not mean to mislead anyone .
“ He is not a trained speaker in any way , ” she said .
“ It was the height of the moment , a situation not typical of that complex .
He was simply trying to uphold the policy as he understood it to be . ”
A previous federal appeals court decision determined that the galleria area where Kreck was standing is not necessarily a public spot and that protests can be curtailed there .
Kreck , a 60 - year - old librarian and former Denver Post reporter , was cited for trespassing by Denver police at the Monday event .
Jogging in the Smog ( With Sally Jenkins )
At some point during our first week here , I came up with the brilliant idea that Sally Jenkins and I should go for a lengthy jog in the smog with the blog and the bog and report back our respiratory findings .
So we did so Wednesday morning , she in jogging pants and an athletic shirt , me in shorts and my LeBron James " Crybaby 23 " t- shirt , which was awesome .
Sally has this peaceful park she 's quite fond of , and I ran about 2.5 miles trying to find it , despite the fact that it 's a half - mile from our hotel .
So by the time we finally met up on Beijing 's version of the Beltway , we had both already covered some ground .
But humor us , as we run together and breathe together and realize our mouths are collecting some weird grainy film together .
I was initially skeptical about all things smog , but let me tell you , it 's for real .
Granted , I feel like death whenever I jog , but this time I felt like death covered with tar enveloped in exhaust fumes wrapped in insulation sprinkled with gasoline and tied together with a sandpaper bow .
In all honesty , running at a slow clip for a very short distance , we undeniably got a lot thirstier and felt a lot crummier than we would have even in D.C. 's humidity .
Take a look .
Thanks to Jonathan Newton for the camera work and Jonathan Forsythe for the edit , and do n't make fun of us too much .
After a month of downtime , TextBook Torrents makes its return , right on time , as the first semester starts in just a few weeks .
The BitTorrent tracker , dedicated to sharing knowledge in the form of textbooks , was pulled offline by Dreamhost early July because the hosting company received a takedown request .
The Textbook Torrents tracker is considered to be the largest library of textbooks on BitTorrent .
The site had been flying under the radar for quite some time but this changed a month ago .
On July 1st , The Chronicle of Higher Education ran a story on the site , which was picked up by Slashdot and later the LA Times blog .
All this attention led to thousands of new visitors to the tracker , but the publicity also had a downside .
Geekman , the administrator of Textbook Torrents told TorrentFreak that their host , xlHost , and their domain registrar , Dreamhost , both received a takedown request a few days after all the press coverage .
“ We received a DMCA notice from Pearson Education a week or so prior , which we complied with , but it was a group of publishers that contacted our host , ” he told us .
Although the tracker was pretty popular , with around 20,000 peers trading files at any given point in time , Geekman said he had never received takedown notices from big publishers before .
“ We had a couple of emails from individuals before , but nothing from organizations .
One was an editor complaining about being cheated out of his 10 Â¢ per copy commission . ”
On July 5th Dreamhost suspended Geekman ’s account , and despite his many efforts to contact them , they simply did n’t respond to his inquiries .
It took more than a week before he was allowed to transfer the domain .
Now , more than a month after the site went down , Textbook Torrents returns , and it ’s not planning to go away anytime soon .
Geekman plans to focus on making the site ’s resources redundant , to reduce vulnerability and to make sure the site remains online .
In addition he will work on the legal issues and improve the privacy of the site ’s users .
One of the most drastic changes is the decision to stop the logging of IP - addresses , which means that the site will stop ratio tracking .
Making the tracker public will ensure the privacy of the users , in case the server is compromised .
“ I want to see the textbook industry change such that we are no longer needed , ” Geekman says when we ask him about his main motivation to bring the site back , while mentioning cheap books and responsible business practices as examples of positive change .
He does n’t think publishers should give away their books –even though some authors profit from doing so — but he does think most books are too expensive .
“ The companies may be corrupt , but they have a right to make money .
They ca n’t be expected to give their material away for free .
After all , there is a significant amount of work involved in the production of a textbook .
We need a middle ground , ” he says .
“ I ’m not naive enough to say that if something can be distributed in a digital form it should be free but there needs to be some adaptation here , ” Geekman added .
For now , however , all the publishers see is a threat to their revenue stream , as Allan Ryan of Harvard Business Publishing put it :
“ We have been fairly vigorous in monitoring these sites and in requesting that they take down our copyrighted content . ”
They sure have something to monitor now , as Textbook Torrents has made its return … because you still ca n’t torrent beer .
Currently , the site can only be accessed directly via the IP - address , however , the domain should be working again shortly .
A member of the film crew rushed over to the massive storefront window , glaring into the street searching for the misguided extra .
“ He ’s someone who will never be in the shot again , ” the crewman assured the visibly frustrated Mr. Fuqua , who was rubbing the back of his bald head .
A few seconds later Mr. Gere staggered in from the sidewalk , nursing his elbow as he joined Mr. Fuqua to review tape of the scene .
Then before long there was silence , and then “ Action ! ”
And again Mr. Gere was in the street , in the middle of the block , tussling with an actor probably half his age .
As strange a scene as it was that day in a neighborhood more accustomed to real - life drama , even more extraordinary is the story of how Mr. Martin , a 28 - year - old former subway worker from East New York , Brooklyn , came to write “ Brooklyn ’s Finest , ” a gritty thriller starring Don Cheadle , Ethan Hawke and Mr. Gere as police officers in a housing project .
Mr. Martin , who in his dusty white FUBU sneakers , denim shorts and a short - sleeve , button - up shirt looked that day more like a college senior than a Hollywood writer , is a onetime film student who remains a few credits shy of his degree from Brooklyn College .
His most recent job was subway flagger with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ; he waved flags and set up warning lights in subway tunnels to warn approaching trains that construction crews were working on the tracks .

The whole movie thing , he said , happened sort of by chance .
In 2005 a car accident left him injured and his 1991 Lincoln Mark VII totaled .
While he would need three months of physical therapy to deal with a bulging disc in his back , his obsession focused less on mending than on making some extra cash to buy a new car .
Surfing the Web one day he came across a call for submissions in a screenwriting competition .
The grand prize was $ 10,000 .
So he began to write the first scenes of what he called “ kind of an epic ” : the intertweaving stories of three police officers who have misplaced their moral compasses and grown to hate themselves a little along the way .

Scientists set off this week to study the wrecks of three German submarines sunk by U.S. forces in 1942 off the coast of North Carolina during the Battle of the Atlantic .
" This expedition is the first part of a larger multi- year project to research and document a number of historically significant shipwrecks tragically lost during World War II , including U.S. and British naval vessels and merchant marine vessels , " said David W. Alberg , expedition leader and superintendent of the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary .
" The information collected during this expedition will be crucial to efforts to preserve these historic sites . "
Researchers will survey and photograph visible sections of the three submarines , U - 352 , U - 85 and U - 701 , using non-invasive methods .
They will also study marine life found at the sites .
The wrecks , popular dive sites off the Outer Banks of North Carolina , are considered war graves and will not be disturbed during the expedition .
( The word U - boat refers to German military submarines operated during World War I and World War II , and is an anglicization of the German abbreviation for " unterseeboot , " or undersea boat . )
The sunken German U - boats are located in an area known as the " Graveyard of the Atlantic , " which encompasses shipwrecks from both sides of the Battle of the Atlantic at recreational diving depths ( less than 130 feet ) .
Two of the U - boats , U - 352 and U - 85 , have been severely impacted by salvage operators and souvenir hunters since their discovery more than three decades ago .
U -701 is relatively intact but also has begun to show signs of damage from illegal salvage attempts .
The sub was discovered by recreational divers in 1989 before being covered by sand and rediscovered in 2004 .
NOAA 's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries is conducting the survey in partnership with the Minerals Management Service , National Park Service , State of North Carolina , East Carolina University and the University of North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute .
The expedition runs through July 26 .
Next summer , the team plans to investigate Allied wrecks in the Graveyard of the Atlantic .
Some of the wrecks lie at recreational diving depths , while many are located in deeper waters where they remain untouched and in relatively good condition .
The leaders of the G - 8 and of major developing countries will discuss how to respond to energy security and climate change tomorrow .
Their first instinct will likely be to propose new regulations .
Yet market forces may already be solving these problems , as high oil prices drive a shift away from the polluting , petroleum - fueled internal combustion engine to cleaner forms of transportation .
That 's a change worth cheering , even if oil prices are painful in the meantime .
Oil is the United States ' principal transportation fuel , ...

It 's sowhen the big record labels pretend like they 're embracing the digital era sometimes .
Check out the latest effort from Universal Music , which the company has dubbed " Playlist Your Way , " and which it purports is a new sort of physical / digital hybrid for the internet era .
It does have a few good elements -- but it wraps it up with plenty of bad elements , most specifically the .
This is n't a Burger King " Have it your way " type of thing .
You do n't get to select the tracks you want in order to create your own CD or anything .
No , you 're buying a ready - made greatest hits CD ( from artists who almost all already have out existing greatest hits CDs ) , plus a few digital extras .
Jess Hemerly over at the Institute For The Future breaks down both the good and the bad of this idea , noting that doing " podcast liner notes " definitely makes sense .
These podcasts do sound interesting : Yes , that absolutely could be quite cool , but it comes tied to forcing you to buy another greatest hits CD .
If anything , all this really seems like is Universal Music trying to convince you to buy the same musicby adding a few random extras .
And , then , of course , there 's the totally misleading name .
It 's as if Universal Music thinks its customers are stupid .
If it advertises something as a customizable playlist , people are going to probably expect a customizable playlist -- but that 's not what you get .
You get a set playlist on a greatest hits CD , and then the option to download some extra stuff : " Consumers may choose six additional tracks and / or a full - length original studio album . "
Of course , if customerswant a playlist " their way , " they 're going to do it the way so many people do it these days : they 're just going to download the tracks they want , and not feel suckered into buying the packaging , even if it 's " designed to be digital friendly , with more color and new impactful designs . "
As Hemerly points out : " How does " impactful " design make a physical CD more " digital friendly ? "
What does this sentence even mean ?
" The idea of including a podcast about the artist is a good one .
It 's just too bad Universal Music is basically only using it to get you to buy yet another greatest hits album , and then making a bunch of boastful claims that either do n't make sense or simply are n't accurate .
At what point do the big record labels realize that they should offer people real options to get what they want , rather than trying to hype them into buying a bunch of crap they do n't care about to get at the tiny nugget of stuff they do want ?

Did McCain ad intend to link Obama to Antichrist ?
John Byrne
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Aide calls ad ' light - hearted '
They call him " The One . "
That 's the spin from a Web ad launched Aug. 1 by the McCain campaign which some biblical scholars and Democrats say contains a hidden message linking Sen. Barack Obama to the antichrist .
" It shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed , " the announcer proclaims .
Following the pronouncement , images of golden clouds and Moses parting the Red Sea are invoked to make a mockery of Obama 's lofty rhetoric .
" And he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one , " the announcer intones .
" To quote Barack , ' I have become a symbol of America returning to its best traditions . '
He can do not wrong ...
Can you see the light ? "
A spokesman for McCain 's campaign told the Wall Street Journal Friday , " It 's a light - hearted ad that pokes fun at him . "
He said the ad is only intended to highlight the Illinois senator 's " many audacious statements . "
Scholars and critics , however , point to startling links between the ad and the popular " Left Behind " Christian End Times series .
Director of the Center for Media , Religion and Culture at the University of Colorado at Boulder Stewart Hoover told the paper the ad's antichrist references were n't subtle for anyone familiar with the books .
Images in the ad closely resemble those used in the latest " Left Behind " novel ; the type font is nearly identical .
The antichrist in the books , Nicolae Carpathia , sets up " the One World Religion " -- just as the ad repeatedly refers to Obama as " The One . "
" For people who want a reason to be skeptical of Obama , this might nail it down , " Hoover said .
The Obama campaign has not commented on the spot .
" The End Times , a New Testament reference to the period surrounding the return of Christ , were popularized in recent years by the " Left Behind " series of books that sold more than 63 million copies , " the Journal notes .
" The Rev. Tim LaHaye , co-author of the series , said in an interview that he recognized allusions to his work in the ad but comparisons between Sen. Obama and the antichrist are incorrect . "
" The antichrist is n't going to be an American , so it can't possibly be Obama , " LaHaye said .
" The Bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place , like Romania . "
The ad has provoked a growing debate on the Internet over whether it is playing with apocalyptic themes .
Those ideas are chiefly shared by fundamentalist Protestants and some other evangelical Christians .
Among their expectations : the ascension of a false prophet , a one - world government and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ .
" Short of 666 , they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad , " said Eric Sapp , a Democratic advisor who advises Democrats on religious outreach .
" There are way too many things to just be coincidence . "
Notes the paper : " In some swing states with concentrated pockets of fundamentalists and evangelical Christians , like Ohio , Pennsylvania , Colorado and Virginia , the ads could have particular impact .
Suggestions that Sen. Obama is the antichrist have been circulating for months in Bible - study meetings in towns like Chillicothe , Ohio , where congregants compare his remarks and his biography with verses from the Bible . "
The ad is available below .
BEIJING -- Chinese authorities have not approved any of the 77 applications they received from people who wanted to hold protests during the Beijing Olympics , state media reported Monday .
The state - run Xinhua News Agency said the applications received since Aug. 1 , a week before the games opened , were submitted by 149 people , including three from overseas .
The complaints ranged from labor and medical disputes to inadequate welfare , it said .
But 74 of the applications were withdrawn because the problems " were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations , " Xinhua said , citing an unidentified spokesman for the Public Security Bureau .
Two other applications were suspended because they did not provide sufficient information and one was rejected because it violated laws against demonstrations and protests , the spokesman said .
No further details were given .
A woman who answered the telephone at the spokesman 's office of the bureau would not comment on the report .
Protests have become common in China , from workers upset about factory layoffs to farmers angry about land confiscation .
But the communist leadership remains wary about large demonstrations , fearing they could snowball into anti-government movements .
The sensitivity is more marked during the Olympics , which China hopes will showcase the country as a modern power .
In July , China said protests would be allowed in three parks far from games venues .
But there were also rules to be followed : Applications with detailed paperwork must be filed five days in advance and protests must not harm " national , social and collective interests . "
A response would be provided 48 hours before the requested rally time , officials promised .
This would make Tuesday the last day anyone could apply for permission to protest during the games .
" The clock is ticking for the Chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so - called protest zones , " said Phelim Kine , an Asia researcher for the New York - based Human Rights Watch .
But Wang Wei , vice president of the Beijing Olympics organizing committee , on Monday defended the protest plan to journalists , some of whom have pressed Olympic officials to show how China has improved human rights as it promised to do while bidding to host the games .
" This is not realistic , " Wang said .
" We think that you do not really understand China 's reality .
China has its own version and way of exercising our democracy . "
Malkin : Slighted 9/11 ' opportunists ' tried to attack the media David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 27 , 2008
Print This Email This Fox News appears to be somewhat disappointed by the absence of violent , or at least disruptive , protests at the Democratic National Convention in Denver .
" We 'd heard that there were going to be anarchists here , the streets were going to be clogged with protests , " Fox 's Steve Doocy complained on Wednesday .
With a note of disappointment in his voice that belied his words , he added , " It 's turned out -- thankfully -- to have been a dud . "
When Fox sent conservative columnist Michelle Malkin on Monday to cover an attempt by protesters to levitate the Denver Mint -- apparently in an ironic tribute to the 1967 attempt by anti-war marchers to levitate the Pentagon -- she herself turned out to be the main attraction .
As Malkin described the event at her own blog , " The protest was an abysmal failure  with a crowd of about 20 profit - bashing protesters far out - numbered by press , bloggers , police , horses , and looky - loos .
I was able to work unimpeded covering the pathetic showing until the Truthers showed up for their YouTube moment .
Desperate to salvage the fizzled demonstration , 9/11 nutball Alex Jones started barking at me and attempting to make a scene and incite a riot . "
" These are people who think the government killed Americans and it was a big conspiracy , " Malkin explained to Fox 's Steve Doocy .
" This guy 's a fringe talk show host , and he showed up at what was supposed to be a peaceful event .
... It turned ugly . "
" Michelle Malkin calls for putting Americans in camps , " yells Jones in a brief clip shown by Fox .
" She 's right over there . "
The full video of Jones confronting Malkin is available at YouTube .
In it , Jones tells her , " It looks like that evil is starting to get to your soul . "
He then continues to yell at her and the Fox cameramen as Malkin flinches away .
Malkin explained to Doocy that " for the most part , Recreate 68 has been a dismal failure .
...
This particular event , which I was there to cover as a blogger , turned out to be a failure , and so opportunists seized the day and tried to make news out of it by attacking the media . "

" [ The Internet ] is not a truck .
It 's a series of tubes . "
- U.S. Senator Ted Stevens
Ah , the Internet : you use it every day for school , work or fun .
In such a short period of time , the Net has grown into an essential every day thing that it 's hard to imagine life without it .
But how much do you know about the Internet ?
Did you know that you have the Soviets to thank for this wonderful invention ?
Or that despite the flack that he got for inventing the Internet , Al Gore actually did play a major role in the creation of the Net ?
Here are the 10 Things You Should Know About the Internet :
1. Sputnik : Kick in the Pants that Launched the Net
In 1957 , the Soviet launched Sputnik ( Russian for " traveling companion " or " satellite " ) , the first man-made object to orbit the Earth .
It was a big surprise to the United States , who feared that it was falling behind technologically against its Cold War enemy .
In direct response to Sputnik , President Dwight D. Eisenhower directed the Department of Defense to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency or ARPA in 1958 .
One of its research programs was headed by Dr. J.C. R. Licklider ( or simply " Lick " ) , who convinced the U.S. Government to create a computer network , which would later evolve into the Internet .
Licklider , in his epic 1963 memo to " Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network " ( Yes , that 's right - " Intergalactic " ) explored the challenges in creating ARPANET , the precursor to today 's Internet .
So , who says war is n't good for anything ?
The Internet is arguably one of the most important technologies that came out of the Cold War .
2. Before The Internet , There Was ARPANET
The logical map of the first 4 nodes of the ARPANET in December 1969 , as sketched by Larry Roberts .
( Image : The Computer History Museum )
In 1969 , after Licklider left ARPA , his successors Ivan Sutherland , Bob Taylor , Larry Roberts and colleagues created the network that would later become the Internet .
The initial ARPANET consisted of four nodes ( or computers called Interface Message Processors , which would later evolve into routers ) located in UCLA , Stanford Research Institute , UC Santa Barbara , and University of Utah :
First ARPANET IMP Log - CSK refers to Charles S. Kline , the very first person ever to login to a remote host via the ARPANET ( Image : The Computer History Museum )
The programmers in Westwood ( UCLA - Ed. ) were to type " log " into their computer , with the SRI computer in Palo Alto filling out the rest of the command , adding " in . "
" We set up a telephone connection between us and the guys at SRI , " Kleinrock recalled .
" We typed the L , and we asked on the phone , ' Do you see the L ? ' ' Yes , we see the L , ' came the response .
We typed the O , and we asked , ' Do you see the O ? ' ' Yes , we see the O . '
Then we typed the G , and the system crashed ! "
They immediately rebooted and this time , ARPANET sprung to life .
( Source )
It would take a couple more years until ARPANET became popular .
Indeed , in 1973 , Bob Bell of Digital Equipment Corporation noted that the NET was a really busy place on Friday nights ( well , geeks will be geeks ! ) :
I remember hearing that there was an ARPANET " conference " on the Star Trek game every Friday night .
Star Trek was a text based game where you used photon torpedos and phasers to blast Klingons .

3. Packet Switching : The Way the Internet Works
We wo n't get too technical here , but the way information travels through the Internet is pretty neat .
Take for instance , how data gets from point A to point B ( say , the text and images from this webpage from the Neatorama servers to your browser ) .
One way to do it is to open a channel from point A to B : data is transmitted in a dedicated circuit until all the data is transfered along the same path .
It 's a pretty fast way to send information , but it comes at a high cost : a dedicated circuit has to remain open until the last bit of data is sent .
This method is called circuit switching and it's the system used by telephone companies .
In the early 1960s , Paul Baran , Donald Davies and Leonard Kleinrock , working independently , came up with a different way to send data .
First , large chunks of data are divided into several small packets that are sent through the network .
Each packet may take a different route to reach its destination .
Once every packet has arrived , then they are re-assembled into the original data .
Packet switching may sound counterintuitive ( it is slower than circuit switching and packets may get lost , thus requiring a re-send ) , but it has its advantages .
For one , because there is no single path of communication , the packets can route themselves to avoid damaged or congested networks .
At the time , U.S. authorities were worried how a computer network would survive a nuclear attack , so when Baran proposed the packet switching method ( he called it the " hot- potato routing " or " distributed communications " - it was Davies that named it " packet switching " ) , the military threw its support for the method .
4. TCP/IP : The Language of the Internet
In 1973 , Vint Cerf ( who is often called the " father of the Internet " ) and Bob Kahn created the TCP / IP suite of communication protocols - basically a language used by computers to talk to each other in a network .
The TCP / IP protocol is so simple that , as an 1990 April Fool 's joke , D. Waitzman of the Internet Engineering Task Force proposed that pigeons be used to carry IP traffic !
A decade later , IP over Avian Carriers was actually implemented by the Bergen Linux user group .
They released 9 packets over a distance of 3 miles and actually got 4 responses ( that 's a packet loss ratio of 55 % and a response time between 3,000 to 6,000 seconds ) .
5. Al Gore Actually Did Create the Internet .
Sort Of .
" Remember America , I gave you the Internet and I can take it away , " joked Al Gore on the Late Show with David Letterman .
Okay , I was being cheeky with that heading .
But here 's the story : During the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election , Al Gore took quite a drubbing for the claim that he " invented " the Internet .
Problem was , Gore made no such claim .
During an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN , Gore was asked how he would distinguish himself from others , and he replied :
During my service in the United States Congress , I took the initiative in creating the Internet .
I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country 's economic growth and environmental protection , improvements in our educational system .
...
Though the term " initiative in creating the Internet " is vague , Gore did quite a bit of legislative work in creating a high - capacity national data network that is a significant part of the Internet .
And do n't forget : though Gore did n't coin it , he did popularize the term " information superhighway . "

6. Father of Spam : Gary Thuerk Sent the First Email Spam
Spamming is an old marketing technique - the very first spam was a dentist advertising his services via telegram in 1864 .
Then , as in now , people who got the unsolicited telegrams got really mad - some even wrote the local newspaper complaining of the advertising tactic .
But when the paper reprinted the telegram , the dentist just got free publicity !
The first email spam was sent by Digital Equipment Corporation 's marketing manager Gary Thuerk in 1978 to 393 recipients on ARPANET .
He was advertising the availability of a new model of DEC computers .
The Wall Street Journal has an interview with Thuerk ( along with a reprint of the original email ) :
From a marketing standpoint , the email was a success :
About 20 people came to each of Thuerk ’s open houses , and he estimates it led to more than $ 12 million in sales .
But the email also earned Thuerk instant notoriety .
“ People started complaining immediately , ” he tells the Business Technology Blog .
Someone from the Rand Corporation sent him a letter telling him he broke the rules of the ARPANET , the Internet ’s predecessor .
( There was an unwritten rule that people would n’t use the ARPANET to sell things ;
Thuerk tells us he only promoted a product . )
A major from the defense communications agency called Thuerk ’s boss and made him promise that Thuerk would never send an email like that again .
Thuerk has embraced his place in history as the father of spam .
It ’s landed him in the Guinness Book of World Records , and he does promotional work for anti-spam companies from time to time .
He says people have one of three reactions when they meet him :
Some are excited to meet someone with an unusual claim to fame ; some want to beat him up on the spot ; and others just avoid him like the plague .

7 . The Sexy Web : 12 % of Websites = Porn !
Grandma 's reaction to 2 girls 1 cup .
If you do n't know what this is all about , consider yourself lucky .
Very lucky .

We can't talk about the web without talking about porn .
The amount of smut available on the Net and our appetite for it are astonishing .
Here are some statistics on porn from Jerry Ropelato of Top Ten Reviews ( who claimed that all of them come from reputable sources )
Pornographic websites : 4.2 million ( 12 % of total websites )
Pornographic pages : 420 million
Daily pornographic search engine requests : 68 million ( 25 % of total search engine requests )
Daily pornographic emails : 2.5 billion ( 8 % of total emails )
Internet users who view porn : 42.7 %
Worldwide visitors to pornographic web sites : 72 million visitors ( monthly )
Internet pornography sales : $ 4.9 billion Every second , 28,258 Internet users are viewing pornography
Every second , 372 Internet users are typing adult search terms into search engines
Statistics from GOOD Magazine :
35 % of all Internet downloads are pornographic in nature
Every day 266 new porn sites appear on the Internet
" Sex " is the most searched word on the Internet
70 % of Internet porn traffic occurs during the 9 - 5 workday
US produced 89 % of all online porn

8 . The Rise of the Blogosphere
Blogs ( short for web logs ) are regularly updated journal published on the Web .
According to Technorati , there are about 112.8 million blogs on the Web right now , with 175,000 new blogs added every day .
That 's about 122 new blogs a minute or 2 blogs a second !
The term " weblog " was coined by John Barger on December 17 , 1997 to describe his website Robot Wisdom that " logged " the links he collected while surfing the Net - as such , his website got the distinction of being the world 's first blog * .
( The contraction " blog , " which arguably became a more popular word , was coined in 1999 by Peter Merholz of Peterme.com who playfully broke up the word into we blog ) .
[ * Note : yes , technically there are blogs that preceded Robot Wisdom , though they were never called " blogs . "
For example , Justin Hall of Justin's Links from the Underground ( now defunct ) started his website in 1994 . ]
Blogging became more popular in 1999 , with the creation of hosted blog tools that made writing for and managing a blog easier ( like Pitas.com , LiveJournal , and Blogger.com )
Today , blogs have become mainstream - newspapers have 'em , corporations have 'em - and heck , even politicians have 'em .
So whatever happened to Jorn Barger , the world 's first blogger ?
Paul Boutin of Wired Magazine wrote about his encounter with Jorn , homeless and broke , on the streets of San Francisco :
Homeless and broke at age 53 , [ Barger ] allowed the domain registration for robotwisdom.com to lapse and can't afford to re-up it .
He has abandoned his Chicago apartment and is staying on Andrew 's floor while he tries to get back on his feet .
He 's looking for work - sort of .
After a few hands - in - pockets attempts at small talk , we give up .
I continue up the hill .
A few weeks later , I find out that Barger has recovered his domain - and Robot Wisdom pops back up online .
I hunt him down for a pint at a local pub and he tells me he 's moving on , this time to Memphis .
He says he avoids the need for a job by living on less than a dollar a day .
" I was carrying a cardboard sign when we met that day , " he tells me .
" I was n't sure if I should show it to you .
I figured if things did n't work out with Andrew I could pick up some change . "
On his panhandler sign , Barger had written : Coined the term ' weblog , ' never made a dime .

9. Surprise !
There 's a Third YouTube Co-Founder
Before there was YouTube , there was ... a dating site called Tune In Hook Up ?!
Yes , that was the first version of YouTube that completely failed ( Source : article by Jim Hopkins at USA Today , from where I shamelessly , um , co-opted the heading ) .
The YouTube we all know and love got started when former Paypal employees Chad Hurley , Steve Chen , and Jawed Karim wanted to share some videos from a dinner party only to realize that the video clip was too huge for email .
Posting the video online was n't easy either - since video websites back then accept some but not all video clip formats .
So the trio went to create YouTube in 2005 - and a little over a year later , the website streamed 100 million videos per day and got 70,000 videos uploaded per day ( roughly 1 per second ) .
It was the fastest growing website in the history of the Internet .
It was estimated that in 2007 , YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 !
Hurley and Chen sold the company to Google for a cool $ 1.65 billion ... so what happened to Jawed ?
He left active role at the company to be a graduate student in computer science before it was sold ( but he did n't leave empty handed - Jawed got about $ 64 million in stocks when YouTube was acquired by Google ) .
Oh , and of course : the first video clip on YouTube was uploaded at 8:27 pm on Saturday April 23rd , 2005 .
It was of Jawed himself ( shot by Yakov Lapitsky ) at the San Diego Zoo :
10 . The Rise of Social Networking and Social Media
In a way , the Web is a big social network .
Even before there was the Web , BBSes served as online communities where people chatted and collaborated .
But the term " social networking " became a buzzword when it was reported in 2005 that MySpace had more pageviews than Google ( Source ) .
But before MySpace , there was Classmates.com ( launched in 1995 ) and SixDegrees.com ( launched in 1997 , dead by 2001 ) .
Afterwards , more successful websites followed : Friendster , MySpace , Orkut , LinkedIn and Facebook .
And how successful were they ?
MySpace was sold to Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. for $ 580 million and Facebook is now valued in the billions of dollars ) .
There 's a social networking website for everybody under the sun : Like movies ?
There 's Flixster .
Online games ?
Avatars United .
Anime ?
Gaia Online .
Books ?
LibraryThing and so on .
( Wikipedia has a huge list of social networking sites here )
On the other side of the new Internet are social media websites .
The term " social media " is kind of a hodgepodge ( Wikipedia , blogs like Neatorama , and videosharing websites like YouTube can all be classified as social media ) .
But all of them have one thing in common : they encourage active interaction and participation of their users .
An interesting subset of the social media websites are social news sites like Digg , reddit and Mixx .
These user - driven websites let people discover and share content on the Internet in a social way : users submit and vote on others ' submissions to determine which links get featured prominently on the websites ' front pages .
But there is a darker - side to social media website .
The " Digg Revolt " on May 1 , 2007 ( remember that ? ) , over the AACS encryption key controversy illustrates how the " social " in social media can be a double - edged sword :
Photo : rtomayko [ Flickr ]
Digg.com has become one of the Web's top news portals by putting the power to choose the news in the hands of its users .
Just how much power they wield , however , only became clear Tuesday night , when Digg turned into what one user called a " digital Boston Tea Party . "
When the site 's administrators attempted to prevent users from posting links to pages revealing the copyright encryption key for HD - DVD discs , Digg 's users rebelled .
Hundreds of references to the code flooded the site 's submissions , filling its main pages and overwhelming the administrators ' attempts to control the site 's content .
( Source )
Ultimately , Digg admins capitulated to its users ' demands and stopped deleting stories with the forbidden codes .
Bonus : Internet ≠ World Wide Web
Most people use Internet ( or Net ) and World Wide Web ( or Web ) interchangeably - but in reality , they 're quite different :
• The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks - these computers exchange data ( hypertext documents like the one you 're reading now , emails , file transfers , and so on ) .
•
The Web is a system of documents linked via hypertext that is accessed via the Internet - so the Web is just a part of the Internet .
The Web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners - Lee ( now Sir Tim Berners - Lee , as he was knighted in 2004 for his contributions to the Web ) while he was working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Geneva , Switzerland .
Sir Berners - Lee was just 34 years old at the time .
( Photo credit : captsolo [ Flickr ] )
Berners - Lee 's very first Web was a project called ENQUIRE ( named after his favorite book : Enquire Within Upon Everything , a 1856 how - to book for domestic life ) .
In 1989 , Berners - Lee and Robert Cailliau wrote a proposal to CERN management about a global information management system to keep track of accelerators and equipments and for scientists to share data .
Berners - Lee originally considered calling it " Information Mesh , " " The Information Mine " ( which was turned down because the acronym TIM is his first name ) , and " Mine of Information . "
He later chose " World Wide Web " when he was writing the code in 1990 .
A client / server model for a distributed hypertext system , as proposed by Sir Tim Berners - Lee
By Christmas of 1990 , Berners - Lee had put together the world 's first Web : a web browser ( written in Objective - C , by the way ) , a web server ( his NeXT cube computer ) and a web page ( yes , that would make it the world 's first web page - archived here on w3 : Link ) .
The first practical use of the Web was a CERN telephone directory , to encourage its employees to it !

The Web is now huge : according DomainTools , there are currently over 103.6 million active domains ( and over 348 million dead ones ) on the World Wide Web .
Last week , Google announced that it has indexed 1 trillion ( as in 1,000,000,000,000 ) web pages ( about 903,000 of which mentioned Neatorama :) ) :
Man choked to death in fairy cake eating competition
Prank : Adam Deeley died cramming five fairy cakes in his mouth
A student choked to death on fairy cakes after trying to fit as many into his mouth as possible as a prank , an inquest heard .
Adam Deeley and his friends had been attending the opening night of a photography exhibition when they began helping themselves to the leftover buffet .
One of the group then put three fairy cakes into his mouth at the same time before another member of the party did the same with four .
The inquest heard that in a bid to outdo his friends Mr Deeley , 34 , then crammed five fairy cakes into his mouth .
Moments later he started choking and collapsed on the floor .
Steven Jenkins , who took part in the contest , told the hearing the cake eating challenge was ' impromptu ' .
He said : ' There was a tray of cakes left over from the buffet - my friend put three cakes in his mouth so I tried four .
' They were small , only an inch and a half across but I struggled with four .
' My friend must have told Adam what we were doing and he put five cakes in his mouth .
' I could see that he was struggling to eat them but then he walked across to the toilets . '
He continued : ' I thought he was wanted to spit them out .
I did n't know he was choking at that point .
' I only realised how serious it was a minute or two later when other people ran to help him . '
Another friend of Mr Deeley , bar manager Daniel Finzelbach , said : ' I realised Adam was in trouble as he walked towards the toilets - his body was convulsing .
' There was cake around his mouth and I could hear and see that he was trying to cough .
I ran to the toilet and started slapping his back as hard as I could . '
The former life guard added : ' Then I tried the Heimlich Manoeuvre but he collapsed on the floor and I called for an ambulance . '
Tragic : Adam starting choking during the contest at the Monkey Cafe Bar in Swansea and was taken to hospital but could not be saved
Adam was rushed to hospital but died of choking due to the cake trapped in his airways .
The tragedy happened at the Monkey Cafe , a bar in Swansea , South Wales , where Adam worked part - time to finance his degree in graphic design .
He was not working on the night of the tragedy but had gone to the venue for the opening of an exhibition by a photographer friend .
The mature student was in the third year of his degree and planned to emigrate to New Zealand after graduating from Swansea University .
Adam was one - and a half - times the drink driving limit on the night of the tragedy .
The inquest heard Mr Deeley came from a ' close family ' but his distraught parents , who live in Birmingham , were too upset to attend the hearing .
PC Stephanie Probert told the hearing that Mr Deeley 's parents last saw their son in December .
She said : ' He was an only child and his parents Sandra and Robert were very proud of him .
His parents last saw him in December when they visited him at university in Swansea .
' He went back to university in September 2005 with the aim of getting a degree so that he could emigrate to New Zealand . '
Recording a verdict of Misadventure , Swansea Coroner Phillip Rogers said : ' Clearly , any activity involving putting large amounts of food in the mouth is dangerous .
' It does not take me to say this sort of thing should be avoided . '
BAINBRIDGE TOWNSHIP --
A woman 's home is her castle , even when teens are drinking in the basement .
An appeals court ruled that Bainbridge Township police should not have entered Phyllis Andrews ' home without a warrant , even though they saw underage drinking , because no emergency existed .
The 11th Ohio Court of Appeals sent the case back to Geauga County Juvenile Court , which had denied Andrews ' request to suppress evidence because the search was invalid .
She was found guilty after pleading no contest to contributing to the delinquency of a minor but her seven - day jail sentence was put on hold pending her appeal .
" The underlying premise is that before you go into someone 's home you need a warrant , " said David Maistros , Andrews ' attorney .
" There are exceptions , such as chasing someone or if some harm is coming to someone in the house .
But in this situation there was no emergency .
Clearly they would have been granted a warrant , but they did not feel like taking the time to do it . "
Geauga County Prosecutor David Joyce will appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court .
" Proper steps were taken by the police and the safety of the juveniles were in question at that point , " he said .
" They were worried the kids could get very sick . "
Police went to Andrews ' home on Lake - in - the - Woods Trail in May 2007 after being called about a loud party .
They saw only beer cans and a burning bonfire in the yard .
When they looked in basement windows they saw about 20 youths with beer cans and cups .
Andrews answered the front door but closed it when asked for identification .
An officer in the back yard noticed the basement was now dark .
About 10 minutes later Andrews , with her driver 's license , opened the door .
A sergeant , without asking permission , pushed past her and entered .
Two judges wrote in the ruling released last week that while Andrews ' actions in overseeing a drinking party were deplorable , police should have gotten a warrant , even if it took hours .
There was no danger because the youths were confined to the house and beer cans and other evidence would not likely be destroyed , they wrote .
Judge Diane Grendell dissented , writing that the youths in the house could be in danger if they drank excessively or tried to escape and drive away .
Seven youths were charged with underage drinking , Maistros said .
Andrews , 44 , could not be reached for comment .
Pearls : a programmers best friend ?
So , I ’m back after a really long hiatus .
This post is part 1 of a series about well known and perhaps not - so - well - known functional pearls .
A Functional Pearl is an elegant , purely functional solution to a problem .
In this post , we ’ll look at the earliest known functional pearl , Christopher Strachey ’s Cartesian product function .
I found this pearl in a paper called “ Strachey ’s functional pearl , forty years on ” by Mike Spivey , and this post is largely based on that paper .
Folds
If you ’ve written any amount of code in a functional programming language , you ’ve come across foldr ( or perhaps foldl ) .
It ’s ubiquitous in the fp world and as natural as say , a for loop in an imperative language .
foldl y [ x1,x2,x3 , ... , xn ] = f( f ( ... f( f( x1 , y ) , x2 ) , ... ) , x_n )
And foldr is the same , but “ from the right ” :
foldr f y [ x1,x2,x3 , ... , xn ] = f( x1 , f( x2 , f ( ... , f( xn , y ) ... ) ) )
Incidentally , a nice way of looking at foldr is : it is the unique solution ( for fixed f and o ) to the equations :
foldr f o [ ] = o foldr f o ( x : xs ) = f x ( foldr f o xs )
One of the things that are so great about languages like Haskell , is that this IS how you define functions .
The above is executable Haskell code that defines foldr !
And God said : let there be foldr …
A bit of history about foldr .
It came as something of a shock to me that foldr was invented ( discovered ? ) , and there was actually a time without a foldr !
Somehow I had always assumed that foldr had been created in the Big Bang along with everything else .
But it appears that there was actually a time when higher order functions like “ map ” were known ( in LISP , for example ) but foldr was n’t .
And although a lot of programmers had probably written their own foldr ’s without realizing it , the discovery of its coolness and universal usefulness can probably be attributed to Christopher Strachey ( I should clarify that the history is actually pretty hazy , so please tell me if you can find an earlier reference )
He ’s probably better known as one of the developers of the CPL programming language ( the great - grandfather of C ) .
But he ’s done a bunch of other things in his career , and among them lies the first functional pearl .
He was investigating foldl and foldr ( although not by that name ) in 1961 ( according to some handwritten notes that were found later ) and began to realize how useful these functions could be .
Then , in 1966 he published a paper giving examples of CPL code written in a functional style .
This paper contained ( among many other things ) a function called cprod , which used foldr .
This is the function that is now widely regarded as the very first “ functional pearl ” .
A X B = ?
The cprod function finds the Cartesian Product of a bunch of sets ( expressed as a list of lists ) .
For example ,
cprod [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 1 ] ] = [ [ 1,2,1 ] , [ 1,3,1 ] , [ 2,2,1 ] , [ 2,3,1 ] ]
These days , several languages let you do this sort of thing with list comprehensions .
For example ,
cprod ( xs:xss ) = [ x :ys | x <- xs , ys <- cprod xss ]
But we will use neither list comprehension nor recursion – just foldr .
To see how , remember what I said about p = foldr f o being the unique solution to :
p [ ] = a p ( x : xs ) = f x ( p xs )
Then for f xs yss = [ x :ys | x <- xs , ys <- xss ] , cprod can be seen as the unique solution to :
cprod [ ] = [ [ ] ] cprod ( xs:xss ) = f xs ( cprod xss )
In fact , cprod = foldr f [ [ ] ] .
Now all we have to do is rewrite the list comprehension f in terms of list primitives alone .
We can do this by expanding each generator in the comprehension as a foldr , giving :
cprod = foldr f [ [ ] ] where f xs yss = foldr ( g yss ) [ ] xs g yss xs xss = foldr ( h x ) xss yss h x ys uss = ( x:ys ) :uss
Beautifying this a little , we get our very first functional pearl !
cprod = foldr f [ [ ] ] where f xs yss = foldr g [ ] xs where g x xss = foldr h xss yss where h ys uss = ( x:ys ) :uss
Next week – zippers !

Judith France and her daughter Holly France - Kremin have been torn about their choice for president ever since Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton lost the Democratic nomination to Senator Barack Obama .
Now Senator John McCain has made up their minds , but in different ways , by his surprise pick of Sarah Palin , the little - known Alaska governor , as his Republican running mate .
“ It made me like McCain a little more , ” said Judith France , 62 , of Thornville , Ohio .
“ They always say he was a maverick , and this made me think , well , he really is .
He went all the way to Alaska  there are n’t that many people up there , they do n’t have that many electoral votes  and he picked this person .
I know people will say she ’s inexperienced .
But she ’s been a governor for 20 months .
That ’s more experience than Obama has . ”
Ms. France - Kremin , 36 , who lives nearby in Dublin , an affluent suburb of Columbus , likewise has qualms about the seasoning of Mr. Obama , a first - term United States senator after eight years as a state senator .
But she also strongly favors abortion rights , and Ms. Palin  more prominently than Mr. McCain  does not .
“ That sealed my decision , ” said Ms. France - Kremin , who added that she would no longer consider voting for Mr. McCain .
A small British company developing a unique form of hovering aircraft says it will soon demonstrate a new and much more serious version of its technology .
Saucer technology in action .
GFS Projects of Peterborough was registered in 2002 , following early efforts by former hovercraft engineer Geoff Hatton to develop a working " flying saucer " aircraft based on the Coanda effect .
( GFS stands for Geoff's Flying Saucers . )
The Reg spoke to GFS marketing chief Mark Broughton this morning , who gave us a run-through on the " Fenstar 50 " autonomous unmanned saucer which the company hopes to have flying in the first half of next year .
Firstly , the Fenstar 50 will be the first GFS saucer to use an internal combustion engine .
Previous craft have been electrically powered , and have suffered from very short endurance .
The current electric saucer , which formed part of Team MIRA at the recent MoD " Grand Challenge " ambush - sniffing tech contest , can normally stay up for just two and a half minutes .
The new Fenstar 50 is expected to manage up to an hour , carrying a payload of 5 kg - a quarter of its all - up weight .
GFS aims to keep the total weight under 20kg , as this is the most that the CAA allows under model aircraft rules .
Any more would take the company into the hugely more onerous certification regime for full - sized aircraft .
Even at 20kg , however , the Fenstar 50 will be significantly bigger and more capable than one of its main rivals , the Micro Air Vehicle ( MAV ) from Honeywell .
The MAV uses a ducted fan rather than a GFS - style Coanda surface , but this offers similar advantages - neither vehicle has projecting helicopter - style rotors .
Both of them can thus fly about happily in between buildings , and perhaps in and out of doors and windows etc .
Both could be very useful as reconnaissance machines for soldiers , especially in dangerous urban combat - indeed Honeywell 's machine has already seen action in Iraq .
The MAV runs on a two - stroke petrol engine like the Fenstar , and offers similar endurance , though it weighs just 7.25 kg and can barely lift a pair of cameras .
The US version .
Overpaid , oversexed , overhead .
GFS ' Broughton reckons the Coanda saucer is better than ordinary ducted fans , being more stable and easily controllable .
According to people who have seen both , the GFS platform offers a " much more stable " video image than the MAV ( GFS received a small tech - demo contract from the US military recently ) .
Broughton was also keen to point out that , while the electric GFS machine did n't actually compete at the MoD Grand Challenge , this was " purely because of bad weather conditions " rather than any technical issue - though admittedly the short endurance might have limited its contribution had it got stuck in .
Asked if he thought GFS could win future military / security business in the States , Broughton said " we 're ever hopeful .
Even a small development deal over there can be $ 10 m , easily - that would be very significant to us .
But the MoD does n't spread that kind of money around to develop new stuff . "
We suggested that sometimes it does , in fact .
Broughton said , " Yes , but we 're not called BAE Systems . "
Another hill for GFS to climb is the issue of autonomous control .
The firm 's saucers , rather than directing air straight down like a ducted fan , instead stream fan air over their curved upper surface .
The fast airflow reduces pressure on the saucer top , allowing the normal air pressure beneath it to push it up .
( Aircraft wings are also curved on top to make use of this effect , but in their case it is not the only factor in play - otherwise planes could never fly upside down . )
The saucer controls rotation and side - to - side motion by means of cunning flaps and fins secured to the outer surfaces .
While Broughton says that the Coanda saucer tech provides a more easily - controlled platform than an ordinary ducted fan , it provides a unique problem for control software .
Systems to let the saucers hover and move about autonomously - requiring no remote piloting - are essential if GFS is to become a serious contender .
Hardware is n't an issue - the necessary actuators etc. are already in place for the remote controls , so Broughton expects no significant weight penalties .
But it wo n't be possible to buy the software off the shelf , as one might with a small helicopter or fixed - wing plane - it will have to be custom built .
For the foreseeable future , GFS saucers seem fated to be unmanned .
But there 's hope for the flying - car fanciers yet .
Asked if`there was any aspiration to scale the tech up to manned versions , Broughton emphatically replied : " Yes .
In fact if you ask our chairman he'd say that 's one of the reasons he 's involved . "
The jury 's still out on whether Hatton 's Coanda saucers are actually better than ducted fans - or indeed whether either will ever be mainstream flight technologies .
But you have to like GFS for being willing to try something new .
Rather than producing a duplicate rival to the Honeywell MAV and similar machines , they are offering altogether different technology which might actually be superior - breaking new ground rather than playing catch - up .
One has to say that it would make sense for the MoD to put some of its scarce R&D funds GFS ' way - rather than giving BAE Systems plc huge , undisclosed sums to play catch - up and reinvent American wheels , as it 's doing right now . ®
Last Saturday and Sunday , Seattle 's Myrtle Edwards Park , a mile - long strip of land fronting Puget Sound just north of downtown , once again played host to the Seattle Hempfest .
And once again , the Hempfest lived up to its reputation as the world 's largest marijuana " protestival . "
With a core staff of around a hundred , led by the indefatigable Vivian McPeak , and about a thousand volunteers who worked to set up the event , keep it running smoothly , and tear it all down at the end of the weekend , Hempfest is not only a celebration of cannabis culture but also the living embodiment of the grassroots cooperative activism that has flourished for years in Seattle .
From its beginnings as a small pro-hemp event 17 years ago , Hempfest has become the coming out party for America 's cannabis nation , which in Seattle includes not only youthful stoners , wizened hippies , and Mr. Bong Head ( a guy wearing a working bong contraption on his head ) , but punks , Goths , ravers , uncostumed twenty - and thirty - somethings , families with children in strollers , and -- the biggest cannabis celebrity in town -- travel writer Rick Steves .
Steves once again called for the US to follow the lead of Europe in relaxing marijuana laws .
Over the event 's two - day span , an estimated 150,000 + people showed up to see and be seen , listen to four stages worth of live music , peruse the hundreds of vendors ' stands for the newest technologies and best buys on glass pipes , t- shirts , hemp items , and other pot-related accoutrements and accessories .
And to get high in public with their comrades .
Seattle police have for years now had an accommodation with Hempfest , even more so since the city 's voters told law enforcement very clearly in 2003 that marijuana should be the city 's lowest law enforcement priority .
Police were on the scene , patrolling the park 's sidewalks in pairs , but appeared oblivious to the open pot-smoking going on all over the place .
In effect , Hempfest is not only the largest marijuana protestival in the world , it is also a massive act of civil disobedience .
Even though Seattle has its lowest priority policy and Washington state has decriminalized pot possession , marijuana use and possession is still against the law .
As one speaker addressed the crowd , pointing out this fact and telling listeners that despite all the progress they had made , they were still criminals , the crowd responded with an enormous cheer .
The only real tension at Hempfest occurred when a small group of sign - holding fundamentalist preachers berated the passing crowds , telling them they were going to hell for their sins .
That sparked occasional heated discussions .
At one point Saturday , Hempfest organizers were heard threatening to send a squad of transgender people to scare off the fanatics .
Some Hempfest attendees took a break from browsing , shopping , and listening to music to actually listen to between - band speeches by activists calling for further marijuana law reform .
While decriminalization and legalization were predictably common themes , this year 's Hempfest emphasized two other issues :
The promotion of hemp and the battle over Washington state 's medical marijuana law , especially the ongoing fight over what are appropriate quantities of marijuana allowable for patients .
The state is currently tangling with patients and advocates over what constitutes a minimum 60 - day supply of their medicine .
An earlier proposal called for 35 ounces of marijuana , but Gov. Christine Gregoire sought a review of that , and the state is now recommending a 24 - ounce limit .
Besides between - band speeches , political activism also took place throughout Hempfest at the Hemposium tent , although in an indication of the role politics played in the larger festival , crowds in the tent numbered in the dozens , as opposed to the tens of thousands listening to music .
" Every single patient I know will not be in compliance with the 60 - day rule .
It 's not going to work .
It 's driven by law enforcement , not science , " said Douglas Hiatt , a lawyer who represents medical - marijuana users , as he spoke at one of the Hemposium sessions .
Hiatt was among the activists calling on patients and supporters to come out for an August 25 action in support of higher limits .
But for most Hempfest attendees , the event was a party , a celebration , not a political seminar .
While that may be a disappointment to activists , it is also a demonstration of the breadth and scope of Pacific Northwest cannabis culture .
It has gone mainstream , with all the apolitical apathy abundant in the broader culture .
And if Hempfest was a little too mellow for your taste , you could always check out Methfest , not a celebration of amphetamine culture but a scary rock music show put on in nearby Belltown .
At the request of theatrical film makers , the Federal Communications Commission on Friday quietly launched a proceeding on whether to let video program distributors remotely block consumers from recording recently released movies on their DVRs .
The technology that does this is called Selectable Output Control ( SOC ) , but the FCC restricts its use .
The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) wants a waiver on that restriction in the case of high - definition movies broadcast prior to their release as DVDs .
" The Petitioners ' theatrical movies are too valuable in this early distribution window to risk their exposure to unauthorized copying , " MPAA wrote to the FCC last month .
" Distribution over insecure outputs would facilitate the illegal copying and redistribution of this high value content , causing untold damage to the DVD and other ' downstream ' markets . "
Less than a month after the request , the FCC has given MPAA a public comment period on the question that will last through July 7 .
Expedited distribution — with one , big caveat
MPAA has pressed its Petition for Expedited Special Relief on behalf of Paramount Pictures , Sony Pictures , Twentieth Century Fox , Universal City Studios Walt Disney Studios , and Warner Brothers .
How did these media companies get an FCC proceeding so fast ?
Ars bets that hiring former FCC Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy as their attorney helped .
Abernathy supported former FCC Chair Michael Powell 's drastic relaxation of the agency 's media ownership rules in 2003 , along with Kevin Martin , now head of the agency .
Movies go through a timeline of staged releases that lasts about three years .
First they go to theaters ; 60 days after that they start showing up in airplanes and hotels ; in 120 days from their theatrical release they transfer to DVD and Internet download ; about a month later to video on demand / pay - per- view ; by the end of the year to premium subscription systems like HBO and Showtime ; and eventually to basic cable and free TV .
MPAA says these studios want to release their movies to multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs ) " significantly earlier and prior to DVD release " — although the trade groups ' filing wo n't say exactly how much sooner .
But in exchange for the accelerated service , MPAA wants permission to obtain SOC blocking of recording capabilities .
The group promises that once said movies have reached the home video sale / rental stage , the blocking will stop .
The movie lobby wants a waiver from FCC rules prohibiting MVPDs from adding code to digital video streams , that , among other restrictions , could block copying .
Here is the rule : " A covered entity shall not attach or embed data or information with commercial audiovisual content , or otherwise apply to , associate with , or allow such data to persist in or remain associated with such content , so as to prevent its output through any analog or digital output authorized or permitted under license , law or regulation governing such covered product . "
MPPA notes that the Commission did say in 2003 that it would consider adjusting this policy around SOC .
" We nonetheless recognize that selectable output control functionality might have future applications that could potentially be advantageous to consumers , " MPAA observes that the FCC declared in a late 2003 Report and Order , " such as facilitating new business models . "
We 're here to help
MPAA argues that , in addition to getting first - run movies to the public sooner , giving movie studios a break on this issue could also aid the DTV transition .
The enhanced service " will encourage the purchase of HDTV sets by consumers , and thereby ensure that a greater number of citizens have the necessary equipment to receive broadcast digital programming by February 17 , 2009 . "
But unquoted in MPAA 's petition is this passage from the same FCC Report and Order : " We also recognize consumers ’ expectations that their digital televisions and other equipment will work to their full capabilities , and the potential harm to the DTV transition if those expectations are frustrated , " the Commission observed .
" In particular , we are concerned that selectable output control would harm those ' early adopters ' whose DTV equipment only has component analog inputs for high definition display , placing these consumers at risk of being completely shut off from the high - definition content they expect to receive . "
Needless to say , this proposal is likely to get a very cold reception from groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
EFF already warns that SOC and " down resolution " — strategically lowering the level of digital quality — could undermine HDTV .
" Many current and novel devices rely on unrestricted outputs , particularly component analog connections , " EFF says .
Not surprisingly , the Home Recording Rights Coalition ( HRRC ) opposes SOC too .
" In the long term , imposition of SOC could have the effect of driving from the market any home interface that supports home recording , " the group observes .
Fears that MPAA 's proposal represents a foot in the door to much wider interference with consumer digital applications may also play a role in this discussion .
The FCC wants comments and oppositions to MPAA 's proposal by June 25 and replies to comments by July 7 .

Call for web to stay open for all
The success of the web has been due to its openness , said Sir Tim Governments , scientists and businesses must do more to ensure the web stays open for all , says Sir Tim Berners - Lee .
The web pioneer made the call while announcing a partnership between the Web Science Research Initiative ( WSRI ) and the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts ( NESTA ) .
The WSRI is studying how the web is growing and is seeking ways to make the most of its potential .
The partnership comes as BT announces sponsorship of the research initiative .
" The development of the Web will have major social , economic and political implications for our future , " said Sir Tim .
" At its core must be a commitment to maintain the principles of openness as a platform for the sharing of information , " he added .
The WSRI was co-created by MIT and the University of Southampton and aims to understand the forces underpinning the success of the web and how those guiding principles can be preserved and enhanced .
The WSRI and Nesta partnership has been set up to look at ways to ensure the web stays open and easy to use .
It will also consider ways the UK can capitalise on the rapid growth of the web .
Nesta announced its initial support for the WSRI in May 2008 when it said it would provide cash to help the new organisation get going .
The fresh injection of money by telecoms giant BT will be used to get the projects research programme under way .
BT has not disclosed how much money it has given to the project .

What are these ?
Far right groups in Switzerland have collected enough signatures to force a nationwide referendum on banning minarets , the distinctive towers of Islamic architecture .
In what is being seen as a sign of growing Islamophobia in Europe , more than 100,000 Swiss citizens signed a petition to halt the construction of minarets .
Under Switzerland 's direct democracy rules , that level of support is enough to trigger a referendum .
The Swiss interior ministry today confirmed a vote would take place , without setting a date .
The petition was launched by Ulrich Schlüer an MP from the controversial Swiss People 's party , which was accused of racist campaigning last year .
In a bid to get immigrants ' families deported if their children had been convicted of violent crime , the party ran an advertising campaign showing three white sheep on a Swiss flag kicking out a black sheep with the caption : " For more security . "
The president of Switzerland , Pascal Couchepin , said the government would recommend that voters rejected the proposed minaret ban .
The organisers of the petition argue that the minarets , which are used on mosques , are a symbol of political and religious claims to power , not just a religious sign .
Schlüer said last year : " We 've got nothing against prayer rooms or mosques for the Muslims .
But a minaret is different .
It 's got nothing to do with religion ; it 's a symbol of political power . "
If Schlüer 's camp wins the referendum , the Swiss parliament must pass a law enshrining a minaret construction ban in the constitution .
Opponents say such a ban would violate religious freedom .
More than 310,000 of Switzerland 's 7.5 million population are Muslims , according to the federal statistical office .
The UN expert on racism , Doudou Diene , has said the campaign is evidence of an " ever - increasing trend " toward anti-Islamic actions in Europe .
It is similar to a law that was introduced by perma- tanned media tycoon Mr Berlusconi , 71 , when he was last in office , and which was later overturned by Italy 's constitutional court .
Tibet protester Lucy Fairbrother took on the might of China - and won .
Here she explains how ...
Alone and thousands of miles from the comforts of her cosy £ 1 million middle - class home in genteel Cambridge , Lucy Fairbrother bit her lip and trembled as the Chinese police interrogators bore down on her and started bawling in her face .
‘ Who is your ringleader ... who paid for you to come here ? ’ they demanded .
During a 12 - hour ordeal Lucy was subjected to a torrent of hundreds of questions , shuddering as a policeman ’s fist thudded , again and again , on to the top of the table she was sitting at , and being warned that her refusal to co-operate would land her in deep trouble .
At one stage a woman interrogator was brought in and , after another barrage of questions , screamed at Lucy : ‘ Are you plotting with the Dalai Lama ? ’
Safely home : Lucy Fairbrother back in London last week
Yet the shy 23 - year - old Classics graduate refused to crack – confident in the knowledge that this panic - stricken reaction by the Beijing authorities only proved that the spectacularly audacious – yet typically British – protest she had helped stage on the eve of the Olympics opening ceremony had been a complete success .
Ultimately , her punishment was deportation – but she left in her wake huge embarrassment for the Chinese authorities by highlighting the Tibetan cause and also raised doubts about their reassurances that security around the Olympic venues had been strengthened amid fears of a possible terror attack .
Sitting opposite her in a London hotel , it is immediately obvious that Lucy Fairbrother is not your average political activist .
With her slight frame , impeccable manners and quiet , well spoken tones , she appears so non-confrontational she would struggle to ask for sugar in her tea .
Yet last week , with the eyes of the world upon her , Lucy , along with three other demonstrators , managed to make a mockery of security arrangements at the Olympic Stadium in Beijing and display Tibetan flags and a banner proclaiming ‘ One World , One Dream , Free Tibet ’ from 120 ft - tall lighting poles .
Inspired : Lucy in Tibet in 2004
‘ Of course it was scary , and very surreal – I would n’t be human if I had n’t been scared , ’ she says calmly in her first in - depth interview about the protest .
‘ Being separated from my friends and shouted at again and again by agitated Chinese police who banged hard on the table in front of me when I would n’t answer was not an experience anyone would enjoy .
But overall , the protest was fantastically successful .
It gained us more attention than we could possibly have dreamed of , so I ’d repeat it in a heartbeat . ’
For Lucy , a highly articulate and thoughtful young woman , this week ’s protest was the culmination of a passion for Tibet and its people which first manifested itself when she was a teenager .
It is a passion that has been encouraged by her parents , Linda , 58 , a journalist , and Jeremy , 69 , a retired former director of Barings bank and bursar of Trinity College , Cambridge .
Indeed , they instilled a belief in activism in her and her siblings , Edmund , 19 , and Laura , 24 .
Lucy says : ‘ Both my parents believe in standing up for what they believe in and from a very early age I was taught to question the world , think critically and then try to do what I can to change things .
At our house , there were always newspapers around and every mealtime led to a lively debate .
We had it drummed into us that we were very fortunate but that others elsewhere in the world were not and that if we could help , we should .
‘ My mum runs media training courses for student activists and knows a lot of my activist friends . ’
As a child , Lucy went to the exclusive Leys School in Cambridge but switched to a local sixth - form college to do A - levels – and it was at Hills Road College that she discovered the pressure group Students for a Free Tibet .
Pole position : Lucy 's fellow protester Iain
Thom unfurls their banner
‘ I ’ve always been interested in world politics , but the Tibetan cause captured my attention more than anything else .
‘ When I first learned about the terrible abuses of human rights by the Chinese government in Tibet I felt I had to help .
Through the group I met Tibetans who told me about the destruction of the monasteries and temples , the Tibetans imprisoned and tortured and the lack of basic freedoms .
‘ Before I went to university I spent 15 days in Tibet , and thought it was the most beautiful country I had ever visited .
I found the people very inspiring – dignified and committed to non-violence , but very strong , too . ’
At Bristol University , Lucy ran her own group named Coalition for Tibet , through which she organised demonstrations in front of the Chinese Embassy in London , marches , speaking tours for victims of oppression and parties to celebrate Tibetan culture .
After graduating she moved to London and found freelance work as a researcher and a web designer .
She continued her activism and , like many others , realised that the impending Olympics would be the ideal time to draw attention to the Tibetan cause .
She says : ‘ I really hoped that the Olympics would force China to stay true to its promises to clean up its human rights records , because it would be in the world ’s spotlight .
I hoped that Tibet would benefit from that .
‘ Unfortunately , it just has n’t happened .
The situation in Tibet has worsened , especially since March , when there were a series of protests and many people were arrested . ’
Safely home : Lucy shares an emotional reunion with her mother as she arrives back in Britain
Deciding that the Chinese authorities were using the Games as a propaganda opportunity and merely pretending to be in dialogue with the Dalai Lama , Lucy took part in the protests during the Olympic torch procession through London – and began to plan the assault on Beijing itself .
Lucy and three fellow members of Students for a Free Tibet – Iain Thom , 24 , from Edinburgh , and Americans Phil Bartell , 34 , and Tirian Mink , 32 – spent the past two months planning the action down to the final detail in hundreds of emails and several phone conversations .
All that remained was to tell her parents – and she was delighted by their typically enthusiastic response .
‘ They were n’t surprised at all , and said they were proud of me , but told me to take care of myself and come back safely , ’ she says .
On July 29 , Lucy flew to Beijing .
‘ We carried the material to make our banners in our luggage , concealed inside jumpers .
I was incredibly nervous as I went through airport security but I was n’t searched and they let me through fine . ’
She and her three co-conspirators travelled separately and then booked into separate hotels in the Chinese capital .
She says : ‘ We ’d heard that there would be 100,000 plain - clothed informants in the city and that there would be surveillance cameras everywhere .
We were warned that even our hotel rooms could be bugged , so we avoided discussing our plans over the phone .
‘ Instead , we spotted a huge lake with people paddling about on it using pedalos , so we decided to use the pedalos and have our discussions in the centre of the lake . ’
The four each made their banners in their respective hotel rooms and made several trips to the Olympic Stadium to discover the best spot to stage their protest .
They settled on two lighting poles outside the ‘ Bird ’s Nest ’ Stadium and agreed on the date and time : 5.30 am on Wednesday , August 6 , when they hoped security would be at its most lax .
Lucy recalls : ‘ That morning , I felt slightly nervous , but mostly excited .
I could n’t believe we were actually going ahead , after all the planning .
‘ We met at the agreed time and Iain and I – Team GB – went one way towards our pole while the Americans went towards theirs .
‘ When we thought we were safe , Iain started to climb up .
My job was to remain at the bottom , relay information to him via our radios and try to keep the situation calm when the police inevitably turned up . ’
Their tactics took the Chinese completely by surprise and the group managed to display Tibetan flags and three 140sq ft banners .
One banner parodied the official slogan of the Games , ‘ One World , One Dream ’ , by adding ‘ Free Tibet ’ , while another read ‘ Tibet will be free ’ .
But within minutes of Iain climbing the pole , security guards arrived .
Lucy says : ‘ Almost straight away , we saw security guards using their walkie - talkies to call for the police .
' A small group of local people had gathered and I chatted to them , explaining what we were doing .
When the police arrived I used one of the locals , who spoke decent English , to try to reassure them that our protest was peaceful .
I felt very calm , even though there were about six police cars surrounding us by the end . ’
Eventually a fire truck with a cherry - picker platform arrived to get Iain down but by then he had been up his pole for about an hour and a half and had even managed to conduct Press interviews using his mobile phone – ensuring their protest received worldwide attention .
The group of four were taken to a conference centre and put in a room together .
But with a guard standing over each of them , they were unable to communicate with one another .
Lucy says : ‘ They asked me who the ringleader was and I did n’t feel it was right to answer as it might endanger one of the others .
They seemed agitated and they took me into another room , on my own .
At that point , I was scared , but I tried to focus on the fact that whatever was happening to me was nothing compared to what some of my Tibetan friends had been through . ’
Over the next five hours , several different officers asked her hundreds of questions , some of which she answered and some which she chose not to .
She says : ‘ A lot of it was totally surreal .
They asked me if I was a friend of the Dalai Lama , and wanted to know who had paid for my ticket .
It was obvious they thought I was part of some sort of conspiracy masterminded by him .
They asked me where I had got my opinions from regarding Tibet .
‘ At times , a woman was interrogating me and shouting in my face .
At others , it was a man who banged hard on the desk in front of me if I did n’t answer .
They kept telling me that my friends had told them what they wanted to know and it was only me who was being difficult so I would find myself in a lot of trouble .
‘ I was becoming more and more exhausted , but held my nerve and just waited for it to be over .
Eventually , they took me back to the others .
' When we compared notes , it seemed I had been treated worst – perhaps because I ’m a woman and they were hoping I ’d crack and tell them something by mistake .
We were held for another few hours , all together , before Iain and I were escorted to the airport and on to a plane to Frankfurt .
By that point , we were very relieved to be going home . ’
Lucy holds aloft the Tibetan flag as she receives a rapturous welcome on her return from China
When the pair made it back to London the following day , the reception they received was overwhelming .
Not only did they find themselves at the centre of a media storm , but many of Lucy ’s friends – including some Tibetan ones – and her mother and sister had turned out to welcome her home .
‘ My mum gave me a big hug and told me she was really proud , ’ she says .
‘ It was then that I felt elated .
I ’d really done it and managed to get all this attention too .
It was amazing . ’
Now , Lucy hopes that despite the security , some other brave protesters will seize the opportunity provided by the Olympics to continue to drive home the Tibetan message .
‘ If we could do it , I ’m sure someone else will be able to , ’ she says .
‘ I ’ll be watching avidly . ’
And then , with typical British humility , this most unlikely activist says : ‘ Now I ca n’t wait to go back to obscurity . ’

Democratic convention to highlight ' real people ' Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008
Print This Email This By NEDRA PICKLER , Associated Press Writer
CHICAGO ( AP ) --
An Indiana railroader , an Iowa mother and a Michigan truck driver are getting a moment at the Democratic convention to help portray Barack Obama as the people 's champion and counter GOP characterizations of him as an out - of - touch celebrity .
The idea is for these " real people , " as the campaign calls them , to share personal stories about why they are supporting the Democratic presidential candidate and how they think he will help folks like them and the more than 20 million expected to be watching the convention at home .
Their prime - time speeches , combined with the convention 's move to the much larger , 75,000 - seat Invesco Field at Mile High football stadium in Denver for Obama 's acceptance speech , are designed to portray his campaign as a vast movement for change bringing in Americans from all walks of life .
The four - day convention starts Monday .
" This convention in Denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines , across geographic divides , because they believe in change , " said Obama spokeswoman Anita Dunn .
She said they will try to contrast the gathering with a GOP convention , to be held the following week , that will be limited to party insiders .
One risk of moving to Invesco Field is that images of a stadium full of cheering supporters could fuel GOP attacks on Obama as the world 's biggest celebrity and someone not serious about leading the country .
The speeches by more than 20 people can counter that perception by helping Obama appear concerned with their everyday struggles .
" His message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people , " said Candi Schmieder of Marengo , Iowa , a scheduled speaker who said she was turned off by presidential politics until this year because of all " the game playing . "
Her speech on opening night , along with Obama 's wife , Michelle , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , will be before about 20,000 people at the Pepsi Center , and the millions watching at home .
" My voice shakes when I speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting , " said Schmieder , a city council member who turned down the campaign 's offer to fly her to Denver because she wanted to drive in with her 11 - year - old daughter .
The convention marks the beginning of the fall campaign , when many voters start to pay attention and will tune in to learn more about Obama .
Organizers want voters to see someone they can envision as president , looking out for their concerns .
Obama has an extra challenge since he is expected to become the first black nominee of a major party , the subject of racism and smear campaigns questioning his background and patriotism .
A goal of the convention is to describe his American story , his family roots and his understanding of real - people challenges .
The real people can talk about economic struggles from a personal perspective and why they see Obama as their champion , drawing a contrast with GOP candidate John McCain .
The Obama campaign portrays McCain as promising more of the same in Washington .
Mike Fisher , an Amtrak machinist from Beech Grove , Ind. , will talk about Obama 's visit to his house for a lunch of Subway sandwiches .
" When I saw that motorcade come down the cul - de - sac , I could n't speak , I could n't swallow .
Within a couple minutes , he put us at so much ease , " Fisher said .
" I 'm just a poor railroader .
I 've got a small house , and a family I 'm trying to raise .
Barack and Michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing . "
He jokes that his family is the " whole ball of wax " when it comes to Obama 's campaign platform - he worries about job security , with Amtrak facing tough financial times ; two of his children are struggling to pay college loans ; his son has a new baby and no health insurance ; and his son - in - law is in the National Guard facing possible deployment to Iraq .
Other speakers were chosen because of their circumstances , and their residency in targeted battleground states for the fall campaign .
- Pamella Cash - Roper and her husband , of Pittsboro , N.C. , are unemployed due to health problems and can't afford gas to leave the house much .
- Xiomara Rodriguez , of Reno , Nev. , served in the U.S. Coast Guard and is concerned about veterans affairs .
- Beth Robinson , of Chesapeake , Va. , has multiple sclerosis and , as the wife of a Marine who has served repeated tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , is concerned about the housing market 's decline on their future relocations and being a single parent when her husband is deployed .
- Roy Gross , a truck driver from Taylor , Mich. , is a single father to a college - age daughter .
During the weekend , the campaign formally invited these people to the convention , providing airfare , lodging and great seats to watch Obama accept the nomination from a circular stage on the 50 - yard line at Invesco Field .
The real people and delegates attending their first convention will be among the roughly 300 people sitting directly around the stage .
Professional speechwriters are helping prepare their remarks , timed to about three minutes each .
And just like any senator or other VIP speaker , an assigned staff member will oversee their schedules and logistical movements , including media interviews , speech coaching and on - stage rehearsals .
Real people also will be featured at an event Tuesday alongside Michelle Obama and the nation 's female Democratic governors to talk about the economic problems facing women .
Besides " real people , " Obama 's campaign and the convention committee on Tuesday announced more names who will speak at the convention , including former President Carter ; Sen .
John Kerry , the 2004 presidential nominee ; various Democratic senators and governors , and union leaders .
Perle returns to the scene of the crime
Former Bush administration official seeks cut of Iraqi oil deal
By Tom Eley
4 August 2008
Richard Perle , the “ neocon ” defense analyst who played an outspoken role in building the fraudulent case for the invasion of Iraq , is now poised to take a position with a private oil firm working in Iraq and Kazakhstan , according to a Wall Street Journal report .
Documents and informants reveal that Perle has held discussions with members of the Kurdistan regional government about oil drilling contracts in northern Iraq .
The Kurdish regional government has been handing out lucrative contracts to international concerns in violation of Iraqi national sovereignty , bypassing the Iraqi central government and not awaiting the Washington - crafted national oil law that is expected to be pushed through in the coming months .
According to the Journal , the deal “ would involve a tract called K18 , near the Kurdish city of Erbil ....
A consortium founded by Turkish company AK Group International is seeking rights to drill there , the documents say .
Potential backers include two Turkish companies as well as Kazakhstan , according to individuals involved . ”
The Houston - based Endeavour International would then ultimately operate the K18 field .
Involved in the discussions are members of a pro-Turkish lobbying group , the American Turkish Council .
Other players include Alexander Mirtchev , described by the Journal as “ a Washington consultant and adviser to the government of Kazakhstan . ”
Perle has been an outspoken backer of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev , who is under investigation in the US for oil company bribery from the 1990s .
Perle has hailed the corrupt Nazarbayeve as “ visionary and wise . ”
Perle offered only a half - denial to the Wall Street Journal story , claiming in an e-mail that he is “ not involved in any consortium involving Mr. Mirtchev .... ”
But he did not deny his involvement in private oil concerns in Iraq or Kazakhstan .
Perle is not the only one profiting from the Kurdish regional government ’s readiness to sign no -bid contacts .
Hunt Oil , another Texas firm that has close ties with President Bush , last year was awarded a contract with the Kurds in apparent contravention of both Iraqi and US policy , a deal now under State Department investigation after protests by the Iraqi central government .
( See “ Bush - linked Texas company signs oil deal with Iraqi Kurds ” )
Prior to the invasion of Iraq , Richard Perle headed the Defense Policy Advisory Board , which played a critical role within the Bush administration in providing the bogus rationales for the invasion .
He is a member of numerous right - wing and pro-Israeli think tanks , and has been an important figure in foreign policy circles with close ties to the right - wing Israeli establishment since his days as an office staffer for the anticommunist Democratic Senator Henry “ Scoop ” Jackson in the 1970s .
Just days after 9/11 , Perle was busy attempting to link Saddam Hussein to Al Queda , and thus realize his long - standing objective of a full US invasion of Iraq .
On September 16 , 2001 , Perle claimed on CNN that “ even if we cannot prove to the standards that we enjoy in our own civil society that they were involved , we do know , for example , that Saddam Hussein has ties to Osama Bin Laden .... ”
In the lead - up to the invasion of Iraq , Perle launched attacks on the CIA for what he perceived to be a too - critical attitude toward the claims of Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress .
This is by no means the first instance in his career in which Perle has been accused of peddling influence to non-US entities and governments .
In March 2003 , the New York Times discovered that Perle had been contracted by a telecommunications multinational with extensive US military and security contracts — Global Crossing — to assuage FBI and Pentagon opposition to its self - sale to a Chinese corporation .
Perle was to receive $ 125,000 for his work and another $ 600,000 upon the deal ’s successful completion .
After accusations of bribery , Perle resigned , but remained on the board of Global Crossing .
As assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration , Perle helped to secure weapons purchases from an Israeli company that had paid him $ 50,000 in consulting fees .
Veteran journalist Seymour Hersh claimed in a 2003 article that Perle had extensive financial ties to the Saudi royal family .
Perle responded by denouncing Hersh as a “ terrorist . ”
That an individual such as Perle may assume a lucrative position with a corporation exploiting Iraq ’s vast oil wealth serves as a stark reminder of the predatory and imperialist character of the war , which has left well over 1 million Iraqis dead , several million more displaced , and an entire society destroyed .
The US invasion of Iraq stands as one of the bloodiest crimes of modern history .
Now , one of the war ’s chief architects appears set to cash in on the destruction .
Perle was a champion , along with Bush himself and prominent members of the media establishment such as Thomas Friedman , of the lie that the invasion was about bringing “ freedom ” to the people of Iraq and the Middle East .
War proponents have always claimed that the invasion had nothing to do with oil .
No doubt the propagandists would have us believe that Perle ’s forthcoming payday is entirely incidental .
The episode also demonstrates the incestuous and mercenary character of the geostrategic politics that determine the fate of millions .
Perle stands to benefit handsomely from his connections with the Washington foreign policy and military establishment .
But he is also being used by powerful corporate interests in Houston and Turkey , as well as corrupt government officials in Kazakhstan and the Kurdish regional government , in order to further their own aims .
These criminal and wholly parasitic machinations do nothing to benefit the people of Kurdistan , Iraq or the US .
Perle , along with other Bush administration officials and their accomplices in the Democratic Party , deserve to stand trial as war criminals .
Perle ’s oil dealings shows , however , that the crime against Iraq is still under way , and brazenly so .
Barack in Berlin Debate over Germany Trip Leaves Team Obama Frustrated
Cheering is guaranteed at Barack Obama 's speech in Berlin on Thursday , but his campaign is still frustrated and nervous .
His appearance in the German capital will be a major test for Obama -- and 40 American journalists will be there to report any faux pas he makes back to the US .
He has shared everything for most of his scuffled life , from twin beds to sofa cushions to last bites .
It only made sense , then , that when he stunningly won an Olympic gold medal in freestyle wrestling Tuesday , the Los Angeles - born son of undocumented Mexican immigrants would also share .
With his most beloved piece of cloth .
The American flag .

Oh , what a pair they made , young Henry Cejudo and Old Glory , dancing cloth - to - cheek across the floor of a gym that rocked and roared in disbelief .
That flag gave a chance to a kid who paid for wrestling by selling tamales on the street .
That kid now held it tight as he dropped to the mat and dissolved in tears .
“ I ’m living the American dream , ” said Cejudo , 21 .
“ The United States is the land of opportunity , and I ’m so glad I can represent it . ”
The flag gave his mother a chance to raise six children on menial wages in countless apartments from Los Angeles to Las Cruces , N.M. , to Phoenix .
The son now flapped it across his back like a cape , as if showing the world how it had enabled him to fly .
Advertisement
“ The U.S.A. is the best country in the world because it allows you to express yourself in whatever you can do best , ” said his brother Alonzo , watching from the stands .
“ Wrestling is just Henry ’s way . ”
That flag gave a high school education to a kid too poor to celebrate Christmas , then gave that kid a chance to become an Olympian even after he finished 31st in last year ’s world championships .
The kid now wore the flag around the gym like an expensive new coat , and later refused to take it off .
“ I do n’t want to let it go , man , ” Cejudo said about an hour after his 55 - kg victory over Japan ’s Tomohiro Matsunaga .
“ I might just sleep with this . ”
The tiny , bushy - haired champion smiled a huge smile , his face a strange mixture of tears and welts and happiness , and it was then he was reminded America had one more thing to give him .

For winning the gold medal , he will be awarded bonuses and donations equaling $ 65,000 .
“ I ’m rich ! ” he screamed .
No , it was the rest of us who were rich , witnessing a moment that could only happen at the Olympics and , yes , perhaps only in America .
“ This is unreal , ” said Frank Saenz , his Phoenix - area high school coach who was weeping with others in the stands .
“ Such a big country . . . how does this happen ? ”
Advertisement
How , indeed ?
Born in 1987 in South Los Angeles to two undocumented Mexican immigrants , Cejudo faced the same long odds encountered by thousands in his neighborhood .
When he was 4 , his parents separated and his mother moved his family to New Mexico .
Two years later , his single mom moved the family to Phoenix .
With only one couch in his living room , and at least one or two siblings in his bed until he was 17 , there was n’t much .
“ So we took off the couch cushions and used them to fight , ” said Alonzo , Cejudo ’s brother .
“ We were like ‘ American Gladiators . ’ ”

Soon the fighting moved to the gym , where Cejudo and his older brother Angel became high school stars .
When Angel moved to the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs , Colo. ,
Henry followed , even though he was just a high school junior at the time .
It immediately provided him the one thing he thought he had been missing .
“ I finally had my own bed , ” he said .
“ But I was lonely in it . ”
His father died of heart failure in Mexico City after a long battle with drugs , and Henry could n’t make it to the funeral .
He won championships while still in high school , but matured slowly after that , and there were times it seemed he would fail his potential .
Advertisement
“ He could be in prison , he could be a drug dealer , he could be a lot of things , ” said his coach , Terry Brands .
But an Olympic champion ?
“ Nobody believed but us , ” Angel said .
He was knocked out of the first round of last year ’s world championships , weeping in defeat .
Advertisement
He needed a late comeback to win the Olympic trials .
He needed to drop 10 pounds just to make weight Tuesday .
Then , once his long wrestling day began , he needed to come back to win all three of his preliminary matches .
By the time he reached the finals , he was a little tired , a little sad , but plenty inspired .
His mother , Nelly Rico , was not in the Beijing Agricultural University Gymnasium stands , because she does not have a passport .
Advertisement
“ If you ask my mom , she will tell you she is American , ” he said , later adding , “ This gold medal is hers . ”
A collection of family and friends did show up , and with such vigor , they were nearly ejected .
During his match , the Cejudo clan refused to sit down despite repeated admonitions from frustrated security people .
“ We did n’t want to get thrown out but , if your little bro is down there , what are you going to do ? ” Alonzo said .
“ After a while , [ the guard ] just got tired of it . ”
Down on the mat , Cejudo was tired of messing around .
He immediately attacked Matsunaga ’s legs and pushed him around the mat , scoring enough to win each of the first two rounds in the best - of - three format , giving him the victory .
Advertisement
After which , Cejudo immediately began crying and looking for that flag , taking it back to the mat for what will become not only the signature celebration of his career , but perhaps of these entire Olympics .
“ The United States is the kind of place where you can choose your own path , ” he said .
“ We should never forget that . ”
Henry Cejudo ’s path -- slippery and scrabbled and wonderfully star - spangled -- perhaps ensures that we wo n’t .

Well , Star Wars : Clone Wars was released , and though it was a much anticipated event ( or ploy ) to get every Star Wars geek to the theater for something a little different , you might spend your money better on the Genndy Tartakovsky versions .
The action picks up shortly after Episode II : Attack of the Clones and owes a lot to the aforementioned Tartakovsky versions in voices , style , and tone .
But that is where the similarities end .
We 're thrown smack in the middle of the narrative with no explanation of character or setting , because , well , you know it all by now , do n't you ?
Obi-Wan and Anakin are deep into battle when they are called to action to find and rescue Jabba the Hutt 's little " punky muffin " ( yes , that is what Jabba called him ) .
The message is delivered by Ahsoka Tano , Anakin 's new padawan learner , a whiny , vacuous little twit who , if she was n't a force - wielding Jedi who kicks some serious Droid behind , would fit right in as a character on Hannah Montanna .
I knew we were lost when Anakin called her " Snips " and she called him " Sky - guy " and R2D2 " Artooie . "
With the introduction of Ahsoka , one can almost forget Hayden Christensen ever happened .
But there are some neat new characters who make appearances and , of course , plenty of aliens .
As far as the animation rendering goes , there are some stylistic choices that give the whole thing a " dirty , " monochromatic feel with the look of papier - maché sculptures .
The animation was supposedly done to resemble Japanese anime , but methinks they confused anime with Supermarionation .
I felt like I was watching an episode of Thunderbirds .
Let 's be clear .
It 's Star Wars , and it satisfies your yearning for clone trooper - on - droid action and light saber duels .
We get to see lots of armored and unarmored clones do their business and big spaceships battling in the void .
My 5 - year - old simply loved it and would not have let me hear the end of it if he was forced to wait until the DVD , or worse , the TV show .
There are some very silly things about this Clone Wars such as the fact that the battle droids all sound like Erkle from Family Matters , and Zero ( Cero ? ) the Hutt sounds more like Capote the Hutt .
But there are some very cool things about this version of Clone Wars too which should add some real variety to the mythos .
Ventress is one of these things .
This character is one evil Sith witch and is the best carry - over from the Tartakovsky toons .
She should make the subsequent TV episodes fun to watch , if the show lasts that long for her to become a major feature that is .
I also can't wait to see more Jedi and General Grievous .
In short , see it if you or the geeklets can't bear the wait , but you might spend your money better somewhere else waiting for the inevitable repeat during the TV release .
The skin-ablation laser tattoo we showed you recently was creepy mainly because burning your naked skin is going to hurt , but this new laser body - mod tackles a safer target , fingernails .
The portraits of famous bods you can see in the image are laser - etched into black nail polish ( I know , it looks like they 're made of seared , blackened nail , but they 're not ) , and member lamedust over at Instructables has got a pretty comprehensive guide .
So if you 're crazy , you too can etch pics onto the end of your digits .
The video makes for interesting watching .

So , all you need is some artwork , a laser - etch machine and the urge to burn your fingers .
Or , if even that 's too creepy for you , the technique also works on artificial nails .

And I know the headline says " not painful " ... but if you check out the Instructables link , you 'll see that 's not strictly true .
Aligning laser and nail and avoiding sensitive skin is sometimes not so easy , it seems ... as is not cooking your nail because the laser intensity 's too high .
Watch it , and promise me not to try this body mod either ?
I 'm pretty sure the lid should be down and all safeties engaged on these machines , for a reason .

Aug. 6 , 2008  -- Colin Carlson 's summer has been very different from those of other kids his age .
Instead of video games , sleepovers and summer camp , the 12 - year - old has spent the last couple of months wondering where he 'll attend college this fall .
Colin , who earned his high school diploma from Stanford University Online High School in June , had planned to go to Connecticut College , where he intended to double major in eco-biology and environmental studies .
But his dreams of the quintessential college experience on the liberal arts campus were ruined , his mother told ABCNews.com , when school administrators told him he would n't be allowed to set foot in a campus dormitory .
According to his family , the college went back on an agreement that would have permitted Colin to be affiliated with a dormitory even though he would live off campus with his mother -- an aspect of campus life the family says is imperative to the college experience .
" They said no to giving him a dorm affiliation , which is a problem because all school events rely on that , " said Jessica Carlson , Colin 's mother .
" Colin would have been completely left out of the community [ without an affiliation ] . "
Carlson said she got the distinct impression from conversations with the administration that having Colin at school was " too much trouble . "
So the family turned its sights to the state university down the road .
Colin will begin as a sophomore honors student at the University of Connecticut in a few weeks .
He 's skipping freshman year because he has already earned several college credits from the University of Connecticut as a part - time student , as well as advanced placement course work while he was home - schooled .
But he says he was still disappointed with Connecticut College 's decision .
" I just wanted to be a part of the liberal arts community -- and that would n't have been possible without dorm affiliation , " said Colin .
Concerns About Drugs , Alcohol ?
Jessica Carlson said she believes her son's possible exposure to drug and alcohol use in the dorm was the reason the school denied the dorm affiliation , though she added that school administrators never explicitly told her that was the reason .
" The deans at the school told me in a phone conversation that they were concerned about the adult activities that took place in the dorms , " said Carlson , who added that she never intended for her son to be permitted to live in a dormitory .
She said she had already found an apartment in which she had planned to live with Colin while he was attending the college .
Connecticut College declined to confirm that Colin had been admitted to the school , but one of the college deans told ABCNews.com in a statement that the school had problems with a 12 - year - old entering a campus residence hall .
" As a matter of policy , Connecticut College does not condone the presence of 12 - year - old children in residence halls after hours , " Aramando Bengochea , the dean of the college community , said in a statement .
" Residence halls are considered to be adult residences , and all programming and supervision of students in residence is predicated on an assumption that students can be treated as adults . "
His mother pointed out that any concerns about Colin's age could have been offset by his abstention from some of the activities known to entice college freshman .
" The point is that he 's no trouble at all , " said Carlson .
" My son does n't vandalize , cheat , have sex , do drugs or drink . "
" I bet there are a lot of students who do drink and do drugs , and I bet they cause problems .
Colin would not , " said Carlson , who described her son as " well - rounded " and " the opposite of a wallflower . "
Nancy Green , the executive director for the National Association for Gifted Children , said college 's concerns about exposing a 12 - year - old to the freshman experience were understandable .
" The decision to send a young child to college does depend somewhat on the child 's social and emotional development , " Green said .
" On the face of it [ it ] makes sense that colleges [ would be concerned about a 12 - year - old ] because a campus is a place where kids live independently for the first time and universities have trouble controlling 18 - year - olds most of the time . "
But she said her organization believes extremely bright students like Colin should not have their academic opportunities limited solely because of age .
Some students , she said , are ready to handle the academic and the social rigors .
" Certainly we want a child to be challenged academically at every stage , and if the other factors [ such as social and emotional readiness ] fall into place we do think college is appropriate , " she said .
" But often if the kids are stimulated academically , the other pieces fall into place . "
Green said that when gifted children see their options limited , they can face obstacles that are n't there for students who excel in other areas .
" There is a lot of resistance against gifted children , " she said .
" It 's not like a star athlete , who immediately , upon showing they 're great at something , they get a special team and a great choice . "
Faculty Were Impressed
Despite reluctance by school administrators , Colin and his mother told ABCNews.com that several professors who had met with him expressed disappointment when they learned he would not be on campus this fall .
Peter Siver , a botany professor and the director of environmental studies at Connecticut College , told ABCNews.com that he was anxious to have Colin become a part of his research team .
" Academically I do n't think there 's any question he would have been able to handle being here , " said Siver , who met Colin during an incoming freshman visitation weekend and kept in touch with him through e-mail .
" I think at a place like this Colin could have blossomed and done research with me and maybe even expanded on it . "
" I joked with my class that they were going to be bumped by Colin -- he had way more questions then my students ever had , " he said .
For Gifted Children , Being Accepted Is n't As Easy As You'd Think
Carlson told ABCNews.com that while her son's SAT scores and IQ are off the charts -- she declined to disclose his exact numbers -- he still faced a lot of wary admissions counselors who seemed hesitant to bend the rules to accommodate his young age .
She said admission counselors at another small New England liberal arts college told Colin that , while they'd love to have him at the school , they simply could not waive the residency requirement that the other students must adhere to .
Because Colin was too young to live alone in a dorm , Carlson said the school instructed Colin to go back to high school until he was of age -- and then apply again .
But Colin did n't want to go through another four years of high school .
" It 's disappointing and irritating when people do n't understand why I would n't repeat high school , " said Colin .
" I just graduated from an accredited high school .
Why would I do it again ? "
' Nowhere to Go '
Colin 's mother says she hopes universities learn from her son that it 's important to be open to all types of students -- even if they 're only 12 .
" There is a lot of age discrimination and age prejudice in the education system , " said Carlson .
" A lot of kids like Colin are being accommodated at young ages , but the problem is they 're hitting an age when they 're done with high school and have nowhere to go . "
" I 'd like to see colleges look at applicants in an age - blind way , " said Carlson .
" That way , if a student is so young that certain practical accommodations need to be made , the college will make them , just like they would for a disabled student with a wheelchair . "
Green , with the National Association for Gifted Children , said many of the estimated 3 million gifted children in the United States will face obstacles when seeking out schooling that will keep them challenged .
" Universities do slam the door [ on gifted kids ] and say it 's more trouble than it 's worth , " said Green .
" Our country is set up on age - based learning , so age becomes a huge issue . "
" With these children , there are a lot of hurdles , " she said .
Colin , who says he 's always had lots of friends , albeit most of them are a bit older , said this summer has been a big enough hurdle as it is , and he 's ready to move on .
" I 'm really excited about starting at the University of Connecticut , " he said .
" I think my classes are going to be great , and I think I 'm going to learn a lot . "
" That 's all I ask for . "

Iran provides 5 % of the world 's oil needs
They call it " Well Number One " .
A sign proudly proclaims the spot where the first middle - eastern oil was discovered 100 years ago .
The oil derrick is still there - it produced oil for 70 years .
The town itself - Masjid e Suleiman - in south west Iran , is still an oil town .
The countryside is criss - crossed with the pipelines that bring oil from each wellhead to the refinery or the export terminal .
But much else has changed .
For nearly 50 years the Iranian oil industry was controlled by the British Anglo - Persian Oil company .
You can still see the names of British companies on some of the older plant .
But the British only paid $ 75,000 ( £ 40,000 ) for the original 60 - year concession - and a small share of the profits .
To this day , that is the source of enormous bitterness in Iran .
British presence " No fair British person can be proud of that part of the history of the UK in Iran , " argues the Iranian National Oil Company 's Vice - President for investment , Ghanimi Fard .
" Unfortunately the overall presence of the British in those years in the Anglo - Persian and Anglo - Iranian oil companies was disastrous for Iran " , he says .
European oil companies are wary of investing in Iran Back in those days , thousands of Western oil workers were based here .
Now the bungalows that used to house them have been taken over by Iranians .
The Golf club , where the Westerners used to relax , has been turned into an army base .
In fact across the oilfields of south - west Iran you hardly see a foreigner any more .
Instead the emphasis is on self - sufficiency .
At Azadegan , the Iranians have taken over development of a vast new oilfield , after the Japanese pulled out because of political pressure .
Iran still provides nearly 5 % of the world 's oil needs .
It is strange then , that an industry of such global importance should be so isolated .
But the Americans have had sanctions in place since the 1979 Islamic revolution , and European companies have become increasingly reluctant to invest .
The French company Total is the latest to put its projects on hold , saying it just could not raise the billions of dollars needed to finance them .
We would be more than happy to supply part of Europe 's energy needs , provided that this would be a two - sided deal .
Dr Ghanimi Fard Iranian National Oil Company
The Chinese , Indians and Russians are moving in - but they can not yet fill the gap .
To some extent the isolation is self - imposed .
The Islamic Republic retains a latent suspicion of foreign involvement in the oil business - international companies describe how difficult it is to do business here .
It is not just the history of British involvement that makes the Iranians wary .
In the Iran - Iraq war from 1980 - 88 , Saddam Hussein targeted the Iranian oil industry - dramatically reducing production .
He had at least a degree of Western support .
Some of the biggest Iranian oilfields run along the border with Iraq - almost in sight of British and American forces .
So a degree of paranoia is understandable .
And Iran argues that it does pretty well on its own - maintaining or increasing oil production , and working on petro-chemicals and gas .
International cooperation
But the lack of technology hurts badly in some areas .
Iran does not have the ability to freeze gas , for example , for shipping to overseas markets .
So the vast gas reserves are underdeveloped .
And even a staunch nationalist like Mr Fard accepts that Iran does need more international co-operation .
President Ahmadinejad campaigned on a pledge to spread Iran 's oil wealth .
" We would like to have this interaction with the world , " he says .
" We would be more than happy to supply part of Europe 's energy needs - provided that this would be a two - sided deal .
In some cases exchange of information , science , expertise can help this .
" Otherwise who is going to be hurting more ?
Very easily I can say that the standard of living in European countries , many western European countries , when they will not have enough energy , is going to be shattered in the long run , " Mr Fard adds .
And despite having curtailed the multinationals , there are still doubts about how much Iran is benefiting from its oil wealth .
The town of Masjid e Suleiman , where oil has been produced for 100 years , is still a dusty impoverished - looking place .
With high oil prices , Iran is now earning $ 7.5 bn ( £ 4bn ) per month from the trade .
President Ahmadinejad campaigned on a pledge to put oil money on people 's tables .
But many Iranians see ever - spiralling prices and high unemployment , and there are wider questions about the long term impact of Iran 's vast oil wealth .
Global economy Bijan Khajehpour , of the company Atieh consulting , argues that so much oil money in the hands of the government changes its relation with society .
Instead of living on taxes , the government has the power to hand out money .
" You will find many Iranian elite members argue that oil for us historically has been a curse , because it has slowed down the overall economic development of the country , it has undermined social and political developments " he explains .
" Personally I am not so sure whether Iran without oil would have been different , Iran without oil would have had many other resources to look towards and develop " , he adds .
For the West , oil gives Iran a strategic importance that makes it hard to contain .
With oil prices over $ 100 ( £ 53 ) a barrel , heavy sanctions on Iran - let alone military action - could endanger the global economy .
So that oil discovery in a sleepy corner of Iran continues to affect Iran and the world - in a way the British engineer directing the drill could never have dreamt of when he struck oil 100 years ago .

However , other nutritionists have stepped in to defend the hot dog .
" My concern about this campaign is it 's giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk , " said Colleen Doyle , the American Cancer Society 's nutrition director .
" An occasional hot dog is n't going to increase that risk . "
We like Uncharted .
As website Action Button points out , it 's the best game ever made about a dude in a T - shirt and jeans .
The cutscenes were pretty good , too with sharp dialogue and everything .
David Cage from French studio Quantic Dream explains how PS3 Heavy Rain is different from PS3 exclusive Uncharted :
Honestly , I loved the game .
I thought Uncharted was very interesting .
There was some very , very interesting aspects to it .
The big difference between Uncharted and what we 're doing here is that Uncharted was still structured like a video game .
It gives you a bit of story , then action , then a bit of story , then action — like porn movies , when you think about it .
Advertisement
More adult film musing after the jump .
Porn movies are structured in exactly the same way , except that the action is not the same ( laughter ) , but it 's the same structure .
Most video games are done like that .
It 's one thing to do a great cutscene , even if it 's real time .
It 's another thing to try to tell the story as you play , so the story 's not told through cutscenes — it 's told through gameplay .
So you do n't need acting performance in cutscenes .
You need interactive performance .

Guess that means
Uncharted the best game ever made with the same structure as a porn movie about a dude in a T - shirt and jeans .

Home affairs correspondent , BBC East
The family were stopped by an officer from the Channel Tunnel Policing Unit A police force has apologised after a disabled child and his parents claimed they were detained at a Channel crossing point under the Terrorism Act.
Julie Maynard , of Ware , Hertfordshire , was taking a day trip to Calais through the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone , Kent .
The detective constable accused Ms Maynard and her husband Leslie Coombs of trafficking her son Joshua , 12 .
Kent Police apologised and described the incident as inappropriate , unprofessional and lacking in tact .
The family was stopped by plain clothes officer from the Channel Tunnel Policing Unit on 20 February .
I wish to reassure you that your highly unsatisfactory experience was a very isolated incident
Insp Helen Shaw Ms Maynard , a legal advocate , said the officer , who failed to identify who she was , asked for the family 's passports then asked " who 's the boy ? "
" My son is mixed race and the officer then told us , ' I believe you are child trafficking ' . "
When Ms Maynard asked the woman officer if she would be asked the same question if her son was white , she said the officer replied : " Are you accusing me of being a racist ? "
She claimed the family were then told they were being detained under the Terrorism Act and said they were surrounded by " at least 10 police officers " who ordered them to get out of their car .
' Frightening experience '
Ms Maynard was separated from her husband and son , who is autistic and has cerebral palsy , and taken to a detention room for questioning .
Ms Maynard said the woman officer told her : " It 's obvious he [ Joshua ] has nothing to do with you " .
She said officers had told the family they had powers to hold them for up to nine hours under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act , but they were released after more than two hours .
Mr Coombs said it was an " unpleasant and frightening experience " .
Ms Maynard said : " More and more people are being stopped under the Terrorism Act - there 's absolutely nothing in the act to stop individual officers abusing their powers .
" They have a difficult job to do in a difficult climate but their approach needs to be reasonable and not presumptive that every person is somehow guilty of a possible terrorism or criminal offence . "
Police apology Kent Police said neither the couple nor the boy were placed under arrest or detained under the Terrorism Act .
The force said in a statement : " Our officer spoke to a white couple with a child of mixed race .
" There were three names on the passport and the officer made inquiries to check the child was leaving the country legally .
" The parents made a complaint for which we have apologised . "
The force added that the officer in question no longer works at the Channel crossing and was in another post but the move was not connected to the incident .
Insp Helen Shaw , from Kent Police 's Frontier Operations , apologised to the family in a letter .
In another letter she wrote : " Your complaint and my subsequent enquiries allowed me to identify that her ( the officer 's ) manner had been insensitive , lacking in tact and that her conduct overall lacked the professionalism I expect .
" I wish to reassure you that your highly unsatisfactory experience was a very isolated incident . "

KINSHASA ( Reuters ) - Poachers in Congo have killed a fifth of the elephants in Africa ’s oldest national park this year as China buys more ivory , the park ’s director said on Friday .
An elephant rests after being shot with a tranquiliser dart by the Kenya Wildlife Service veterinary officials at the Maasai Mara National Reserve March 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Antony Njuguna
Rwandan rebels have killed seven Savannah elephants in the past 10 days alone in the Virunga National Park , along Congo ’s eastern border with Rwanda and Uganda , Emmanuel de Merode told Reuters .
“ We ’ve definitely lost 20 percent of the population this year and probably more , ” he said .
“ We have rangers with them , and we ’re trying to reinforce them .
But ( the rangers ) are outnumbered 20 to one . ”
The 790,000 - hectare ( 2 million - acre ) reserve was home to one of central Africa ’s largest Savannah elephant herds in the 1970s numbering around 5,000 .
But a brutal 1998 - 2003 war , heavy poaching , corruption and mismanagement of the park have taken a heavy toll .
Today conservationists believe no more than 300 elephants remain .
China , among the world ’s main destinations for illegal ivory , was granted permission last month to buy 108 tonnes of ivory stocks from Botswana , Namibia , South Africa and Zimbabwe by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species .
De Merode singled out China ’s growing appetite for ivory as one of the root causes of this year ’s increase in elephant killings , as poachers attempt to launder their illegal ivory for legitimate sale .
“ It ’s very difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal stocks , ” he said .
Despite the official end of the conflict in Congo , the eastern borderlands remain a volatile patchwork of rebel strongholds and militia controlled zones .
Armed clashes between rival armed groups are a regular occurrence , limiting the rangers ’ ability to patrol , and providing cover for poaching .
The Savannah elephant is a sub-species of the African elephant , which is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources .
The BBC's Erica Chernofsky in Jerusalem gets a rare insight into the lives of members of Israel 's Ultra -Orthodox Jewish community .
Sitting on a park bench in the late afternoon , Michal Greenwald watches her children run around the playground with dozens of other kids as she takes a few minutes rest from her hectic day .
A full - time property lawyer , Mrs Greenwald is the sole breadwinner and also takes care of her four young children and tends to the housework .
Her husband , Shmuel , spends his days studying in a religious seminary for men .
She says she cannot imagine life any other way .
'' Girls are raised this way from a young age , and such are the lives of Haredim in Israel , '' she says of the Ultra - Orthodox Jews who choose to live separately from mainstream Israeli society .
It is difficult to walk the streets of Jerusalem without running into Haredim , but their community can seem isolated and closed .
The men are distinct in their long black wool coats and trousers , stark white button - down shirts and black hats , even in the heat of the Middle Eastern summer .
Living ' with a purpose '
Mrs Greenwald , 34 , lives in Har Nof , an ultra- orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem where absolutely everything is closed on Saturday - the Sabbath - and only kosher food is sold in shops .
We look different , in fact we look very weird - we dress how people used to dress 100 years ago
Moshe Eliahu
Haredi student and father Like all Haredi women , she dresses very modestly , covers her hair with a wig or scarf and will not allow physical contact of any kind with any man other than her husband .
" Being Haredi means being someone who fears God , " Mrs Greenwald says .
" It means that first and foremost in life are the Torah ( Bible ) and keeping the mitzvoth ( commandments ) . "
She is referring to the 613 commandments in the Bible that Jews believe were given to them by God .
" Everything in my life is built around the Torah , " she says .
" If I go on a trip with my family , I can't eat just anything , I can't go mixed swimming , and I 'm constantly thinking ' what is the proper thing to do now ? '
As Haredim we do n't just live , but we live with a purpose . "
That purpose , as she defines it , is to fulfil the Torah and mitzvoth by bettering herself as well as the world around her , and in so doing striving to become closer to God .
It is for this reason that she proudly supports her family while her husband pursues his religious studies .
' Positive energy ' Currently Haredim make up about 10 % of Israeli society , and have a less than positive reputation among secular Israelis , many of whom view their customs as primitive and disapprove of their choice to study at seminaries and thus avoid the mandatory army draft .
" It 's an ancient concept in Judaism that the spiritual and the physical are united , that to win a war you need both spirit and strength , " says Moshe Eliahu , a Haredi father of two and full - time student at a Jerusalem seminary .
" You need people fighting , but you also need people learning and praying . "
According to government figures , the majority of Haredi men do not have paid jobs .
Mr Eliahu , who also earns a meagre wage working at a support centre for Haredi youth in the evenings , explains that Haredim believe that there must always be a certain amount of men learning the Jewish books in order for life , as we know it , to go on .
He is a direct descendant of the Hatam Sopher , a leading 19th Century rabbi of European Jewry and one of several key figures who were the early leaders of the various Haredi sects .
Mr Eliahu says Israel and the world need the " positive energy " that comes from learning Torah .
" This sounds funny to the western ear - what can a man learning in a yeshiva all day possibly give back to the world ? " he says .
" Torah learning that we do is the hidden code of the physical existence of all mankind , and if for one single second there is no Torah learning in the air , all the world would go back to chaos . "
Mr Eliahu 's wife , Miriam , teaches English at two Jerusalem schools and takes care of their children .
" There 's no point to our physical existence without a spiritual purpose , and I , as the husband who is learning all day , am primarily responsible for that , " he explains .
' Defence mechanism '
He also rejects the view that Haredi gender roles are primitive .
In Judaism , he says , women are actually considered to be closer to God than men .
'' They are the ones who create life , they are the queens . "
Dressed in classic Haredi garb , he acknowledges he stands out on the street .
'' We look different , in fact we look very weird .
We dress how people used to dress 100 years ago , we have long peyot ( side locks ) , and all these things set us apart . "
He explains that Haredi men dress this way as a " defence mechanism " to " protect ourselves from assimilation " .
Mrs Greenwald too defines herself by her religious ideals , setting herself apart from the values of wider society .
" I do n't live life for myself , " she says .
" My priority is my family , my home , and then my career .
I can't say I desire to become a famous lawyer , or to be a millionaire .
" For us , there is a bigger picture here .
We know this world is just a hallway to the real life , to the Garden of Eden . "

House waves off impeachment measure against Bush
By LAURIE KELLMAN
1 day ago ( Copied 06.13.08 )
Copyright Â© 2008 The Associated Press .
All rights reserved .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) – The House has voted to send articles of impeachment against President Bush to a committee that is not likely to hold hearings before the end of his term .
By 251- 166 , House members dispatched the measure to a committee on Wednesday – a procedure often used to kill legislation .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi long ago declared the prospects for impeachment proceedings “ off the table . ”
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , who ran for president earlier this year , insists that his resolution deserves more consideration .
He spent more than four hours Monday night reading his 35 articles of impeachment into the record , including charges that Bush manufactured a false case for going to war against Iraq .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday that the Democratic - led Congress was holding the Bush administration accountable and questioned spending time on impeachment in the “ waning months of this administration ’s tenure . ”
An election looms in which every House seat , a third of those in the Senate and the presidency are up for grabs .
House leaders are staunchly against spending the remaining time in the abbreviated legislative schedule on impeachment proceedings .
The House vote sent the impeachment articles to the House Judiciary Committee , chaired by Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich . , who had once vowed to hold impeachment hearings .
He would n’t immediately comment on the articles ’ prospects for hearings .
Democratic aides widely suggested those gauging the bill ’s prospects look to a precedent : the impeachment articles against Vice President Dick Cheney , which were sent to Conyers ’ committee in November .
There ’s no evidence they will be considered before the Bush administration leaves office in January .
Those were Kucinich ’s , too .
Republicans , seeing a chance to force Democrats into an embarrassing debate , voted to bring up the resolution .
Democrats countered by pushing through a motion to scuttle the bill from the floor .
Kucinich ’s articles also charge Bush with failing to provide troops with vehicle armor , illegally detaining both foreign nationals and Americans , condoning torture , mishandling the government ’s response to Hurricane Katrina and undermining efforts to address global warning .
“ It is imperative that members of Congress have a thorough opportunity to read the articles of impeachment and study the documentation , ” Kucinich said in a statement .
In a conference call with reporters Thursday , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , Mr. McCain ’s senior economic adviser , complained about what he described as flaws in the Tax Policy Center study .
He called it “ an incomplete analysis ” that made “ some fundamentally unrealistic assumptions ” about Mr. Obama ’s plan , specifically in the area of taxes on small businesses , and accepted spending projections for the Democrat “ that also do n’t add up . ”
There is “ a real difference here ” between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama , Mr. Holtz - Eakin added .
“ The Tax Policy Center did n’t capture that , ” he said .
Part of the disagreement between the candidates has to do with the semantics of what constitutes a tax increase .
When Congress approved cuts in 2001 and 2003 , it did so with the understanding that those benefits , which largely favor the wealthy , would expire at the end of 2010 .
While Mr. McCain wants to extend virtually all of the cuts permanently , Mr. Obama favors retaining those that primarily benefit people whose income is less than $ 250,000 a year .
“ The way the Congressional Budget Office scores it , that would not be a tax increase , because their baseline assumes the increase is going to happen as part of current law , ” said Chris Edwards , a tax analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute .
“ Bush and the Republicans would have liked the cuts to be permanent , but you need 60 votes in the Senate to make cuts permanent . ”
Mr. McCain is correct when he says that Mr. Obama intends to increase the maximum tax rate on capital gains , the bulk of which fall on the wealthiest segment of the population , and that he would be less generous in offering breaks on the estate tax .
But he tends to play down or ignore Mr. Obama ’s proposals to eliminate taxes for retirees earning less than $ 50,000 a year and to give tax breaks to workers earning less than $ 75,000 annually .
“ McCain is picking the areas where rates go up and ignoring the areas where Obama is trying to rebalance the tax code so that taxpayers would save , ” said John Irons , research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute , which is generally viewed as sympathetic to working families .
Mr. Irons said that “ the important thing is to look at overall impact on people ” and that on this score , “ the vast majority of the population , almost the entirety of the middle class , would see more from Obama than McCain . ”
Economists have also criticized the methodology behind Mr. McCain ’s assertion that Americans from all kinds of backgrounds could end up paying thousands of dollars more in taxes if Mr. Obama got his way .
Several criticized him as apparently basing his claim on an average figure in which , as Mr. Irons said , “ Bill Gates is mixed with you and me , and everything gets skewed . ”
A NOUN , A VERB , AND P.O.W …..
After the McCain campaign responded to yesterday ’s flap over the senator ’s untold number of homes by emphasizing his background as a former prisoner of war , I started wondering just how often Team McCain plays this card .
Perusing the last couple of weeks , I found four examples : 1 ) in response to questions about McCain ’s marital infidelities ; 2 ) in response to criticism of McCain ’s healthcare plan ; 3 ) in response to a question about the first thing that comes to his mind when he thinks of Pittsburgh ; and 4 ) in response to allegations he may have heard the questions in advance of Rick Warren ’s recent candidate forum .
The Huffington Post ’s Sam Stein went a little further , noting that McCain also emphasized his background as a prisoner of war while railing against earmarks and again when talking about his taste in music .
After all of this , for the first time , McCain is actually starting to face some media push - back .
Once a remarkable and respected aspect of his biography , John McCain stands on the brink of “ trivializing ” his past as a prisoner of war , which has become a “ crutch in the campaign , ” Newsweek ’s Howard Fineman declared Thursday .
“ I think they are going to it way too many times .
It ’s the original story that defined John McCain , that still when you read it in his book ‘ Faith of my Fathers , ’ when you read about it in ‘ The Nightingale ’s Song , ’ you ca n’t help but have admiration and respect for the guy .
And I think he wisely for many years stayed away from it as a political tool , he really did .
But now it not only defines him , it ’s become a crutch in the campaign .
And I think he is in danger of trivializing it .
By the time they get to the convention in St. Paul , there might not be much of it left to use . ”
It ’s not just Fineman .
Time ’s Ana Marie
Cox went so far as to argue that McCain ’s over - reliance on this is “ bordering on irrational . ”
Greg Sargent summarized the problem nicely : “ [ I ] f you print too much currency , it devalues it .
The McCain campaign is cranking out all these bills with a little ‘ McCain as P.O.W. ’ logo on it and is trying to use them to buy their way out of every controversy that comes along .
Pretty soon the McCain team ’s money wo n’t be good anywhere . ”
Quite right .
I ’d just add that the hard - sell would n’t be quite so awkward if McCain did n’t go around saying that he ’s reluctant to talk about his Vietnam experiences .
Britain ’s first eco-nightclub needs peppy dancers to generate electricity
The DJ of this new eco-nightclub better play great music if he wants to keep his turntable working .
For if the feet stop thumping so will the power .
Britain ’s first eco-nightclub , set to open in King ’s Cross , will require the patrons to dance on a modified dance floor that will harness the energy expelled by the clubber ’s moves and convert it to electricity .
This place is so Green - oriented ; they even plan on using a recycled water system to flush their lavatories .
The Club will also serve organic spirits served in polycarbon cups .
Entry to the club will cost £ 10 , but those who can prove that they cycled , used public transport or walked to the venue will be welcomed in free .
That ’s not it customers will have to sign a pledge before entering the club that they will work towards curbing climate change .
The club will open doors on 10 July and is based at Bar Surya in Pentonville Road , which is owned by property millionaire and Tory donor Andrew Charalambous .
Mr Charalambous is also the head of a new climate change organisation called Club4Climate , said he hoped to use clubbing to inspire young people to tackle global warming .
“ This is a new way to draw in the young generation , ” he said .
“ It ’s a sexy and fresh approach as opposed to the way young people feel they are preached to by other more ‘ grown - up ’ charities .
“ Our aim in opening the country ’s first ecological club is to get as many people as possible involved in saving their world .
“ There is no greater platform than clubbing to reach out to young people .
Having an energy - generating dancefloor is a very exciting and interesting - idea that we have been talking to people in Rotterdam about .
Such a dancefloor could generate about 60 per cent of the building ’s energy . ”

Sega Genesis / Megadrive 101 : A Beginners Guide
Note from racketboy : Special thanks goes to Scooter for putting this guide together !
The RetroGaming 101 series is aimed at gamers who are just starting out in the classic gaming scene or are curious about an older console that they do n’t know much about yet .
Those of you that are especially knowledgeable about the featured machine , I encourage you to add any information that you think would be beneficial into the comments section .
If you are new to the featured console , and still have questions , you can also use the comments section and I will do my best to help you out .
In the early 1990 ’s Sega did the impossible by breaking free of Nintendo ’s early power grip on the console game industry .
Not only did it lure away many gamers from the dominant NES , but Sega started a cult following of its own and continued to carry on the battle against Nintendo ’s 16 - bit SNES .
Even though Sega had some great games and consoles that followed the Genesis , the 16 - bit era was still its peak of stardom .
In this guide , we ’ll take a look at what made the Genesis great and how you can get the most of the machine more than a decade later .
Another note : Sega ’s 16 - bit wonder was titled the Mega Drive in all markets except North America where the name had previously been copyrighted and was thus named the Genesis in that market .
For purposes of this article , the term Genesis will be used but should be noted that it is interchangeable with the name Mega Drive .
Additionally , the Sega CD was named the Mega CD outside North America .
Historical Impact
The Sega Genesis was the first console to give meaningful worldwide competition to Nintendo ’s firm grasp on the home console market .
The marketing of the Sega Genesis produced the first worldwide “ console war ” ( Atari and Mattel had gone head to head years before but almost solely in the US market alone ) .
The Genesis was produced over an impressive 14 year retail life span .
The Genesis can reasonably be credited for turning Sega into a video game and home console powerhouse .
( The predecessor , the Sega Master System , never did command a meaningful amount of market share in Japan or North America )
The Genesis was usually marketed to a more mature audience by offering more games with mature content thus paving the road for video games to become more than a toy or entertainment for children alone .
The Genesis , along with it ’s contemporary competitors , helped bring home console gaming more significantly into the mainstream of home entertainment choices .
The inclusion of more mature content in games , predominantly pioneered by Sega for games available on the Genesis , led to video game rating systems .
The Sega CD , 32X and Power Base Converter peripherals expanded the software capabilities of the base system and extended the life of the hardware .
The Genesis platform saw the introduction of one of the most recognizable , prolific and enduring video game characters of all time , Sonic the Hedgehog .
The Genesis platform provided powerful graphics processing , multi-layered backgrounds and stereo sound capabilities which were impressive in it ’s time .
The system was first released in Japan in 1988 , North America in 1989 and in Europe in 1990 .
The Genesis remains as Sega ’s most successful console selling roughly 29 million units worldwide .
The Sega Channel –
This system let subscribers try out and play tons of Genesis games over a cable network .
This was very much ahead of its time and paved the way for modern Internet - based systems like XBox Live and Playstation Network
More information on the Sega Genesis on Wikipedia.org .
Strengths
Games produced and published by Sega itself were always the Genesis ’ platform ’s strongest selling point .
Coupled with liberal licensing which brought in numerous large and small third party developers , the console always enjoyed a wide variety of games which appeal to a broad array of gamers .
A very large game library ( Over 500 Titles ) .
Given the longevity and mass appeal and sales success of the hardware , most major and minor game developers of the era brought game after game to the platform , most of which are still available in readily available quantities and most at reasonable prices .
The console ’s game library contains an impressively strong array of games in almost every game genre .
Simple straightforward yet powerful hardware architecture ( base unit Genesis at least ) provided the opportunity for first and third party developers to more fully exploit the capabilities present in the hardware .
This translates into more impressive graphics , abilities , sound and overall game presentation .
The first major console to have games that were sold in durable , consistently sized packaging .
This a boon to gamers who are also collectors .
Many innovative games and some innovative peripherals .
Backwards compatibility with Sega Master Systems games via the Power Base Converter which significantly expands the overall game library without needing to add a complete additional console .
Expandability with the addition of the Sega CD and / or 32X units which provides access to additional game libraries , some of which are entirely exclusive to those attachments .
A substantial and strong fan base which allows for a large and active community within which to investigate reviews and impressions of games and hardware and within which to locate harder to find items and to provide technical support .
A great number of licence - based games are available ( games based on movies such as Jurassic Park , Disney properties , or pop culture icons such as the Simpsons ) so retro gaming enjoyment can be tied to favorite movies , cartoon / comic characters and television programs .
This is also great for younger children starting out with games .
Weaknesses
The color palette is relatively small with 512 colors possible yet with only 64 on - screen colors possible at any one time .
Aside from the very early Genesis units , most base units and software contain regional lockouts providing a great deal of incompatibility between products made for the North American , Japanese and European / Australian markets .
The model 3 Genesis marketed by Majesco late in the Genesis lifespan are incompatible with the Sega CD , 32X and Power Base Converter hardware add - ons .
Model 1 base units cannot provide stereo output directly to a stereo amplifier or television without the use of a secondary cable .
When properly coupled with a Sega CD unit , even the Model 1 unit can provide stereo output via a typical A/V cable connection .
Game cartridges with a battery powered game save memory may require the replacement of the battery to allow game saves to be maintained .
Typically , the replacement of the battery will erase previous saves if they are even still retained .
Games with mature content are perhaps not suitable for young children .
Games published prior to the creation of video game rating systems may not provide alerts to the fact that the game may contain content inappropriate for younger gamers .
Hardware Variations
There are plenty of Sega Genesis / Megadrive hardware options out there .
Some are more extraordinary than others , but even when it comes to a standard Genesis model , there are three variations to choose from .
If you would like to check out the debate about which model is best , check out this forum thread . ​
Model 1
This is the original Genesis unit , it is wide and flat molded in black plastic in a roughly rectangular shape .
The unit has two control pad connections on the front as well as a stereo sound mini-pin output receptacle and includes a volume control slide switch for the stereo sound output .
Suposedly , the Model 1 is the easiest to perform modifications on it for regional bypasses , overclocking , LED change and S - Video output .
It is also said to have the best audio output .
Model 2
This is a simplified Genesis unit .
This noticeably smaller unit is roughly squarely shaped .
The stereo output is now included in the A/V outputs at the back and no volume control for the sound is provided .
Again , two control pad connections are provided .
The unit is molded in black plastic .
Model 3
This is a further simplified and even smaller unit yet roughly squarely shaped .
The basic controls and outputs mirror the Model 2 .
This unit is molded in black plastic .
These units are not compatible with Sega CD nor the 32X .
Sega CDX
This is a relatively compact unit that combines the hardware of both the Genesis and Sega CD into one relatively small unit .
The unit provides two control pad outputs at the front , a small array of CD system control buttons at the front top edge , a CD system door in the middle top and a cartridge slot at the top rear .
AV outputs and AC inputs are found on the sides of the unit .
Sega Nomad
This portable handheld unit contains an entire Genesis hardware system and a backlit full - color screen in a handheld design .
The front of the unit contains the typical control pad buttons and the screen .
The top contains the cartridge slot , on / off switch , player 2 control pad and AV outputs .
The Nomad is not compatible with Sega CD , 32X or Power Base Converter .
The Nomad is incompatible with a very small , perhaps 2 - 4 , number of Genesis games .
Sega MegaJet
This unit is similar to and the precursor of the Nomad and was only available in Japan .
The MegaJet contains the control pad and game cartridge features of the Nomad , but does not contain a viewing screen and as such must be connected to a television screen for game play .
As with the Nomad , the MegaJet is not compatible with Sega CD , 32X or Power Base Converter .
JVC X’eye / WonderMega
These units combine the Genesis and Sega CD hardware into one complete package .
Pioneer LaserActive with Mega Drive module
The Pioneer LaserActive was a stand - alone laser disc based game system .
Additional modules could be purchased which would allow , among other things , Sega Genesis or PC Engine / Turbo - Grafx 16 games to be played .
Essentially , it was the cutting - edge hub for electronic home entertainment in its day .
Genesis Add - Ons
Power Base Convertor –
This add - on was available around the launch of the Genesis and allowed loyal Sega Master System owners to be able to play their existing library of games on the Genesis .
A few games were incompatible with the PBC .
The first and much more prevalent PBC was designed to fit into the Model 1 Genesis and will not fit onto a Model 2 Genesis .
This earlier PBC included a card slot at the front to allow the adapter and the Genesis to also play game card - based SMS games , not just the cartridge based games .
This card slot also allowed for the use of the 3D glasses adapter for 3D enhanced SMS games .
A later Master System Converter II was offered in much smaller quantities which acted as a SMS game adapter for the Model 2 Genesis console , however this unit does not provide a slot for card based games and as such also does not allow input for the 3D glasses peripheral .

Sega CD –
The semi-popular add - on was Sega ’s first attempt at pushing the Genesis past the Super Nintendo from a technical standpoint .
It allowed developers to add high - end audio and full - motion video to the Genesis platform while also giving them a much larger storage capacity in comparison to cartridges .
Two models of the Sega CD were also produced to match each of the first two Genesis Models .

( see also Games That Defined The Sega CD ) Sega 32X – The 32X is the much maligned 32 - bit add on that was expected to enhance the abilities of the Genesis and help carry it into the 32 - bit era .
It was originally expensive and a small and mostly lackluster library of games provided to give these units a short life span and as such they were not produced in large numbers , especially so outside North America .

Genesis Accessories
The list of peripherals for a popular system which enjoyed a long production life such as the Genesis is exceptionally long and we could not hope to list them all , however we are providing a list of the more popular or innovative items made for the Genesis .
The Game Genie
The Activator – This device replaces the control pad and is predominantly intended for use in fighting games which became a popular genre during the Genesis ’ lifespan .
An octagonal shaped hoop containing sensors is laid on the floor and the player stands in the center of the hoop .
By punching or waving their arms and kicking their legs at various points above sections of the hoops , various control pad controls are sent to the base unit .
They idea was to attempt to act out the actions required in the game that the game character needed to perform and thus the player is more interactive with the action .
The units ’ sensors were not entirely effective and accurate and this item should be considered an interesting gimmick worth collecting for the interest factor than for an actual expectation of Wii - like peformance or game interaction .
Similar and even more unsuccessful baseball bat and golf club peripheral systems were also available and as such were limited use with the specific games for which they were designed .

The Menacer – This is Sega ’s own light gun peripheral , however it is only compatible with a few specific games designed for its use .
The gun requires batteries unlike other light guns which draw power from the control pad connection .
The gun has rifle stock and gun sights attachments that can be attached or removed as desired providing configurations anywhere from a handgun to a rifle with a scope .
This particular gun uses a separate communications sensor which must be positioned on top of the television and as such the unit is more difficult to configure and it is not horribly accurate .
This peripheral too should only be considered for its collectible interest and not as a useful light gun .

The Enforcer – This is a light gun made by Konami and as such is compatible only with Konami light gun games and a few other games by other publishers .
This gun can be coupled with a unique second player gun for two player action .
The second player gun can ONLY be used in conjunction with the one player gun .
Since the gun uses typical light gun technology , it will only function properly with a picture tube ( CRT ) type television , LCD , plasma and projection screen TV users are out of luck here .

Arcade control stick , enhanced feature and 6 - button controllers – Sega certainly had their own brand name items in these categories but many more were offered from any number of third parties and provide varying arrays of features .
Arcade sticks typically are larger laptop or table top control pads in which the typical d-pad is replaced with a control stick similar to those found on arcade game consoles .
Most of these pads have large buttons often with slow motion and turbo fire settings available individually for each button .
Enhanced feature control pads are available in the standard 3 - button configuration and the later 6 - button configuration .
Many offer turbo - fire ( rapid fire provided by simply holding down the button ) and slow motion ( the game play is repeated paused and started while the button is held down so fast action sections can be reacted to more easily ) .
Some of the more advanced pads include additional buttons which can be programmed to deliver the equivalent of a series of button combinations and can be quite useful in fighting games where often complex series of button combinations are required to make strong moves in the game .
Many other pads simply provide a different ergonomic design .
Six -Button pads arrived toward the later segment of the Genesis lifespan .
The pad provided 6 action buttons as opposed to the previous three .
The 6 - button pads can be used with all but a handful of earlier games .
When used with games not designed to make use of the extra buttons , the pad simply functions the same with the extra buttons simply not being employed .
Games specifically designed to make use of the extra buttons are typically clearly marked on the back of the packaging as having the 6 - button pad capability .
Most games designed to use the 6 - button pads also will function just fine with 3 - button control pads .
– Sega certainly had their own brand name items in these categories but many more were offered from any number of third parties and provide varying arrays of features .
Multiplayer adaptors –
There are a number of multiplayer adapters which allow for up to four players to participate in games designed for multiplayer action .
Since the Genesis is designed with only two control pad input sockets , such an adaptor is required to attach 3 or 4 control pads .
The most common versions of these adaptors are the Sega version and the Electronic Arts 4 - Way - Play .
The EA 4 - Way - Play was only compatible with EA games and of course only on games designed to allow for up to 4 players .
The original Sega multitap only worked with Sega games , later versions worked with Sega and EA games .
CodeMasters sold some games in the European market in what they called J - Carts which also allowed for up to 4 - players .
The J - Carts included two additional control pad input sockets on the top of the game cartridge itself so no additional adaptor was required .
– There are a number of multiplayer adapters which allow for up to four players to participate in games designed for multiplayer action .
Since the Genesis is designed with only two control pad input sockets , such an adaptor is required to attach 3 or 4 control pads .
The most common versions of these adaptors are the Sega version and the Electronic Arts 4 - Way - Play .
The EA 4 - Way - Play was only compatible with EA games and of course only on games designed to allow for up to 4 players .
The original Sega multitap only worked with Sega games , later versions worked with Sega and EA games .

Game Library
Games That Defined The Sega Genesis –
There were many games that defined Sega ’s personality in the early 1990s .
The earlier titles may not be very exciting by today ’s standards , but the Genesis library was gradually strengthened by a number of unique and exciting games .
The Best Undiscovered Sega Genesis Games –
If you have already filled your collection with all of the most popular titles , take a look at this extensive list of excellent games that did not get the attention they deserved .
The Cheapest Sega Genesis Games Worth Your Time –
If you want to build your Genesis cart collection quickly on a budget , take a look at this guide to get your the values .
Playing Imports
A good number of region - specific games can provide an expanded library of games to those willing to address the technical requirements to make access to such games possible given their home television environment .
North American based units can have easy access to Japanese games with the use of a cartridge slot based unit such as the Game Genie , yet access to European based games can potentially require much more involved technical accommodations .
System modifications such as adding region switches and SCART outputs can be readily accomplished on most model 1 and model 2 hardware .
Emulation
Emulators are available from a variety of sources such as Windows Mobile , iPod , PC , Playstation Portable , Game Boy Advance , Nintendo DS and Palm OS .
The two major PC emulators are Kega Fusion and Gens — many emulators for other platforms are based on these emulators
If you would like to learn more about emulating the Sega Genesis , check out this guide for setting up Kega Fusion on a Windows PC .
You also have commercial emulation options like the Wii Virtual Console or the Sega Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSP .
Affordability
Due to the fact that a large number of hardware units were manufactured and sold and that software was also sold in large numbers , most of the basic hardware and software are readily available at reasonable prices .
Solid base hardware units can be obtained for $ 50 or less .
Many cheap games availible – Many of the more popular games can be obtained locally in larger cities with stores which cater to older games for $ 10 or less .
Loose games without packaging can often be obtained for just a few dollars .
Some of the more rare hardware packages and games can be difficult to find in complete condition which includes all packaging , manuals and software and as such can command increasingly steep prices .
The Sega CDX ( see Hardware Variations ) can often approach $ 200 for a complete , boxed unit in pristine and collectible condition .

Current solar plants need large mobile mirrors to produce energy A new way of capturing the energy from the Sun could increase the power generated by solar panels tenfold , a team of American scientists has shown .
The new technique involves coating glass with a specific mixture of transparent dyes which redirect light to photovoltaic cells in the frame .
The technology , outlined in the journal Science , could be used to convert glass buildings into vast energy plants .
The technology could be in production within three years , the team said .
See how new solar panel technology works " It makes sense to coat the side of [ very tall ] buildings with these new panes , " Professor Marc Baldo , one of the researchers on the team , told BBC News .
" It 's not far fetched at all . "
Colour trick
The most advanced attempts to generate large amounts of electricity via the Sun require the use of a solar concentrator .
These are often bulky mobile mirrors that work by tracking the progress of the Sun and concentrating its beams on the cell at its heart .
But there are downsides to this technology : the cells at the centre have to be constantly cooled , and each concentrator requires a large amount of space to avoid shadowing its neighbour .
The technology collects and focuses different colours of sunlight
The new technology does away with the need for mirrors and mobility .
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) team has found a way to coat panes of glass or plastic with a mixture of several dyes that essentially do the same job .
" What we have is a piece of glass , with a very thin layer of paint or dye on top , " explained Professor Baldo .
" The light comes in and hits the dye and which absorbs it and re-emits the light , but now it 's inside the glass so it bounces along there until it gets to the edge .
So you only need to mount the solar cells around the edge . "
The idea was first developed in the 1970s but was abandoned because much of the light energy was lost en route to the cell .
But using its expertise in optical techniques and a specific mixture of dyes , the MIT team has found a way to make the light travel much farther without losing as much energy along the way .
Window future " When you do this there is a little bit of energy loss with the dye , " said Professor Baldo .
" The main benefit is with the cost .
You use a far smaller amount of solar cells .
For the same area of solar cells , you get much more electricity . "
Existing solar installations could also benefit from the new concentrator , he said .
" You could take this new kind of glass and put it on top of an existing solar cell so the cell still generates electricity but this glass pane with the dye on top captures a certain part of the spectrum and converts it more efficiently than the solar cell would do on its own . "
The MIT team believes it could improve existing panels by 50 % .
In addition , the system is simple to manufacture , requiring little more than to coat glass or plastic with the combination of dyes .
It could be in production within three years , the researchers believe .
If that becomes a reality , one obvious application , they said , was converting windows into energy plants .
" The coated glass would let through about 10 % of the Sun to light up the room , and the remainder would be captured and funnelled to the edges to solar cells to generate electricity , " said Professor Baldo .
" It would look like smoked glass because of the dyes . "
HOW NEW SOLAR PANEL TECHNOLOGY WORKS 1 .
First solar concentrator coated with transparent dyes absorbs sunlight and transmits it to glass panel edge
2 . High voltage solar cells on edge of glass capture sunlight .
3 . Low voltage solar cells trap light escaping through first panel .
4 . The first panel can also be used alone as a window pane .
In the future , glass buildings could produce their own electrical energy .

Yes , because the business model of free servers works for pc and PSN and wii and DS , it should n't work for Xbox ?
Only thing in the way is greed .
Just look at Blizzard .
Battlenet has been around since 1997 and without fees .
Free multiplayer packed in a great service sells games .
Blizzard knew this .
To make it even more clear to you , do you think Counterstrike would have been a hit if it had a monthly fee ?
I shudder at how many more people that would own a Xbox 360 instead of a wii or ps3 had MS realised this simple truth .
PALO ALTO , California – Georgia residents Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer say they 've found Bigfoot – and not only that , they say they have his body .
They just did n't happen to have the creature 's corpse with them for their press conference Friday .
At the well - attended gathering , Dyer and Whitton , together with professional Bigfoot hunter Tom Biscardi , answered questions , handed out unconvincing photos and talked about their alleged find .
" We were not Bigfoot hunters originally , " said Whitton , who claims he and Dyer found the lifeless body of a large , hairy , bipedal animal while camping in the woods of northern Georgia .
" But now we are some of the best Bigfoot hunters in the world . "
According to Whitton , there were several other living animals that resembled the body they found near the discovery site .
The creatures were about 50 feet from Whitton and Dyer , who recorded video of the supposed Bigfeet .
Whitton and Dyer said they put the body in a large freezer shortly after removing it from the woods in early June .
( The photo at right , provided by the team , allegedly shows the Bigfoot body in that freezer . )
Later , they teamed up with Biscardi , who has made a name for himself over the past several years as a Bigfoot hunter whose claims of having found the furry giants have n't always panned out .
The trio now say the body is in Biscardi 's possession in an " undisclosed location , " pending scientific tests .
Biscardi named two scientists he 's contacted regarding his find : Curt Nelson of the University of Minnesota , and Richard Klein , a paleontologist at Stanford University .
" There 's also an Igor and a Dmitri coming from Russia , " Biscardi said .
" They 're very prominent in the Bigfoot world . "
According to the team , the Bigfoot creature is 7 - feet 7 - inches tall , weighs over 500 pounds and has feet that are over 16 inches long , or about size 24 .
By comparison , Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is 6 feet 4 inches tall , weighs 165 pounds and has size 14 feet .
Phelps is also nearly hairless , while Bigfoot appears to be covered in fur .
The press conference was extremely well - attended , with more than two dozen video cameras at the hotel where the event was held and satellite uplink vans outside .
But for all the attention , the press conference – much like a similar event earlier this year in Denver , in which a man revealed video of an alleged space alien – raised more questions than it answered .
One thing we do know : Whitton , Dyer and Biscardi have formed a business venture to profit from their newfound notoriety ( although they provided no details on how they plan to transform their discovery into a business ) .
When asked how much money they hoped to make , Biscardi answered , " As much as we can . "
Whitton and Biscardi answered questions for nearly an hour Friday and were joined late in the session by Dyer .
At the conclusion of the conference ,
Biscardi handed out a photo that he said showed the creature 's mouth and tongue , plus a blurry image of a walking Wookiee / Bigfoot - type creature ( see below for these photos , plus other pictures from the press conference ) .
Biscardi said DNA tests had been done , and handed out a printout Friday describing the results .
They appear to show one sample matching human DNA , another matching opossum DNA and a third test that proved inconclusive .
The three men presented no video or additional evidence to support their rather extraordinary claims .
Their announcement is also odd , considering that Whitton and Dyer posted a YouTube video where they appear to make light of their discovery .
The eight - minute video features Whitton , who is wearing a splint and holding a teddy bear , cracking jokes and complaining about the pair 's detractors .
Casting further doubt on the pair 's announcement is analysis by several bloggers showing that their photograph bears an uncanny resemblance to a commercially available Bigfoot costume .
The Bigfoot Field Researchers Association says that the men's apparent discovery is a hoax .
The men have offered three different stories about their find , according to an Associated Press story :
In early videos , the animal was shot by a former felon , and the men followed it into the woods .
In a second version , they found a " family of Bigfoot " in North Georgia mountains .
In the third , the two were hiking and stumbled upon the corpse with open wounds .
The pair 's press release , issued earlier in the week , has already generated a fair amount of buzz on blogs , science fiction sites and even in the mainstream media .
That buzz is sure to continue , given the attendance at Friday 's press conference and the paucity of evidence one way or another .
Biscardi provided the photo below , which he says shows a Bigfoot - type creature walking through the woods of northern Georgia .
The other photo handed out by Biscardi at the press conference purportedly shows the mouth and tongue of the dead creature discovered by Whitton and Dyer , below .
When Biscardi handed out photos at the end of the press conference , he was mobbed by reporters looking for proof of his remarkable claims .
Tom Biscardi , CEO / founder of Searching for Bigfoot , shows a photo of the creature 's mouth and tongue .

Create a Dynamic Table of Contents Using MooTools 1.2
You 've probably noticed that I shy away from writing really long articles .
Here are a few reasons why :
Most site visitors are coming from Google and just want a straight to the point , bail - me - out ASAP answer to a question .
I 've noticed that I have a hard time reading long articles .
Short attention span , I guess .
When the article is long , I tend to see less comments -- both on my blog and others .
Quite frankly , if the article bombs , I feel like I wasted a bunch of time .
Say I did put together a lengthy article -- I 'd want to automate a table of contents , right ?
Well , here 's how I would do it .
The XHTML
< h1 > Article Title</h1 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h2 > Article Title 2 ( 1)</h2 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h3 > Article Title 3 ( 1)</h3 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h3 > Article Title 3 ( 2)</h3 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h3 > Article Title 3 ( 3)</h3 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h2 > Article Title 2 ( 2 )</h2 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h2 > Article Title 2 ( 3)</h2 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p> < h3 > Article Title 3 ( 4)</h3 >< p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit .....</ p>
As you can see , the above content is really just rubbish for our example .
Note the order of the " h " tags .
The CSS
#toc { float : right ; border : 1 px solid # fc0 ; background : # fffea1 ; padding : 10 px ; font - family : tahoma , arial ; margin:0 0 20 px 20 px ; } #toc a { display : block ; margin : 3 px ; } #toc .h1 { color :#090 ; } #toc .h2 { padding:0 0 0 10 px ; font - size : 11 px ; } #toc .h3 { color : #f00 ; font - size : 10 px ; padding:0 0 0 30 px ; }
The above CSS applies only to the table of contents DIV we 'll be building .
The JavaScript will add the " h{x} " class to the generated link to that section .
Note that the TOC will start hidden .
The MooTools JavaScript
//once the dom is set ... window.addEvent( ' domready ' , function ( ) { // initial vars var finders = [ ' h1 ' , ' h2 ' , ' h3 ' , ' h4 ' , ' h5 ' , 'h6 ' ] ; var matches = [ ] ; // find the h1 , which is the article title $ ( 'article-area ' ) .getElements ('*') . each ( function ( el , i ) { // do we want this ?
if( finders.contains (el.get ( ' tag ' ) ) ) { // create anchor var anchor = new Element ( 'a ' , { ' class ' : el.get ( ' tag ' ) , ' text ' : el.get ( ' text ' ) , ' href ' : ' javascript : ;' } ) ; //click event anchor.addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( ) { var go = new Fx.Scroll ( window ) .
toElement ( el ) ; } ) ; // add into our matches array matches.include ( anchor ) ; } } ) ; // should we show the toc ? if ( matches.length ) { // create toc div , inject var toc = new Element ( ' div ' , { ' id ' : ' toc ' , ' html ' : '< strong > Table of Contents </ strong >< br />' }).inject('article - area ' , ' before ' ) ; // inject the matches matches.each( function ( el ) { el.inject ( toc ) ; } ) ; } } ) ;
There 's a lot going on here so let me break it down .
First , I initialize a few vars .
The most important is " finders , " which allows us to set the tags to be included in the table of contents .
Next , we grab all elements inside my designated " article - area " element .
If the element is in our " finders " list , we create an anchor for it , attach smooth scrolling to the anchor 's " click " event , and store the anchor in our " matches " array .
In the end , if we find any matches , we create the DIV and float it to the right .
If not , the TOC never displays .
Sweet !
Notes
By Malik Miah
August 10 , 2008 -- Much of the world is fascinated by the current US presidential election .
The main reason is because the United States is ready to do something that most developed countries would never consider doing : electing a representative from an oppressed minority as head of state .
Could Australia ever elect an Aborigine as prime minister ?
An Australian of Asian descent ?
Could Germany ever elect a German - born Turk as chancellor ?
What about a black as head of state in the United Kingdom or France ?
Yet we in the United States are discussing the real possibility that a man with a father from Africa , representing a community of descendants of former slaves , could actually be elected president of the most powerful country in human history .
So it is not a surprise that Barack Obama ’s skin colour and bi-racial origins are a subtle and not - so - subtle issue in the presidential race .
During the Democratic Party primaries , for example , Hillary Clinton and the former president Bill Clinton and their supporters made references to the “ fact ” that Obama could not appeal to enough “ blue - collar workers ” — meaning white working - class Americans in the main — to defeat the Republican nominee ( Bill Clinton is still very upset that some in the Black community thought he was playing the “ race card ” to help get his wife nominated .
He has n’t met with Obama yet . )
Now the expected Republican nominee , John McCain , is playing the same dirty race card to undermine support for Obama — the likely Democratic Party nominee .
The most infamous ad involved the two young white female personalities ( Brittney Spears and Paris Hilton ) and Obama .
There is a long history of race - baiting politics using the fear of a Black man with white women in US society .
Race matters
Can the United States overcome its history of racial prejudice to elect the first Black president ?
Race is the elephant in the room .
But few will openly acknowledge its role in this unprecedented presidential race .
Code words are used by the media to avoid the issue of racism and race prejudice .
Yet the fact is the Democratic Party expects to win big in the House of Representatives and Senate races because of the very low approval rating of the Republicans , especially President George W. Bush ( some 20 % ) and his diabolical vice - president , Dick Cheney ( even less ) .
But the polls show the presidential race too close to call .
McCain is in a statistical dead heat with Obama .
There is only one reason for this : Obama ’s skin colour .
The Republican attack machine led by former Bush aides is running negative ads that tell angry white voters upset by high gas prices , fewer jobs and a dark future that Obama ca n’t be trusted .
While it is true that the racism and racial prejudice of most whites is at historic low levels , there is no doubt that the 23 % of whites who openly state they will never vote for a Black can turn the 2008 elections to the Republican nominee .
The Republicans know that several ``swing states ’’ are in play and race can make the difference .
( The US presidential election is not won by a national popular vote .
It is based on who wins the most electoral votes , which are calculated state by state .
In 2000 Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral collage vote to Bush . )
What ’s striking is that the Republicans have been able to attack Obama by playing the “ race card ” then blaming Obama for explaining how the race card will be used by the Republicans .
Obama has repeatedly explained that his opponents will raise the fear of him to divert discussion of the issues of war and the economy because he does n’t look like previous presidents on US currency .
The media falls for the lie as it did four years earlier when the same tactic was used to smear ( “ Swift boat ” ) Democrat John Kerry over his military record during the Vietnam War .
Worse , the pundits have all accepted the false concept of “ blue - collar workers ” being only white workers , leaving out Black , Latino and Asian workers .
Obama ’s campaign has played its hand too carefully on the race - baiting issue .
The campaign has a strategic fear that any mention of race will agitate the “ fear factor ” among whites and may lead them to vote for the “ safe ” white candidate .
Race matters because racism is institutionalised throughout US society .
The fact that an African American ( bi-racial but Black , because skin colour is what defines you ) could be elected to the most powerful office in the world is not a concern to the ruling class .
It knows Obama will defend its interests .
But that truth is not enough to be elected .
Political power has been in the hands of white men so long that a change of power wo n’t happen without a fight .
Many mainstream , journalists are now beginning to openly discuss this elephant in the campaign .
EJ Dionne Jr. , of the Washington Post , observed , “ There is no doubt that two keys to this election are : How many white and Latino votes will Obama lose because of his race than a white Democrat would have won ?
And how much will African American turnout grow , given the opportunity to elect our nation ’s first Black president ? ”
( Dionne notes that in 1960 , when John F. Kennedy ran and won as the “ first Catholic president ” , his religion was an issue and he won 80 % of the Catholic vote — about 30 % greater than the Catholic share won four years earlier . )
Obama is fully aware of this history .
It ’s why he is shifting on issues like affirmative action and talking more about “ class ” as the basis for qualifications to enter higher education and other positions .
The fact is skin colour is always a factor even for wealthier , more educated Blacks .
Study after study shows — and proves — that equally qualified whites and Blacks applying for jobs , nine times out of 10 whites will get the job first .
Affirmative action is necessary to level the playing field and to ensure equal opportunity .
( Obama has told white audiences his two daughters wo n’t need it to appeal to their false belief that there is such a thing as “ Black skin privilege . ” )

The problem for Obama and his supporters is the blatantly racist campaigns of the past ( Richard Nixon ’s infamous 1968 “ Southern strategy ” to get poor whites to change parties ) are no longer viable .
Today the campaigns are more subtle as the Spears - Hilton ad showed — and they tend to work .
The Republican attack machine uses “ fear ” of the Black man and Obama ’s alleged “ elitism ” ( he attended Columbia University in New York and Harvard Law School ) as wedge issues for white workers looking for an excuse to vote against a Black candidate .
McCain ’s charge that Obama is not qualified to be commander in chief is a red herring .
So is the charge of elitism since Obama ’s upbringing by a single white mother and a distant father is more in common to what most working - class whites face .
The “ fear the Black man ” machine is not just aimed at working - class whites , but at Latinos and Asians too .
It is noteworthy that two - thirds of Latinos are polling for Obama , who they see as closer to their concerns especially on the issue of immigration .
The Asian community is more divided but a majority still favour the Democrats and Obama .
Some 40 years after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. , now a national hero , and the fall of legal segregation it is amazing that a Black man may be elected president .
If the Republican attack machine succeeds in turning the election into the “ white guy versus the Black man ” the outcome of the election could change with many anti-racists voting for Obama to express opposition to the race baiting of the Republican campaign .
There is no way today to predict what will happen in November .
In the late 1960s after the victories of the civil rights movement that led to some important legal changes in law , the first Black candidates for higher office ( big city mayors ) faced vicious racial attacks .
Whenever those elections were nominally labeled “ non-partisan ” many on the socialist left backed those candidacies as a rejection of racism and support to the right of the Black community to have elected political representation .
They knew that these candidates still identified themselves as Democrats .
The 2008 presidential election has some similarities .
The difference of course is that Obama does n’t pretend to be independent .
He is n’t running against the old guard of his party .
He is campaigning as a “ centrist ” new Democrat , as seen in his positions on major issues — from energy , the economy , health care and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
World tour in this context
Obama ’s quickly organised and highly publicised international trip in July , in this context , was to show the world and the United States ( his main audience ) that he is “ presidential ” .
What he said was mainstream and in line with the shift in US imperial policy that began under former president Bill Clinton and accelerated under Bush .
Obama ’s trip to the Middle East was not a repudiation of Bush - Cheney policies but an argument that the Democrats have a better strategic plan to protect Israel and defend US interests .
Obama supports US domination of the Arab world .
He advocates a more aggressive war in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
( He even told his staff and reporters not to wear “ green ” while in Israel and Jordan because it symbolises Hamas ! )
Obama also told the media that he sees generals as tacticians carrying out the president ’s orders .
Obama , like Bush , will pick generals who support or accept his polices .
When Obama spoke to hundreds of thousands of Germans in Berlin , he focused on the responsibility of the world ( “ I ’m a citizen of the world ” , he said ) to defend the “ free world ” from terrorism .
While much of the left sees Obama shifting positions on Iraq by proposing a long - term withdrawal , he strongly advocates a new “ surge ” into Afghanistan .
He is also for a more aggressive policy toward Pakistan .
Obama simply believes he ’s smarter than the Bush team and thus more capable of defending US interests while he rebuilds alliances with ``Old Europe ” and rising Asian powers .
Obama ’s domestic programs are centre right too .
The “ yes you ” rhetoric taps the real desire for a change of leadership .
While he will support some liberal positions on women ’s rights and civil rights , his healthcare program is modest and does not guarantee healthcare as a right .
On energy policy he first opposed any new off - shore drilling .
But as the Republican attack machine pushed back hard , he shifted his stance to allow it if “ part of a comprehensive energy plan ” .
The differences with McCain are sharper on social issues like affirmative action and abortion rights .
But even on these issues he is fudging more and more to appeal to religious conservatives and white blue - collar workers .
In the fine traditions of Bill Clinton , Obama is saying what his audiences of white gun carrying Americans want to hear .
The shift to the ” centre ” assumes that minorities , particularly African Americans , will turn out in big numbers and vote for him anyway .
It is likely that Blacks will do so because of the historic nature of electing a Black president .
But for other groups , it ’s not so clear .
Obama will need a big turnout to overcome the white fear factor backlash .
Two contradictory realities
While socialists who recognise that lesser - evil politics can never free workers , including white workers , from capitalist exploitation and domination , the issue of race could be decisive if the Republicans are successful in turning the election into a referendum vote for or against the candidate best able to protect whites .
Under those circumstances , it may be justifiable to cast a vote against McCain ’s race baiting .
I say this knowing that most socialists and those in favour of an independent working - class party will vote for the independent Ralph Nader or the Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney .
The contradiction of the Obama phenomenon is that it reflects two realties .
One is the possibility that the world ’s sole superpower is okay with having a Black man as its president .
Second , is the polarisation and legacy of racism in the United States .
The reality is the ruling class may be okay but the politicians seeking the job are not ready to give up their privileges and power .
For socialists the issue of Obama ( the unique figure and capitalist politician ) is conflicted .
On the one hand , there is no doubt that backing a candidate of the most powerful military industrial complex in the world is impossible .
On the other hand , the issue of race and racism poses the question :
Is the election of Obama as the first Black president a way to push back racist ideology as it was in the 1960s - 70s when the first “ independent ” Black candidates for big city mayors were elected did ?
I 'm of two mind sets .
As a socialist I will either vote for Nader or McKinney to advance the need for class independance .
But as a supporter of nationalism of the oppressed , I 'm inclined to vote against the de facto race - bating campaign of McCain and elect the first Black president .
During the great American Civil War in the 1860s , Marx and Engels wholeheartedly supported the North against the South .
They urged their followers to join the Union Army and help bring about the defeat of the slave owners .
Marx and Engels had no illusions of what that meant for capitalist development and consolidation .
But the smashing of the slave labour system and development of a modern - day US capitalism was in their view in the long - term interests of the working class .
A new body blow to racist ideology by electing a Black man as president is n’t on that order of significance for many reasons .
But it would send a message that citizenship and rights should not be based on the false construct called “ race ” or the shade of your skin .
( CNN ) -- Pamela Madsen knows a thing or two about getting pregnant .
She did it twice , and it took several teams of doctors , six rounds of artificial insemination , six rounds of daily injected drugs , and four rounds of in - vitro fertilization .
Pamela Madsen had four rounds of in - vitro fertilization before her sons Spencer , left , and Tyler , were conceived .
She 's madly in love with the results -- son Tyler is 19 and Spencer is 15 -- but she did n't always love the process .
That 's why she started the American Fertility Association -- to help other couples in the same position .
" Getting pregnant is n't always an easy thing to do , " said Madsen .
" Doctors are not gods , and you have to remember that no one 's going to care about you as much as you are . "
Here are a few things Madsen said she did right while going through infertility treatments .
1. Get Dad out of the hot tub
Couples often forget that 40 percent of infertility is due to something wrong with the man , according to Sheryl Kingsberg , chief of the division of behavioral medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine .
That means Dad has to watch what he does .
Hot tubs are one example .
" Sitting in a 103 - degree tub for prolonged periods of time may impair sperm quality , " said Dr. Alan Copperman , with Reproductive Medicine Associates in New York .
Being obese , smoking , drinking heavily , or using illegal drugs also can affect sperm count .
Women need to follow the same advice , because all of these can affect her fertility , too , Copperman added .
2 . Use an ovulation predictor kit
This is n't necessary , but it might speed a referral to a fertility specialist , according to Madsen .
" When you go to the doctor and you say you 're having trouble getting pregnant , they might tell you to just keep trying , " she said .
" But if you 've been using an ovulation kit , you can prove to the doctor you 've been trying at the right time of the month . "
How long you should wait depends on your age and your health history .
Fertility experts say if you 're under 35 , try for a year before proceeding with fertility treatments .
If you 've had certain problems -- endometriosis , for example , or irregular periods -- do n't wait that long , said Dr. Andrew Toledo with Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta , Georgia .
Women over the age of 35 should wait no longer than six months before getting help , experts said .
" There 's definitely a need to be proactive , but not panicky , " Toledo said .

3 . Go to a clinic that 's open seven days a week
When it comes to procedures such as harvesting eggs and implanting embryos , one day can make a difference , " Madsen said .
" If they 're not open seven days a week , they 're manipulating your cycle to fit their schedule . "
For help finding a fertility clinic , check success rate statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology .
Also , ask these questions suggested by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .
4 . Get a " cycle buddy " -- real or virtual
Madsen said one of the smartest things she did while trying to get pregnant was to strike up a conversation with another would - be mom over the coffee maker in her doctor 's waiting room .
" It turned out she was on the same cycle I was , and we became ' cycle buddies , ' " she said .
" I 'd talk to her for hours about the size of my follicles and the fluffiness of the lining of my uterus .
Believe me , no one else , including your husband , wants to talk endlessly about those details . "
If you 're too shy to accost another patient in the waiting room , find one on discussion forums at fertility groups such as Resolve , Inciid and the American Fertility Association .
5 . Get a second opinion
" If you feel like your doctor is n't paying attention to your case , or you feel like you 're just a number , or you 're not having success after several cycles , it 's really OK to ask for a second opinion , " Madsen said .
" And if your doctor is n't OK with that , that 's reason enough for you not to be there . "
In the midst of all this , do n't think you 're nuts if you start to feel little bit crazy , Kingsberg advised .
" The psychological impact of infertility cannot be overstated , " Kingsberg said .
" Your sexual lives are now open for scrutiny , your financial lives may be in jeopardy , the time commitment tends to interfere with work . "
Madsen agreed , and said couples should control what they can .
For example , early on , she asked nurses to call her husband with the results of pregnancy tests .
" I felt like I could handle it better hearing the news from my husband , " she said .
" We had six ' failure ' phone calls , and then one day my husband delivered flowers to my work that said " All my love to the both of you . "

Nearly a century after Danish physicist Niels Bohr offered his planet - like model of the hydrogen atom , a Rice University - led team of physicists has created giant , millimeter - sized atoms that resemble it more closely than any other experimental realization yet achieved .
Bohr offered the first successful theoretical model of the atom in 1913 , suggesting that electrons traveled in orbits around the atom 's nucleus like planets orbiting a star .
Bohr 's model led to a deeper understanding of both the chemical and optical properties of atoms and won him a Nobel Prize in 1922 .
But his notion of electrons traveling in discrete orbits was eventually displaced by quantum mechanics , which revealed that electrons do n't have precise positions but are instead distributed in wave - like patterns .
" In a sufficiently large system , the quantum effects at the atomic scale can transition into the classical mechanics found in Bohr 's model , " said lead researcher Barry Dunning , Rice 's Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy .
" Using highly excited Rydberg atoms and a series of pulsed electric fields , we were able to manipulate the electron motion and create circular , planet - like states . "
The team included members from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Vienna University of Technology .
Using lasers , the researchers excited potassium atoms to extremely high levels .
Using a carefully tailored series of short electric pulses , the team was then able to coax the atoms into a precise configuration with one point - like , " localized " electron orbiting far from the nucleus .
In fact , the atoms are true atomic giants , with diameters approaching one millimeter .
" Our measurements show that the electrons remain localized for several orbits and behave much as classical particles , " Dunning said .
He said the work has potential applications in next - generation computers and in the study of classical and quantum chaos .

Kuwait activates emergency war plan as three U.S. warships steam towards Iran
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , August 12 , 2008
The largest naval deployment since 1991 is unfolding as no less than three U.S. warships make their way towards the Persian Gulf in what observers are calling an “ unprecedented ” build - up , while Kuwait has activated its highest war alert in anticipation of a potential attack on Iran .
According to reports , the USS Theodore Roosevelt , the USS Ronald Reagan , and the USS Iwo Jima are steaming towards Middle East waters to reinforce the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Peleliu which are already in the region .
They will be joined by a British Royal Navy carrier battle group and a French nuclear hunter - killer submarine .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The maneuvers represent the largest movement of warships into the region since the 1991 Gulf War and come just a week after Operation Brimstone , a drill “ which saw more than a dozen warships from US , British and French naval forces conduct war games in the Atlantic Ocean in preparation for a possible confrontation with Iran , ” reports Press TV .
The deployment has fueled rumors that Georgia ’s sneak attack on Russia in South Ossetia , backed by the U.S. and Israel , was a shot across the bow to warn Russia against interfering in a strike on Iran which could be imminent .
Kuwait has activated its highest priority Emergency War Plan in response to the naval deployment .
“ Kuwait was caught by surprise last time , when Iraqi troops invaded the small emirate and routed the Kuwaiti army in just a few hours , ” a former US diplomat to Kuwait told the Middle East Times .
The Israeli news source Debka File speculates that the U.S. naval deployment could have five alternate implications .
1 . The US , aided also by France , Britain and Canada , is finalizing preparations for a partial naval blockade to deny Iran imports of benzene and other refined oil products .
This action would indicate that the Bush administration had thrown in the towel on stiff United Nations sanctions and decided to take matters in its own hands .
2 . Iran , which imports 40 percent of its refined fuel products from Gulf neighbors , will retaliate for the embargo by shutting the Strait of Hormuz oil route chokepoint , in which case the US naval and air force stand ready to reopen the Strait and fight back any Iranian attempt to break through the blockade .
3 . Washington is deploying forces as back - up for a possible Israeli military attack on Iran ’s nuclear installations .
4 . A potential rush of events in which a US - led blockade , Israeli attack and Iranian reprisals pile up in a very short time and precipitate a major military crisis .
5 . While a massive deployment of this nature calls for long planning , its occurrence at this time cannot be divorced from the flare - up of the Caucasian war between Russia and Georgia .
While Russia has strengthened its stake in Caspian oil resources by its overwhelming military intervention against Georgia , the Americans are investing might in defending the primary Persian Gulf oil sources of the West and the Far East .

While a tough guy can be reassuring , he ’s less reassuring when it ’s your child he ’s sending to die because “ we ’re all Georgians . ”
At rare moments in history , a military response is essential and required , as it was in World War II , and as it was in Afghanistan in the wake of Sept. 11 .
But more often , the choices offered by history are more complex , requiring judgment and wisdom .
Choosing confrontation and war too quickly when other options are available can prove disastrous , as the example of Iraq should have taught us .
McCain ’s instinct , demonstrated time and again and most recently now in Georgia , is to cast America as a global policeman .
In the next few months , American voters have to ask themselves whether they share that vision and instinct .

A common weedkiller in the U.S. , already suspected of causing sexual abnormalities in frogs and fish , has now been found to alter hormonal signaling in human cells , scientists from the University of California San Francisco ( UCSF ) report .
The herbicide atrazine is the second most widely used weedkiller in the U.S. , applied to corn and sorghum fields throughout the Midwest and also spread on suburban lawns and gardens .
It was banned in Europe after studies linked the chemical to endocrine disruptions in fish and amphibians .
The UCSF study is the first to identify its full effect on human cells .
It is being reported in the May 7 issue of the journal " PLoS One . "
In studies with human placental cells in culture , the UCSF scientists found that atrazine increased the activity of a gene associated with abnormal human birth weight when over - expressed in the placenta .
Atrazine also targeted a second gene that has been found to be amplified in the uterus of women with unexplained infertility .
In parallel studies of zebrafish , a widely used animal in development studies , the research team showed that atrazine " feminized " the fish population -- increasing the proportion of fish that developed into females .
In water with atrazine concentrations comparable to those found in runoff from agricultural fields , the proportion of female fish increased two - fold .
Environmental factors are known to influence the sex of zebrafish and many other fish and amphibians as they develop .
" These fish are very sensitive to endocrine disrupting chemicals , so one might think of them as ' sentinels ' to potential developmental dangers in humans , " said Holly Ingraham , PhD , senior author on the study and a UCSF Professor of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology .
" These atrazine - sensitive genes are central to normal reproduction and are found in steroid producing tissues .
You have to wonder about the long - term effects of exposing the rapidly developing fetus to atrazine or other endocrine disruptors . "
Ingraham intends to determine precisely how atrazine affects human and other mammalian endocrine cells and why these cells are particularly sensitive to it .
She notes that bisphenol A , a compound in many hard plastic consumer products , is also an endocrine disrupter and is now under increased study for its safety .
In April , Canada announced a decision to ban sale of consumer products with bisphenol A .

The lead author of the study is Miyuki Suzawa , a postdoctoral fellow in Ingraham 's lab .
UCSF researchers exposed sexually immature zebrafish to atrazine and other chemicals for different periods of time .
They found that exposure to atrazine for 48 hours at concentrations that might be found in water containing agricultural runoff , produced twice as many female fish .
Through genetic analysis , they found that atrazine preferentially activates a class of receptors in the cell nucleus , including two known as SF - 1 and LRH - 1 .
SF - 1 regulates production of enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroids in the body and development of many endocrine tissues .
One of these enzymes , known as Aromatase , plays a role in determining whether lower vertebrates , such as fish will become male or female .
Aromatase is known as a feminizing enzyme .
In the human placental cell culture studies , the scientists found that a 24 - hour exposure to atrazine activates a cluster of genes involved in hormone signaling and steroid synthesis .
They report , " Endocrine - related cell types with a capacity for steroid generation appear to be especially sensitive ( to Atrazine ) , as demonstrated by the " exquisite " cellular specificity of the atrazine response . "
The finding that a pervasive and persistent environmental chemical appears to significantly change hormone networks means that scientists must take a broader look at this herbicide 's potential effect on human health , Ingraham said .
Up to now , much of the focus has been on breast cancer , but since proper development of the endocrine system is important for normal reproduction , stress responses and metabolism , early exposure to this chemical in a fetus or infant might alter normal physiology later in life , she said .
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health .

In particular the RIAA has been spending a lot of time defending their " making available " argument , where they claim that simply sharing files is enough to qualify as copyright infringement . , the firm that finds alleged copyright infringers for them and gathers the information used to get initial subpoenas is also under fire With all that in mind Mr. Beckerman is doing his best to help put together an effective strategy against the .
In his August 12 blog post he saidHe also gives a number of examples that show the corner thehas backed themselves into .
The briefs he links to for examples paint a clear picture of the arguments labels have been making for years now .
Those same claims , by the way , are what judges are finally ruling on - and shooting down of course .
Perhaps the most striking thing about these cases is the arrogance of the , whose attorneys go so far as to calltheir investigator in one brief while claiming in another ( in the same case ) that That same brief also cites an opinion by the New York Attorney General on the requirements for licensing which specifically exempts patent infringement investigators working for attorneys .
It then argues that copyright investigation is equally exempt .
Setting aside for the moment that patent infringement is a very different matter than copyright , just as patent attorneys are so different from others that they have their own bar exam , it turns out the opinion cited was from 1919 , and not even based on current laws .
The question that comes immediately to mind is this .
If the 's arguments are so clearly in line with both written and case law why do they have to reach so far to prove it ?
T. Boone Pickens , the legendary wildcatter and corporate raider , has decided that drilling for more oil is not the answer to the nation ’s energy problems .
President Bush should listen to his fellow Texan and longtime political ally .
The 80 - year - old Mr. Pickens does not oppose drilling .
He ’s been doing it for most of his life .
Nor has he become a born - again eco-warrior ( a conservative , he helped underwrite and made no apologies for the Swift Boat campaign against John Kerry ) .
But he knows something that his friends in the White House wo n’t acknowledge : that a nation holding less than 3 percent of the world ’s oil reserves while guzzling 20 percent of the world ’s production will never be able to drill its way out of its dependency on foreign oil .
He also considers it absolute madness  financially and in terms of national security  to be spending $ 700 billion every year on imported oil produced in volatile and in some cases hostile countries .
His answer is to develop wind power in states with steady , forceful winds ( like Texas ) and use it instead of natural gas to produce electricity ( natural gas now generates about one - fifth of the power in the United States ) .
He would then use the natural gas saved to fuel cars and trucks .
He predicts that oil imports would drop by 40 percent and the country would save $ 300 billion a year .
Henrik Kniberg , author of Scrum and Xp from the Trenches , talked today at Agile 2008 about the most common ways for teams to fail despite applying agile practices and tools .
His presentation was organised as a talk about common problems and symptoms of those problems , with audience voting on what hurts them the most .
From my perspective , it was a very effective way to see problems of other teams and definitely raised the awareness of some of these issues .
The audience voted by raising coloured cards .
A green card signaled that a particular issue was not really hurting the voter , a yellow card signaled that it hurts a bit and a red card meant that the issue was a serious problem .
Here are the things that Kniberg talked about :
Believing the hype ( mostly yellow cards ) belief in magic — “ all the problems will magically go away when we install XP 1.0 ”
not willing to change — “ trying to chop the tree with a chainsaw ”
throwing out stuff that works
focusing too much on process perfection
trying to get it all right from start
blaming the messenger — scrum flushes out problems in the open
tool focus — ” let 's buy the biggest most expensive XP tool ”
focusing on the wrong issues ( should we use postits or index cards ) Definition of done ( mostly yellow and red cards ) not having one
not obeyng it
it 's outside the teams control ( in production , but team has no access to it ) Velocity issues ( mixed – yellow , green and red ) it 's not known
it 's not used
is misused ( connected to salary )
death marches
cheating
yo - yo velocity — bugs leaking into other iterations Retrospective problems ( mixed – yellow , green and red ) does n't happen
does n't result in concrete improvements
changes not executed and evaluated
unwanted people in the meeting – team not open
team members or product owner not participating
team is penalised for bad changes Team commitment issues ( more red than anything else , but mostly yellow ) team is pressured – deadlines , death marches , aggressive managers
team is not sitting together
team does not track and learn
always under - committing
always over - committing
velocity=0 — nothing actually delivered to the end
no slack Technical debt ( mostly red ) letting it pile up
ignoring it
fixing the product but not the process
big bang rewrites Teamwork issues ( yellow - red ) fixed roles — “ I do n't touch your stuff ever ”
personal backlogs
people not helping each other
personal incentive models
implementing all stories in parallel
management interference Product backlog and product owner / customer issues ( mostly red cards ) not having a backlog
having backlog but not visible
big or never - ending stories
product owner does not have power or domain knowledge
multiple , conflicting product owners
product backlog not being maintained
product owner surprised at sprint demo
product owner is a bottleneck
product owner not prioritising Mergofobia — merging is a pain and therefore we do it as seldom as possible ( mixed colours ) no “ done ” branch
no branch policies — purpose of each branch not clearly defined
not integrating early and often
not taking responsibility
hiding behind branches — “ whenever we have a problem , we add a new branch ” Sprint backlog / taskboard ( relatively mixed , mostly yellow ) does not exist
too far from the team
too complicated — " too many columns "
not used during daily scrum
not owned by he team — tool or way of maintenance imposed from above
no burndowns
not updated daily
warning signes ignored
From the votes , it looks like technical debt and product backlog and product owner / customer issues are the biggest problems for most teams
An interesting thing happened at the start of the talk , when Kniberg asked the audience to vote on “ this conference is too big ” , with most people raising red cards .
From what I can work out , at any time there are at least 30 sessions running concurrently and it is often a challenge to select a single session to attend .
U.S. child labor laws are child abuse Share This :
When I was sixteen , I ran away from home and lived on the streets for as short a period of time as I could manage .
I did not turn to prostitution or to drugs ; I was lucky .
Not in avoiding paid sex and substances -- these were deliberate choices .
I was lucky to be sixteen and , so , able to legally support myself .
If I had been two months younger , child labor laws would have forced me to beg or do far worse in order to survive .
People call me " an exception . "
They baldly state that most kids on the street would never choose low - paid honest jobs over well - paid criminal ones .
How do they know ?
Government does not permit a comparison to exist .
At sixteen , I decided that ' profits ' are not all monetary -- but this was something I knew at fifteen and fourteen as well .
I knew that prostitution and drugs were violent , disease - prone worlds in which I had no future .
Even if only a minority of under - aged runaways would make the same choice , how can anyone in good conscience deny them that opportunity ?
Another common comment is that I should have sought the assistance of a governmental agency .
There are at least two things wrong with this advice .
First , runaways are on the streets because authority figures in their lives have betrayed them .
Most of them will not willingly relinquish control to yet another authority .
Second , there is an assumption that government protects children , yet this is the same government that denies them the right to their own labor .
History frowns upon the belief that government protects children 's rights .
Consider child labor in 19th century Victorian Britain -- the well spring from which modern child labor laws evolved .
Immediately , hideous snapshots flash in the mind : five - year - olds being lowered into coal mines , wan children at textile mills , a Dickenesque Oliver asking for " more " .
These images are used to condemn the free market and the Industrial Revolution against whose evils a humanitarian government is said to have passed child labor laws .
This analysis is badly mistaken .
For one thing , it misses a key distinction .
Early 19th century Britain had two forms of child labor : free ; and , parish or ' pauper ' children .
Historians J.L. and Barbara Hammond , whose work on the British industrial revolution and child labor is considered definitive , clearly recognized this distinction .
The free market economist Lawrence W. Reed , in his brilliant essay " Child Labor and the British Industrial Revolution , " goes one step farther .
He recognizes the importance of the distinction .
Free labor children lived with their parents or guardians and worked during the day at wages agreeable to those adults .
But parents often refused to send their children into unusually harsh or dangerous work situations .
As Reed notes , " Private factory owners could not forcibly subjugate ' free labour ' children ; they could not compel them to work in conditions their parents found unacceptable . "
For example , the unacceptable position of ' scavenger ' in textile factories .
Typically , scavengers were young children -- about six - years - old -- who had to salvage loose cotton from under the machinery .
Because the machinery was running , the job was dangerous and injury was common .
Fortunately for businessmen willing to use the State to their advantage , government had no qualms about sending parish children to work under running machines .
Reed explains , " These youngsters [ parish children ] ... were under the direct authority and supervision not of their parents ... but of government officials . "
Parish workhouses had existed for centuries , but Victorian society with its stern Protestant work ethic was unique in considering poverty to be a personal moral failure on the part of the poor .
Sympathy for the downtrodden was also lessened by the fact that taxes for poor relief in 1832 were over five times higher than they had been in 1760 .
Gertrude Himmelfarb's book " The Idea of Poverty " chronicles this shift in attitude toward the poor from compassion to condemnation .
In 1832 , partly at the behest of labor - hungry manufacturers , the Royal Poor Law Commission began an inquiry into the " the practical operation of the laws for the relief of the poor . "
Its report divided the poor into two basic categories : lazy paupers who received governmental aid ; and , the industrious working poor who were self - supporting .
The result was the Poor Law of 1834 , which statesman Benjamin Disraeli called an announcement that " poverty is a crime . "
The Poor Law replaced outdoor relief ( subsidies and handouts ) with ' poor houses ' in which pauper children were virtually imprisoned .
There , the conditions were made purposely harsh to discourage people from applying .
Virtually every parish in Britain had abandoned workhouse children who , being bought and sold to factories , experienced the deepest horrors of child labor .
In this , the workhouses were merely continuing a practice common before the Poor Laws .
It is no coincidence that the first industrial novel published in Britain was " Michael Armstrong : Factory Boy " by Frances Trollope .
Michael was apprenticed to an agency for pauper children .
Nor is it coincidence that " Oliver Twist " was not abused by his parents , but by brutal workhouse officials in comparison to whom Fagin was a humanitarian .
And , remember , at the age of twelve with his family in debtor 's prison , Dickens himself was a pauper child who slaved at the Blacking Factory .
Reed observes , " [t ] he first Act in Britain that applied to factory children was passed to protect these very parish apprentices , not ' free labour ' children . "
The Act was explicit in doing so .
Even workhouse children with solvent parents could not always escape the grasp of officials .
The " Ashton Chronicle " ( June 23 , 1849 ) published an interview with pauper child Sarah Carpenter , who explained : " My father was a glass blower .
When I was eight years old my father died and our family had to go to the Bristol Workhouse .
My brother was sent from Bristol workhouse in the same way as many other children were - cart - loads at a time .
My mother did not know where he was for two years .
He was taken off in the dead of night without her knowledge , and the parish officers would never tell her where he was . "
Thus , in advocating the regulation of child labor , social reformers asked government to remedy abuses for which it was largely responsible .
Once more , government was " a disease masquerading as its own cure . "
To their credit , some reformers realized that regulations to help the poor did precisely the opposite .
Thus , the classical liberal John Bright -- a leader of the Anti-Corn Law movement that championed the poor -- voted against the Factory Act of 1844 in the British House of Commons .
The Act reduced the hours of work for children between eight and thirteen years old ; it also reduced the ability of poor families to survive .
But what of the other side of the equation -- the businessmen willing to use pauper children as slave labor ?
Consider one example .
To assuage labor shortages at his textile mills , Samuel Greg took children from workhouses .
Indeed , children were offered to him .
In February 1817 , the Vicar of Biddulph wrote to him : " The thought has occurred to me that some of the younger branches of the poor of this parish might be useful to you as apprentices in your factory at Quarry Bank .
If you are in want of any of the above , we could readily furnish you with 10 or more at from 9 to 12 years of age of both sexes . "
Usually , such children were apprenticed to an employer until the age of twenty - one .
When the local parishes no longer provided sufficient labor , Greg went as far as Liverpool and London for children .
Some parishes paid businessmen like Greg between two and four pounds to take a child off their hands .
The children received their board and lodging from Greg , as well as a small salary .
Greg saw himself as a humanitarian and , by contrast with workhouse officials , he probably was .
In " The Philosophy of Manufactures " ( 1835 ) , Andrew Ure wrote : " At... the great firm of Greg and Son .... stands a handsome house , two stories high , built for the accommodation of the female apprentices .
They are well fed , clothed and educated .
The apprentices have milk - porridge for breakfast , potatoes and bacon for dinner , and meat on Sundays . "
But no amount of decent treatment can obscure the fact that the children were stripped of the one thing they possessed -- their labor and the right to contract .
Nothing can convert the violation of their rights as laborers into an act of benevolence by Greg or by government officials .
Contemporary Child Labor
Government 's victimization of children through denying them their rights as laborers is not merely a matter of history .
In September 1990 , the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( UNCRC ) , already adopted by the UN General Assembly , came into force .
The human rights violations involved in child labor began to receive unprecedented attention .
There is no question : children around the globe are being coerced into slave labor situations that are appalling , and should be prohibited .
No one -- not parents , employers , or governments -- should be able to coerce children into or prohibit them from entering work situations .
Children old enough to be supporting themselves are old enough to make their own decisions .
The foregoing statement seems heartless .
The reverse is true .
The only real protections children can enjoy are the family structure and their ability to be self - sufficient .
In an ideal world -- a Western world -- families are prosperous and supportive : children are protected and educated .
In Third World countries , parents often cannot provide the basics of life for their children , who must trade their labor for sustenance .
The greatest act of benevolence is to recognize their right to contract and to work in the same manner as adult rights are respected .
Anything that interferes with the self - sufficiency necessary for their survival is child abuse .
This is what Third World governments , under pressure from the UN and the United States , are doing .
They are denying children the right to their labor -- to self - sufficiency -- by prohibiting children under a certain age from working .
In some countries , the minimum age is now eighteen .
And the standards of abusive child labor are so broadenly defined as to prohibit the possibility of voluntary child labor .
For example , Article 32 of the UNCRC affirms a child 's right to be â€œprotected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development . "
These standards would virtually eliminate all forms of child labor , whether coerced or voluntary , abusive or not .
In an article within " Child Workers in Asia " ( Vol. 15 . No. 3 , 1999 ) , Sulaiman Zuhdi Manik describes a work situation in Indonesia .
Namely , there are children " working on fishing platforms , called â€ ˜Jermalâ€™ , in the middle of the sea " where conditions are brutal .
The solution imposed , " An Indonesian Minister of Labour Circular Letter dated 1997 forbids child workers on Jermal and a 1998 Circular Letter from the Governor of North Sumatra forbids the Jermal owners to hire children under 18 . "
Are the children who are seventeen there by choice ?
Did all Jermal owners coerce or abuse their child laborers ?
And what became of the suddenly unemployed children ?
Only the latter question is answered in the article : " They are still being hired and forced to work under terrible conditions . "
What forces them ?
A coercive individual , or the reality of poverty through which they must survive ?
The question of what happens to children by government decree is dealt with more candidly on the UNICEF web site .
It describes garment factories in Bangladesh " following the introduction of the Child Labor Deterrence Act in 1992 by US Senator Tom Harkin .
The Bill would have prohibited the importation into the US of goods made using child labour .... [ W ] hen Senator Harkin reintroduced the Bill the following year ... garment employers dismissed an estimated 50,000 children from their factories , approximately 75 per cent of all children in the industry . "
UNICEF admitted to surprise at the consequences .
The children " were trapped in a harsh environment with no skills , little or no education , and precious few alternatives . "
In follow - up visits to homes and villages , UNICEF discovered that the " children went looking for new sources of income , and found them in work such as stone - crushing , street hustling and prostitution - all of them more hazardous and exploitative than garment production .
In
several cases , the mothers of dismissed children had to leave their jobs in order to look after their children . "
UNICEF 's proposed solution : increased governmental involvement and programs .
Having forced children into more hazardous labor and causing poor families to lose the income of mothers , the real solution to child labor never seems to occur to such agencies .
Namely , to call for the labor rights of all children to be respected .
Instead , they promote the opposite : they call for the inability of children to contract their labor as free human beings .
Some pieces of legislation seem to address the difference between voluntary and coerced child labor .
For example , on June 12 , 1999 , the White House issued an Executive Order entitled " Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor . "
Moreover , the Order 's definition seems adequate : " ' Forced or indentured child labor ' means all work or service
(1 ) exacted from any person under the age of 18 under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself voluntarily ; or ( 2 ) performed by any person under the age of 18 pursuant to a contract the enforcement of which can be accomplished by process or penalties . "
Critics might and should decry the further intrusion of government into the sphere of business , how can the Order be criticized on the basis of harming voluntary child laborers ?
It will do so in the same manner as the bill proposed by Senator Harkin .
The Executive Order instructs the Department of Labor to " publish in the Federal Register a list of products , identified by their country of origin , that those Departments have a reasonable basis to believe * might * have been mined , produced , or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor . " [ Emphasis added ]
At the mere whiff of such a mention , any prudent American business will cease to deal with the suspected producer .
At the mere possibility of being mentioned , foreign business -- like the garment industry in Bangladesh -- will dismiss child laborers , voluntary or not .
Thus , " The Economist " ( January 15 - 21 , 2000 ) advises rich nations who wish to ease the pain of Third World child labor " to send the children aid rather than impose harmful trade sanctions .
If exports made by child labour are banned , children often end up unemployed or in unregulated sectors such as prostitution . "
Conclusion
The foregoing analysis will seem callous to many .
This is especially true of the many good hearted people who support child labor measures in the belief that passing a piece of paper through a governmental body will change a complicated social situation .
Such people sleep better at night because they have " done something . "
One of the things they accomplish is to make fifteen - year - old runaways in their own back alleys turn to prostitution .
The effect on Third World children may be far more devastating .

The History of Child Labor LawsConsider child labor in 19th century Victorian Britain -- the well spring from which modern child labor laws evolved .
Immediately , hideous snapshots flash in the mind : five - year - olds being lowered into coal mines , wan children at textile mills , a Dickenesque Oliver asking for " more " .
These images are used to condemn the free market and the Industrial Revolution against whose evils a humanitarian government is said to have passed child labor laws .
This analysis is badly mistaken .
For one thing , it misses a key distinction .
Early 19th century Britain had two forms of child labor : free ; and , parish or ' pauper ' children .
Historians J.L. and Barbara Hammond , whose work on the British industrial revolution and child labor is considered definitive , clearly recognized this distinction .
The free market economist Lawrence W. Reed , in his brilliant essay " Child Labor and the British Industrial Revolution , " goes one step farther .
He recognizes the importance of the distinction .
Free labor children lived with their parents or guardians and worked during the day at wages agreeable to those adults .
But parents often refused to send their children into unusually harsh or dangerous work situations .
As Reed notes , " Private factory owners could not forcibly subjugate ' free labour ' children ; they could not compel them to work in conditions their parents found unacceptable . "
For example , the unacceptable position of ' scavenger ' in textile factories .
Typically , scavengers were young children -- about six - years - old -- who had to salvage loose cotton from under the machinery .
Because the machinery was running , the job was dangerous and injury was common .
Fortunately for businessmen willing to use the State to their advantage , government had no qualms about sending parish children to work under running machines .
Reed explains , " These youngsters [ parish children ] ... were under the direct authority and supervision not of their parents ... but of government officials . "
Parish workhouses had existed for centuries , but Victorian society with its stern Protestant work ethic was unique in considering poverty to be a personal moral failure on the part of the poor .
Sympathy for the downtrodden was also lessened by the fact that taxes for poor relief in 1832 were over five times higher than they had been in 1760 .
Gertrude Himmelfarb's book " The Idea of Poverty " chronicles this shift in attitude toward the poor from compassion to condemnation .
In 1832 , partly at the behest of labor - hungry manufacturers , the Royal Poor Law Commission began an inquiry into the " the practical operation of the laws for the relief of the poor . "
Its report divided the poor into two basic categories : lazy paupers who received governmental aid ; and , the industrious working poor who were self - supporting .
The result was the Poor Law of 1834 , which statesman Benjamin Disraeli called an announcement that " poverty is a crime . "
The Poor Law replaced outdoor relief ( subsidies and handouts ) with ' poor houses ' in which pauper children were virtually imprisoned .
There , the conditions were made purposely harsh to discourage people from applying .
Virtually every parish in Britain had abandoned workhouse children who , being bought and sold to factories , experienced the deepest horrors of child labor .
In this , the workhouses were merely continuing a practice common before the Poor Laws .
It is no coincidence that the first industrial novel published in Britain was " Michael Armstrong : Factory Boy " by Frances Trollope .
Michael was apprenticed to an agency for pauper children .
Nor is it coincidence that " Oliver Twist " was not abused by his parents , but by brutal workhouse officials in comparison to whom Fagin was a humanitarian .
And , remember , at the age of twelve with his family in debtor 's prison , Dickens himself was a pauper child who slaved at the Blacking Factory .
Reed observes , " [t ] he first Act in Britain that applied to factory children was passed to protect these very parish apprentices , not ' free labour ' children . "
The Act was explicit in doing so .
Even workhouse children with solvent parents could not always escape the grasp of officials .
The " Ashton Chronicle " ( June 23 , 1849 ) published an interview with pauper child Sarah Carpenter , who explained : " My father was a glass blower .
When I was eight years old my father died and our family had to go to the Bristol Workhouse .
My brother was sent from Bristol workhouse in the same way as many other children were - cart - loads at a time .
My mother did not know where he was for two years .
He was taken off in the dead of night without her knowledge , and the parish officers would never tell her where he was .
" Thus , in advocating the regulation of child labor , social reformers asked government to remedy abuses for which it was largely responsible .
Once more , government was " a disease masquerading as its own cure . "
To their credit , some reformers realized that regulations to help the poor did precisely the opposite .
Thus , the classical liberal John Bright -- a leader of the Anti-Corn Law movement that championed the poor -- voted against the Factory Act of 1844 in the British House of Commons .
The Act reduced the hours of work for children between eight and thirteen years old ; it also reduced the ability of poor families to survive .
But what of the other side of the equation -- the businessmen willing to use pauper children as slave labor ?
Consider one example .
To assuage labor shortages at his textile mills , Samuel Greg took children from workhouses .
Indeed , children were offered to him .
In February 1817 , the Vicar of Biddulph wrote to him : " The thought has occurred to me that some of the younger branches of the poor of this parish might be useful to you as apprentices in your factory at Quarry Bank .
If you are in want of any of the above , we could readily furnish you with 10 or more at from 9 to 12 years of age of both sexes . "
Usually , such children were apprenticed to an employer until the age of twenty - one .
When the local parishes no longer provided sufficient labor , Greg went as far as Liverpool and London for children .
Some parishes paid businessmen like Greg between two and four pounds to take a child off their hands .
The children received their board and lodging from Greg , as well as a small salary .
Greg saw himself as a humanitarian and , by contrast with workhouse officials , he probably was .
In " The Philosophy of Manufactures " ( 1835 ) , Andrew Ure wrote : " At... the great firm of Greg and Son .... stands a handsome house , two stories high , built for the accommodation of the female apprentices .
They are well fed , clothed and educated .
The apprentices have milk - porridge for breakfast , potatoes and bacon for dinner , and meat on Sundays .
" But no amount of decent treatment can obscure the fact that the children were stripped of the one thing they possessed -- their labor and the right to contract .
Nothing can convert the violation of their rights as laborers into an act of benevolence by Greg or by government officials .
Contemporary Child LaborGovernment 's victimization of children through denying them their rights as laborers is not merely a matter of history .
In September 1990 , the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( UNCRC ) , already adopted by the UN General Assembly , came into force .
The human rights violations involved in child labor began to receive unprecedented attention .
There is no question : children around the globe are being coerced into slave labor situations that are appalling , and should be prohibited .
No one -- not parents , employers , or governments -- should be able to coerce children into or prohibit them from entering work situations .
Children old enough to be supporting themselves are old enough to make their own decisions .
The foregoing statement seems heartless .
The reverse is true .
The only real protections children can enjoy are the family structure and their ability to be self - sufficient .
In an ideal world -- a Western world -- families are prosperous and supportive : children are protected and educated .
In Third World countries , parents often cannot provide the basics of life for their children , who must trade their labor for sustenance .
The greatest act of benevolence is to recognize their right to contract and to work in the same manner as adult rights are respected .
Anything that interferes with the self - sufficiency necessary for their survival is child abuse .
This is what Third World governments , under pressure from the UN and the United States , are doing .
They are denying children the right to their labor -- to self - sufficiency -- by prohibiting children under a certain age from working .
In some countries , the minimum age is now eighteen .
And the standards of abusive child labor are so broadenly defined as to prohibit the possibility of voluntary child labor .
For example , Article 32 of the UNCRC affirms a child 's right to be â€œprotected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development . "
These standards would virtually eliminate all forms of child labor , whether coerced or voluntary , abusive or not .
In an article within " Child Workers in Asia " ( Vol. 15 . No. 3 , 1999 ) , Sulaiman Zuhdi Manik describes a work situation in Indonesia .
Namely , there are children " working on fishing platforms , called â€ ˜Jermalâ€™ , in the middle of the sea " where conditions are brutal .

Are the children who are seventeen there by choice ?
Did all Jermal owners coerce or abuse their child laborers ?
And what became of the suddenly unemployed children ?
Only the latter question is answered in the article : " They are still being hired and forced to work under terrible conditions . "

I was sixteen , I ran away from home and lived on the streets for as short a period of time as I could manage .
I did not turn to prostitution or to drugs ; I was lucky .
Not in avoiding paid sex and substances -- these were deliberate choices .
I was lucky to be sixteen and , so , able to legally support myself .
If I had been two months younger , child labor laws would have forced me to beg or do far worse in order to survive .
People call me " an exception . "
They baldly state that most kids on the street would never choose low - paid honest jobs over well - paid criminal ones .
How do they know ?
Government does not permit a comparison to exist .
At sixteen , I decided that ' profits ' are not all monetary -- but this was something I knew at fifteen and fourteen as well .
I knew that prostitution and drugs were violent , disease - prone worlds in which I had no future .
Even if only a minority of under - aged runaways would make the same choice , how can anyone in good conscience deny them that opportunity ?
Another common comment is that I should have sought the assistance of a governmental agency .
There are at least two things wrong with this advice .
First , runaways are on the streets because authority figures in their lives have betrayed them .
Most of them will not willingly relinquish control to yet another authority .
Second , there is an assumption that government protects children , yet this is the same government that denies them the right to their own labor .
History frowns upon the belief that government protects children 's rights .
These shoes ain't made for workin ' , the TUC says
Bosses who force employees to wear high heels as part of their work dress should reconsider their policy , the TUC union body has said .
Several " big City institutions and upmarket shops " were the worst offenders , it added , urging them to permit " healthy and safe footwear " .
Slip - on shoes and high heels can lead to long - term foot problems , it said , especially with prolonged standing .
Workers should be able to wear footwear appropriate to their job , the TUC said .
' Blatantly sexist '
" Heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on Hollywood stars , but they 're not appropriate for day - to - day work wear , " said TUC general secretary Brendan Barber
" These dress codes - apart from being blatantly sexist - can lead to long - term foot and back problems as women are forced to stand or walk around in high heels or ill - fitting footwear . "
He added that " instead of worrying about what their staff look like " , employers should concentrate on the impact that the wrong shoes and standing for prolonged periods can have .
" We were surprised how many times we found that employers ' dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable sensible footwear by women , " Mr Barber said .
" Employers should look at encouraging their staff to come to work in comfortable shoes and , where possible , provide the option of sitting . "
The TUC 's report , Working Feet and Footwear , also looked at issues including firms providing slip - resistant shoes when needed .
And where there was the possibility of standing on nails or other sharp objects , bosses must ensure that staff wore shoes with puncture - resistant soles , the TUC added .
I 'm not gullible enough to believe something that outrageous .
They sell overpriced souvenirs to gullible tourists .

Rove must testify or risk contempt Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Former White House political guru Karl Rove has no problem spouting off his opinions to Fox News or the Wall Street Journal , but he 's being quite cagey in his attempt to avoid sworn testimony on his role in the US Attorney firing scandal .
Two prominent House Democrats wrote to Rove 's lawyer Thursday warning that the man who was known as " Bush 's Brain " must comply with a subpoena demanding his testimony or he risks criminal contempt of Congress charges .
Rove has been subpoenaed to appear at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing next week ; attorney Robert Luskin has been trying to free him from that obligation , instead offering that Rove would speak to committee members behind closed doors , off the record and not under oath .
" We want to make clear that the Subcommittee will convene as scheduled and expects Mr. Rove to appear , and that a refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject Mr. Rove to contempt proceedings , including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives , " wrote Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - CA ) and Rep. Linda Sánchez ( D - CA ) , chair of an administrative law subcommittee .
The lawmakers have been investigating the dismissal of at least nine federal prosecutors in what they say was a politically motivated purge likely orchestrated by Rove .
Also of interest to the committee , is the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegleman , a Democrat , on what observers say were trumped up charges ; Rove 's fingerprints also are on that case .
In an earlier letter , Luskin claimed Rove would be unable to testify because of executive privilege being invoked by President Bush .
Conyers and Sanchez remind Luskin that the prominent DC attorney had said publicly that Rove would respond to a subpoena , and they note that several other Bush administration officials have testified to Congress , such as onetime press secretary Scott McClellan , who responded to an invitation , and Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff David Addington , who reluctantly appeared in response to a subpoena .
The lawmakers ' letter appears below :
Mr. Robert D. Luskin
Patton Boggs LLP
2550 M Street , N.W .
Washington , DC 20037- 1350
Dear Mr. Luskin :
We were disappointed to receive your July 1 letter indicating that your client Karl Rove does not intend to appear before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law on July 10 , in violation of the subpoena directing him to do so .
Your letter is all the more disappointing since other current and former White House officials have testified before the Committee , both voluntarily and pursuant to subpoena , and since you have publicly stated that Mr. Rove would testify if subpoenaed by Congress .
We want to make clear that the Subcommittee will convene as scheduled and expects Mr. Rove to appear , and that a refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject Mr. Rove to contempt proceedings , including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives .
Your letter states that Mr. Rove will not attend the hearing because he is obligated to disregard the subpoena as a result of the White Houses claim of immunity for former advisors .
In fact , precisely the opposite is true .
As a private party , Mr. Rove is obligated  to comply with the subpoena issued to him and , at the very least , appear at the July 10 hearing .
Indeed , in a similar situation in the 1970s , when the White House attempted to instruct a private party , AT&T , not to comply with a House Subcommittee subpoena , AT&T felt obligated to disregard those instructions and to comply with the subpoena ,  resulting in a lawsuit by the Administration seeking to enjoin such compliance .
In addition , refusing even to attend the hearing flies in the face of the recent conduct of several high - ranking White House officials , including current vice presidential Chief of Staff and presidential assistant David Addington and former White House press secretary Scott McClellan , who testified before the Committee upon invitation ( McClellan ) or subpoena ( Addington ) .
Former White House officials have also testified under subpoena before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Indeed , when you were asked by a media representative whether Mr. Rove would testify before Congress in response to a subpoena on the Siegelman matter , you responded sure by e-mail .
The Subcommittee is prepared to consider objections to specific questions on privilege grounds , but there is no proper basis for the refusal to appear altogether .
Finally , although we remain willing to discuss proposals to seek to resolve this matter , we want to restate that attempting to separate the Siegelman matter from our related concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department is not acceptable .
In fact , your own April 29 letter appears to recognize that the Siegelman matter , other selective prosecution matters , and the U.S. Attorney firings are clearly related as part of the concerns regarding politicization of the Department under this Administration .
For this reason , an artificially truncated interview such as the one you propose would not be constructive ,  but could instead limit the Committees ability to understand any role played by Mr. Rove in the matters under investigation .
We strongly urge you to reconsider your position , and to advise your client to appear before the Subcommittee on July 10 pursuant to his legal obligations .
Please direct any questions or communications to the Judiciary Committee office , 2138 Rayburn House Office Building , Washington , DC 20515 ( tel : 202-225-3951 ; fax : 202-225-7680 ) .
Sincerely ,
John C. Conyers , Jr.

U.S. Guns Arming Mexican Drug Gangs ; Second Amendment to Blame ?
More than 90 percent of weapons used by Mexico 's drug gangs come from U.S .
April 22 , 2008  -- U.S. gun stores and gun shows are the source of more than 90 percent of the weapons being used by Mexico 's ruthless drug cartels , according to U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials .
" It 's a war going on in Mexico , and these types of firearms are the weapons of war for them , " said Bill Newell , the special agent in charge of the Phoenix field division of the ATF , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , which has primary law enforcement jurisdiction for investigating gun trafficking to Mexico .
" It 's virtually impossible to buy a firearm in Mexico as a private citizen , so this country is where they come , " said Newell .
But U.S. efforts to stop the smuggling of tens of thousands of guns to Mexico , including high - powered assault weapons , have been hampered by lenient American gun laws and the Bush administration 's failure to give priority to anti-gun smuggling efforts , officials tell ABC News for a report Tuesday on ABC News '
" World News With Charles Gibson . "
President Bush said today at a press conference that Mexican President Felipe Calderon again raised the issue of guns at their meeting in New Orleans .
Mexico 's strict gun laws are being subverted by the easy availability of weapons in the U.S. , the Mexican attorney general , Eduardo Medina - Mora Icaza , told ABC News .
" The Second Amendment , " said the attorney general , " is certainly not designed to arm and give fire power to organized crime abroad . "
More than 3,400 people have been killed by the drug cartels in the last 15 months , 2,000 of them law enforcement officials , according to the Mexican attorney general .
U.S. and Mexican officials say they have traced most of the thousands of high - powered weapons seized from the drug cartels to gun dealers in Texas , California and Arizona .
Assault weapons made in China and Eastern Europe , resembling the AK - 47 , have become widely and cheaply available in the U.S. since Congress and the Bush administration refused to extend a ban on such weapons in 2004 .
Under federal gun laws , gun dealers are not required to report multiple purchases of such weapons because they are classified as rifles .
" If you were to go into a gun store and buy 20 of these , there is no requirement by the gun dealer to fill out a multiple sales form , " said the ATF 's Newell .
The drug cartels ' weapons of choice include variants of the AK - 47 , .50 - caliber sniper rifles and a Belgian - made pistol called the " cop killer " or " mata policia " because of its ability to pierce a bulletproof vest .
" It 's in high demand by your violent drug cartels , their assassins in Mexico , " said Newell of the ATF .
The gun can fire a high - powered round used in a rifle .
An ABC News investigation found the " mata policia " and a wide range of assault weapons prominently displayed at gun stores along the border in Texas , the state providing the most weapons to the drug cartels , according to the ATF .
Under Texas and federal law , there is no waiting period for the purchase of such weapons and no restriction on how many can be bought at a time .
U.S. officials say there is little they can do to go after licensed gun dealers because large purchases , dozens or hundreds at a time , are legal for U.S. citizens and legal immigrants with an INS green card unless a gun dealer suspects the purchase is being made for someone else .
ATF agents say legitimate gun dealers will often report suspicious activities , but that a small but significant number looks the other way .
" I have personally worked cases where gun dealers have willfully allowed hundreds of guns to leave their gun store knowing that they were going into the wrong hands , " said Newell .
While the Bush administration has asked for an additional $ 100 million to combat drug violence on the border , only $ 948,000 , less than one percent , has been allocated to the ATF under the White House proposal .
" We need a lot more resources , " said the ATF 's Newell .
" It sure shows a lack of concern on our part for this piece of the problem , " said Sen. Jeff Bingaman , D - N.M. , who has introduced legislation to give the ATF an additional $ 15 million to improve border efforts .

Rangel Now Only Hoards Three Rent Controlled Apartments ]
In case you missed it , powerful New York Congressman Charlie Rangel has been hoarding four apartments in Harlem ’s Lenox Terrace .
Coincidently ( perhaps not so coincidently ) Lennox Terrace is the same building where New York ’s Governor Patterson , Patterson ’s father , former Manhattan Borough President , Percy E. Sutton , and Rangel ’s Cheif of Staff , Jim Capel hoard rent - controlled ( ahem , Rent Stabilized as it ’s referred to by NY politicians ) apartments .
Not only does Rangel have four rent - controlled apartments in the building , but he has been using one of those apartments as a campaign office !

The Times reported on Friday that Mr. Rangel has four rent - stabilized apartments at Lenox Terrace , including three adjacent units on the 16th floor overlooking Upper Manhattan , in a building owned by one of New York ’s premier real estate developers .
( The apartment is featured in “ Style and Grace : African Americans at Home , ” a book published by Bulfinch Press . )
Mr. Rangel , the powerful Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , uses his fourth apartment , six floors below , as a campaign office , despite state and city regulations that require rent - stabilized apartments to be used as a primary residence .
Mr. Rangel , who has a net worth of $ 566,000 to $ 1.2 million , according to Congressional disclosure records , paid a total rent of $ 3,894 monthly in 2007 for the four apartments at Lenox Terrace , a 1,700 - unit luxury development of six towers , with doormen , that is described in real estate publications as Harlem ’s most prestigious address .
The current market - rate rent for similar apartments in Mr. Rangel ’s building would total $ 7,465 to $ 8,125 a month , according to the Web site of the owner , the Olnick Organization .
The use of multiple apartments that might not normally be available to other tenants could pose legal or ethical problems for Mr. Rangel .
The House Ethics Manual defined a gift as “ a gratuity , favor , discount , entertainment , hospitality , loan , forbearance , or other item having monetary value . ”
But Mr. Rangel dismissed the notion that his housing arrangements could be construed as a gift .
“ Paying the legal rent is not a gift .
Are you doing this deliberately or are you just stupid ?
Listen — if you are paying a legal rent and without the law the rent would be higher , just what school did you go to that could misinterpret that as a gift ? ”
Well , if it was n’t a gift it , it is legalized theft !
What is the scale of the gift ( or legalized theft ) ?
According to the NY Times it is about $ 30,000 per year :
Some Congressional ethics experts have said that while it appeared legitimate for Mr. Rangel to have one rent - stabilized apartment , the difference between what he paid for the second , third and fourth apartments and what a new market - rate tenant would pay — some $ 30,000 annually — could be considered a gift because it was given at the discretion of the landlord and was not generally available to the public .
Of course , there ’s nothing wrong with him having four apartments , but I do n’t see any reason why Rangel could n’t pay market rates for his rent .
Even fans of rent conrol must see this as hoarding that prevents four other families from renting those stabilized units .

WCBSTV – Rangel ’s Apartments Renew NYC Rent Control Debate I liked this quote from CBSTV :
Jason Kirby , who pays $ 1,900 a month for an unstabilized one - bedroom apartment in the same building , said he also has a deal , compared to the space he was renting on the Upper East Side .
Even if his rent was stabilized , the 35 - year - old restaurant manager is going to move to the suburbs in a few years , for even more space .
He called rent - stabilization “ a golden pair of handcuffs ” in the city .
“ The benefit of being here and staying here and making your home here in the city is you get , if you ’re lucky enough , a rent stabilized apartment . …
Then you ca n’t go anywhere else . ”
A Russian researcher has reported there are holes in the patch for the DNS flaw that threatened the foundations of the Internet .
Just a month ago , Dan Kaminsky told the world that the Internet ’s Domain Name Server system for routing Internet users to the proper addresses for web sites could be compromised .
He had organized a months - long effort to create a patch to fix the problem .
But not it appears the patch does n’t do the job , according to a story in the New York Times .
It confirms Kaminsky ’s own warning that the patch was a stopgap measure and that there were worse things coming out .
Evgeniy Polyakov , a physicist , said that he figured out a flaw in the patch for DNS , which is like the Internet ’s telephone book , in just ten hours of work .
He posted the news on his blog .
Kaminsky said at Black
Hat this week that the threat of the flaw was wider than he announced on July 8 .
That ’s because there are a series of common Internet functions — such as sending a new password to a user who has forgotten it — that depend on the accuracy of DNS addresses .
( Our interview with Kaminsky ) .
Meanwhile , companies such as Secure64 , which makes a secure operating system , are advocating a shift from DNS to a more secure form of the addressing system , dubbed DNSSEC .
But it will likely take a long time for such an infrastructure shift to be implemented .
The patch is still better than no patch at all .
“ The question is , if you are in a boat , which would you rather have – a gaping hole letting water flood in , or a pinhole ? , ” said Brian Dickson , a DNS expert , in an email .
“ Hint : With a pinhole leak , you have the option of bailing water out of your boat until help arrives … with a gaping hole , not so much . ”
Update : Kaminsky said today that the hack on the patch is n’t particularly alarming and that he predicted it would be possible in his own talk .
He noted that before the patch , it would take 32,000 packets and a very short amount of time to crack DNS addressing systems .
The attack used by the Russian researcher took 10 hours with a high - speed link using billions of packets .
That risk , Kaminsky said , was an acceptable one and it means that the community should now proceed with implementing a permanent fix .
Tehran , Aug 12 , IRNA - One of the best universities of the world is in Iran , the Newsweek weekly said in its latest edition , referring to Iran 's Sharif University of Science and Technology .
" Forget Harvard _ one of the world 's best undergraduate colleges is in Iran , " said the news weekly in an article appeared in its August 9 edition .
It said that Sharif University has now one of the best undergraduate electrical - engineering programs in the world .
The Star Students Of The Islamic Republic By Afshin Molavi | NEWSWEEK
In 2003 , administrators at Stanford University 's Electrical Engineering Department were startled when a group of foreign students aced the notoriously difficult Ph.D. entrance exam , getting some of the highest scores ever .
That the whiz kids were n't American was n't odd ; students from Asia and elsewhere excel in U.S. programs .
The surprising thing , say Stanford administrators , is that the majority came from one country and one school : Sharif University of Science and Technology in Iran .

Newsweek quoted Bruce A. Wooley , a former chair of the Electrical Engineering Department , as saying , " Stanford has become a favorite destination of Sharif grads . "
Noting that Iranian students are developing " an international reputation as science superstars , " the weekly added .
" Iranian students from Sharif and other top schools , such as the University of Tehran and the Isfahan University of Technology , have also become major players in the international Science Olympics , taking home trophies in physics , mathematics , chemistry and robotics . "
According to the news magazine most of the grads of Iranian universities were working with major international companies .
" The Silicon Valley companies from Google to Yahoo now employ hundreds of Iranian grads , as do research institutes throughout the West .
Olympiad winners are especially attractive ; according to the Iranian press , up to 90 percent of them now leave the country for graduate school or work abroad . "
Newsweek said that one of the major reasons behind the success of Sharif University was its " extremely rigorous selection process . "
" The selection process [ gives ] universities like Sharif the smartest , most motivated and hardworking students in the country , " the weekly quoted one of Sharif 's former grads Mohammad Mansouri as saying .
The magazine added that boasting an excellent faculty and Iran 's high - school system were other secrets of Sharif 's success .
According to Newsweek Iran 's high - school system , places a premium on science and exposes students to subjects Americans do n't encounter until college .
The concept of the H2 economy has fizzled from its peak along with many stock options but it still seems to creep up every once in a while .
Every car manufacturer has a PEM fuel cell program and occasionally I see an ad on TV promoting a fuel cell car which is " right around the corner " .
Here 's a tricky ad for Honda 's fuel cell car that was recently brought to my attention .
Now , the technology works , no doubt about it .
If you live in the Southern California area , for $ 600 / month you can lease Honda 's fuel cell car .
Last year I took a test drive in a Ford Focus with a Ballard PEM fuel cell and a compressed H2 tank stuffed into the trunk .
They could n't tell me how much it cost but I was told it was insured for $ 250,000 .
Also no mention of the lifetime , but the last person I spoke to about this who works in the business ( it was a Japanese maker ) tells me that they 're at the 5 year mark before problems arise and the target is to double that .
I have confidence that they 'll be able to double it , just like they 've been able to fix the sub zero freezing start issue .
The problem with the H2 economy is n't in the technology , it's in the thermodynamics when compared against battery cars ( note , batteries do have their own problems ) .
Making H2 is extremely hard to justify when you can keep electricity on the grid and charge up a battery instead .
This is n't to say that H2 as a fuel is a goner all together , it just means it will have a much smaller impact than previously thought .
It 's the so called hydrogen economy which is a goner , and the market knows it .
This smaller impact is largely reflective of the correction in Ballard 's stock price that happened about 8 years ago now when they first decided to investigate PEM fuel cells for stationary power generation , a much smaller market than the transportation sector .

Ben : Joining me from Lucerne , Switzerland is Dr. Ulf Bossel who is the organizer of the European Fuel Cell Forum in Lucerne , which for me at least is one of the conferences to go to , although Switzerland 's Big Macs are a little more expensive than they are in Canada .
Ulf has been around fuel cells and renewable energy for a long time now , but Ulf , I think , one of your best credentials is that your great , great grandfather back in the 1830s , Christian Friedrich Schoenbein , was the first to figure out how fuel cells work .
Ulf Bossel : Yes , he is the discoverer of the fuel cell effect .
Ben :
So , fuel cells obviously run in your blood .
Ulf Bossel : Because of genes .
Ben :
In your genes , yes .
Ulf Bossel : Fuel cell genes .
Ben :
I have one of your books that you wrote about the history of fuel cells and it was dedicated to your great , great grandfather .
So , thanks for coming on the show by the way .
It is great to have you .
Ulf Bossel : Oh , thank you .
Ben :
So , the topic …
Ulf Bossel :
It 's a pleasure to have a show across the Atlantic .
Ben :
So , the topic today is about sustainability and where our energy will come from for the rest of the earth 's lifetime .
But before we get into that , you made a really significant announcement at the most recent European Fuel Cell Forum , which was the week of July 3rd and the announcement was that any discussion of hydrogen and PEM fuel cells will not be continued .
So , why did you make this announcement ?
Ulf Bossel : Well , the overriding issue is the creation and establishment of a sustainable energy future .
Sustainability , let me say that , it is a term which was coined by the Prussian Forest Administration back in 1790 or so and it means that one should never take more wood out of the forest than can re-grow between two harvesting periods .
That means we leave nature intact and just live from nature 's interest rates .
We take from nature what nature can provide without harming nature .
Now , in the energy field , we interact with nature in two ways .
We first interact when we draw energy from nature and then we interact again when we release the products of the energy use into nature .
Clearly , all fossil fuels are finite and therefore we cannot live off the fossil fuels forever .
This is also true for uranium , that is also depletive in whatever time this may be , but Uranium deposits will not last forever .
On the other hand , after energy use , we leave CO2 or radioactive waste behind which nature cannot absorb .
Therefore sustained energy can only come from renewable sources , i.e. solar , wind , biomass , hydropower , geothermal .
It means that a sustainable energy future will be based on energy from renewable sources used with the highest energy efficiency we can afford or we can accomplish between source and service , i.e. between energy harvest and energy use .
Ben :
So , basically hydrogen fuel cells just …
Ulf Bossel : Hydrogen is an artificial , synthetic fuel .
It has to be made from other energy .
If you look at renewable energy , most of it is harvested as electricity , some as biomass and some as solar heat , but basically most of the renewable energy is harvested as electricity .
Hydrogen has to be made artificially by splitting water by electrolysis .
This requires more energy than you will ever recover from the hydrogen .
However , hydrogen has to be compressed or liquefied for handling , it has to be distributed , and then reconverted back to , guess what , electricity .
That means electricity derived from hydrogen has to compete with its original energy source , electricity .
If you go through a hydrogen chain , you find that after the fuel cell only 25 % of the original electricity is available for use by consumers .
A hydrogen economy is a gigantic energy waste .
We cannot afford this in the future .
Therefore , three of four renewable energy power plants are needed to balance the losses within a hydrogen economy luxury .
Because of the losses , electricity derived from fuel cells and hydrogen must be four times more expensive than power from the grid .
Ben :
So , you might as well just keep it in grid form .
Ulf Bossel : Sure .
People will not choose the hydrogen roots to make their own electricity , but they will take it from the grid .
That means we have to extend the grid , of course .
We have to develop renewable electricity generation and electricity storage systems .
People talk about a hydrogen infrastructure .
We have to adjust the electricity infrastructure to meet the challenges of the future .
Ben :
So , why did you make this announcement now ?
I mean we have known about this problem for a while now .
Ulf Bossel :
There is no future to a hydrogen economy because it is much too wasteful .
We cannot solve the energy problem by energy waste .
The energy losses are all caused by laws of physics .
If you go through the entire hydrogen chain starting with AC - DC conversion , electrolysis , compression , or liquefaction , transportation , storage , re-conversion the electricity by fuel cells with subsequent DC - AC , there are additional losses in every process stage .
These are all related to physical processes .
This is physics , not poor handling , and as the laws of physics are eternal , there was no past , there is no present , and there will be no future for a hydrogen economy .
Hydrogen economy is a structure of mind , which has no backing by physics .
Ben :
Actually , I just want to clarify .
When people generally say hydrogen economy , what they overwhelmingly mean is hydrogen - fuelled vehicles , right ?
Ulf Bossel : Right .
This is part of the game , the hydrogen - fuelled vehicles , but electric vehicles will be four times less costly to drive .
Ben : Yeah .
Ulf Bossel : So , who wants to buy a hydrogen vehicle ?
Today , the plug - in hybrid is the proper development goal .
We will have plug - in hybrids in the sustainable energy world because 80 % of the driving is done for rides of less than 50 kilometers , or 50 miles .
80 % of the miles are driven in short - range commuting traffic .
Such short rides can all be handled with electric cars .
So , a plug - in hybrid means you fill up the batteries at home , you fill them up again at work and you commute between work and home with electricity .
When you take your car on longer rides or go on vacation you may fill up the tank with gasoline as long as it lasts , but with methanol or some fuel derived from biomass in the sustainable future .
This is the most likely picture of the future .
Ben :
I totally agree that hydrogen is much less efficient than batteries .
Just from quick back of the envelope calculations , if somebody drove a hydrogen - fuelled cell car , say 35 kilometers everyday , then the amount of extra electricity that you have to use to make that hydrogen is pretty much the same amount of electricity as the per capita electricity consumption in Germany .
Ulf Bossel : Yes , this sounds right .
Ben : Quite a bit .
If you went to battery cars , then you would be using the same amount of electricity as the per capita consumption of Poland .
Ulf Bossel : Yes , exactly .
There are a number of studies confirming this .
With the same amount of electricity , original electricity , be it from wind solar energy , with the same amount of electricity you can drive an electric car three times farther than a hydrogen car .
On 100 kWh of electricity you can drive an electric car 120 kilometers while a hydrogen fuel cell car of similar size can do only about 40 km .
If we want to have mobility and a sustainable future , we have to go for electric cars and not for hydrogen cars because we electric cars are less costly to operate .
It is not the vehicle technology , but a question of energy cost of the fuel .
Hydrogen must always be much more expensive than electricity needed to split water by electrolysis etc .
That is a very clear picture .
I have analyzed the situation to illustrate how much water and electricity is needed for certain hydrogen jobs .
If you take the Frankfurt Airport and Frankfurt Airport is perhaps comparable to the airport at Montreal .
About 50 jumbo jets leave Frankfurt every day , each charged with 130 tons of kerosene .
If you replace kerosene by hydrogen on a one - to - one energy base , each plane needs 50 tons of hydrogen .
As a side remark : 50 tons of liquid hydrogen occupy 720 cubic meters of space , while 130 tons of kerosene take only 160 cubic meters .
We need totally different airplanes for hydrogen .
But that is another story .
To fill the 50 jumbo jets one needs 2,500 tons of liquid hydrogen every day .
22,500 cubic meters of water , the water consumption of a city of 100,000 , must be split by electrolysis .
For this one the continuous electricity output of about eight nuclear power plants is needed .
Now , if the entire traffic at Frankfurt Airport was all done with hydrogen , one would need the water consumption of the City of Frankfurt plus about 25 nuclear power plants .
Using hydrogen for all public air and road transport in Germany , it would take the power output of about 400 nuclear power plants plus enormous amounts of water .
You need nine kilograms of water to make one kilogram of hydrogen .
The Rhine river and all other rivers would be dry in the summer because the water is used to make hydrogen .
So , we are really approaching limits and we have to talk about these limits before we talk about a hydrogen economy .
Ben :
So , while we are on the topic of flying , what can replace kerosene though ?
Ulf Bossel :
Well , in my vision , the long distance transport by air , ships and also transcontinental trucks , some railroads that is not electrified will continue to run on diesel or diesel - like fuels .
Ben : Okay .
Ulf Bossel : Or kerosene .
That means we have to reserve the last drop of fossil fuels of oil for these kinds of applications and we have to also reserve the diesel - like fuels we derived from biomass for these kinds of application .
We should not use biomass fuels for the local transport where we can use electricity , but airplanes cannot run on batteries or solar energy .
They cannot on hydrogen either because hydrogen is simply impractical for long distances .
We need different planes which are so bulky that they cannot fly at high speeds , but have to fly at low speed and still , their drag is so high that the fuel consumption is up .
So , the last drops of oil plus biomass fuels must remain reserved for long distance transportation by air sea and surface .
Ben : Okay .
So , let us just get back to my original question , which is why did you make this announcement now ?
I mean why not five years ago ?
Ulf Bossel : Well , the European Fuel Cell Forum is a completely independent body .
We are not receiving money .
We are not accepting money or asking for money from governments and other organizations because that would imply , that we can not be critical about energy policies .
But we are free to articulate our concerns .
Five years ago things were not that clear , but today the facts are on the table .
A hydrogen economy is in conflict with a sustainable energy future .
Even the promoter of hydrogen say , " Well , it will come in 30 years or so . "
Patents have a lifetime of 20 years .
Ben : Yeah .
Ulf Bossel :
That means all the research and development we do now will not be put to commercial use in the foreseeable future .
Why spend money for a technology , which may become useful in 30 years if we are not even 100 % sure that a hydrogen economy will ever come ?
Ben :
But is not there a risk though if you stop researching , say PEM fuel cells outright , then we might miss out on some accidental discoveries or spin - off technologies from the research ?
Ulf Bossel :
Well , the research can go on .
I am not stopping the research .
I just think that it is much more urgent to talk about the establishment of sustainable energy future .
That includes implementation of wind energy , solar energy , plus all measures to improve the energy efficiency , i.e. technical advances , infrastructure and whatever else we need .
All these issues have to be discussed in a broad sense by an international audience .
That is much more important than talking about the details of a particular energy conversion technology and one type of energy conversion device .
Ben : Yeah .
Ulf Bossel :
We have many different energy conversion devices .
Fuel cells have to compete with the internal combustion engine , with gas turbines and so on .
The problem with fuel cell that needs pure hydrogen , it is link to the hydrogen economy .
The decision is not against fuel cells .
Fuel cells are efficient energy conversion devices , but no new sources of energy .
We just had a successful solid oxide fuel cell congress and we will continue this conference series two years from now .
Next year we will feature the congress " Fuel Cells for a Sustainable World " .
We will discuss molten carbonate fuel cells , phosphoric acid fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells
Some of these fuel cells have already run 60,000 hours and more and doing well and we should continue to support these successful technologies .
However , we should not push solid polymer fuel cells because they have fundamental problem which apparently that can not be solved .
Even if these problems are overcome , it will remain a standalone technology , which can not be put into the market because there is no hydrogen fuel .
Ben :
Okay , so let us start talking about the sustainable energy path for us then .
I know early in the discussion you were talking about the electron economy and I know that you have written papers talking about how today about 80 % of our energy is derived from chemical energy and 20 % from physical sources and the future will be pretty much exactly the opposite , so can you explain that a bit ?
What is chemical energy ?
Ulf Bossel : Yes .
What people need is physical energy .
We need motion of vehicles , we need light , we need heat , and we need communication .
These are all physical energy .
People need chemical energy only for eating and drinking .
Okay , that is what the people 's needs are .
Now , to satisfy these needs , engineers of the 18th , 19th or 20th century have developed a fantastic technology for the conversion of chemical energy of fossil origin into physical energy needed by people : steam engines , gas turbines , internal combustion engines and so on .
All these inventions are fantastic .
It is a fantastic technology , but in the future this technology will run out of fuel because there is not enough of oil , gas and coal left to drive our economy .
Also , we may have political issues restricting access to fossil resources .
The use of fossil fuels may further be restricted to stop global warming .
Anyway , the renewable energy from wind , solar and so on is mainly harvested as electricity .
Therefore , as fossil resources become depleted , the chemical energy base vanishes .
Electricity from wind , water , waves , solar and ground heat will become the new energy base .
Once electricity has become our source energy , we should not make the mistake to convert it into chemical energy like hydrogen in order to continue with energy technologies which were developed to convert natural gas or fossil fuels to electricity or motion , but we should find the courage to say , " Goodbye steam engines .
Goodbye Carnot cycles .
Here we are with electricity .
We do n't need you any longer . "
Ben : Yeah .
Ulf Bossel :
This is what we should drive for .
We have to accept that our energy base is being changed from chemical today to physical tomorrow and conceptually , we have to be prepared to make this change and not replace the dwindling resources of fossil fuels by synthetic chemical fuels .
The worst you can think of is that hydrogen is made from natural gas , which it is supposed to replace .
Ben : Yeah .
Ulf Bossel :
It is really strange to hear people say that they make hydrogen by reforming fossil fuels in order to replace fossil fuels .
That does not make sense at all .
Ben :
So , the future of the 80 % of our energy will come from physical sources , wind , solar , geothermal type things , right ?
Ulf Bossel : Well , the 80 % is a number , which I think is practical .
Wherever people live , we can recover up to 20 % of the energy needs from organic waste produced by human and animal society .
It could also be residues from farming and food industry , or agriculture - produced biomass .
20 % is a realistic figure , but rest has to come from physical sources .
We have to install wind generators , solar power plants , photovoltaic arrays , small hydropower installations etc. to make up the rest and the difference could be about 80 % of the total energy needs .
Ben :
Do you think that this will provide us enough energy for our future ?
Ulf Bossel :
Yes , it will because the efficiency of an all electric system is about three times higher than it is today .
That means we can do the same , provide the same comfort , the same quality of life , the same living standard and the same energy services with one - third of today 's primary energy consumption .
Ben :
Yeah , that is a good point .
Ulf Bossel : Today we derive most of our comfort from primary fossil energy with is converted to electricity or motion at fairly low efficiency .
If the primary energy comes from sun , wind & Co. , the efficiency is 90 % between the renewable power source and people .
The electricity has to pass through a number of transformers , but it is never converted across the physical - chemical boundary
Ben :
And we will have to find a way to store electrons in an electron economy .
Ulf Bossel : Yes , this is right .
Exactly .
Ben :
And that will probably be done by , I mean it could be done by plugging vehicles , right ?
Just battery cars ?
Ulf Bossel : Yeah .
It is basically electricity has to be stored as physical energy .
That can be easily done with batteries , but physical energy can also be stored with flywheels , compressed air , pumped hydro storage etc .
The worst energy storage would be if we convert the physical energy " electricity " to the chemical energy " hydrogen " and then convert it back to electricity .
This has a roundtrip efficiency of about 35 - 45 % while compressed air has 75 % , flywheels perhaps 80 % and Lithium-ion batteries about 90 % .
Now , it seems to be best to store electrical energy in the form it will later be used .
For instance , in a 48 Volt battery for a 48 Volt electric car .
You could also run a refrigerator at night to make enough ice to keep the appliance cold for the entire next day .
There are many things we can do .
Electric cars will have the wonderful lithium ion batteries for high density electricity storage at low volume and weight .
Roundtrip efficiency is above 90 % .
The batteries can be charged in very short time , i.e. in 10 minutes from 15 - 85 % capacity given the needed power , of course .
The expected lifetime is 10 years and one million cycles may be obtained .
The final word has not been spoken because these batteries have not been around for 10 years .
We now use them in cell phones and laptops .
Five years ago it took hours to recharge the cell phone and one charge lasted only a few days .
Now the batteries are recharged in a few minutes and last for a week .
Ben :
Actually , the lifecycle of batteries is something that I am pretty interested in because I personally do not think that they can compete with a diesel engine , for instance , in terms of the lifetime .
Ulf Bossel :
Well , they may have to last a lifetime of a car .
We are used to replace car batteries every five years .
Ben : Yeah .
Ulf Bossel :
And a car , you might say , is sitting there , on four wheels for 10 years , but it is actually driven for about only two hours a day .
3000 hours is the typical lifetime of a car .
The question is do batteries deteriorate when the car is not driven ?
With the lead acid batteries , this was the case .
It is no longer the case with lithium - ion batteries .
Anyway , I can see that the energy storage problem can be solved by keeping electric cars grid - connected when they are not driven .
Now , that sounds strange , but a car is normally driven two hours a day , so it is parked for 22 hours at home , at work or somewhere else .
What we need is at home and at work are inductive power transfer platforms .
While the car is parked , the battery is recharged .
The meter is in the car .
At the end of the month , the meter is read and you pay for electricity received from the grid .
Such system would create a huge electricity storage capacity .
Batteries are filled with surplus power at night , during windy days , on weekends etc .
If the wind is not blowing strong , then batteries are charged to only 80 % , but every car remains in a drivable condition at any time .
You do not have to go to a gas station to fill up a battery .
You park your car at home , turn off the key and then the batteries are charged automatically .
Of all I have said , this is the only vision I have .
All the rest is derived from physics , but this is a vision , is doable even today .
It can be a bit more sophisticated in that the power company automatically recognize the car and does the bookkeeping for you .
You do not have read a meter , but the power company is controlling the charging of your car and at the end of the month will send you a bill for the kilowatt - hours transferred to your car .
Ben :
So , basically in conclusion then we are going to have to use a variety of renewable energy sources in the future because we are running out of fossil fuels .
Fossil fuels will not be available in the quantities that they are today , so we are going to have to be using renewable energy sources .
The organic fuels that are available will not be available in very large quantities and so we better find the most efficient way to use them .
Ulf Bossel : Yes .
Ben :
And one of the most efficient ways of using the organic resources is actually through a fuel cell , like a high - temperature fuel cell .
Ulf Bossel : Yes .
Right , right .
Organic fuels derived from biomass or the last natural gas or oil flowing through pipelines , have to be converted with highest efficiency into electricity and heat by co-generation .
For that , solid oxide fuel cells , high - temperature fuel cells , are the best because they can convert hydrocarbons directly without the need of a reformer .
Because solid oxide fuel cells are always superior to PEM fuel cell and reformer .
This is another reason why we should discontinued to push the hydrogen technology , because PEM fuel cells run on hydrocarbon fuels cannot beat solid oxide fuel cells with respect to overall system efficiency .
Most of the waste heat from PEM fuel cells is too cold for practical use .
So , I can not see that the polymer fuel cell have a great future in today 's energy system .
It makes sense in a hydrogen economy , but because of the physics a hydrogen economy may never be established .
The future has to be built on renewable energy and energy efficiency .
Ben :
Let me just read from one of the paragraphs of one of your papers in the conclusion .
You wrote , " The key points is the transition from a chemical energy base built on fossil fuels to a physical energy base built mainly on electricity from renewable sources .
The transition is predetermined by the laws of physics .
It could not be avoided or significantly delayed by politics .
However , the transition will proceed more smoothly if all players agreed to move in to the same direction . "
Ulf Bossel :
It is my intent now , to provide some insight into the physics so that people can recognize the " light at the end of the tunnel . "
Only then can we join forces and go together into one direction rather than trying find solutions by trail and error .
At the moment , time and money is wastes , because the solutions are know and the technologies are available .
We do not have to invest in research on technologies which cannot provide sustainable solutions to the energy problem .
If one considers the overall mass and energy balances , ideas like " clean coal " , " nuclear fusion " , " oil from tar sands " etc. sound like bad jokes .
One cannot solve the energy problem with processes whose energy input exceeds the energy output .
The energy problem has to be solved soon by energy efficiency and energy from renewable sources .
We have not much time to waste .
Ben : Just one last question .
What type of responses have you been getting to your announcement ?
Ulf Bossel : Positive .
Very , very positive .
People have told me that they will come to Lucerne next summer , because we are now talking about energy politics .
Of course , there are some others who would like to present their good PEM solutions .
Indeed , the advances in the PEM area are fantastic .
I have highest respect for my fuel cell colleagues .
But it does not make sense to develop fuel cells for which the fuel is not available and will not be available in the near future .
I fear that all the wonderful PEM fuel cells and the PEM fuel cell vehicles will all end up in technical museums .
Ben :
Okay , well , thank you so much Ulf for coming on the show .
It is great to talk to you .
Ulf Bossel : Okay .
Thank you and it was a pleasure .
Ben : Bye - bye .
Ulf Bossel : Thank you .
Bye - bye
There seems to be an arms race of sorts between myself and a good number of “ security experts ” at various sites i frequent .
It all revolves around my account information .
You see , i trust that the info on my computer , sitting behind several layers of encryption , is actually far more secure than their site .
Why do i assume that ?
Because i know exactly what sort of security i have in place where as i have less knowledge about theirs .
i’m willing to believe that the opposite is also quite true and that the administrators of those remote sites believe their site to be far more secure than mine .
The administrators , however , have deemed it necessary to require me to enter my password in , by hand , every time i access their site .
Now , since each of these sites required various levels of “ added security ” involving me typing in a password with both upper and lower case letters , a number , one or more non-alphanumeric characters , plus one or more characters from the original transcript of the Chronicles of Gilgamesh ( mac users , please use Ancient Sanskrit ) , i’m far more likely to record said password somewhere other than my memory .
This is where things like Firefox ’s auto - complete function is a wondrous blessing since it ensures that those passwords are encrypted and stored on my equally wonderfully encrypted truecrypt drive where any accidentally acquired keylogger is far less likely to get access to them .
The remote site administrators , however , seem to feel otherwise .
At first , they simply turned autocomplete off for passwords .
A quick greasemonkey script fixed that .
Then , they escalated and added calls to the form and page to turn off autocomplete as well .
Again , minor issue , and a quick fix to the script was all i needed .
That ’s when they suddenly went hardball .
In the past few months i’ve seen the following :
1 ) A script that waits half a second after the page finishes loading , then clears the user name and password fields .
2 ) A drop down username selection box that obscures all but the last three letters of the previous login entry which kinda screws up the auto - fill since it ’s missing half of the index it uses to figure out what password to fill in .
3 ) A script that actually removes the password box entirely , replacing it with a Div that accepts keystrokes and inserts “ * ” .
4 ) After the page loaded , a rabid monkey was teleported directly to my keyboard and the only way to abate his foaming , disease filled hurled poo was to use a command word based on my account name and date of joining .
Ok , not so much that last one , but the other three definitely .
i ’m honestly not sure i really understand this .
i mean , yeah , i can imagine that some idiot logs in to a computer set up on some random Anacostia street corner and does n’t think to flush his cookies or clear his browser ’s cache , but frankly , if THAT was the case , i’d hazard that there are about 80 other issues that this theater would n’t actually address ( like the fact that the computer is made of cardboard and consists of a guy making “ beep - boop ” noises when you press the “ keys ” ) .
As it is now , i either figure out ways to work around this , wonder why the hell i’m working around this , or open up access to my stored , encrypted password file so that i can remember whether or not i had to add ༼ or ༽ to the password .
Personally , i’d love to find out where these guys live , and go change the locks on their houses .
i’d even leave them a nice little map indicating the lat / long of the location of their new keys , and maybe warn them about the bears in the area .
You know , for added security .
We hear a lot about housing bubbles , credit bubbles , even oil bubbles .
These bubbles exist .
They are birthed and nurtured by statist governments fixated on central planning .
Statist governments that obsess constantly about control over property , movement , and the minds and hearts of individuals .
You know , governments like the one in Washington , D.C .
For libertarians , these bubbles are predictable .
But predictability does n’t make them less sad or less painful for the bulk of Americans , who pay dearly for their government ’s outrages .
But there is an exception in the predictable sadness of bubbles .
Paul Farrell ’s latest column at Marketwatch.com advances the outrageous American war economy , and concludes that the massive " war bubble " will explode , and soon .
I naturally agree with what Mr. Farrell had to say — after all , most of his article was plain old statistical fact about what Eisenhower recognized in the 1950s , and what Bob Higgs has explained in his excellent books and articles .
Most ongoing bubbles have innocent , if ignorant , victims , who ultimately pay the financial price .
But unless those Americans read LewRockwell.com or consult history directly — they do not understand why they are hurting , and why they are paying .
So far , the state - created bubbles have been successfully portrayed as victimizing a thin regional or economic slice of the population , and most importantly , as being caused by a non-state , non-government villain .
For housing , the villain was evil mortgage lenders , and colluding appraisers .
For the credit bubble , it was the nasty raptors in the credit card industry , and in banking , the villains were , as always , a few bad apples .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac blamed everyone but itself , and with oil , we found that the bubble was the direct malevolent act of " oil speculators . "
A delightful exception is the war bubble .
Investopedia explains bubbles this way :
Speculative bubbles are generally a result of the “ bandwagon effect . ”
Investors , seeing an upward trend in prices , quickly enter long positions in an attempt to participate in the stocks ’ profitability .
Typically , these bubbles are followed by even faster sell - offs once the prices begin to decline .
The war bubble — the American war bandwagon — unlike other , more familiar bubbles , has a kind of clarity and marketability politicians would die for , and sometimes do .
The victims of the war bubble are not people who just wanted more house then they could afford , or who chose to buy high in a hot market .
The innocent victims of the war bubble are our own patriotic sons and daughters !
They are those who , after " serving their country " are now on waiting lists at VA hospitals that by commission and omission , fail to heal or even help .
The innocent victims of the war bubble occupy graveyards , family basements , and shelters in towns around the country , and what we clearly understand as an American family is this : " My son , my daughter , my husband , my wife , my niece and nephew , my grandson , my granddaughter — is not the same person I knew before they went to war . "
We feel a nearly national shame about what we have had our children and spouses do — what we ourselves may have done — in Iraq .
This shame fuels the anger of both those against the war as well as the actions of those who support it even more vigorously , to ensure they did not sacrifice their child at the wrong altar .
If the obvious war bubble victim is our child , the other victim of the American war bubble has 100 million taxpayer faces , all looking horrified at the debt and outlays for war — $ 3 trillion just for current war , not counting ongoing military empire expansion that appears determined to encircle both Iran and Russia .
How can we repay this obscene debt , a small , optional purchase by our government in the basket of commitments our government has racked up ?
Someone ought to make a movie about what we are going to do about this debt !
But what is really interesting about the war bubble , and useful if we want to see political change in this country — is that this bubble miraculously makes all Americans — adults and children — its righteous and innocent victims .
Before I go on — there is truth , and then there is truth .
Truth is , we did n’t have to join the military , encourage others to do so , insist that our congressmen and the transient living at 1600 Pennsylvania " protect us " from darkness , and light and everything in between , and on top of that , give us federal kickbacks in the form of military bases , military benefits , college funding and university grants .
Truth is we could have taken Ike ’s advice , and been a little more vigilant .
We did n’t have to accept the false patriotism and true fascism of the government created and sustained defense industry .
But the kind of truth that makes the imminent bursting of the American war bubble exciting and joyful is that we — all Americans — will be able to say honestly , together , that we love peace , and we hate war .
As we did in the 1980s , again we can honestly and loudly criticize government and military waste — waste and loss that is measured in billions and billions of dollars , making the $ 500 hammer look like a smart deal .
Politicians complain that the people are fickle .
For once , as the American war bubble collapses , we can be fickle in a direction that recalls the ideas of Washington and Jefferson , founders who feared standing armies , and a well - funded central government .
Tyranny of the majority was less of a concern than the sure tyranny of a would - be king , and a bunch of government - aligned businessmen .
For them it stunk of the contemporary British Empire ; for Americans , who do not study history but trust our gut , it stinks of simple un-Americanism .
When the American war bubble collapses , we will have American victims — it will be all of us .
And for once , the obvious villains will be the actual ones .
We will ask , as a nation : Who pumped up the case for war ?
Who lied about real return on investment ?
Who played the role of ignorant flamboyant CEO and CFO — and who whispered sweet assurances of success in their ears ?
Who conducted the audits ?
Who defaulted on the promise , and trashed the American dream ?
Americans will blame the war - mongering thinktanks , and the greedy politicians without a principle or a moral or a backbone among them .
Americans will blame the political generals , found in green zones , green rooms , and boardrooms .
Americans will blame government dependent , overfed and non-competitive defense and security industries and their lobbies , who effectively push , always and constantly , for more war and more spending .
Americans will look askance at foreign countries who stand shamelessly with their hands out , for military aid they neither need nor deserve .
The collapse of the war bubble will hurt .
But as we witness the rapid and accelerating global selloffs —
Americans and their representative media will , like a stopped clock , correctly identify the villain .
There will be no one but the state to blame — and all Americans will stand together as its victims .
Completing the trifecta is the foundation of understanding across the country brought about by the Ron Paul Revolution .
The coming collapse of the war bubble is indeed good news , and it will usher in a new era of liberty .

Wide World of Pranks : Rant Wal - Mart Intercom Pranks Wal - Mart stores can be so big and the workers seem so bored and the customers seem so harried and annoying .
It seems like the perfect fertile ground to have a little fun at Walt 's expense .
Sometimes I just want to jump on the intercom and say something .
But how does one get access ?
Planet Wally found the answer .
You can use the intercom from any one of the many telephones Wal - Mart provides around the sales floor .
Even better , we know the code !
Here is how you use the intercom at Wal - Mart :  Pick up the phone
 Dial # 96
You 're now on the store intercom !
The proper way to use the store intercom , I mean , apart from the fact it is only supposed to be used by Wal - Mart employees , is to declare the code and the location .
For instance , " Code White in Automotive " .
Here are a few helpful things you can do with the Intercom .
Intercom Codes : INTERCOM HOLD : Sometimes silence is golden .
So if you pick up the phone , dial # 96 and then hit hold , nobody can use the intercom until they figure out which phone is on hold .
CODE 1 : This code is used for SHOPLIFTING !
CODE 10 : Dry Spill .
CODE 20 : Wet Spill .
CODE 90 : Management Needed .
That sounds useless .
CODE 99 : This code implies that there is an emergency and all male employees are to immediately stop what they are doing and move to the announced location .
CODE 300 : Security Needed .
For grins , call Code 300 to the location you are currently at .
CODE ADAM : Code Adam is used to report a lost child .
Technically , the store is supposed to shut all doors until the lost child is found .
This sounds like fun until you realize that you are going to be trapped in a Wal - Mart for hours while they attempt to locate a missing child .
CODE BLACK : This code is used for severe weather .
It 's only used if something severe is happening such as tornadoes are bearing down on the store .
All employees are supposed to immediately head to the fitting rooms at the center of the store .
Wal - Mart does n't like to use this code because it quite frankly , when the employees all leave , it leads to looting .
CODE BLUE A bomb scare .
CODE C : Customer service .
A customer needs help in a location like housewares .
CODE GREEN : This code is used when there is a hostage in the store .
Ask yourself , do you really want to shop at a store that needs to have a special code for a hostage situation ?
CODE ORANGE : This is for a chemical spill .
Water is a chemical .
CODE RED :
This is used in case of a fire !
CODE WHITE : is used for an injury .
With knowledge comes power and responsibility .
Use it wisely .

PHOENIX -- Adam Dunn had no idea the Cincinnati Reds were about to trade him to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday .
But with longtime teammate Ken Griffey Jr. already gone and the Reds on a six - game losing streak , Dunn did n't mind packing his bags and heading West .
" It was one of those pleasant surprises , " the slugger said on a conference call .
" To come off the terrible month that we had in Cincinnati , and you get a phone call today saying you 're being traded to a first - place team .
As a player that 's all you could ask for . "
Dunn , who was tied for the big league lead in homers , could boost an Arizona offense that was ranked 20th in the majors in runs scored .
The Diamondbacks ( 60 - 58 ) entered the day with a 1 ½ - game lead in the NL West over the Los Angeles Dodgers , who recently traded for Manny Ramirez .
Arizona sent minor league right - hander Dallas Buck to Cincinnati ( 52 - 67 ) along with two players to be named .
The 23 - year - old Buck was 1 - 4 with a 3.94 ERA at Class - A South Bend .
Dunn , 28 , was batting .233 for the Reds with 32 home runs and 74 RBIs .
He has a good eye at the plate ( 80 walks ) but also strikes out a lot ( 120 Ks ) .
Dunn has a .247 career batting average with 270 homers and is eligible for free agency at the end of the season .

Pupils that study at a Brisbane Catholic school for girls are being taught about how to bet on races .
Each girl who studies at the prestigious Mt St Michael 's College was granted an imaginary $ 50 so they could spend the money over 4 hours at the Doomben racetrack .
The girls ' teacher was n't left behind - he amused himself by placing several bets of his own .
During the next weeks the pupils will be given lessons on casino gambling .
It seems that such exercises were aimed towards improving the skills of some pupils at maths .
Members of the Australian Family Association accused the Mt St Michael 's College of leading pupils off the track .
However , Jim Dooley , who is a teacher of math at the inner-west Brisbane school , mentioned that pupils aged 16 and 17 would learn how to bet correctly .
" The main objective of this is for the girls to research a mathematics assignment based on risk and return .
We encourage them to have fun with it while they are learning .
It also shows them the sharp end of gambling when they see that most people do n't get a return out of it , " said Mr Dooley .
According to a research performed by the Australian National University , over 10 percent of pupils in years 7 and 12 gamble on a regular scale .
About half of those students were categorized as " problem " gamblers .
Mark Holzworth , the state president of the Australian Family Association outlined that young people should not be taught to think that gambling was okay .
" There is no way we can endorse this method of alternate learning .
There are creative ways of teaching children maths skills and life skills , but this is pushing the fringe further than it needs to be pushed .
For many , gambling would be considered a vice , " he said .
" We do n't send children to tobacco factories or breweries , so why are we sending them to a racetrack ? "
Lisa Stanley , Brisbane gambling counselor , mentioned that exposure and addiction are very close to each other .

Dark Knight recently became the fastest movie to earn $ 400 million .
Opening weekend , the flick filled seats for 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. screenings and fans on Craigslist were paying two , four and ten times more than face value for tickets .
Â
At just over two and a half hours , the movie even tops other Batman movies in length !
Despite all this success , though the Dark Knight cannot win it all .
Here are a few records it wo n't be breaking :
1 ) Summer revenue abroad
The Mummy is burying Dark Knight in weekly box office sales outside the US .
Oddly enough , if the summer Olympics had taken place in New York City instead of Beijing , Gotham City might have reigned worldwide .
2 ) New Zealand 's top spot
There 's simply no budging Frodo and friends from holding onto the opening weekend record in the country where the Lord of the Rings series was filmed .
The country was so cuckoo for Tolkien that it temporarily renamed the capital city of Wellington as Middle Earth .
3 ) Top domestic revenue
( At least , not yet . )
Titanic still reigns as the top grossing movie of all time in the US , breaking the $ 600 million mark .
While Dark Knight is certainly moving up the chart , in the past ten years , no movie has come close to sinking this ship 's record .
4 ) Video game success
Spider - man 3 , Shrek 3 and other top movies released video games at the same time that they hit the theaters .
Â
So far , Dark Knight has n't issued a video game version , and with it , has lost as much as $ 100 million in revenue .
5 ) Most expensive movie
In recent years , Spider - Man 3 clocked in at $ 258 million in production costs .
If you adjust for inflation , 1963's $ 44 million Cleopatra would have cost nearly $ 300 million .
By that measure , Dark Knight seems like a bargain at an estimated $ 185 million .
6 ) Most Prince - ly soundtrack
While Prince recorded one of the two soundtracks for the 1989's Batman , and appeared in music videos , including Batdance and Partyman , he was noticeably absent from the new movie 's soundtrack .
Sorry , Dark Knight !

The AFP got a photo from the Iranian government “ the Web site of Sepah News , the media arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards , on Wednesday , ” with a teensy alteration …
and the next day , the Associated Press got an almost - the - same image from the Iranian government …
so you can probably guess which one ran on the front of big rig papers :
update : The New York Times blog
The Lede has posted updates and has more information , including this :
In a sentiment no doubt echoed by news organizations everywhere , an MSNBC editor acknowledged that the four - missile picture was initially welcomed with open arms .
“ As the media editor working the msnbc.com home page yesterday , I was frustrated with the quality of a fuzzy video image we published of the Iranian missile launch , ” said Rich Shulman , the network ’s associate multimedia editor .
“ So I was thrilled when the top image crossed the news wires . ”
update : on 7/11/08 , Drudge reports that the NYT will quote “ military insiders ” letting us know that this story just keeps getting better :
a video showing what appeared to be many missiles being fired -- is actually one missile , filmed from different angles !
update : from The Telegraph on 7/12/08 :
Iran claimed last week to have tested a new version of the Shahab missile with a 1,250 - mile range that would put in range much of the Middle East , including Israel and Turkey and the Arabian peninsula , and Pakistan .
However , a respected independent national security website , ArmsControlWonk.com , concluded that the missiles were identical to an earlier version of the Shahab , first unveiled by Iran in 1998 with a known range of 746 miles .
…
Iran also issued misleading statements about the ranges and doctored videos to make the firings seem more numerous and fearsome than reality , The New York Times reported .
Coverage showing what appeared to be many missiles being fired was apparently just one device , filmed from different angles .
“ Deception was rampant , ” said Charles Vick , an expert on the Iranian missile programme at Global Security , a prominent defence think tank .
… Last week ’s missile tests sent oil prices soaring from $ 136 to $ 147 a barrel , delivering a windfall gain worth billions of dollars to Iran ’s oil - based economy .

This is a story that will likely make you hungry , inspired , and hopefully thinking a little broader than you started .
This is a story of passion and mystery , with a twist at the end .
This is about an ice cream that uses no dairy , yet tastes as good as , if not better than its milk based counterparts .
And you wo n’t want to choose it because you can’t have dairy , you ’ll just like it because it ’s good .
Or so that ’s what the folks behind Coconut Bliss are aiming for .
Now I know , you ’re saying , coconut based , that sounds ( insert gushing or repulsed adjectives here )
Hang on .
Coconut Bliss makes all the standard flavors you ’d expect and far beyond , from Vanilla Island to Chocolate Hazelnut Fudge , with some Strawberry Lemon Love thrown in for good measure .
The flavor , when it hits your tongue , is distinctly focused on the flavor at hand .
Coconut sits very much in the background , nearly undetected .
It ’s more the messenger rather than the flag bearer .
They use very clean ingredients , all organic , and skip insulin spiking sugar for its more even keeled cousin , agave nectar .
In conversation with Larry Kaplowitz from Coconut Bliss however , coconut was front and center .
It was simply what they chose to use to make ice cream for themselves , while living and working at the Lost Valley Educational Center .
But why coconut ?
For them , it was a matter of both taste and ethics .
Sure , there are plenty of soy and rice based options out there , but they did n’t meet the same taste standard for them as dairy based .
Coconut milk , found at many local stores , seemed to meet that , giving great taste and feel without sacrifice .
Then something happened .
In the mold of Clif Bar , Ben & Jerry ’s and other foodpreneurs , their friends went crazy for it , encouraging them to make more and sell it at stores .
But where to find enough coconut milk ?
Ah , therein lies the mystery .
Apparently it is a tightly guarded secret .
Their favorite , from lots of taste testing , was that from Thailand .
Three brands , all with the same taste .
Same supplier ?
Nobody was saying .
So they just bought can after small can of coconut milk , at one point using 2500 a day .
And a really sturdy can opener .
No joke !
Then one day , there was a peek behind the curtain .
An employee saw , on a Alibaba a global supplier marketplace , the possible name behind the goods .
After a lot of courting and an eventual visit in Thailand , Coconut Bliss had their direct source .
No , they are n’t telling who it is either .
So they were in business , starting in Eugene , Oregon which according to Kaplowitz is a very fertile ground for new natural foods companies to start .
Why ?
They have 7 independent natural foods stores , as compared to 3 in Portland , 2 in Seattle .
And there ’s the Williamette Sustainable Valley Foods Alliance , which is a powerful collective supporter and resource for fostering and growing such businesses .
Great .
But my question to them was , what about the eco impact of shipping coconut milk from 9000 miles away versus using local dairy ?
Larry was well prepared for this , telling me things about cows beyond what I knew about ( large land use needs , methane emissions , etc )
For example , cows drink an average 50 gallons a day .
And he also opened my mind to the concept of biologically appropriate vs. a strictly local focus .
An example would be English beef .
It ’s a place where they have relatively limited land available , and must import the grain used to feed them .
This , versus somewhere like New Zealand , which by it ’s coastal focused population density and abundance of grass and grains naturally has all that ’s needed to raise cows with ease , with much less resource intensity .
Which is better , in this case ?
Local should of course be the first consideration in food choices , but then there ’s considering the surrounding factors that contribute to it ’s impact ( or lack of it ) as well .
The same idea goes with the coconuts .
They have 650 acres of land , of which they do zero to raise them .
As in no watering is done outside what rain , and they let the native plant life flourish around it , and allow termite mounds to ground on the trees , which it turns out is helpful , as the termites consume the fallen plant remains on the floor below .
When it ’s time to harvest , they simply drive through the acres , pressing down the plants between the trees so workers can go in and harvest them .
Here again is an example of raising things where they grow well , versus forcing them into being , with a lot of external inputs , as in English beef .
And they ’re organic .
By accident .
Kaplowitz told me that one year the growers did n’t have enough money for fertilizer .
So they went without , and got 50 % less yield .
But they found out they could charge twice the price .
Seeing an opportunity for what it was , they elected to continue on that path , since improving the yield while reducing labor cost and environmental impact .
Returning to Eugene , Oregon , there ’s a curious fact : Coconut Bliss is now produced in the processing plant of Lochmead Farms , a major regional dairy producer .
Purists of both food and ethical basis might balk , but step back and look at the bigger picture : Lochmead is a local business , owned and run by the same family since the 1950s .
They own their their cows , grow their own feed , and the farm and processing plant are only 5 miles apart .
They sell their product through 42 local stores , all within 40 miles of their operations .
They employ about 400 people and seek long term positive relations with them , whereas other area dairies use mostly benefitless temp workers .
No they are n’t organic , but by many other counts , they are an asset to the local economy and the environment .
So , the next time you ’ve got that craving for ice cream , consider taking Coconut Bliss for a test drive .
Readers :
What ’s your take on local vs biologically appropriate farming ?
What other “ under the radar ” organic foods should we know about ?
Have you had Coconut Bliss ?
What ’s your take ?

For too many studios my advice will be too late
3,200 ++ Martial Arts Studios went out of business in the month of May alone .
In the history of Martial Arts in the United States - nothing like this has ever happened .
In one month about 20 % of all studios closed their door .
Most will never reopen !
Most should never been in business to start with .
Starbucks is closing 600 locations this year because people cannot afford to pay $ 3 for a cup of coffee .
How do studio owners - especially those with 90 % kids expect parents to pay $ 100 per month plus testing fee's ?
Now they have the added expense of $ 4 a gallon gas .
This is a no brainier for parents :
Cut out the kids Karate and Dance lessons .
Three Critical Areas are at the top of the list :
1. Keep your overhead low
2 . Do everything yourself !
3 . Teaching mixed martial arts is not the solution its part of the PROBLEM !
Your goal for Studio Survival :
Keep you total Studio overhead below $ 2,200 per month .
If you can't do that there is a good chance you will go Bankrupt .
Warning :
You still may not be able to survive if your personal living expenses are more then to studio can bring in .
# 1 Keep the phone covered
24/7 - And not with an answering Machine
Without endless supply of New Customer - a studio will go bankrupt !
The solution - get a " cell phone that is with you 24 hours a day " and keep the battery charged .
When ever you leave the studio - even for 5 minutes - call forward - your studio phone to your cells phone !
And answer it when it rings .
An answering machine will never take the place of a real " Qualified " person answering the phone !
Atomic Bomb Game
The Atom Bomb Game event at the Imperial War Museum in London , for the 60th Anniversary in 2005 .
Under the glass is the position of the board at the time the bomb was dropped .
The 106 moves from the first two days had just been replayed on the board at the time .
The board here belongs to T. Mark Hall .
Just visible on the other side is Mark 's diploma signed by Iwamoto Kaoru , a survivor of the Atom Bomb game .
The Atomic Bomb Game was a game played 4 - 6 August 1945 as the second game of the third title series for the Honinbo title , which was held at that time by Hashimoto Utaro .
The challenger was Iwamoto Kaoru .
The venue for game 1 ( 23 to 25 July 1945 ) was the house of Fujii Junichi , Nakajima - Honcho , Hiroshima City .
But game 2 was moved to the Chugoku Sekitan ( a coal company , president : Tsuwaki Kan'ichi ) employees ' dormitory in Yoshimi-en , Itsukaichi- cho , Saeki - gun ( Yoshimi- en , Saeki - ku , Hiroshima City today ) .
Go had continued all through the war years in Japan , in reduced form .
The story of the game has been told often .
The game recorder was Miwa Yoshiro , and the official observer / referee Segoe Kensaku , whose birthplace was Hiroshima .
The second game was played on the outskirts of the city because propaganda leaflets had been dropped , concerning a new powerful bomb ( it seems the move was at police insistence ) .
The location was about 10 kilometres from the eventual centre of the explosion .
The blast from the atomic bomb " Little Boy " above Hiroshima interrupted the game in its third day .
It came at 8.15 am and at a point where the players had replayed the position - but had not yet started the game again .
There were injuries to some of those there caused by flying glass , and damage to the building .
Hashimoto was blown off his feet .
The game was n't resumed until after lunch .
The game was then played to a conclusion , Hashimoto winning by five points with White ( there was no komi ) .
This tied the match 1 - 1 .
People at Nihon Ki-in in Tokyo thought all had been killed by the explosion , before Miwa came back to report the story .

Government admits national DNA database holds records of 40,000 INNOCENT children
Nearly 40,000 innocent children have been placed on the Government 's enormous DNA database for life , ministers admitted last night .
The number of ten to 17 - year - olds who have done nothing wrong yet have had their genetic profiles seized by police has soared by 60 per cent in two years .
The news will fuel mounting fears that forces are arresting youngsters who have committed no crime simply to build up their DNA database by ' stealth ' .
The scale of the gathering operation was revealed by Home Office minister Meg Hillier .
She confirmed the database held the records of 303,393 children whose genetic profiles can be checked against any crime scene .
DNA : Thousands of innocent children have had samples taken
Of these , 39,095 - or 12.8 per cent - had ' not been convicted , cautioned , received a final warning or reprimand and had no charge pending against them ' .
The controversial figures , slipped out in a written Parliamentary answer , provoked condemnation yesterday .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' This is yet more evidence that the DNA database is totally arbitrary , with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons . '
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said it was wrong to store the DNA of innocent people .
He pointed out that the database does not contain data on many convicted criminals .
He said : ' These figures show that the Government is building a national DNA database by stealth .
' There can be no excuse for storing the DNA of innocent adults , let alone children , who are entirely blameless .
' This is an intrusive policy that gives far too much sensitive information to the state , when we know that ministers cannot be trusted with its security .
The DNA that should be on the database is that of past offends , yet when it comes to them , there are major gaps in the database . '
Since April 2004 , anyone aged ten or above who is arrested in England and Wales can have their DNA and fingerprints taken without their consent , or that of their parents .
The DNA samples - plus the computerised profiles - are kept permanently , even if the person arrested is never charged or is acquitted .
Only a tiny fraction of the files are destroyed .
Britain has the world 's largest DNA database , with 4.5 million genetic profiles on record .
Up to 1.5 million - or a third of these - are from innocent people .
Criminologists have warned that , in a bid to make policing simpler , officers are targeting for arrest those who they see as potential troublemakers .
For example , by making arrests for a minor offence such as criminal damage , they can take the DNA of a group of youngsters at the time .
But those who have had samples taken include two schoolgirls charged with criminal damage after drawing on a pavement in chalk , and a child in Kent who removed a slice of cucumber from a sandwich and threw it at another youngster .
Last month a Government - appointed advisory body , the DNA Database Ethics Group , said samples obtained from innocent people should be destroyed .
Pensioners ' fingerprints may defeat ID card scheme
Problems scanning the fingerprints of four million pensioners could compromise the controversial identity card scheme , Government advisers have warned .
The Home Office has been told it is ' hard to obtain good quality fingerprints ' from people over the age of 75 , and that the technology needed to overcome these difficulties would cost the taxpayer more money .
The ID card database , which will include the fingerprints and iris patterns of 50 million citizens , is already predicted to cost up to £ 20 billion .
Its success depends on all prints being clear enough to be scanned repeatedly as proof of identity .
But a report by the Biometrics Assurance Group , led by Professor John Beddington , said scanners would struggle to read elderly people 's prints because the ridges on the pads of their fingers are often less defined .
It also warned the card scheme had not been sufficiently tested on those with ' challenging biometrics ' - including the elderly , mute , non-English speaking and blind .

The remarkable sound of a Stradivarius violin has been revealed .
Scientists used a medical scanner to discover that the violin has a unique sound due to the extraordinary even density of the wood it is made of .
It is worth mentioning that during a three - century period , various musicians and researchers tried to find an answer regarding the exceptional quality of the classical Cremonese violins created by such remarkable Italian artists as Antonio Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesu .
Finally , scientists believe to have found the answer .
A doctor living in the Netherlands , Berend Stoel , along with the artist that creates violins in Arkansas , Terry Borman , were able to discover the mystery behind the exceptional sound of the Italian masters ' violins .
The two performed a comparative analysis of 5 classical and 8 modern violins using a computer tomography scanner , which is generally used to examine patients .
The doctor and the violin maker examined the physical properties of the violins with the help of an adaptation of a computer program , which was developed with the goal of estimating lung densities in patients with emphysema .
In such a way researchers made their study without any damage to the instruments with a total value of millions of dollars .
There were no big dissimilarities found between the median densities of the two types of violins ( modern and antique ) , but researchers found a significant difference between the early and late growth of wood grains in the ancient violins .
Due to the fact that the differences in the density of the wood have an impact on the vibrations , thus affecting the quality of the sound , the finding can give the answer regarding the exclusiveness of the Cremonese violins .
Researchers reported the results in the online journal PLoS ONE .
One reason why the woods of maple and spruce in a violin made by the Italian artists are so different is that the today 's trees grow differently than in the past .
" Climate difference could explain part of it but treatment of the wood could be another explanation .
A third answer could simply be the ageing of the wood over the past 300 years .
There is no way of knowing from this data ; we 've just shown there are density differences . " mentioned Dr. Berend Stoel of the Leiden University Medical Center told Reuters .

Last month I went to LA for the American Library Association conference , and sat on a panel called " Privacy :
Is it time for a revolution , " with Dan Roth from Wired and Beth Givens from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse .
The panel was put on by the ALA 's Office for Intellectual Freedom as part of a larger project that is rallying librarians and their patrons to fight for privacy in libraries and in society at large .
It was a really good panel ( librarians are the best conceivable audience for this kind of thing ) and the organizers have posted video of the speakers — but more importantly , they 've put up the ALA Privacy Initiative Concept Paper " Rallying Americans for the Right to Information Privacy " and a survey on privacy practices .

There are ways to get more vacation time 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
When family rights advocate John De Graff started doing some historical research , he came across a shocking discovery - that medieval European peasants had more vacation time than modern American office workers .
De Graff , national coordinator of Take Back Your Time Day , based his figures on the number of religious holidays peasants took off to eat , drink and spend time with their families , and found it was about two weeks extra .
He even printed up T - shirts saying : " Medieval Peasants Had More Vacation Than You . "
As the economy falters and fewer employers give raises , it might be a good time for some American workers to negotiate more time off instead .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
But that 's not to say it will be easy .
According to Rebecca Ray , research assistant at the Center for Economic Policy Research and co-author of " No - Vacation Nation , " there is no federal or state protection to stop employers from firing workers just for asking for vacation time .
" The employer might not explain the reason for the firing , so it 's difficult to get accurate statistics on how often it happens , " says Ray , who would like to see federal protection for employees .
Ray advises " talks about talks " in advance , to be sure the employer understands that any discussions on vacation should not be viewed negatively .
Employers should also know that a rested employee is a productive employee .
Joe Robinson , founder of the Work to Live Movement , tells employers who hire him to improve employee motivation that research shows productivity goes up after a vacation .
" In the U.S. , we have moved into a knowledge economy and the main tool is your brain .
The best possible aid to that tool is a vacation , " Robinson said .
There are a number of steps that workers can take to push for more time off without being asked to clear out their desk .
Vacation pooling : Under vacation pools , employees trade time off .
One employee may take no vacation one year but double his time the next year by trading with a workmate .
Other vacation pools allow employees to lump their vacation , holiday and personal time in one , so that they are given a set amount of days off .
Edgar Cahn , the founder of TimeBanks USA , which promotes better quality of life , says that office pooling is an ideal way for people to enjoy their allotted time off .
" It 's a very creative idea , " he said .
" The company does n't have to give the employees any extra time off and it allows office workers much more flexibility . "
Self - financing : According to Robinson , mentioning to your boss that you are willing to go on vacation without any pay can often be a very effective way to get some time off .
" OK , so it 's not ideal , but if you want time off , it 's the easiest way , " he said .
Robinson did this in his previous work in journalism and the music industry .
" If you can afford to do it , I 'd recommend it .
Unfortunately , many employees think it 's a bit strange if they do n't have their nose to the grindstone all the time , especially if they are funding the vacation themselves , " he said .
Robinson advocates a noncombative approach , explaining to the employer why it's in his or her interests to give you a vacation .
Take what you get :
It may seem obvious , but many people do n't check how much time they are entitled to take off .
Many others are reluctant to take the average nine days of paid vacation to which they are entitled , often because they are afraid it will show weakness or lack of loyalty .
Joe Robinson said there may be " ongoing subtle discouragement " in the work force , but employees should remember that they are entitled to their vacation and should not be afraid to take it .
In 2005 , U.S. workers collectively turned down a staggering 1.6 million years of vacation time that was offered to them .
Imagine if one person had all that time - it would take them back to the Tertiary Epoch , when saber - toothed tigers roamed America and Homo erectus was still evolving in Africa .
Vacation wisely :
If vacation time is limited and your boss wo n't budge , then recharge in the best way possible .
Robinson is concerned about the rising popularity of " staycations " - lounging at home to offset rising fuel costs and the weak dollar .
He believes those breaks are not as restful .
" Working the brain 's neurons by taking up a challenging activity will leave you far more refreshed than sitting at a resort doing nothing , " he said .

Human - frog hybrids might reveal the neurological secrets of autism .
By fusing cells from the preserved brains of deceased autistic patients with the eggs of a carnivorous African frog called Xenopus , scientists have started investigating the way the brain cells of people with autism behave .
The frog eggs work a little like human neurons and the hybrid cells act as a surrogate of a living brain with the condition .
“ It ’s almost as if you were studying a neuron in the human brain , ” says Ricardo Miledi , a neurobiologist at the University of California , Irvine , who developed the approach and has previously used Xenopus eggs to study epilepsy .
Miledi ’s earlier work has suggested that some brain cells of epilepsy patients have trouble sensing a molecule that helps damp down neuron activity .
The proteins in question , called neurotransmitter receptors , sense the chemicals that neurons use to communicate , and Miledi thinks that problems with these proteins underlie epilepsy and other disorders

Some researchers blame autism on a malfunction in mirror neurons , cells that play a vital role in understanding the actions of others people .
To see if abnormalities in neurotransmitter signalling also underlie autism , Miledi ’s team collected brain samples from six deceased autistic patients , aged eight to 39 .
They fused brain - cell membranes , which house neurotransmitter receptors , together with Xenopus egg membranes .
As a control , they did the same thing with brain cells from patients with no history of mental disorder .
Miledi’s team then doused the frog eggs in neurotransmitter chemicals , and measured the voltage generated within each egg .
The neurotransmitter chemicals tell brain cells to pump charged molecules in and out the membrane , creating a voltage across the membrane .
Since Xenopus eggs do not respond to the neurotransmitters , the human proteins are completely responsible for any electric current generated .
Four of six autistic brains responded to neurotransmitters chemicals less vigorously than the controls .
However , Miledi cautions that more research with additional samples will be needed to firm up any conclusions .
“ Autism spectrum disorder is a very broad range of maladies , with many different sources and many different problems , ” he says .
Jonathan Pevsner , a neurobiologist at Kennedy - Krieger Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , agrees that frog eggs could be useful for studying certain properties of autism , and perhaps uncovering new treatments .
He notes that other brain illnesses , such as depression and Parkinson ’s , can be treated by turning the activity of neurotransmitters up or down .
Hybrid frog eggs could perhaps hint at which neurotransmitters to tweak , he says .

Will Olympics illuminate pollution problem enough for gov’t .
to act ?
In a recent survey of over 3,000 Chinese citizens , environmental issues emerged as a big problem in the eyes of the majority of respondents .**
The 2008 survey , conducted as part of the Pew Research Center ’s Pew Global Attitudes Project , found that about three quarters of those surveyed ( 74 % ) cite air pollution as a big problem .
66 % of respondents ranked water pollution as a big problem .
But not only did Chinese say they were concerned about environmental problems , but they also said something should be done about it .
As many as 80 % of Chinese think protecting the environment should be made a priority , even if this results in slower growth and a potential loss of jobs .
The new data suggest the Chinese people may be struggling with some of the consequences of economic growth .
What I find most striking about these results are : A ) That concern for the environment is so salient among the Chinese , that people are willing to sacrifice some economic growth and jobs to take steps towards correcting those environmental problems , and B ) That the concern for the environment was based on “ pollution ” themes .
Pollution - based environmental problems are salient because they are visible , tangible , and ‘ real ’ products of industrial growth ( as can be witnessed in this excellent series of short films ) .
These types of problems were also perceived as very important to Americans in the late 1960s and early 1970s , before the U.S. enacted its core environmental policy .
Can we expect that to be the next for China ?
And if so , when will that next step actually commence ?
** Methodology : “ Face - to - face interviews were conducted with 3,212 adults in China between March 28 and April 19 , 2008 , a period which followed the March 10 onset of civil unrest on Tibet and preceded the May 12 earthquake in China ’s Sichuan Province .
The sample , which is disproportionately representative of China ’s urban areas , includes eight major cities , as well as medium - sized towns and rural areas in eight Chinese provinces .
The area covered by the sample represents approximately 42 % of the country ’s adult population . ”

Q : Should we expect to see “ plug - in ” hybrid cars anytime soon ?
I ’ve been hearing they are on the horizon but I wonder if that means in one year or 10 .
– Bill A. , Stratford , Conn .
A : Gasoline - electric hybrids now , like Toyota ’s Prius , do n’t need to plug in – you just fill their tanks with gas and the battery is charged by the internal combustion engine and by energy recaptured when braking .
The battery runs the electric motor when idling , backing up , crawling in gridlock , maintaining speed while cruising , and for extra uphill power .
The electric motor is a back - up ; the hybrid relies mainly on the gas engine .
Plug - in hybrids let owners plug their cars into a standard electrical outlet to recharge .
The vehicles will go 40 or 50 miles on a charge , ideal for commuters who drive short distances to work and back .
Those drivers may be able to rely solely on electric power .
The gasoline engine then becomes the supplemental one for when the car needs to go farther than the electric motor can take it .
According to researchers at the University of Cali­for­­nia , Davis , the electricity cost of powering a plug - in hybrid is about one - quarter the cost of the gas needed to run a like - sized , gas - only vehicle .
Toyota , by far the world ’s largest producer of hybrid vehicles , says it expects to have a commercially viable plug - in hybrid as early as 2010 .
It is testing prototype versions of plug - in hybrids at two California universities .
US automakers are also jumping onto the plug - in bandwagon .
General Motors says that it will have mass - market plug - in hybrids on the road by 2010 .
Ford has also developed a small fleet of plug-ins , but is not yet ready to offer them to the public .
Chrysler ’s Sprinter van was the first plug - in from a major US manufacturer , but it is currently available only to a limited number of institutions as a fleet vehicle .
Plug-ins have also caught on elsewhere .
Chinese carmaker BYD plans to sell a plug - in hybrid sedan in the United States within five years .
And Volkswagen hopes to have a plug - in hybrid Golf ready to roll by 2010 .
Q : I was intrigued to hear that there were a number of ways one could modify or construct a roof on a house or office that would provide great environmental benefit .
Can you enlighten ?
– Bill Teague , Menlo Park , Calif .
A : Most roofs are designed to shed rain and so are hard and impermeable .
As a result , rainwater runs off , collecting impurities on its way to municipal storm sewers , which eventually empty into local bodies of water .
Minimizing this runoff means that more impurities will remain in local soils where they can be broken down more easily into their constituent elements than if they are concentrated downstream .
In order to achieve this goal , landscape architects have developed “ green roofs , ” which use living plants and soil on top of a building in order to absorb , collect , and reuse rainwater while also preventing runoff .
Buildings employing green roofs find many uses for the water collected , from watering exterior plantings at ground level to flushing toilets inside .
Steven Peck , of the Toronto - based nonprofit Green Roofs for Healthy Cities , says such roofs can play a big role in maintaining ecological integrity within paved - over areas .
“ The roofscapes of our cities are the last urban frontier – from 15 percent to 35 percent of the total land area – and the green roof industry can turn these wasted spaces into a force for cleaner air , cleaner water , energy savings , cooling , beauty , and recreation , ” he says .
The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) encourages the creation of green roofs to mitigate the urban “ heat island effect , ” whereby temperatures in crowded cities can soar some 10 degrees F. higher than in less - developed areas nearby .
Such roofs also provide amenity space for tenants , reduce heating and cooling costs , scrub carbon dioxide out of the air and heavy metals out of rainwater , and increase bird habitat .
Certain inorganic materials can also make an existing roof greener .
The nonprofit Cool Roof Rating Council ( CRRC ) , for instance , suggests roofing surfaces that reflect the sun ’s heat so as to reduce the urban heat - island effect while improving residential energy efficiency .
According to the group , “ a cool roof reflects and emits the sun ’s heat back to the sky . ”
Builders can check out CRRC ’s website for a database of information on the radiative properties of various roofing surfaces .
Long - lasting roofs , like slate or metal ones , are also more ecologically appealing , though costly .

An official in the newly formed UN Human Rights Council has called for a fresh investigation into the events of 9/11 in order to examine the possible role that neoconservatives may have played in the attacks .
The New York Sun picked up the story today , explaining that Richard Falk , a professor of international law emeritus at Princeton University , and an expert on human rights was assigned to a new position within the council on March 26 .
His role is to report on human rights in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs .
Two days prior to the announcement , Falk appeared on former University of Wisconsin lecturer Kevin Barrett ’s radio show and spoke of how he is keen to see a fresh investigation into 9/11 in order to address inconsistencies in the official account of what happened .
Mr. Falk told Barrett , " It is possibly true that especially the neoconservatives thought there was a situation in the country and in the world where something had to happen to wake up the American people .
Whether they are innocent about the contention that they made that something happen or not , I do n’t think we can answer definitively at this point .
All we can say is there is a lot of grounds for suspicion , there should be an official investigation of the sort the 9/11 commission did not engage in and that the failure to do these things is cheating the American people and in some sense the people of the world of a greater confidence in what really happened than they presently possess . "
Falk previously penned the preface to Professor David Ray Griffin ’s groundbreaking 2004 book The New Pearl Harbor , in which the theologian catalogued scores of unexplained facets surrounding 9/11 and inconsistencies in the official government version of events .
Falk has also published a number of notable books and essays analyzing the legality of the Vietnam War and other military operations , including the Iraq invasion .
A year ago he played a prominent role in a Citizens ’ hearing on the legality of the Iraq War as a tribunal testifier .
Of the Invasion he has previously written :
" inescapable that an objective observer would reach the conclusion that this Iraq war is a war of aggression , and as such , that it amounts to a Crime against Peace of the sort for which surviving German leaders were indicted , prosecuted and punished at the Nuremberg trials conducted shortly after the Second World War . "
Falk ’s appointment to the Human Rights Council has also hit headlines due to the fact that he has previously slammed the Israeli occupation of Palestine and compared the Zionist government ’s treatment of Palestinian Arabs to the Nazi treatment of Jews in the holocaust .
The Israeli government announced Tuesday that it will deny Falk a visa to enter Israel , Gaza and the West Bank .
Despite this and the now customary attacks from the Anti-Defamation League , Falk has stood by his comments , telling the BBC : " If this kind of situation had existed for instance in the manner in which China was dealing with Tibet or the Sudanese government was dealing with Darfur , I think there would be no reluctance to make that comparison , "
The New York Sun reports that former ambassador to the UN , John Bolton commented on Falk ’s recent appointment to the Human Rights Council : " This is exactly why we voted against the new human rights council . "
Bolton is clearly worried that like Falk , some of the officials within the council are legal experts that recognize war crimes when they see them and may actually attempt to do something about it .
Last month Japanese member of Parliament Yukihisa Fujita told the Alex Jones
Show that a potential new investigation of the 9/11 cover - up may be coordinated by individuals within the United Nations .
It remains to be seen whether the Human Rights Council is composed of enough well meaning individuals to have a significant impact or whether , like much of the rest of the UN , it becomes a part of the establishment left arm of the global elite system .

What does the American surrender monkey call it when he is defeated in the Iraq War , and he is forced to retreat ?
A real country can accept defeat like a man , admit that it lost and it is retreating , as even someone as weak as Gorbachev did when he pulled Soviet troops out of Afghanistan .
But American surrender monkeys have no dignity or honor , they cannot face the hard facts that they lost the Iraq war .
So the chief surrender monkey president George Bush comes up with new expression for the American retreat , that begins next year , he calls it a “ time horizon . ”
Bush agrees to time ‘ horizon ’ on Iraq troop cuts By TERENCE HUNT – 2 days ago WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Bush and Iraq ’s prime minister have agreed to set a “ general time horizon ” for bringing more U.S. troops home from the war , a dramatic shift from the administration ’s once - ironclad unwillingness to talk about any kind of deadline or timetable .
I wonder , does it make American retarded public feel better , that the defeat and retreat from Iraq is called a “ general time horizon ” ?
Are you really so pathetic that you have to be told such dumb obvious lies meant for a child , so that you do n’t cry and run away and hide your face in your pillow to cry all night ?
“ Dear Toothfairy , thank you for taking my teeth and leaving me a quarter , and thank you for calling America ’s retreat from Iraq a ‘ general time horizon . ’
I believe you !
Yours , Uncle Sam ”
American surrender monkeys really are pathetic people .
But you also are funny people too .
I was writing about you before in The eXile , and I stopped for reasons that are not so important .
Let us say just that Yasha Levine and me “ buried the hatchet ” to use the words of Yasha .
So I am back , when I have time , to laugh my ass off at retarded loser nation , America , who just a few years ago went around the world starting wars because it calls itself “ the world ’s only superpower , ” and now is in retreat fleeing back to America as “ world ’s only surrender monkeys . ”
Even a silly third world country Iran scares a shit out of American surrender monkeys .
Top surrender monkey commander Admiral Mike Mullen said yesterday he already is raising the white flags to Iran , because he is so scared of losing a third war .
Mullen says he ‘ does n’t need ’ a war in Iran Jul. 20 , 2008 Associated Press The Pentagon ’s top military officer Adm .
Mike Mullen on Sunday discussed the fallout from a potential attack against Tehran by either the US or Israel .
“ Right now I ’m fighting two wars and I do n’t need a third one . ”
Yeah , if I am losing two wars against even weaker loser opponents , I also will not want to start a third one .
I will run away and maybe call police or call my daddy for help .
You see , this is the only way to teach bloodthirsty American dumbshits that they should not be starting wars up , and telling everyone how to run their own countries .
Like a misbehaving child , you have to kick a shit out of the Americans to teach them , because that is the only way Americans learn .
Americans always think they are tough guys , they talk so much bullshit all the time , so if you put them in their place and smack them around a little bit , then you see , that they are just very sad pathetic and weak , running away from fights and telling each other lies about “ general time horizon ” to make each other feel better .
For me , what shows how far America really is falling is that now people of New Hampshire are begging for gasoline from Venezuelan enemy , Hugo Chavez :
CONCORD , N.H. ( AP ) —
Two years ago , New Hampshire refused to accept heating oil from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , the pro-Castro U.S. critic who once called President Bush “ the devil . ”
But with fuel prices rising , well , free oil is free oil .
With the state ’s blessing , New Hampshire residents will be receiving some of the fuel this winter .
New Hampshire becomes the last state in the Northeast to embrace the offer .
“ A lot of people have said , ` We need help and we value any help we can get , ' ” said Amy Ignatius , director of New Hampshire ’s office of energy and planning .
I guess when supposedly proud beggars of New Hampshire say “ Live free or die ” what they mean is “ live on free gasoline from America ’s enemy or die . ”
“ Seriously Mahmoud , all you have to do is offer them a free tank of gas , and they ’re on their knees begging to surrender !
Ha - ha -ha ! ”
Jesus , you Americans have no dignity at all .
You are biggest fags in the world , rolling over to your enemy just for a free tank of gasoline .
Fucking pathetic .

School administrators are spinning their wheels trying to cope with the soaring costs of fuel for school buses .
The bottom line : More students will walk farther this fall .
" All the less drastic measures have pretty much been exploited , " says Robin Leeds of the National School Transportation Association .
" All that sort of easy - picking fruit has been picked . "
Fuel costs are up 35 % - 40 % since last year .
Schools are making more students walk to school and axing buses for extracurricular activities , and more operate on four - day weeks :
• Garden City , Mich. , schools have eliminated Saturday transportation for extracurricular activities .
Last year , the district cut out daily buses for high school students , but after two weeks , the buses were back when parents expressed safety concerns .
• In Nash - Rocky Mount public schools in Nashville , N.C. , a bus for any extracurricular event that is not a competition now depends on funds raised by students or booster groups .
• The Montgomery County , Md. , school board has given Superintendent Jerry Weast authority to expand how far students will walk to school or a bus stop if gas prices create " exigent circumstances . "
At least 86 school districts are on four - day weeks , according to the National School Boards Association .
Kentucky 's Webster County schools switched to four - day weeks in 2005 , saving the district more than $ 400,000 so far .
For the coming year , the school board is considering busing only students who live more than a mile from school rather than let everyone ride , Superintendent James Kemp says .
Transportation for sports and other activities will be up to parents .
In Ohio , more schools are cutting back to the minimum requirement , which means buses only for kindergartners through eighth - graders who live more than 2 miles from school , according to Pete Japikse , the state 's director of pupil transportation .
The number of students on daily buses is down from 1.1 million to 1 million .
Busing advocates say cutting basic bus service jeopardizes safety .
About 800 students die each year going to and from school , but only about 20 deaths are bus-related , according to the National Academies of Sciences .
" Every time you make more kids get off the bus and go some other way , you 're increasing the risks that those kids are not going to get to school alive , " Leeds says .
Drastic cuts also threaten attendance , says Mike Martin of the American School Bus Council .
" When you start to cut transportation , you eliminate the ability to participate in a lot of things that most kids take to be the most enjoyable parts of school , " Martin says .
Some students forced to find their own way to school may not go at all , he says .

Witnesses to the crash have told smh.com .au the group of up to 60 professional cyclists were riding south on Southern Cross Drive , just south of Dacey Avenue , Mascot about 6.30 am when a driver , agitated with being held up , accelerated in front of the pack and then slammed on his brakes , giving the riders no time to stop .
Olympic preparations derailed
Kersten , speaking from a chiropractor 's surgery where he was having his injuries assessed , said he feared his preparation for the Beijing Olympics could be derailed by the incident .
" I did hurt myself , I 'm not broken or anything , but I am going to need a few days ' recovery , " he said .
" I 'm having trouble bending my arm , my hip 's all flared up .
I rolled my ankle so it 's not something you just walk straight through , but a lot of other people looked a lot worse than me .
It 's just a disgrace , an absolute disgrace .
" I have an Olympic trial in two - and - a half weeks for the last remaining spot [ on the team ] so it 's not very good timing at all .
" I 've got to get a new bike now , I 've got to worry about my injuries , I 'm supposed to be at training now but I 'm at the chiropractor .
Every day counts .
This is not what you need . "
Kersten said motorists needed to learn to share the road with cyclists .
" This is our training ground .
We can't ride round and round a football stadium at 60 k mh .
The law states we are allowed on the road .
A brutal death match on the road is not going to solve anything , " he said .
" We 're so lucky somebody is n't dead , we were pushing 60 k mh , sprawled all over the road with trucks going past .
I really do n't know how someone is n't dead , that 's all I can say . "
Kersten said any person found guilty of driving offences related to the crash should have to pay compensation to the riders whose equipment was damaged .
" My bike suffered a fair bit of damage , it 's carbon and it's got a crack in it and the wheels are written off , " he said .
" It 's probably about $ 12,000 worth [ of damage ] but I am lucky enough to be sponsored by a [ cycling manufacturer ] , so they will be able to do something , but there are 50 other bikes in the bunch that are not sponsored .
" I definitely think [ the driver ] should [ pay compensation ] .
I think there was probably close to $ 50,000 worth of bike damage done .
" But I just want to see him go to jail , I do n't give a hoot about the bikes because I do n't think someone of that calibre is going to fork out one cent .
I would rather see him go to jail . "
Group called the Coluzzi Ride
One of the riders said the cycling group called itself the Coluzzi Ride after the Darlinghurst cafe it regularly set out from and was made up of " serious , A - grade riders and pros " .
" A lot of Olympians and professionals when they are in town join the ride , most of them are just higher level amateurs , you have to be pretty fast to keep up , " said rider Nick Cooper , 27 .
One of the group said the motorist was " worrying " the rear of the pack , then overtook , pulled in front and slammed on his brakes , giving the riders no time to stop .
Slammed into each other
" Everyone 's slammed into each other ... there were broken bikes - wheels busted and wheels snapped - and people lying on the road . "
Mr Cooper said : " Three female cyclists took the brunt of the accident , careering into the back of the braking vehicle , several of them being thrown into the air landing on the boot and roof of the car .
" Most riders were left with cuts and bruises and at least some damage to bikes , shoes and helmets , including some bikes sustaining thousands of dollars of damage .
" This whole incident really exemplified the escalating road rage towards cyclists happening on Sydney 's roads .
" Road rage seems to occur with or without provocation , and regardless of whether cyclists are riding in a law abiding way , or slowing down traffic .
Motorists jeered " A perfect example of the enmity were the jeers and taunts of several drivers - more than three separate drivers that I noticed - making their way past the aftermath of the accident , despite the fact that a police car and two ambulances were on the scene treating seriously injured people .
" [ A ] policemen informed us that the back of the group was nearly cleaned up by a semitrailer locking the brakes to avoid the suddenly halting group , with its trailer jackknifing and sliding towards the group before being skilfully brought under control by the driver , narrowly avoiding potential fatalities , " Mr Cooper said .
He said he overheard one rider telling a policewoman that his bicycle , which had sustained major damage to its front wheel , was worth $ 9000 .
Michelle Ferris , who was at the front of the pack , described the collision .
" We we 're all in the left hand lane and this Ford Falcon came from the middle lane and swerved into the front of the bunch and braked suddenly , " she said .
" We were doing about 40 k mh , there was no way for me to go and I went straight into the back of his car and other riders went into me .
" My chin [ hit ] the back window and my bike was totalled . "
Police - including an off - duty officer who witnessed the crash - quickly closed the lane down while they investigated the incident .
Driver known to police
It is understood they know who the driver of the car is , and are attempting to contact him now .
It is expected he will be charged , including with failing to stop at the scene of an accident and negligent or dangerous driving .
There was no doubt the driver of the dark blue Ford Falcon - described by other witnesses as in his 30s with a female passenger - had done it deliberately , she said .
Everyone was particularly worried about Kate Nichols , given her involvement in the 2005 road crash in Germany in which national team member Amy Gillett was killed , Ferris said .
" We were all very worried about her .
When I saw her she was as white as a ghost still sitting on the ground . "
Nichols 's father Kevin , who was also involved in the crash , said his daughter had only just begun riding again after a lengthy lay - off .
" She 's pretty shaken , it 's a pretty shaking incident , " he said .
" She just started [ riding again ] last week , she had a long break and had just started out again .
She had n't ridden with this group for months .
" She had had a bit of tiredness , issues being sorted out , she had started work and was taking it easy .
She was sick last year , she had a virus . "
Mr Nichols said he was not sure if the crash , so soon after the horrific injuries she suffered in Germany in 2005 , would prompt his daughter to give the sport away completely .
" Who knows ? " he said .
" You take each day as it comes with this sort of thing . "
His daughter was not in contention for the Australian Olympic cycling team for this year 's Games , he added .
Mr Nichols said she was not badly injured but had a bump on the head and was having precautionary X - rays following the crash , which he described as " malicious " .
He said he saw the face of the driver of the Falcon and his female passenger , whom he believed were both aged in their 30s , and said they appeared to find their actions funny .
" Most motorists are really good , but clowns such as the person today are just one out of the box , " he said .
Road rules for cyclists Cyclists riding in groups on public roads can only cycle next to one other rider - a law described by the Roads and Traffic Authority as riding " two abreast " - and must not ride more than 1.5 metres apart .
The RTA 's website also stipulates that cyclists must ride in a bicycle lane if one is available and can use bus lanes , except when the lane is marked " buses only " .
Contrary to some correspondence to smh.com.au today , the section of road where the crash happened was flanked by a shoulder , not a cycle path .
Children under 12 are allowed to ride on a footpath but adults are only permitted to use them if they are supervising a child .
Ferris said the group involved in today 's crash were obeying the road rules before the pile - up .
" We were riding two abreast and 1.5 metres from the left of the lane , " she said .
" We were all riding together , we certainly were n't going out there to cause trouble . "
Ferris , who said she was feeling " pretty sore " after being one of the first to crash into the braking vehicle , said some of the ignorance in the community about the rights of cyclists on the road was " just astounding " .

Do Assassinations Change History ?
" A country whose autocrat is assassinated is 13 percentage points more likely to move toward democracy in the following year than a country where the assassination attempt on the autocrat failed . "
Do assassinations change history ?
It 's a tangled question , given the many political , military , socioeconomic , and other forces at work .
But a new study suggests that political assassinations can change the course of individual nations .
" We find that assassinations of autocrats produce substantial changes in the country 's institutions , while assassinations of democrats do not , " conclude authors Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Olken in Hit Or Miss ?
The Effect of Assassinations on Institutions and War ( NBER Working Paper No.13102 ) .
They also find that the killing of leaders intensifies small - scale conflicts but may hasten the end of large - scale ones .
Their analysis demonstrates a violent means through which societies democratize , and more generally illustrates the important role of individual leaders in shaping institutions and conflict .
The analysis further suggests the key role that random events - such as whether a bullet hits or misses its target -- can play in shaping events .
One of the startling findings in this paper is how common assassinations are .
The authors focus narrowly on nations ' leaders - the most powerful individual within a given country .
They do n't include in their study " coup d'etats , " where a group kills the head of state in order to seize power .
Also , they only look at " serious " attempts on leaders ' lives - incidents where the weapon was actually discharged .
( Note : Guns are the most frequently used and effective weapons ; bombs are also frequently used but are not very effective , the study finds . )
Even with all those restrictions , there have been 298 serious assassination attempts on leaders worldwide since 1875 , the authors calculate .
Of those , only a fifth - 59 - succeeded .
The number of political assassinations has risen to record levels in recent decades .
A national leader has been assassinated in nearly two of every three years since 1950 , according to the study .
But that 's mostly a factor of there being so many more independent countries than a century ago .
Individually , leaders are safer than they were a century ago , the authors write .
" At the peak in the 1910s , a given leader had a nearly 1 percent chance of being assassinated in a given year ; today , the probability is below 0.3 percent . "
Given the difficulty of separating cause and effect in history , one innovation of this paper is the development of a method for analyzing whether assassinations actually cause change .
To do this , the authors compare successful assassinations with failed assassination attempts .
Their key assumption is that , once the weapon is actually engaged ( the gun fired , the bomb detonated ) , whether the attempt succeeds in killing the leader is driven largely by chance .
To validate this assumption , the authors show that , once the weapon is discharged , death or survival is largely unrelated to features of the attack ( other than weapon ) or the situation of the country at the time of the attack .
That being the case , they use failed attacks as a " control group " for successful attacks and ask whether national outcomes differ substantially depending on the result of the attack .
Their findings are striking : A country whose autocrat is assassinated is 13 percentage points more likely to move toward democracy in the following year than a country where the assassination attempt on the autocrat failed , the authors calculate .
Also , the successful assassination of an autocrat is 19 percentage points more likely than a failed attempt to lead to subsequent leadership changes being made through regular , institutional means .
These effects are not just short - term changes .
They 're still seen a decade or more later .
Assassinations also have an effect on conflict , at least in limited contexts .
The researchers find that successful assassinations lead to an intensification of small - scale conflicts and , perhaps , hasten the end of large - scale conflicts .
Of course , the authors note , these findings are based on the differences between failed and successful attempts .
Thus , it 's difficult to tell whether the observed phenomena are caused by successful assassinations , failed assassinations , or both .
To gain some insight into which type of outcome - success or failure - tends to matter , this study includes additional analysis using a method called propensity - score matching .
Though less conclusive , that analysis backs up the commonsense notion that successful assassinations have a much bigger impact than failed ones .
However , there are some signs that failed attempts trim the chances of a move toward democratization somewhat , perhaps because autocrats can crack down on opposition movements after a failed assassination attempt .
Besides providing evidence for certain theories of democratization , institutional change , and war , this study emphasizes how random events can lead to profound change .
" Had Hitler lingered 13 minutes longer in a Munich beer hall in 1939 , he would likely have been killed by a waiting bomb , " the authors write .
" Our tests provide evidence that small elements of randomness -- the path of a bullet , the timing of an explosion , small shifts in a leader 's schedule -- can result in substantial changes in national outcomes . "
They conclude : " Whether or not assassinations change ' the history of the world ' in [ British statesman Benjamin ]
Disraeli 's words , they do appear to change the history of individual countries . " -- Laurent Belsie

Sonya Thomas is thin .
At 5 feet 5 inches and 99 pounds , the Alexandria , Va. , resident is one of those people about whom you think , " She must eat like a bird . "
And , in fact , she does , but only because birds supposedly eat twice their body weight in food .
Not surprisingly , her name notwithstanding , Thomas is Korean .
Have you ever gone out for Korean BBQ ?
How did you feel when you left the table ?
Full ?
I thought so .
( I once asked a Korean friend whether her parents approved of her white boyfriend ( now husband ) , and she sighed and said , " Well , he 's a good eater , so that was good . " )
Thomas , South Korean born , 37 years old and single , is the No. 1 competitive eater in the United States .
She is ranked second in the world , with 22 world titles , and regularly outeats men four and five times her size in contests held throughout the year , earning the self - appointed moniker the Black Widow . "
For those unfamiliar with this sport , competitive eating is just what it sounds like : Contestants sit down in front of a huge pile of baked beans or matzo balls or pulled - pork sandwiches , the timer starts and they eat as much as they can , as fast as they can , until the time is up .
Lest you think this is some cheesy county - fair sideshow , know that competitive eating has become a hugely popular sport ( a designation some observers object to ) with its own governing body , the International Federation of Competitive Eating ( IFOCE ) .
The number of contests has grown from 12 eating events in 1997 to more than 100 last year , 20,000 people show up to watch the Wingbowl each year and Nathan 's Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Championship , the Super Bowl of competitive eating , appeared on the Jumbotron in Times Square last year .
According to Richard Shea of the IFOCE , competitive eating is the fastest - growing sport in the world .
In 2002 , Fox aired a two - hour prime time television special called " The Glutton Bowl , " in which food was dropped from a trash can on a platform into a huge bowl 20 feet below .
The world 's top eaters gorged on a lip - smacking smorgasbord of delicacies , including mayonnaise , butter and cow tongue .
Competitive eating has spawned its own celebrities as well .
The No. 1 eater in the world , Takeru " the Tsunami " Kobayashi , won the last Nathan 's contest by eating 50 hot dogs in 12 minutes , doubling the previous record .
The 5 - foot - 7 - inch , 145 - pound Kobayashi also blew away the elephantine competition on " The Glutton Bowl " by outscarfing them and wrapping up the proceedings by slurping down 50 - plus cow brains .
The diminutive Thomas is second in the world only to the similarly slender gobblemeister , the latest and greatest in a tradition of Japanese eaters who pose an ever increasing challenge to American eating supremacy .
( The Coney Island title went to a Japanese eater in 1997 , and the Japanese have owned it ever since ) .
On the IFOCE Web site is a proclamation : " There is an century - old prophecy within the competitive - eating community , dismissed by most , that foretells the rise of the One Eater , a woman who will electrify America 's gurgitators and lead them to international victory once again .
Like Joan of Arc before her , this eater will be slender of stature but mighty in strength .
In recent months , the prophecy has been mentioned more and more frequently as the eaters have watched Sonya Thomas excel in nearly every contest she enters . "
As the summer season approaches for Nathan 's qualifiers -- smaller regional hot - dog - eating contests whose winners qualify to compete in the championships on July 4 and take a crack at winning the coveted mustard belt -- those who care about these sorts of things may be wondering whether Kobayashi will retain his title , and maybe a few will also wonder whether the teeny - tiny Thomas could do the seemingly impossible and bring gluttonous glory back to the U.S.A .
Her record speaks for itself .
Some of Thomas 's recent accomplishments include :
-- March 20 , 2005 -- 46 dozen ( 552 ) oysters in 10 minutes .
-- Feb. 12 , 2005 -- 25 grilled cheese sandwiches in 10 minutes .
-- Jan. 22 , 2005 -- one 9 - pound burger with cheese in 48 minutes , 10 seconds .
-- Nov. 27 , 2004 -- 52 hard - boiled eggs in five minutes .
- Sept. 29 , 2004 -- 48 soft - shell chicken tacos in 11 minutes .
- Sept. 5 , 2004 -- 5.09 pounds of buffalo wings ( 162 wings ) in 12 minutes -- Aug. 21 , 2004 -- 9.76 pounds of lobster meat ( 38 soft - shell lobsters ) in 12 minutes .
-- July 4 , 2004 -- 32 Nathan 's hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes , a new women 's world record ( and American record )
How It All Began
Thomas , who grew up poor in South Korea , was born competitive .
" I hate to lose , " she said .
" I hate to lose . "
Thomas moved to the United States in 1997 and settled in Alexandria .
Back then , she had little else in her life besides a job , and her spirit continued to , well , hunger for more .
It was so bad , Thomas said , that she became depressed and even considered suicide .
But everything changed in 2002 , when , on television one day , she saw Nathan 's Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Championship .
She knew in a split second it was for her .
" It was my dream , " she said .
" I just wanted to be there .
They looked like celebrities because they were on TV eating . "
To get there , she had to win a qualifying regional contest .
But Thomas had no experience with eating fast , and she did n't normally eat hot dogs , so she bought two from 7 - Eleven and set a timer .
One minute passed , and she was still on her first dog .
" Oh , my God .
Yes , one minute , " she said .
" That was Christmastime , Christmas Day 2002 .
I say , ' I can't finish one hot dog in one minute .
How can I be there ?'
" And then I give up , " she continued . " ' OK , ' I say , ' I 'm not going to try .
If I can not do well , then there 's no point in losing .
I do n't like to lose . ' "
But she watched the video of the contest again .
" And then I saw Takeru Kobayashi -- No. 1 in the world .
When I look at him , he 's so small , like me , and look at him -- he 's a human being .
He 's human .
Why can't I ? "
A month later , she decided to give it another try .
She ate 15 hot dogs in 12 minutes and thought , " OK , now I 'm ready . "
Thomas entered the Molly Pitcher Qualifier in New Jersey .
Jason " Crazy Legs " Conti ( ranked 17th in the United States ) , who also competed that day , remembers her appearance .
" I did not notice the petite Korean - American woman patiently waiting for the contest to begin .
No one else noticed her , either , " he wrote in Topic magazine .
" And then this tiny , tiny woman named Sonya Thomas delicately put away her 18th hot dog and bun , smiled and won . "
Thomas said , " That first eating contest , I was nervous , but I won that one -- 18 hot dogs with bun in 12 minutes . "
Winning the qualifier meant she was eligible for the big show : Nathan's .
Conti wrote , " On the Fourth of July , 2003 , Sonya appeared nervous .
This , the ultimate eating extravaganza , was only her second contest .
I do n't think anyone knew what to expect of the Tinkerbell - size lady sandwiched between two 400 - pound men .
Sonya looked like she would be more at home at a beauty pageant than at an all - you - can - eat event .
" With a dazzling smile and demure wave , she calmly and neatly ate 25 hot dogs and buns , placing fourth and setting a new female record , " he concluded .
Thomas simply said , " Then I move up .
One week later , I ate 25 .
Like moving up , you know .
Improve myself .
Every time , I just improve myself . "
The Regimen
The eating technique various so - called gurgitators use is a source of much speculation .
Some competitive eaters religiously watch videos of Kobayashi to analyze his style so they can improve theirs .
One secret to fast hot dog eating is dunking the bun so it 's easier to swallow and you do n't need to spend time drinking water from a cup between bites .
The hot dogs can't go down whole , either .
" You have to chew a little , because if you do n't chew it , you can choke , " said Thomas .
( Apparently , Kobayashi swears by the " Solomon approach , " breaking hot dogs and buns in half first . )
" You have to have a strong jaw , too , " said Thomas .
" It gets tired , your jaw . "
You also want to guard against the involuntary act that can shame you and get you disqualified from an event , variously known as a " reversal of fortune , " a " Roman incident , " " urges contrary to swallowing " or , more commonly , throwing up .
According to Thomas , people tend to vomit because they 're eating so fast , they 're not paying attention .
" You have to try to get time for burps , and belching , to make yourself comfortable , and then you can continue to do it , " she said .
Many observers subscribe to Ed Krachie 's " belt of fat " theory , which states that thin people have an advantage because abdominal fat can inhibit stomach expansion .
In 1998 , competitive eater Krachie wrote a journal article -- rejected , not surprisingly , by many scientific journals in the United States and Canada -- called " Can Abdominal Fat Act as a Restrictive Agent on Stomach Expansion ?
An Exploration of the Impact of Adipose Tissue on Competitive Eating . "
Suffice it to say that the very top eaters are slim but the majority of players are gargantuan folks used to packing away whole chickens and cakes and demolishing all - you - can - eat buffets with a great deal of pleasure and a modicum of pride as well .
As for pre-event training , Kobayashi supposedly shrinks his stomach by running , then expands it with cabbage and water to teach the organ to distend .
He is also said to eat only one huge multihour meal a day .
Thomas follows a similar regimen .
According to her , when she lived in Korea , she was heavier than she is now by 30 pounds , all due to her diet and her job as a typist : " I never move my body . "
And she ate all day .
" I do n't drink any water , I just eat lots of junk food , like snacks all the time , " Thomas recalled .
" I do n't eat meals .
When I go to eat a meal , I eat a little bit , not much .
But I was constantly eating snacks . "
Nowadays , Thomas ' routine could n't be more different from her habits of old .
Every day , she hits the treadmill for 1 1/2 hours .
" Walking fast on incline , high incline , " she said .
" Before work .
Never after work .
I 'm too tired . "
She eats only one meal a day , from 6 to 9 p.m. , generally at her beloved Burger King .
A normal meal for her ?
" Chicken Whopper , grilled chicken , right ? " she said .
" Without mayonnaise .
I do n't eat mayonnaise .
I do n't eat any fatty things . "
Is that because you do n't want to gain weight ?
" Yes , I have to watch out , too , right ? "
Really ?!
You 're 99 pounds .
" Oh , no !
Even though you 're 99 pounds , you have to watch out because if you have a habit of putting on mayonnaise all the time , then you have to have that .
So I have to say to myself , ' Anytime I eat a sandwich , I do n't want to eat mayonnaise , but I want ketchup , or mustard . ' "
She does allow herself some leeway : " But one thing , OK ?
One thing , I love Burger King french fries .
I love it .
I can not skip my fries .
I have to eat them every day .
Really .
I eat large french fries with that Chicken Whopper .
Every day .
And then a five - piece Chicken Tenders .
And then I drink 42 - ounce -- Burger King king - size cups -- Diet Cokes , about three , with my meal . "
Do you think this is healthy ?
" That 's my style . "
You feel good , though ?
You feel healthy ?
" Yeah , I feel good .
Really . "
The Circuit
So , does Thomas pal around with all the other eaters she competes against -- big guys four times her size with names like Bill " El Wingador " Simmons , Eric " Badlands " Booker and Dale " Mouth o' the South " Boone ?
She claims she 's not a social person .
" I do n't like it -- too boring for me , " she said .
" Me is always my way .
I want to do it my way .
I 'm very selfish ; I 'm very stubborn .
That 's my personality . "
Her way , however , appears to be working quite well for her .
Thomas ' appetite is legendary .
And she works it .
After the lobster - eating contest , in which she blew away reigning champ Kevin " the Boss " Cross in his home state of Maine by eating 9.76 pounds of lobsters ( 38 of them ) , she was asked whether she could eat more and she replied , " Yes , but something else -- not a lobster . "
After winning the first Turducken eating championship , scarfing eight plates of chicken stuffed into a duck stuffed into a turkey in 12 minutes , she remarked , " I do n't really like turkey , but this was so good that I could eat more . "
And radio personality Drew Garabo of WTKS , in Orlando , Fla. , chronicles how Thomas went head to head on - air with his producer and an unnamed listener in a quesadilla - eating contest .
Thomas blew them both out of the water by eating 31 1/2 quesadillas in five minutes .
Then she settled into the interview with a large bucket of popcorn .
Remember , she weighs 99 pounds .
But putting it away is n't always a piece of cake for her .
She won one contest by eating 11 pounds of cheesecake with coffee on an empty stomach in nine minutes .
" Oh , my God , I was so sick ! " she said .
( By her own admission , she did end up suffering a reversal of fortune after this one -- the only time ever . )
But the hardest was the recent Big Daddy Barrick Burger contest , hosted by Las Vegas ' Plaza Hotel , which she won by eating a 9 - pound burger in 48 minutes .
Thomas said it was the toughest because of the quantity of food .
Now , 46 dozen oysters may seem like a larger amount , but , according to Thomas , the burger was much harder because she ate the bun first , dunking it in water , according to her usual style .
Big mistake .
After about a pitcherful of water , she still had to eat the meat itself ( more than 7 pounds ) .
She said that the combined weight of food and water is probably 17 or 18 pounds .
" After I eat that burger , my stomach has no room , " she said .
" After every other eating contest , I still have room , I still can drink water , I still can eat ice cream .
Even though I ate 46 Crystal burgers in eight minutes , afterward , I went to the food court , I ate Chinese food .
Because I had more room . "
Next year , with the Barrick Burger , she said , " Meat first , bun later . "
The best thing Thomas ever ate ?
" Oh , man , oysters and chicken wings , " she said .
" Oysters .
Easy to eat , and I like them .
Chicken wings are so much fun , and I like them , too .
But my favorite thing , I think , is hard - boiled eggs . "
Ooh , that would be hard .
" Oh , no , it 's not hard .
Easy for me .
Other people cannot do it .
Only me . "
Why do you think that is ?
" Think about this -- 65 hard - boiled eggs in six minutes and 40 seconds .
Do you think other people can do it ?
They do n't want to try .
No . "
What 's your secret ?
" I think I love to eat eggs .
OK , here 's my technique : I bite a little bite , one or two bites , and drink water , drink a little bit .
Zip , you know ?
And constantly do it .
So easy for me .
I think that 's my specialty .
Hard - boiled eggs is my specialty . "
The Future
Sonya Thomas does n't live by gluttony alone .
She still works full time as a manager for Burger King , even though she is the highest earner in the U.S. eating community .
" Right now , I 'm good .
I 'm good at making money , " she said .
" It 's OK , but not enough for a living . "
And she says she'd do it even if no money were involved .
" I love doing it because I can win , " Thomas added .
" That 's my hobby .
Makes me happy . "
Besides , she loves her job too much to quit .
" You know why I work fast food ? " she said .
" I want to be the best manager , too .
When I 'm working , I work so fast , nobody can beat me . "
Her allegiance to Burger King is the stuff a corporate ad exec dreams about .
" I love working at Burger King , " she added .
" I do n't like McDonald 's food .
No way .
I love Burger King food . "
So , what are her goals ?
" My first goal is , I want to have my own Burger King , just one store , " Thomas said .
" I really want it .
I can do it . "
She thinks it 'll take her 10 years to save up enough money -- a half million dollars in cash and a million more for the property to buy one franchise .
Her second goal is to be the No. 1 eater in the world :
She wants to beat Takeru Kobayashi .
" I have to practice , " she said .
" I have to practice more technique .
Then .
I do n't know . "
Thomas thinks she has a chance in a short contest like an eight - to 10 - minute one because then she can focus on technique .
" See , if I swallow fast , then I can compete with him , " she said .
" But my swallow is not fast enough , that 's the only thing .
And stomach capacity -- he can stretch his stomach so big , 5 pounds , 20 pounds .
He can handle that , his stomach , but me ?
I do n't think so . "
You can bet she 'll put every ounce of steely determination she has into trying , though .
" Koreans care about winning , " she told me .
" Korean people , their mind .
Do you see that ?
In all sports , they try to be the top one .
They care only about top one ; they do n't care about second one , third one .
You know , it 's Korean style .
That 's why I learned that , too .
In my life , I have to be top one -- you know , that 's me .
I cannot take second place , third place . "
She might be Korean in spirit , but Thomas loves living in America .
" Yeah , I love it , " she said .
" More freedom .
You can do anything you want .
In America , there 's so much freedom .
I like it . "
Her Web site says it all : " And beneath what you may see on the surface , know this : My Yankee Doodle Dandy heart proudly pumps red , white and blue blood to the beat of " God Bless America . "
One day ... one day ! "
One day ?
Could that one day be July 4 ?
If so , Takeru Kobayashi had best beware .
God Bless America , indeed .

The history of scientific discovery is full of missteps .
Sometimes iffy ideas lead to stronger theories .
Other times , a good idea becomes a bad idea .
And still others seem like they were always bad ideas ( if scientists do n't understand why something glows in the dark , maybe you should n't paint your face with it ) .
1. Fire - proof Aprons !
The bright idea :
In the early 1900s , designers offered the perfect solution for women who hated seeing a dirty ashtray on the kitchen table — asbestos tablecloths .
In fact , housewives ( and magicians ) were delighted to find out that asbestos materials came with a neat cleaning trick : if you set an asbestos tablecloth on fire , stains would come out , and the things would look brand new !
No more washing and drying .
Of course , with such a novel , fireproof material in their hands , suppliers did n't want to limit asbestos ' potential to the kitchen table .
So , they expanded to kitchen clothing .
" Careless ladies "  who leaned against the stove and caught aflame did n't have to worry anymore thanks to asbestos aprons and oven mitts .
In fact , a 1936 article from The Monessen Daily Independent reported that the only disadvantage to the aprons was that they felt a little " starchy . "
The downer : Although humans had used asbestos since the Greek and Roman empires ( and even though physicians back then noticed that exposure to the fibrous material caused lung ailments ) , the United States did n't start investigating asbestos ' negative affects until the 1970s .
While it took governments centuries to ban asbestos , lawyers caught on much faster and mesothelioma attorneys have been suing companies ever since .
2. Glow - in - the - dark Paint
The bright idea :
In 1889 , Marie Currie and husband Pierre discovered radium and coined the term radioactive .
And while little was known about the alkaline earth metal , one thing was for sure : it glowed in the dark !
Suddenly , the public was captivated by raduim 's luminescence .
Manufacturers painted airplane dials , instruments , and watch faces with radium , spawning a huge glow - in - the - dark fad .
Women began painting their nails with it to impress suitors , for Halloween , people even coated their faces with the stuff to get that oh - so - ghoulish look .
The downer : A dentist in New Jersey noticed that many of his patients , who worked at U.S. Radium , suffered from deteriorating jaws or phossy jaw .
Worse still , the Essex County coroner discovered that women from a plant were dying of severe anemia and leukemia .
By 1925 , he 'd collected enough data to prove that radiation was so high in the women 's bodies that it was likely the cause of death .
As if exposure to the material was n't bad enough , many of the watch - painting women had been dipping the tip of their paintbrushes in their mouths to make a finer point for painting tiny numbers on watches .
Unfortunately , it took physicians a little while to officially link the substance with cancer .
3. An Automatic Flosser
The bright idea :
It 's tough reaching those back molars with dental floss , and it 's even harder to floss them .
That 's why Oral - B created the Hummingbird flosser , the Cadillac of dental aids .
The ergonomically designed , vibrating electric flosser was made to gently massage those hard to reach spots and turn the flossing experience into a dream .
The downer : Oral - B investors had no idea the Hummingbird flosser would make picking padlocks a dream , too .
With a few modifications — mainly changing the power source from a AAA battery to a D battery and replacing the floss with a pick — nefarious MacGyvers can create a vibrating pick that will pop open most padlocks .
Even those inept at building can follow the step - by - step directions on the Web ( not that we 're encouraging it ! ) .
ABC releases excerpts of Edwards ' nightline interview , revealing affair RAW STORY

The following excerpts are from an interview by ABC News ' Bob Woodruff of former Sen. John Edwards for ABC News " Nightline " on Aug. 8 , 2008 , release in a press release late Friday .
RAW STORY 's full story follows .
BOB WOODRUFF : Senator , before we start this I just want to make it clear to our audience that you asked me to come here , and asked me to come here to talk about the reports about your personal life .
&
Let me ask you the question , did you have an affair with Ms. Hunter ?
JOHN EDWARDS : In 2006 2 years ago , I made a very serious mistake .
A mistake that I am responsible for and no one else .
In 2006 I told Elizabeth about the mistake , asked her for her forgiveness , asked God for his forgiveness .
And we have kept this within our family since that time .
All of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear , none of them are responsible for it .
I am responsible for it .
I alone am responsible for it .
And it led to this most recent incident at the Beverly Hilton .
I was at the Beverly Hilton .
I was there for a very simple reason , because I was trying to keep this mistake that I had made from becoming public .
BOB WOODRUFF : Is this affair completely over ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Oh yes , it 's been over for a long time .
WOODRUFF :&
How long did it last and when exactly did it end ?
JOHN EDWARDS : Well , here 's the way I feel about this Bob .
I think that my family is entitled to every detail .
They 've been told every detail .
Elizabeth knows absolutely everything .
I think beyond the basics , the fact that I made this mistake and I 'm responsible for it and no one else .
I think that 's where it stops in terms of the public because I think everything else is within my family and those privacy boundaries ought to be respected .
WOODRUFF : I know this is a very difficult question , but were you in love with [ Rielle Hunter ] ?
EDWARDS : I 'm in love with one woman .
I 've been in love with one woman for 31 years .
She is the finest human being I have ever known .
And the fact that she is with me after this having happened is a testament to the kind of woman and the kind of human being she is .
There is a deep and abiding love that exists between Elizabeth and myself .
It 's always been there , it in my judgment has never gone away .
WOODRUFF : Your wife , Elizabeth , is probably the most admired and beloved person in this country , she 's had enormous sympathy because she 's also gone through cancer , how could you have done this ?
EDWARDS : Here 's what , can I explain to you what happened ?
First of all it happened during a period after she was in remission from cancer , that 's no excuse in any possible way for what happened .
This is what happened .
It 's what happened with me and I think happens unfortunately more often sometimes with other people .& Ego .
Self - focus , self - importance .
Now , I was slapped down to the ground when my son Wade died in 1996 , in April of 1996 .
But then after that I ran for the senate and I got elected to the Senate and here we go again , it 's the same old thing again .
Adulation , respect , admiration .
Then I went from being a senator , a young senator to being considered for vice president , running for president , being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure .
All of which fed a self - focus , an egotism , a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want .
You 're invincible .
And there will be no consequences .
And nothing , nothing could be further from the truth .
WOODRUFF : So your assumption was that you 'd just never be caught ?
EDWARDS : It was a huge judgment , mistake in judgment .
But yeah , I did n't think anyone would ever know about it .
I did n't .
And the important thing is , how could I ever get to the place , to that place and allow myself to let that happen ?
WOODRUFF : &[ I ] f you thought that you would not get caught , how did [ Elizabeth ] find out about this affair ?
EDWARDS : I told her .
WOODRUFF : This was before there was public reporting on this ?
EDWARDS : Oh it was way before .
This was in 2006 .
I decided , it was clear to me very quickly after this happened that I had to tell her that I loved her , she was central to my life , she had to know it and it was painful for her .
Hard and painful for her , but she responded exactly like the kind of woman she is .
And then she forgave me and we went to work on it .
I 'm not saying she thought it was okay , I 'm not saying that , but she did forgive me .
Listen , she understands what I understand which is that I am imperfect and anybody , anybody watching this broadcast or who hears about this who wants to beat me up for this , they should have at it .
The truth is you can't possibly beat me up more than I have already beaten myself up .
WOODRUFF : Why did you continue to deny it [ publicly ] and not tell the truth ?
EDWARDS : Because I did not want the public to know what I had done .
Fair and simple .
And there 's also a lot of these you know supermarket tabloid allegations are just lies , they 're complete lies .
But this , this mistake , is the truth .
* WOODRUFF : When Elizabeth did find out about this , how has she coped ?
What was her reaction to that ?
EDWARDS : She was mad , she was angry , I think furious would be a good way to describe it .
She did n't understand .
We both went through a process of trying to figure out how it happened , why it happened .
But she was amazing , she 's just an amazing person .
Elizabeth and I have been married 31 years .
The admiration she gets from the public is deserved and , but nobody can see -- Bob , you 've been married a long time , nobody can see inside everybody 's marriage .
&
This is not something Elizabeth did , this something I did .
And I continue to love and admire her because she has just stood with me .
WOODRUFF : I need to ask about probably the most controversial allegation .
Which is that a report has been published that the baby of Ms. Hunter is your baby .
True ?
EDWARDS : Not true .
Published in a supermarket tabloid .
That is absolutely not true .
WOODRUFF : Have you taken a paternity test ?
EDWARDS : I have not , I would welcome participating in a paternity test .
Be happy to participate in one .
I know that it 's not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events , so I know it 's not possible .
Happy to take a paternity test , and would love to see it happen .
WOODRUFF : Are you going to do that soon ?
EDWARDS : I 'm only one side -- I 'm only one side of the test , but I 'm happy to participate in one .
WOODRUFF : Has Miss Hunter said , she does not want to do this DNA test ?
EDWARDS : I do n't know what she has said .
WOODRUFF : People say they are in contact with her , have told us that you have met her out in California several times .
True ?
EDWARDS : I met her this last time when I was in California for the very purpose that you and I just spoke about .
WOODRUFF : And that picture is absolutely you and you are holding that baby .
EDWARDS : The picture in the tabloid .
I have no idea what that picture is .
WOODRUFF : But you 've seen it right ?
EDWARDS : I did see it and I can not make any sense out of that .
When I went to this meeting you 've already asked me about , uh , I was not wearing a t - shirt , I was wearing a long - sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up .
I do n't know who that picture -- I do n't know if that picture is me , it could well be , it looks like me .
I do n't know who that baby is , I have no idea what that picture is .
WOODRUFF : But are you saying you do n't remember holding that child of Miss Hunter ?
EDWARDS : I 'm saying you asked me about this photograph , I do n't know anything about that photograph , I do n't know who that baby is .
I do n't know if the picture has been altered , manufactured , if it 's a picture of me taken some other time , holding another baby -- I have no idea .
I was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken I can tell you that .
WOODRUFF : You did say you did meet her at a hotel in California .
EDWARDS : She was there , Mr. McGovern was present , and that 's where the meeting took place .
WOODRUFF : But you do n't remember a baby being there ?
EDWARDS : No . WOODRUFF : There are reports that you have tried to cover up .
They call it alleged hush money .
That there was money paid to try , to cover up this affair .
Was there ?
EDWARDS : Uh , this is what I can tell you .
I 've never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved .
I 've never asked anybody to pay a dime of money , never been told that any money 's been paid .
Nothing has been done at my request .
So if the allegation is that somehow I participated in the payment of money -- that is a lie .
An absolute lie , which is typical of these types of publications .
WOODRUFF : I do need to tell you though through ABC investigation there has been evidence , or we 've been told that there , about $ 15,000 a month has been paid to Miss Hunter , so that she could actually live out in California .
In fact that money was from Fred Baron , who was your national finance chair .
Is that correct ?
EDWARDS : I do n't know .
I told you just a moment ago , I know absolutely nothing about this .
WOODRUFF : You never even heard about that before ?
EDWARDS : I 've heard about it from reporters like you just in the last few days .
It 's the first I hear anything about it .
WOODRUFF : And Andrew Young has declared publicly that he is the father of the baby , of Miss Hunter .
EDWARDS : I 'm aware of that .
WOODRUFF : Do you think that 's true ?
EDWARDS : I do n't know .
WOODRUFF : So when you see this now and you see the reporting about it and you see the information about it , are you going to try to look into this ?
That this is somebody doing this to cover up what happened with your affair ?
EDWARDS : If you 're talking about Fred Baron , I do know Fred Baron .
I also know that Fred Baron knows both of these people who are involved and has worked with them for years .
So he has the relationship with them independent of me .
So what he chose to do or not do , I can't explain , he 'll have to explain .
I do n't know what he did or why he did it .
And what his reasons for , were , for doing it .
Is it possible that he wanted to help them because they were in a difficult time ?
Of course .
Is it possible that he was worried that in fact something had happened with me , and he wanted to help ?
Of course that 's possible .
I think all these things are possible .
WOODRUFF : Do you think it 's possible he was trying to protect you ?
EDWARDS : Do I think it was possible he was trying to help me ?
WOODRUFF : Yes .
EDWARDS : Yeah , of course I think it 's possible .
WOODRUFF : Do you think your political career is completely over ?
EDWARDS : I 'm not sure I had a political career for the future anyway .
I 'm not sure that politics was what I wanted to spend my life doing .
WOODRUFF : Will your marriage survive ?
EDWARDS : Oh yeah .
Oh yeah .
I think our marriage will not only survive but be strong .
WOODRUFF : When you hired Ms. Hunter , that was back in 2006 , the committee hired in July 2006 , paid her $ 114,000 to make films for you .
She did have a lot of experience .
Uh was the affair going on when you hired her ?
EDWARDS : No .
No .
And again , I always said this to you , I do n't think I 'm going to go through the details of this , I already did it with Elizabeth -- uh , she was hired to come in and produce films and that 's the reason she was hired .
WOODRUFF : But this had nothing to do with the fact that you were having an affair with her ?
EDWARDS : Same answer .
Same answer -- no I did not .
WOODRUFF : So you hired her before it even started ?
EDWARDS : That is correct .
WOODRUFF : In terms of the Beverly Hilton , did Elizabeth , your wife , know you were visiting the Beverly Hilton ?
EDWARDS : No . WOODRUFF : That was a secret ?
EDWARDS : You mean did I tell her before I went ?
WOODRUFF : Yeah .
EDWARDS : I did not .
WOODRUFF : Did she find out after the recourse ?
EDWARDS : She found out the next morning ; I called her and told her .
* WOODRUFF : And in terms of this baby -- does Elizabeth think this is possibly your baby ?
EDWARDS : No , of course not .
WOODRUFF : Is it only possible to prove it though with a DNA test ?
EDWARDS : I 'm not a scientist -- I do n't know what the various methods of proving it are but that 's certainly one way to prove it .
I mean I know right now it 's not possible and she does too .
WOODRUFF : When you do do that test or if you do that test , would you tell us the result of it ?
EDWARDS : Sure , of course .
WOODRUFF : Did you want to control [ Ms. Hunter ] to some degree ?
In the sense that you did n't want her to reveal this relationship ?
EDWARDS : I wanted her not to tell the public what had happened .
Very simple .
That 's the reason I went .
Update :
Why some news orgs .
refrained from reporting allegations Former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards on Friday admitted to an extramarital affair while his wife was battling cancer .
He denied fathering the woman 's daughter .
Edwards told ABC
News that he lied repeatedly about the affair with a 42 - year - old woman but said that he did n't love her .
He said he has not taken a paternity test but knows he is n't the father because of the timing of the affair and the birth .
ABC said a former Edwards campaign staffer claims he is the father , not Edwards .
In 2006 , Edwards ' political action committee paid $ 100,000 in a four - month span to a newly formed firm run by Rielle Hunter , who directed the production of just four Web videos , one a mere 2 1/2 minutes long .
Hunter 's daughter , Frances Quinn Hunter , was born on Feb. 27 , 2008 , and no father 's name is given on the birth certificate filed in California .
Edwards was a top contender for the Democratic nomination for president .
He placed second in the Iowa caucuses last January but dropped out of the race a few weeks later .
Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina , was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2004 .
News organizations were wary to report alleged affair Many news organizations - including RAW STORY - did not report on the alleged affair because of its source .
The tabloid National Enquirer has been sued often in the past for making up stories .
Last year , Alan Butterfield , one of the writers behind the Edwards story , wrote about Ted Kennedy 's alleged " love child " and was subsequently sued by the baby 's mother .
Butterfield was also sued for an article which alleged that actor Ben Affleck cheated with strippers while famously dating Jennifer Lopez .
Five years ago he was also involved in a scandal which developed at the Salt Lake Tribune .
The Tribune " fired two reporters who were paid $ 20,000 for collaborating with the National Enquirer on an Elizabeth Smart story because they misled their employer about the level of their involvement with the tabloid , " the Associated Press reported in 2003 .
In addition , " the story ha[d ] been retracted as part of a settlement between the Smart family and the tabloid . "
A blurry photograph purportedly showing Edwards carrying his alleged " love child " was released by the tabloid nearly two weeks after the story first hit .
Radar noted various reasons why the photo seemed " sketchy . "
David Perel , editor of the Enquirer , talked to Radar but was " mum about the location of the Enquirer 's photographer , the type of camera used ( it 's an extremely blurry photo , after all ) , and how Edwards manages to have the exact same sweat pattern in both photos , even though the conditions and shirts might both be different . "
LA Times editor Tony Pierce " stirred up some internal discontent " at his paper after he " banned its bloggers , including political bloggers , from mentioning the Edwards / Rielle Hunter story , " Slate reported .
Pierce explained why to his staffers in an email : " Because the only source has been the National Enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumors or salacious speculations . "
Excerpts from ABC story : # Edwards said the affair began during the campaign after she was hired .
Hunter traveled with Edwards around the country and to Africa .
Edwards said his wife , Elizabeth , and others in his family became aware of the affair in 2006 .
Edwards made a point of telling Woodruff that his wife 's cancer was in remission when he began the affair with Hunter .
Elizabeth Edwards has since been diagnosed with an incurable form of the disease .

The ravenous giant rabbit , named after the famed Wallace and Gromit character , is reported to have ripped up dozens of prize - winning leeks and turnips .
Now growers in Felton , near Morpeth , have drafted in licensed gamekeepers with air rifles to halt the rampage .
But animal welfare workers have called for the animal to be trapped instead .
Four gardeners described the rabbit as having one ear larger than the other .
The main clues are oversized paw prints and sightings of what growers claim to be a cross between a hare and a rabbit .
It 's been taking huge bites out of cabbages , carrots and turnips ... it 's a hungry fella
Marksman Brian Cadman
A small group of allotment holders have now clubbed together to hire two air rifle marksmen with orders to shoot to kill .
Grower Jeff Smith , 63 , said : " This is no ordinary rabbit .
We are dealing with a monster .
" It is absolutely massive .
I have seen its prints and they are huge , bigger than a deer .
It is a brute of a thing . "
Mr Smith , who has kept an allotment for 25 years , added : " We have two lads here with guns who are trying to shoot it , but it is clever .
" They never see it .
There were big rabbits in the 1950s and 1960s before pesticides were introduced , but not like this . "
Marksman Brian Cadman , 17 , said : " We 've been told to shoot on sight , but we 've not had much luck yet .
" You can see what it 's been eating .
" It 's been taking huge bites out of cabbages , carrots and turnips .
It 's a hungry fella . "
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) urged the growers to set a humane trap for the animal and release it elsewhere .
