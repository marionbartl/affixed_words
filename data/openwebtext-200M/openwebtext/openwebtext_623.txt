As the global demand for air travel increases , so too does the demand to decrease the environmental impact of flight .
The answer may lie in the technological advances made by the next generation of short - haul commercial aircraft currently in development by British low - cost airline , EasyJet .
The unique design of EasyJet ’s “ EcoJet ” promises a 50 % reduction in CO2 emissions by 2015 .
The aircraft will incorporate the latest research by airframe and engine manufacturers around the world – all of which can be incorporated into an aircraft that should be in operation by 2015 .
The projection for the 50 % CO2 reduction is based on the findings from the latest research by industry leaders and will come from the engines ( 25 % ) , the lightweight airframe ( 15 % ) and from improvements to air traffic control technology and design ( 10 % ) .
One of the key design changes made in the EcoJet , is the use of rear - mounted “ open- rotor ” engines .
The reason behind this is simple physics .
The environmental performance ( fuel efficiency ) of a modern jet engine is related to the mass of air that the fan can move , which is driven by the rotor diameter of the fan blades - the larger the fan , the greater the propulsive efficiency .
Conversely , containing such a large diameter fan in a casing would have significant weight and drag penalties .
In the short - haul sector of the market , unducted fan ( open rotor ) engines offer unrivalled environmental performance due to their higher propulsive efficiency .
However , there are significant design penalties in fixing such a large engine under a wing of such a small aircraft , making rear mounting of the engines the optimum solution .
The EcoJet also employs an efficient forward - swept wing design .
One of the primary methods of reducing fuel burn is by reducing drag .
Conventional jet aircraft currently suffer increased drag from turbulent airflow over their wings .
A forward swept wing however , enables airflow from wing tip to wing root ; and a wing profile that provides laminar flow over a significant proportion of the wing .
Laminar flow is the smooth , uninterrupted flow of air over a wing , and is essential to lift .
When the smooth flow of air is interrupted over a wing section , turbulence is created which results in a loss of lift and a high degree of drag .
The EcoJet ’s use of a forward - swept configuration will prolong laminar flow and greatly reduce drag during cruising speeds .
The requirements of a laminar flow wing will dictate a slightly slower design cruise speed – Mach 0.75 ( 570.9 mph , 918.8 km /h ) compared to Mach 0.78/0.79 for today ’s conventional designs .
On the average short haul sector this would add 3 - 10 minutes to the flight , but it is anticipated that air traffic control improvements and faster turn - around times on the ground will compensate for this increase in flight time .
The EcoJet will have at least 3 full size doors , allowing airlines to board passengers through all three doors , speeding up turn - around times .
Even boarding from a single jetbridge connected to the central pair of doors will speed up boarding times , as passengers would be able to head either up or down the aircraft upon entrance instead of forming a single line once inside .
The EcoJet will also be a more autonomous aircraft , requiring less ground equipment -- e.g. as the fuselage is closer to the ground , a belt loader will not needed for the bulk loading and unloading of baggage .
The current average trip length in the short - haul market is around 500 nautical miles ( 575 miles , 926 km ) and 98 % of all commercial flights in the 120 - 240 seat segment are below 2,000 nautical miles ( 2,302 miles , 3,704 km ) .
Therefore the design range of the EcoJet will be 2,000 nm or less .
This reduction of the design range will reduce the weight and size of the aircraft , and will therefore further increase its fuel efficiency .
Additional weight reductions will be realized through the use of advanced weight - reducing materials similar to those used in current projects like the Boeing 787 -- which itself is estimated to be 27 % more fuel efficient than the aircraft it will replace in many fleets .
The wings of the EcoJet are to be manufactured out of carbon fiber composites .
The EcoJet will provide 150 - 250 seats in single class configuration , and 130 - 220 seats in a 2 - class offering .
In easyJet ’s current configuration and operation , the projection for the eco-liner would generate less than 47g of CO2 per passenger km ( 0.167 lb / passenger mile ) .
For comparison , EasyJet ’s current operations generate 97.5g of CO2 per passenger km ( 0.346 lb/ passenger mile ) , the Toyota Prius emits 104g of CO2 per kilometer ( 0.369 lb / mi ) ; and the European car industry has recently been given a target to achieve 130g of CO2 per kilometer ( 0.461 lb / mi ) .
Speaking at a press conference to unveil the EcoJet , Andy Harrison , EasyJet Chief Executive , said :
“ The aviation industry has an excellent record in reducing the environmental footprint of aircraft .
Today ’s aircraft are typically 70 % cleaner and 75 % quieter than their 1960s counterparts .
Now we are planning the next generation that will help towards taking the plane out of the emissions equation . ”
“ The EcoJet represents the next major step forward in airframe and engine technology .
The lightweight structure and open - rotor engines are based on technologies that are being developed right now by the major manufacturers .
The ‘ EasyJet EcoJet ’ is realistic and it is achievable . ”

They claim that every action they have taken has been done with the best interests of Main Street not Wall Street in mind .
Whether their intentions can be believed is questionable .
After all they are politicians .
One thing is certain ; the ramifications of their actions at least in the short term have not benefited Main Street .
As we all know by now , the goal of Washington 's gross intervention in the economy is to unfreeze the credit markets with injections of massive amounts of liquidity .
This unfreezing will allow financial institutions to resume regular lending thereby putting us on the road to recovery .
In other words , the same device ( debt ) that got us into this mess will get us out of it .
That argument aside , as was reported in this column a couple of weeks ago , the best laid plans of Washington are once again going astray .
In that column , I reported that instead of unfreezing the credit markets allowing for a freer flow of capital and lower lending rates , the government 's actions so far have actually resulted in higher mortgage rates and consequently less borrowing .
This is a result of more government debt pushing up the yields on Treasury notes which in turn raises mortgage rates .
Additionally , because Uncle Sam is guaranteeing bank debt , it is becoming more attractive for investors and creating more competition for his own firms – Fannie and Freddie , when they seek to sell their securities .
To compete for investors , the nationalized companies must raise their own yields and then charge borrowers higher rates for mortgages .
As a matter of fact , mortgage rates are higher now than they were before the Fannie / Freddie bailout was launched .
Higher mortgage rates are an old problem , as this week two other concerns were voiced from Washington over the effectiveness of government measures to fix the economy .
It seems that nine Wall Street banks have been asked by Congress to justify billions of dollars in pay and bonuses after they accepted nearly $ 125 billion of taxpayer funded bailout money .
The nine banks include the usual suspects : Bank of America , Bank of New York , Mellon , JPMorgan , Chase & Co. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs Group , and Wells Fargo & Co .
Then there was the revelation from the White House this week that banks receiving taxpayer money were “ hoarding ” the funds and not making new loans .
Apparently , the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) , a key indicator of international lending , remains at elevated levels .
Not good .
But in all fairness to the banks , at least one of them will not be hoarding their federal largess .
It has been reported that the government has approved PNC Financial Services Group Inc. to receive $ 7.7 billion of taxpayer funds and to use $ 5.58 billion of it to purchase National City Corp – so much for the funds being used to unclog the markets .
The problem ultimately is that the government should not be doing what it is doing in the first place .
But beyond that , the capital infusion program has very few strings attached to it .
It was felt that too many strings would discourage bank participation .
Undoubtedly , too few strings are allowing the banks to take full advantage of the taxpayer .
The bottom line is that we are giving hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars of our money to banks that got us into this mess in the first place with virtually no restrictions with the hope that they wo n't do it to us again ?
How stupid or corrupt is that ?
Here 's hoping that the banks continue to hoard our money .
Beyond the reported ill effects on Main Street of the government 's actions to fix the economy , there are other hidden bad consequences as well .
Because the Federal Reserve has decreased interest rates to artificially low levels over the last nine months to stimulate lending ( by the way this has n't worked either ) the earnings of many small community banks have been adversely affected .
Many of these banks were responsible and took no part in subprime lending .
These institutions are important to millions of Americans on Main Street who rely on them for loans and savings accounts .
One of the last things we need is a crisis in the community banking industry .
Current government policy is already making it hard for these institutions to succeed .
Lastly , another hidden bad consequence of the government 's actions is a lowering of the yields on money market and savings accounts .
Again , as the Fed lowers interest rates artificially , savings and money market rates also decline .
Go online or check your next bank statement to notice that your savings rate has gone done .
With more people on Main Street hurting , especially pensioners and those on fixed incomes , the last thing they need is for their last safe haven to be upended by government policy .
But that is what is happening .
We could take Washington at its word that it is doing its best to help Main Street through this crisis .
The consequences of its actions speak otherwise .
Then again , maybe Washington is doing its best ; because when it does its best , we are at our worst .

The Somali coast is the most dangerous in the world for piracy Security forces in northern Somalia have raided and freed an Indian ship hijacked by pirates , capturing four of the hijackers in a gun battle .
Pirates had boarded the ship sailing up the Somali coast from Asia , despite the presence of a flotilla of warships sent to the region to clamp down on piracy .
The crew of 13 were freed unharmed from the vessel .
Dozens of ships have been seized this year in the busy shipping lanes along the Gulf of Aden and close to Somalia .
The authorities in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland in northern Somalia said their forces raided the Indian ship soon after pirates attacked over the weekend .
They said they had captured four of the hijackers in a shootout , while four more escaped .
The ship was the 30th to be taken by pirates this year - most were freed after their owners paid hefty ransoms but ten are still being held , most notably the MV Faina - a Ukrainian ship loaded with 33 tanks and ammunition headed for Kenya .
A Russian guided missile frigate is steaming through the Suez Canal to join an international flotilla of warships that have surrounded the Faina to stop the pirates from unloading its cargo .
Nato has sent ships to support US navy vessels already there , while India and several European countries have said they will also mount anti-piracy patrols .
The Somali coast is still the most dangerous in the world for piracy , but international patience seems at its limit .

What are these ?
A Texas startup has finally pulled the wraps off its 40 - mpg , 450 - horsepower Scorpion roadster , a hand - built hydrogen - burning " eco-exotic " that is sexier than Angelina Jolie and has the performance to provide more grins than nitrous oxide .
Ronn Motor Company unveiled the Scorpion today at the big SEMA , or Speciality Equipment Market Association , automotive trade show in Las Vegas , which may be the perfect place to debut so flashy — and innovative — a car .
The company hopes the Scorpion does for hydrogen what the Tesla Roadster has done for batteries .
" We want to build cool cars , just more responsibly ” , company president Ronn Maxwell told Wired.com .
" Our hope with the Scorpion is to implement a paradigm shift not only in how the industry looks at supercars but at cars in general . "
We got a sneak peak of Scorpion # 001 as it was being unloaded at the Las Vegas Convention Center ...
The Scorpion gets its sting from a hydrogen delivery system the company calls H2GO .
While cars like the Honda FCX Clarity and Chevrolet Equinox use hydrogen fuel cells to drive electric motors , the Scorpion uses electrolysis to convert water into gaseous hydrogen .
The hydrogen is mixed with 91 - octane gasoline to improve the fuel economy and reduce the emissions of the car 's 3.5 - liter internal combustion engine .
Maxwell , a 40 - year auto industry vet and lifelong gearhead who holds several patents , is using the limited production — just 200 will be built — Scorpion to prove the technology works and legitimize the H2GO system the company will begin selling for $ 1,000 early next year .
The way he sees it , if H2GO works on the Scorpion , it 'll work on your Civic .
Maxwell did n't offer much in the way of specifics , saying the publicly traded company is still dotting the i's and crossing the t's on the venture .
But he says H2GO is good for a 15 percent to 33 percent improvement in mileage , a noticeable increase in power and a significant reduction in overall emissions .
The company is pursuing EPA certification of the Scorpion so people can get a better idea of what the system is capable of .
Maxwell insists the 40 - mpg figure is the real deal .
The trucking industry has been using hydrogen boosting for years .
But the Scorpion is significant because it uses what the company calls real - time hydrogen delivery as part of an original factory design .
And unlike BMW ’s Hydrogen 7 , Scorpion does not keep any 30 - gallon tanks full of liquid hydrogen lying around at ? 253 °C ( ?423.4 °F ) .
“ Our system does not require any pressurized hydrogen storage .
It ’s completely safe and uses water from your garden hose to create hydrogen on demand .
We are simply increasing the efficiency of what ’s already there ” , says company COO Damon Kuhn .
“ Even better , the infrastructure to support this technology is here right now , not 10 years from now . ”
Kuhn is referring to the biggest challenges to hydrogen 's use in vehicles — the need for a fueling infrastructure , a venture that by any measure will take many years and many millions of dollars .
Ronn Motors is confident that the sexy Scorpion will top 200 mph .
The chrome - moly chassis and carbon - fiber body surrounds a twin - turbo 3.5 - liter V6 in a car that weighs just 2,200 pounds .
The engine was sourced from Acura — it 's the same mill found in the TL Type S , albeit turbocharged — and mated to a six - speed gearbox .
The car will set you back $ 150,000 , and if 450 ponies is n't enough , another $ 100 grand will get you a tweaked version with another 150 horsepower .
Tom duPont , publisher of the duPont registry , pulled the sheet off the Scorpion this morning and said , “ If it was a square box with a bunch of batteries , I would n’t be getting pre-orders from NBA basketball players .
The exotic styling and amazing performance mixed in with the environmental angle is really inspiring a lot of attention . ”

THE Beijing Olympics may be over , but the long run-up to the London Olympics has begun .
In 2012 baseball and softball will be dropped as Olympic events .
Played by only a handful of countries , they join a long list of discontinued Olympic events .
The 100 m freestyle swim for sailors survived just one Olympics after being limited to sailors from the host country .
If some other events are dropped — farewell to rhythmic gymnastics or synchronised swimming ?— there might be space to bring back more unusual sports .
Perhaps it is time again for live pigeon - shooting ( in Trafalgar Square ) or an old favourite , the tug - of - war .

While there has been a slight reduction in 2013 in some crime categories as reported by the Royal Bahamas Police Force ( RBPF ) , violent crime remains above the 2012 level .
Since July 2013 , the government has not published national crime statistics .
The Bahamas continues to have a high crime rate , particularly on New Providence Island , which has continued to experience escalated levels of violent crime .
Home break - ins , theft , and robbery are not confined to any specific part of the island .
Generally , most reported crimes were perpetrated against local Bahamians in areas of saturated criminality not typically frequented by tourists .

Crimes increase during holiday seasons and before school sessions begin due to the belief that people are in possession of more cash for gifts and school fees .
The most frequently reported crimes against Americans in Port - au - Prince are aggravated assaults , kidnappings , and robberies .
Home invasions also remain an item of concern in some parts of Port - au - Prince .
Crimes against persons , including gender - based violence , remain a serious problem .
Haitians still lack basic policing services , so many residents do not report assaults , rape , and other crime because of lingering — and too - often justified — perceptions of police apathy , incompetence , and corruption .
Traditional tourist - oriented crimes , such as pick pocketing and purse snatching , are less frequently reported in Haiti .

Crime is a constant problem in Lima and most other parts of Peru .
The Regional Security Office ( RSO ) considers the following neighborhoods to be relatively safe : Miraflores , San Isidro , Barranco , La Molina , Camacho , San Borja , Monterrico , and the eastern section of Surco .
Street crime is prevalent in most urban areas , especially in Lima .
Pickpocketing , purse snatching , “ smash and grab ” robberies , the theft of items from unoccupied vehicles , and the theft of vehicle parts ( mirrors , lights , etc. ) are common crimes .
Electronics ( especially cameras , laptops , GPSs , smart phones , I - Pods , etc. ) rank high on the list of items that criminals target .
All U.S. and foreign visitors are vulnerable to crime , as they are often perceived to be wealthier than the local populace and more likely to be carrying greater amounts of cash and other valuables .

Prensa Libre Guatemala City , Guatemala 5/25/14
Deportations via air increase 5 % through May
The number of Guatemalans expelled from the U.S. by air has increased 5 % in the first quarter of the year , according to current statistics of the Dirección General de Migración , an agency of the Ministerio de Gobernación .
GUATEMALA CITY .
– 22 thousand 124 persons have been deported by air from the U.S. from January 1 to May 21 , which means an increase of 5 % with respect to the same period in 2013 , when the number of the detained was 21 thousand 41 , according to what the Migración internet page shows .
Nominally it is the equivalent of one thousand 83 more Guatemalans .
Of that total , 19 thousand 356 are males and 57 minors , which adds up to 19 thousand 413 , that is , an 88 % .
As well as two thousand 701 women and 10 minors , which total two thousand 711 , that is , 12 % respectively .
Last Wednesday the figures show that in May alone the number of deportees by air is three thousand 627 , of which three thousand 122 are men , eight minors and 497 women .
On average , four thousand 425 Guatemalans are expelled each month from the U.S .
By land .
Regarding the data of deportees from Mexico by land , Migración reports 12 thousand 375 Guatemalans from January to May 19 .
Nevertheless , Honduran citizens head the list with 15 thousand 559 expulsions , six thousand 191 Salvadorans and 268 Nicaraguans .
In this context , expulsions ( up to May 19 ) total 34 thousand 393 persons , while in 2013 the four month cumulative was 33 thousand 551 .
Individual monetary remittances .
The intake of foreign currency due to personal transfers shows an increase of 9 % during the first third of the year in comparison with the same period of 2013 .
In the first four months of the year the arrival of individual monetary remittances is U.S. $ 1 billion 729 million ( 13 billion 392 million Quetzals ) which means an increase of U.S. $ 144 million more than in 2013 .
The income in 2013 was U.S. $ 1 billion 584 million ( 12 billion 276 million Quetzals . )

The unceasing emigrant drama
Poverty has made deep marks in Central American geography , and its influence makes every human being react differently to that calamity .
Some are resigned to it , in which case their offspring bear the worst part , and many of those do n’t even reach an age sufficient enough to be able to realize the sorry trek that is theirs to suffer while they become one more number in this country ’s shameful statistic .
Nevertheless , there are many others who refuse to accept this fate and try to overturn this reality even at the cost of their own lives or suffering serious harm .
To do so they are even forced to abandon their loved ones to escape poverty or violence and to seek a better future , mainly in the United States , enroute to which they set off on a journey full of obstacles and dangers , even though a high percentage of them never see their dream come true .
Estimates by organizations that aim to help emigrants show that only eight of every ten of the undocumented are successful in their objective of crossing Mexican territory , a number that seems overly optimistic because the crude reality they must face in their task is overwhelming ; this is not an ordinary trip , starting from the fact that they do n’t have the usual means of transport and that these are constantly inspected by Mexican police , so they must resort to the most extreme possibilities .
That hellish challenge starts for many fellow citizens in Arreaga , a town in ( the Mexican state of ) Chiapas , the closest town where the train known as the Beast runs , and that presents the best possibility of taking a giant step to reach the objective , but it constitutes one of the hardest tests for the Central Americans , as evidenced by the fact that in an average temperature day this can easily go above 40 degrees ( 104 F ) , something that can burn when you travel on the top of a train .
This is one of the harshest tests that Hondurans , Salvadorans and Guatemalans must face ; they predominate among the thousands of emigrants who are capable of facing the adversity that awaits them along their journey .
They accept the challenge of doing it , even at the cost of their own lives , because the obstacles and threats are just as powerful in their own countries from which they flee .
Violence and poverty forces them to travel even with some of their children , many of them quite young .
As a result , humanitarian organizations report that since last December there has been a noticeable increase in the number of entire families who seek to reach the United States and this is proved with migratory statistics on both sides of the border .
The number of children deported from Mexico has tripled so far this year , something that should be sufficient motive to seek long term solutions to end this migratory flow that is leaving a stream of pain in thousands of families who only seek to flee from the poverty that oppresses them .

To Emigrate
Emigration is a human right and a personal decision .
Everyone has their reasons and they ’re all legitimate .
At times it ’s as if you were sick and tired of living with an abusive person after having believed for years that you ’d be able to change him .
You could go on attempting it , why not , miracles do happen , you only have to resist and fight , one day he or she will be moved and will reconsider , they tell you .
But it might be that your life will be spent in that , as happened to your parents and grandparents , and well , at the end one hopes for a certain peace , to have some hope about the future of one ’s sons , one wishes to foresee an acceptable horizon while still alive and not just in three or four generations .
Something similar happens with the country , though not identical , and when you decide to leave , the truth is that you never completely go away because you carry its culture in your heart and you continue cultivating it in mind and in deeds , ( emphasis added ) enriching it with new learnings and friendships that will make you feel that the world is large and beautiful , that you ’re a human being capable of enjoying life and not just a head louse or an entrenched combatant who goes to bed each night thinking that if he ’s not able to change reality , then the children must do it .
The one question in a million is :
Does one have the right to delegate to them the responsibility of improving this whorish society ?
Is it a just thing to impose on the offspring a future with such a heavy and uncertain load , especially when they have n’t asked for it ?
The answer is delicate .
Whatever it might be , it will surely have the sweet and sour taste of life .

Grandmother sues McCain for hate speech David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday October 17 , 2008
Print This Email This A Kansas City grandmother is suing John McCain and Sarah Palin for promoting hate speech .
Mary Kay Green told KSHB that some statements at McCain campaign rallies terrify her as much as the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
" I know the secret service is on this case , but John McCain and Sarah Palin can stop some of this by a statement that they abhor these death threats and will not tolerate them , " said Green .
The 66 - year - old civil attorney , a lifelong Democrat , claims in the suit that the McCain campaign has intentionally and recklessly portrayed Barack Obama as a terrorist .
Green said , " You have to take these things seriously . "
Green believe that Palin has been working crowds into a frenzy .
There have been reports from McCain campaign rallies with words like " kill him , " " off with his head , " and " Muslim terrorist . "
According to Green , her father managed the Nebraska campaigns of John and Robert Kennedy .
After both were felled by assassins , her father died " of grief . "
" I think John McCain and Sarah Palin have no understanding of what we went through as a nation , " she said .
" [ The lawsuit ] will be dismissed as soon as I hear public statements from these two candidates that they abhor these death threats and that they will not tolerate these intruders in their audiences . "
KSHB has more details here .

Iran , the number two oil producer in OPEC , says the cartel is likely to cut back further on production if the latest reduction does not stabilise crude prices .
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries , which produces 40 per cent of world crude , decided on Friday to reduce its production quota by 1.5 million barrels per day as of November 1 to a level of 27.3 million bpd .
Despite the announcement , the price of Brent North Sea crude sank to $ US61 , the lowest point for 17 months .
" Be assured that if ( Friday 's ) decision is not effective on the market , the OPEC will take steps to consolidate the market and stabilise prices at its next meeting , " Iran 's OPEC representative Mohammad Ali Khatibi said in an interview on state television .
OPEC has said its latest decision will be reviewed at its next meeting in Oran , Algeria , on December 17 .
Many analysts have questioned the effectiveness of measures taken by OPEC , given the seriousness of the global financial crisis that has sharply reduced the prospects for economic growth and thus oil consumption .
Crude futures in London and New York have plunged close to 60 per cent from record highs of above $ US147 a barrel reached only three months ago when supply concerns sent prices soaring .
Dutch - sponsored researcher Robin Gremaud has shown that an alloy of the metals magnesium , titanium and nickel is excellent at absorbing hydrogen .
This light alloy brings us a step closer to the everyday use of hydrogen as a source of fuel for powering vehicles .
A hydrogen ' tank ' using this alloy would have a relative weight that is sixty percent less than a battery pack .
In order to find the best alloy Gremaud developed a method which enabled simultaneous testing of thousands of samples of different metals for their capacity to absorb hydrogen .
The British company Ilika in Southampton has shown considerable interest .
Hydrogen is considered to be a clean and therefore important fuel of the future .
This gas can be used directly in cars in an internal combustion engine , like in BMW 's hydrogen vehicle , or it can be converted into electrical energy in so - called fuel cells , like in the Citaro buses in service in Amsterdam .
The major problem of using hydrogen in transport is the secure storage of this highly explosive gas .
This can be realised by using metals that absorb the gas .
However , a drawback of this approach is that it makes the hydrogen ' tanks ' somewhat cumbersome .
The battery , the competing form of storage for electrical energy , comes off even worse .
Driving four hundred kilometres with an electric car , such as the Toyota Prius , would require the car to carry 317 kilos of modern lithium batteries for its journey .
With Gremaud 's light metal alloy this same distance would require a hydrogen tank of ' only ' two hundred kilos .
Although this new metal alloy is important for the development of hydrogen as a fuel , the discovery of the holy grail of hydrogen storage is still some way off .
Hydrogenography
In his research Gremaud made use of a technique for measuring the absorbance of hydrogen by metals , based on the phenomenon of ' switchable mirrors ' discovered at the VU University Amsterdam .
About ten years ago researchers at the VU discovered that certain materials lose their reflection by absorbing hydrogen .
This technique became known as hydrogenography , or ' writing with hydrogen ' .
Using this technique , Gremaud was able to simultaneously analyse the efficacy of thousands of different combinations of the metals magnesium , titanium and nickel .
Traditional methods require separate testing for each alloy .
The analysis requires each of the three metals to be eroded from an individual source and deposited onto a transparent film in a thin layer of 100 nanometres using so - called sputtering deposition .
This ensures that the three metals are deposited onto the film in many different ratios .
When the film is exposed to different amounts of hydrogen , it is clearly visible , even to the naked eye , which composition of metals is best at absorbing hydrogen .
Gremaud is the first to use this method for measuring hydrogen absorption .
The British company Ilika in Southampton wants to build a hydrogen analyser using this technique .

Cassiopeia A :
Cassiopeia A in Many Colors
This stunning picture of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A ( Cas A ) is a composite of images taken by three of NASA 's Great Observatories .
Infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope are colored red ; optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope are yellow ; and X - ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory are green and blue .
Cas A is the 300 - year - old remnant created by the supernova explosion of a massive star .
Each Great Observatory image highlights different characteristics of the remnant .
Spitzer reveals warm dust in the outer shell with temperatures of about 10 degrees Celsius ( 80 degrees Fahrenheit ) , and Hubble sees the delicate filamentary structures of warmer gases about 10,000 degrees Celsius .
Chandra shows hot gases at about 10 million degrees Celsius .
This hot gas was created when ejected material from the supernova smashed into surrounding gas and dust at speeds of about ten million miles per hour .
A comparison of the infrared and X - ray images of Cas A should enable astronomers to better understand how relatively cool dust grains can coexist in the superhot gas that produces the X -rays .
It should also help to determine whether most of the dust in the supernova remnant came from the massive star before it exploded , or from the rapidly expanding supernova ejecta .
The turquoise dot at the center of the shell may be a neutron star created during the supernova .
Blue Chandra data were acquired using broadband X - rays ( low through high energies ) ; green Chandra data correspond only to intermediate energy X - rays ; yellow Hubble data were taken using a 900 nanometer - wavelength filter , and red Spitzer data are from the telescope 's 24 - micron detector .
It 's absolutely uncanny .
Absolutely every accusation or smear that the McCain campaign hurls at Barack Obama comes back worse for McCain .
I 'm halfway seriously expecting a registration card for McCain from the '50s to turn up with " Communist " marked as party affiliation .
And after solemnly announcing that we were possibly on the brink of ' destroying the fabric of democracy ' due to ACORN and their ties to Obama at the final debate , it turns out that McCain has his own little acorns ... or at least , nuts , perpetrating REAL fraud that has stolen votes from REAL Americans , by registering voters as Republicans without their consent or knowledge and tearing up Democratic registrations in several states .
Transcripts below the fold :
It was less than one week ago when Senator John McCain on national television warned the nation about a grave threat to democracy , maybe even quote “ destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
So , in our third story tonight , why have McCain and Sarah Palin stopped sounding the trumpet on this grave threat over the last few days ?
No , he did n't just forget .
McCain ’s charge was that the national grassroots group , ACORN was committing widespread voter fraud , disenfranchising voters by registering fictional voters and Barack Obama had helped to fund ACORN .
As we have explained previously , some part - time workers have been accused of ripping off ACORN because fictional voters do not vote .
But , there may be other reasons McCain has dropped the voter fraud rhetoric , namely new reports that McCain himself has funded not one , but two Republican owners of voter registration firms , both of whom are embroiled in very real charges of very real and concerted efforts to disenfranchise real voters .
First , meet Mark Jacoby .
Yes , that would be a mug shot .
He was arrested Saturday night in California on two counts of perjury and two counts of vote fraud .
The charge that : Jacoby registered a fake address in California , so he would be legally eligible to register other voters in the state .
Mr. Jacoby ’s company is YPM , Young Political Majors .
And YPM was no stranger to vote fraud claims before even Jacoby ’s arrest .
Prosecutors in L.A. , Ventura and San Bernardino counties are investigating Jacoby ’s company after dozens of voters accused YPM of “ slamming , ” which is registering them as Republicans without their knowledge .
The Los Angeles Times finding YPM registered more than 80 % of its new Republicans without their knowledge or by misleading them .
So why does or what does YPM have to do with McCain ?
YPM makes money by registers not voters , but Republican voters specifically .
Working not only as a subcontractor for the California Republican Party but also , according to the Ventura County Star , for the voter registration bounties offered by another man , Steve Poisner , a multimillionaire who offered YPM $ 5 for every new Republican registered .
Like a bounty .
He also happens to be the California co-chairman of the McCain campaign .
McCain cannot claim ignorance to YPM ’s track record .
Jacoby is based in Arizona where a number of ballot initiatives may not be on the ballot after YPM gathered signatures for them and some of those signatures failed to pass muster with local election officials .
And YPM was publicly accused of vote slamming before .
In 2004 in both Florida and Massachusetts .
And then there is Nathan Spruill , former head of the Arizona Republican Party .
He , too , now in the vote registering business and a serial denial of whistleblowers , who not only accuse him of slamming voters into the Republican Party but also claim he has torn up Democratic registrations in Oregon , Nevada , Pennsylvania and West Virginia .
Real registrations of real voters .
Real Americans who thought they were registered , and may very well have been denied their right to vote in the real elections of 2004 .
McCain ’s connection ?
This year Huffington Post reports a joint committee of the GOP and McCain campaign paid $ 175,000 for , quote , “ registering voters ” to the Lincoln Strategies Group , the voter registration company headed by Nathan Spruill .
So , why is n't anybody investigating Nathan Spruill ?
Since the days of John Ashcroft , Democratic members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to investigate real voter suppression , Congressman John Conyers specifically including Nathan Spruill in one of his responses last year .
The stone walling in stark contrast to the Justice response - time on Republican claims of voter fraud .
Last week , leaking word of its ACORN investigation the day after McCain pointed his finger at ACORN ; previously pressuring prosecutors to pursue Republican claims about voter registration fraud ; and firing some prosecutors who refused to do so , including most famously New Mexico ’s David Iglasius , who later revealed the Justice Department knew those claims in 2004 were bogus .
Talking Points Memo reported some of the same Republican operatives pushing voter fraud claims this year were at the heart of some of those bogus claims .
According to one Republican Party operative ’s 2004 email , “ I believe the voter ID issue should be used at all levels .
You are not going to find a better wedge issue . ”
Razor wire seals off the top of the designated pen for protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Boston , Massachusetts July 22 , 2004 .

DENVER ( Reuters ) - Protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Denver can be restricted to fenced - in areas , federal judge ruled on Wednesday , saying that security needs outweighed curbs on their rights .
A dozen groups who intend to protest at the August convention sued the U.S. Secret Service and the city of Denver over plans to confine their activities to a parade route and fenced - in zone , saying that their Constitutional rights to free speech were being violated .
The American Civil Liberties Union , the American Friends Service Committee and others argued that the rules would keep them too far away from delegates to get their message across during the convention , which is scheduled for Aug 25 - 28 at the city ’s downtown Pepsi Center .
U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger agreed that the protesters would suffer some infringement on their freedom of expression but said those interests had to be balanced with security concerns .
“ The restrictions inhibit the plaintiffs ’ ability to engage in some forms of expressive conduct , ( but ) ... the plaintiffs have a wide variety of alternative means of expression that will allow them to effectively communicate their messages , ” Krieger wrote in her 71 - page ruling .
Three eminent Sikh religious musicians were thrown out of a US Airways flight after the pilot refused to fly with them onboard in California , a leading US - based Sikh group alleged on Wednesday .
The three -- Gulbag Singh , Davinder Singh and Iqbal Singh -- had boarded the plane in Sacramento on November 15 after being cleared by the security .
In a complaint letter to the Airways , ' United Sikhs ' protested the incident and warned it of legal action unless prompt amends are made .
The group pointed to the severity of the racial profiling and discriminatory treatment , sought an apology and compensation for the three and offered training for US Airways staff .
The three , who had boarded the plane for Salt Lake City , Utah , were sitting together in the rear of the aircraft , in their assigned seats .
After having been on the plane for approximately ten minutes , they were approached by one of the ticket - reception desk workers and asked to exit the plane .
While none of the three could adequately comprehend or speak English , the group complied and exited the aircraft , the United Sikhs said .
When it became apparent that the group was unable to converse with US Airways representatives , a Punjabi interpreter was called to assist , it said .
The interpreter informed Iqbal Singh , on behalf of the US Airways representatives , that the pilot was refusing to fly if they were onboard the aircraft , it added .
When Iqbal Singh asked why , the US Airways representatives were unable to give a clear answer , and the interpreter went on to persuade the three not to raise any objection because it could lead to more problems , the organisation said .
The trio , having become concerned , fearful , and worried about what had happened , took the only option they were given , which was to stay the night in a hotel and depart on a Delta Airlines flight the following morning to Salt Lake City , it added .

Just over half of Africa ’s 52 countries speak French , but the number is dropping .
This month , Rwanda defected , announcing that henceforward only English will be taught in the schools .
It would not be overstating the case to say that this caused alarm and despondency in France .
You could n’t help feeling , either , that Rwanda ’s trade and industry minister , Vincent Karega , was deliberately rubbing salt in the wound when he explained why French was being scrapped .
“ French is spoken only in France , some parts of West Africa , and parts of Canada and Switzerland , ” he said .
( In parts of Belgium , too , actually , not to mention Haiti , but you get the point . )
“ English has emerged as a backbone for growth and development not only in the region but around the globe . ”
No country cares more passionately for its language than France , and it has waged a long and expensive campaign to guarantee the survival of a French - speaking zone in Central and West Africa .
It even provided the bulk of the foreign aid for the former Belgian colonies that spoke French : Congo , Rwanda , and Burundi .
But the present government of Rwanda has special reasons not to be fond of France .
Getting very close to the regimes in African countries that have French as an official language , even sending troops to protect them from their domestic enemies , has always been part of Paris ’s strategy for preserving the status of French as a world language .
In Rwanda ’s case , that put France in bed with the extremist Hutu - dominated regime that ruled the densely - populated country before the genocide , to such an extent that Paris largely paid for the tripling in size of the Rwandan army in 1990 - 91 .
When the Hutu regime began murdering the minority Tutsis in industrial quantities in 1994 , France did not abandon it .
The French president at the time , Francois Mitterrand , is alleged to have remarked that “ in such countries , genocide is not too important ... ”
And a principal reason that France overlooked its Rwandan ally ’s ghastly behaviour was that the Tutsi-led opposition in exile mostly spoke English , because its members had found refuge in English - speaking Uganda .
An estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered in 1994 , but the Uganda - based Rwanda Patriotic Front put an end to the genocide by invading the country and overthrowing the regime .
Even a direct French military intervention in Rwanda ( thinly disguised as a humanitarian operation ) could not save the Hutu “ genocidiaires , ” as they are universally known .
So it was not to be expected that the new , mainly English - speaking government in Rwanda would have warm feelings towards France .
Fourteen years later , more than 95 percent of Rwanda ’s secondary schools still teach mainly in French , although an alternative English instructional program or intensive English language courses are usually available .
Knowledge of both English and French is required for university entrance ( and for most government jobs ) but the government ’s own statistics say that only 3 percent of the population is fluent in English .
Nevertheless , the new decision ends the teaching of French in Rwandan schools .
The government defends it as a purely - business decision , driven by Rwanda ’s membership in the largely English - speaking East African Community ( Kenya , Uganda , Tanzania , Rwanda , and Burundi ) , but there is no question that resentment of France also plays a role .
This is a country that has already expelled the French ambassador and closed down the French cultural centre , international school , and radio station .
But can an African country just switch from one European language to another like that ?
It can if , like Rwanda , it only uses one language domestically .
Almost all Rwandans , whether Hutu or Tutsi , speak Kinyarwanda , so they have no need for a lingua franca to communicate among themselves .
Only those going into higher education or working with foreigners need any other language at all — which is why only eight percent of Rwandans speak fluent French after all this time .
This is far from typical of African countries , most of which have many different ethnic groups , each with its own language .
Such countries use the language of the former colonial power as a neutral “ national ” language , and have such a large investment in teaching it by now that switching is out of the question .
The Congo will always use French ; Nigeria will always use English ; Mozambique will always use Portuguese .
So francophones can relax : their language is not about to vanish from the African continent .
On the other hand , French will always lose out to English in situations like Rwanda , where there is a single national language and the main reason for learning a foreign language is communication with the rest of the world .
Vietnam , an ex-French colony , has long taught English as the main foreign language in its schools , and Madagascar , also formerly ruled by France , made English a national language last year .
English - speakers often assume that this world role for their language owes something to its huge vocabulary and wonderful literature , or at least to the fact that Hollywood speaks English .
However , nothing of the sort is true .
The sole reason is that the world ’s dominant powers for the past two centuries have been English - speaking : Britain in the 19th century , and the United States in the 20th .
Timing is everything , and English just happened to be the leading candidate when globalization created the need for an agreed global second language .
In many ways it 's a pointless question .
Even if we could identify the turning point in the market with a high level of certainty , there are very few people with the courage to enter at these low points .
The more important thing to look for are the features that will help to identify , first , the end of the market fall and second , the development of a market recovery .
These two events may be separated by a few months , or by many months .
There are two important features that identify climax selling .
The first is the rapid acceleration in the speed of the market fall .
Like a Stuka dive - bomber , the market first rolls over slowly and then plunges in a vertical dive .
This is fear at work .
The second feature is a massive increase in volume .
This is panic .
Ordinary people are desperate to get out of the market .
Generally the funds and institutions got out of the long - side of the market many months ago .
The selling in January and February was dominated by institutions and funds .
The current panic selling is thousands of small orders from retail investors desperate to get out of the market .
During the bear market collapse , volumes decline .
Fewer people want to buy stock so volatility increases because small trades have a disproportionate impact in a shallow market .
This selling climax shakes out all the weak hands in the market .
It kills the margin speculators .
It wipes out those who have finally lost patience .
It removes the speculative money in the market because people think the risk is too great .
This is also called capitulation .
Everybody gives up – and it influences the thinking of a generation .
My parents , who lived through the depression , could never entirely shake the idea that the market was a dangerous place .
I wanted some resolution to Josh ’s stint on American Idol , and it was either this or the Thunderdome .
Two singer ’s enter , one singer leaves .
In that scenario I think Josh would be riding on the back of a behelmeted retard .
I ’ve always pictured him “ Master ” than “ Blaster . ”
Speaking of Highlander ( I think I mentioned this on a podcast ) , the first movie was pretty much excellent .
The 2nd movie retconned this whole thing about the Highlanders being aliens in a galactic civil war or some such shittery .
So for the 3rd one they pretended that original sequel never happened and picked back up where the first one left off .
It gives me tired - head to think about it .
Was n’t there another franchise that ignored one of the sequels ?
Superman Returns sort of did that , acting as a follow up to Superman 2 and all .
So what sequels did you think were “ one sequel too many . ”
Which movies ruined a franchise for you ?
What ’s your X - men 3 , or Star Wars Episdodes 1 - 3 ?
Did the franchise recover , reboot or fade away ?
Robin !
To the Bat - comments !
By the time the Reserve Fund reported last Tuesday afternoon that its Primary Fund money market funds had “ broken the buck ”  that is , were no longer worth a dollar a share  investors had already withdrawn billions of dollars from the fund .
Some market analysts assumed they had reacted to the panic sweeping the market .
But a lawsuit filed in Minneapolis late last week by Ameriprise Financial offers another explanation :
The suit claims the Reserve Fund tipped some big customers about its crisis in advance so that they could get their cash out before its losses became public .
According to the complaint , two senior Reserve Fund executives acknowledged during a conference call last Thursday with Ameriprise that big investors had received an early warning .
The Reserve Fund executives “ seemed surprised that Ameriprise had not also been tipped at the same time , ” the complaint alleges .
A Moral Fight to an Unreasonable End .
In 1989 , the people of China were fighting the injustice of their communist government in Tiananmen Square .
Their rights were being oppressed and they wanted the ability to run their own lives .
The students at the protest had elected representatives to speak up against their communist leader .
They wanted China to accept the reforms they protested for , but more than that they wanted the rest of the world to realize that China ’s communist government was ruining the country .
The protestors of Tiananmen Square used reasonable means of protesting to gain the rights that they did not have because they were never trying to harm anybody in their process of achieving freedom .
To gain these liberties , the people protested together at Tiananmen Square , wrote petitions against the government , and went on a hunger strike .
The first way that the college students of China protested against their government was by gathering at Tiananmen Square .
First , in April 17 , 10,000 students had met up at Tiananmen Square to protest .
This shows that so many people of China wanted a change in government and that the government was ruling unfairly .
They were not trying to harm anybody by gathering together .
They were only there to mourn for the death of Hu Yaobang and to protest for a democracy .
Also , these students began to sing hymns that had lyrics that fought communism and promoted democracy .
This portrays the fact that the people were so propelled by their beliefs of a need for democracy that they were compelled to sing out their feelings for a new government .
Once again , they were not trying to kill anybody with their singing .
They were only trying to let out their emotions to the world to let others know what they desired .
Finally , the students carved out a giant statue that stood for liberty and democracy .
This reinforces the fact that they wanted a democratic government because they were trying to mimic the Statue of Liberty to get the rest of the world and the US to notice their plea for a fair government .
In the end , the government did notice their protesting , but the people of China did not gain anything out of it .
They were only massacred later on for their insolence and betrayal against the government even though the students had not tried to harm anybody .
The second thing the students did was to make petitions and posters to protest against the government .
Petitions are a moral way to call against the injustice of a nation because nobody is harmed in doing so .
First , on the first day of the gathering at Tiananmen Square , the students immediately began to make a petition of demands that they wanted .
It was a way to get the world to realize that so many people wanted a change in government .
Second , the students began making posters and banners that called for freedom , democracy , and enlightenment .
They hung them up on the imitation Statue of Liberty to attract the attention of the government .
They also wanted the people of the world to see those banners and realize how badly the people of China wanted a democracy .
Finally , on May 9 , the students petitioned for the freedom to report the protest to the world .
They wanted to tell everybody that the government was oppressing them .
None these tactics worked because they angered the government and ended up being slaughtered in their own protesting grounds .
Finally , the students that were protesting went on a hunger strike .
On May 13 , the students began a hunger strike in order to get the government to meet with them .
In a sense this was an unmoral tactic to force the government to notice them because they were risking human lives , but the end justifies the means and their reason for a hunger strike was moral .
Then on May 14 , the students were allowed to talk to the government leaders because the hunger strike convinced the government to talk with them .
Unfortunately the negotiations failed and the students were left with nothing .
They had a chance to make changes to China , but a stubborn Communist Government prevented them from doing so .
Finally in May 18 , Li Peng tried to stop the students from their strike , but the students wo n’t stop their protesting and the government prepared for martial law .
The length of the hunger strike most definitely forced the government to take extreme means to stop the strike .
After all , if the government let the people die from starving themselves , the international press would print bad reviews on China to the rest of the world .
This means that the people of China brought the massacre upon themselves when they tried to protest by the means of a hunger strike .
The student protestors at Tiananmen Square were never trying to harm the government from the start because that would not have solved anything and that means that the protestors ’ tactics of fighting for their cause was just .
All three of their tactics to protest against their government were moral , but going on a hunger strike brought about their protest ’s failure .
The government could not afford the deaths of human lives that they would not be able to cover up later , so their final resort was to use martial law .
Although the protestors used just ways of fighting , the government they were fighting only did whatever it could to stop the protesting .

If we want to contact any of those other civilizations out there , we ’ll need a beacon to send messages with .
But what to build ?
Gregory Benford at the University of California Irvine and family (? ) have done a cost / benefit analysis on the types of microwave generators out there that can produce the 10^17 W necessary to reach a significant proportion of the galactic habitable zone .
There are various ways that the cost can be optimised and the Benfords summarise them like this :
“ Thrifty beacon systems would be large and costly , have narrow searchlight beams and short dwell times when the Beacon would be seen by an alien observer at target areas in the sky .
They may revisit an area infrequently and will likely transmit at high microwave frequencies , ~ 10 GHz .
The natural corridor to broadcast is along the galactic spiral ’s radius or along the spiral galactic arm we are in . ”
This has implications for the search for ET civilisations ( as opposed sending messages for them ) .
If ET civilisations are as cost conscious as we are , then they may well have built beacons in this way .
And if so , say the Benfords , nearly all SETI searches to date would have missed them .

GAINESVILLE , Fla .  Last April , during spring football practice at the University of Florida , a collective gasp came from a track meet across the street .
Jeffrey Demps had just run the fifth - fastest 100 meters by an American high school sprinter , 10.17 seconds .
Even better , he was a Gators football recruit .
“ The rest of the day , I ’m not really sure what happened at practice , ” said Coach Urban Meyer , who heard the time over the public - address system .
“ I was so excited we had a guy joining the program that could run sub - 10.2 .
I ’ve never witnessed that . ”
In late June , at the Olympic track and field trials , Demps ran even faster , setting a national high school record of 10.01 and matching the world junior record for the 100  a time equal to the seventh - place finish at the Beijing Games .
Now a freshman tailback at fifth - ranked Florida , he appears to be the swiftest running back ever to play college or professional football , according to track historians and an examination of performance lists compiled by USA Track and Field .
At 18 , Demps is already much faster than famous predecessors like Herschel Walker ( 10.23 ) , O. J. Simpson ( 10.3 ) and Bo Jackson ( 10.44 ) , slightly faster even than Bob Hayes ( 10.05 ) , the 1964 Olympic champion at 100 meters who played running back at Florida A.&M. before becoming an All - Pro receiver with the Dallas Cowboys .
While many Americans are watching as their pensions crash with the markets , across Russia it 's a different story .
Though their stock market crash has been longer and deeper than in almost any other country , most Russians remain relatively unaffected .
Meanwhile , Russia 's wealthiest man , aluminum king Oleg Deripaska , has reportedly lost $ 16 billion over the past month .
As Russia 's economy struggles under the weight of the global economic crisis , the effects on the country vary drastically among different segments of society .
While Russian industrial barons are falling like kingpins , the government has maintained a budget surplus thanks to oil revenues and sovereign debts paid off by former President Vladimir Putin .
Additionally , the general population has also been largely protected due to outmoded financial practices and social beliefs that kept pensions separate from the stock market .
The varied effects of the market crisis are likely to alter the underpinnings of Russian society , say many Russian economic analysts .
" The Russian economy will survive this crisis , but will emerge greatly changed , " says Olga Kryshtanovskaya , director of the independent Institute of Applied Politics .
Plunging oil prices , fallout from Russia 's August war with Georgia , and ongoing uncertainties about the Kremlin 's intentions toward private business have taken a toll on the Russian markets .
Since their peak last May , Moscow 's two key stock indexes have lost over two - thirds of their value , while big Russian corporations are sagging under total debts reported at over half a trillion dollars , mostly owed to international financial institutions .
The Russian government , on the other hand , remains largely debt free , and its oil - fed foreign reserves are the world 's third largest at $ 600 billion as of August .
About 10 percent of those reserves have melted away in the past two months as the Kremlin has moved to prop up the ruble , inject liquidity into troubled banks , and support selected companies .
Many financial analysts say the crisis has greatly accelerated the growth of " Kremlin capitalism , " which involves direct state ownership over strategic economic sectors as well as indirect control over larger swaths of the economy through backing for businesses run by Kremlin cronies .
" A huge redistribution of property is taking place due to the crisis , " says Nikolai Petrov , an expert with the Carnegie Center in Moscow .
" The political elites in the Kremlin are sure now that they 've been right all along about the need for greater state control , and believe that even the West is now coming around to their point of view . "
A special $ 50 billion line of credit to support distressed companies , approved by the Russian government last week , will go largely to state - connected firms .
The state oil firm Rosneft will receive $ 4.5 billion and the gas monopoly Gazprom about $ 1 billion .
Other state firms producing arms , aircraft , and other " strategic goods " will be given priority , according to Russian media reports .
" Everybody is losing money , but the further they are from the state the more businesses are losing , " says Mikhail Delyagin , scientific director of Moscow 's independent Institute of Globalization Problems .
The global meltdown will have minimal impact on the country 's real economy that , two decades after communism 's collapse , has yet to fully integrate with world markets .
According to a report prepared by Alfa Bank , a leading Russian financial institution , the country 's entire banking sector has assets totaling 60 percent of gross domestic product , and just 3 percent of those are vested in mortgages .
The average Russian has little consumer debt and no exposure to the stock market via pension plans .
The stock market is " totally speculative and not a place where most Russians would ever choose to put their money , " says Sergei Glazyev , director of the independent Institute of New Economy in Moscow .
Earlier this month , the International Monetary Fund estimated that Russia will clock 7 percent economic growth this year , but that will sink to 5.5 percent in 2009 .
The government 's budgetary surpluses will swiftly erode if global prices for oil – that account for 67 percent of the country 's export revenues – sinks below $ 70 per barrel for an extended period .
But pain is reaching Russia 's equivalent of Main Street .
Last week Russia 's auto giant , KamAZ , slowed to a four - day workweek , the huge Magnitogorsk steel works has slashed production by 25 percent , and other major Russian companies are showing signs of slowing down .
Though many affluent Muscovites say they 're not hurting yet , a number of the city 's giant shopping malls , luxury boutiques , and car dealers are much less crowded than usual .
After nearly a decade of booming real estate markets , Moscow 's powerful mayor , Yury Luzhkov , last week announced a surprise $ 2 billion aid package for leading local property developers .
Social protest , which Mr. Putin appeared to banish , could return amid worsening conditions .
" If oil prices continue to drop , there could be political unrest because all this prosperity and self - assurance we have seen [ under Putin ] will disappear , " says Marshall Goldman of Harvard University 's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies .
When Putin came to power eight years ago , he dealt harshly with big business " oligarchs , " and vowed to eliminate them " as a class . "
Most tycoons were left alone as long as they showed political obedience , but as recently as July trouble was flaring again between now - Prime Minister Putin and the Russian coal and steel giant Mechel .
The 25 richest Russians listed by Forbes have lost a combined $ 230 billion in the financial meltdown .
Aside from Mr. Deripaska , another big loser is Roman Abramovich , famous for buying the British Chelsea Football Club , who is reportedly down $ 20 billion .
" Russia 's vulnerability to the storm blowing through world markets will force the authorities to be pragmatic , " says Yevgeny Gavrilenkov , an expert with Troika Dialog , a Moscow - based investment bank .
" But it 's understood that the state will first support its own companies .
In Russia , the state is a megaoligarch . "

Obama : Captains of industry are ' a little tone deaf ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Obama tells Walters he 's negotiating to keep his Blackberry As he prepares to assume the presidency , Barack Obama appears to be preoccupied with the prospect of falling out of touch with the problems of ordinary Americans , whether he is discussing the " tone - deafness " of top auto executives or his own potential isolation in the Oval Office .
In an interview to air Wednesday night , ABC's Barbara Walters asked Obama how he feels about the auto company executives taking private jets to testify in Washington .
" I thought maybe they 're a little tone - deaf to what 's happening in America right now , " Obama replied .
He added , " This has been a chronic problem , not just for the auto industry .
I mean , when people are pulling down hundred million dollar bonuses on Wall Street and taking enormous risks with other people 's money , that indicates a sense that you do n't have any perspective on what 's happening to ordinary Americans . "
Obama also agreed with Walters that bank executives could set a good example by foregoing their Christmas bonuses , suggesting , " If you are already worth tens of millions of dollars and you are having to lay off workers , the least you can do is say , ' I 'm willing to make some sacrifice as well because I recognize that there are people who are a lot less well off , who are going through some pretty tough times . ' "
In a very similar tone , when Walters asked Obama about reports that because of security concerns he may have to give up his personal Blackberry and communicate through intermediaries , he replied , " One of the things that I 'm going to have to work through is how to break through the isolation , the bubble that exists around the president . "
" I'm in the process of negotiating with the Secret Service , with lawyers , with White House staff , " Obama continued .
" I 'm negotiating to figure out how can I get information from outside of the 10 or 12 people who surround my office in the White House .
I want to make sure that I keep my finger on the pulse of the struggles that people are going through every day . "
A recent article in Slate highlighted Obama 's dilemma , suggesting , " Imagine you 're Barack Obama .
You just ran ' the most technologically sophisticated presidential campaign in history .'...
You proved yourself to be a modern info - executive with your 3 a.m. e-mails and your preference for reviewing docs on your BlackBerry .
...
Now , you 're preparing to enter the White House , and your BlackBerry is about to be ripped from your clutches because of privacy and security concerns .
Savor the irony :
You captured the Oval Office by making technological history , only to find that you 're now required to govern like in the 19th century .
Echoes of Lincoln , indeed . "
Walters reports , sadly , that Obama is currently losing the negotiations to hold onto his Blackberry .
Walters was also enthusiastic about how Barack and Michelle Obama interact as a couple .
" I do n't want to gush , " she said while previewing the interview on Good Morning America .
" They 're very cute -- and very funny in this interview together . "

Oh , the gaffe - a- minute , never - vet - any - campaign - speech joy of the McCain campaign .
Sarah Palin debuted both a new set of glasses and a new talking point about the way that the McCain / Palin administration will be smarter about the way government funds important programs :
Where does a lot of that earmark money end up anyway ? [ snip ]
You 've heard about some of these pet projects they really do n't make a whole lot of sense and sometimes these dollars go to projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good .
Things like fruit fly research in Paris , France .
I kid you not .
Apparently , Palin is n't aware of the kind of research done with fruit flies .
Pharyngula :
This idiot woman , this blind , shortsighted ignoramus , this pretentious clod , mocks basic research and the international research community .
You damn well better believe that there is research going on in animal models — what does she expect , that scientists should mutagenize human mothers and chop up baby brains for this work ? — and countries like France and Germany and England and Canada and China and India and others are all respected participants in these efforts .
Yes , scientists work on fruit flies .
Some of the most powerful tools in genetics and molecular biology are available in fruit flies , and these are animals that are particularly amenable to experimentation .
Molecular genetics has revealed that humans share key molecules , the basic developmental toolkit , with all other animals , thanks to our shared evolutionary heritage ( something else the wackaloon from Wasilla denies ) , and that we can use these other organisms to probe the fundamental mechanisms that underlie core processes in the formation of the nervous system — precisely the phenomena Palin claims are so important .
In fact , irony of all ironies , fruit fly research has actually aided in understanding a genetic component or predisposition towards autism .
Blaine hopes to hang upside down for 60 hours US illusionist David Blaine has begun another endurance challenge - hanging upside down for almost three days .
The 35 - year - old magician was hoisted by his heels over the Wollmann ice rink in New York on Monday .
He intends to remain there until late Wednesday , despite doctors ' concern about the effect of the stress on his internal organs and blood circulation .
Blaine said he was " doing all right " on Monday , though he did admit his head felt like it was " about to explode " .
His previous stunts include spending 72 hours encased in ice , seven days underwater and 44 days without food in a glass box .
Blaine is suspended from a four - storey high metal frame , though he can be lowered to speak to fans face to face .
Catheter
He is also able to free one leg , using its weight to raise his head to a horizontal position .
For two nights and three days he will neither eat nor sleep , taking liquid through a straw and passing water through a catheter .

Asked to compare this current spectacle with his earlier endeavours , the Brooklyn - born performer said this was " the most difficult for sure " .
" The others you could get into them soon after the start , " he told an interviewer .
" But this one is tough from the get - go . "
Blaine said he would use " sheer willpower " to complete the challenge - inspired in part by his hero , the legendary escapologist Harry Houdini .
He has said he likes to test his endurance " because it gives me a different perspective , for a short duration " .

What are these ?
Your value does n’t decrease based on someone ’s inability to see your worth .
Read that again .
Everyone has an opinion and that does n’t change who you are , or what you bring to the table .
Only you [... ]

" We 're going to get a little tougher , " a senior Republican operative said , indicating that a fresh batch of television ads is coming .
" We 've got to question this guy 's associations .
Very soon .
There 's no question that we have to change the subject here , " said the operative , who was not authorized to discuss strategy and spoke on the condition of anonymity .
And so , Princess Palin is dispatched on the Winkers and Wankers Tour , to spread the message across the country : " Barack Obama associates with unsavory people - colored folks , negroes , and even black men !
What ?
Oh ..
Well , he used to , anyway ! "
Yes , my friends , she 's all Lips and Quips , and she 's coming to your town , newspaper , radio or what have you , to spread a message so powerful you 'll wonder how the Almighty could suffer such a blasphemy upon his own creation .
Meanwhile , Reality will have none of it .
11:25 AM , EDT :
* CNN : " Stocks tumbled today , with the Dow falling below 10,000 for the first time in nearly four years .
The Dow dropped more than 500 points before recovering .
The sell - off came despite Friday 's signing of a historic $ 700 billion bailout bill for U.S. financial institutions .
European governments also are rushing to prop up failing financial firms , underscoring the global reach of the credit crunch , CNNMoney reports . "
* Yahoo News : " Wall Street tumbled again Monday , joining a sell - off around the world as fears grew that the financial crisis will cascade through economies globally despite bailout efforts by the U.S. and other governments .
The Dow Jones industrials skidded nearly 500 points and fell below 10,000 for the first time in four years , while the credit markets remained under strain . "
* AOL News :
" The financial crisis spreads across the globe , despite government bailouts in both the U.S. and aboard .
The Dow falls below 10,000 for the first time in four years , joining markets around the world that have also reported sharp drops . "
* MSNBC : " Stocks fall to mark not seen since October , 2004 , as investors come to believe that $ 700 billion rescue plan wo n’t work quickly enough to end credit squeeze . "
* FOX " News " : " URGENT : Dow falls more than 400 points , sinks below 10,000 for first time in four years as Asian , Euro markets plunge on fears U.S. financial crisis will spread , slow global growth . "
So , the question becomes this : Will John McCain and the Cue Card Cutie acknowledge that there are far more important things happening in the nation and the world , TODAY , than pointing fingers and making specious claims about Obama 's patriotism ?
Or does Gov. Palin need another three day retreat at the Talking Points Day Spa to wash that black man 's past out of her hair , so she can talk about something else in complete sentences ?
But , hey - as long as we 're talking about relationships , past and present , why not turn the national conversation to John McCain ?
We could talk about his relationship with Charles Keating and the resulting $ 3,000,000,000 Savings and Loan bailout that was paid for by the taxpayers .
Or we could talk about his relationship with former Senator and current economic adviser , Phill Gramm , who authored the deregulating legislation that led to the current economic crisis we 're witnessing .
Maybe we could talk about the 72 lobbyists who work for the McCain Campaign .
Also .
Whadda ya say , Sarah ?
I suppose we should n't be surprised that a mental lightweight like Sarah Palin is sent out on a traveling Slumber Party to give us updated Cooties Reports on Barack Obama .
It 's not like she has the first fucking clue about anything that actually affects people or any interest in what Joe Six Pack is really concerned about .
It 's just too bad that her Jr. High squeaks and giggles are being drowned out by the sound of real Americans grinding their teeth and the death rattle of our Economy .
Way to go , Team Maverick !
It 's that kind of out - of - the - box thinking that will , uh ... yeah , way to go !
[ Update ] - Unbelievable .
Reporters were n't permitted to wander around inside Coachman Park in Clearwater to talk to Palin 's audience , the St. Petersburg Times reported .
When reporters tried to leave the designated press area and head to where the crowd was seated , an escort would dart out , confront him or her and say , " Can I help you ? " and turn the person around , Times staff writer Eileen Schulte wrote on the paper 's Web site .
When one reporter asked an escort , who would not give her name , why the press was n't allowed to mingle , she said that in the past , negative things had been written , Schulte reported .
No need to talk to Joe Six Pack when the McCain campaign can just tell you what he thinks , right ?
Mavericky !

WASHINGTON  Fear that the financial crisis is infecting once - healthy economies created another white - knuckle day for investors Friday , causing stocks to tumble from Tokyo to New York .
Uncertainty also roiled currency markets as investors continued to turn to the security of the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and drove down currencies of developing countries like Brazil , Ukraine and South Korea and even of developed countries like Britain .
In the United States , where the crisis began , investors were less alarmed than elsewhere .
A rout in Asian and European stock markets sent the Dow Jones industrial average swooning by more than 500 points in early trading in New York , but trading recovered enough ground through the day to leave the Dow down 312.30 points , or 3.6 percent .
Just a year ago , a drop of that size would have been considered a black day in the markets , but in these days of routine triple - digit declines , it offered a modicum of relief to traumatized investors .

Anyway , here 's some helpful tips for the next time someone jacks your shit .
1 ) Pay attention .
Granted , you were n't paying attention to start with or you would n't have gotten mugged , but now that you 've been hit from behind / had a gun shoved in your face , pay attention .
2 ) Follow directions .
Give the friendly mugger what he wants .
Do n't talk back or fight .
In all likelyhood , you 're a pussy hipster retard , and are , by NYC law , unarmed .
3 ) You 've been paying attention right ?
Remember some simple things in this order : sex , clothing color , clothing type , headwear , and direction of flight .
4 ) Congratulations !
You 've just been robbed and you 're still alive .
What now ?
Well , do n't go back to your apartment and call the cops thirty minutes later .
Do n't call your mom in Kansas and tell her first .
CALL THE COPS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE .
You'd be amazed at how many people fuck up this simple step .
Pay phones still exist as do 24/7 bogies .
Go there , call the cops .5 )
It may take a while for the cops to show up .
The 911 system , at best , will result in a five minute wait before we 're even notified .
Then we have to drive there without killing anyone .
Be patient .
For that matter , tell the 911 operator exactly where you are .
Nothing makes a responding cop happier than having to scour the area for your dumb ass while the perp gets away .
6 ) Resist the temptation to curse / complain / bitch about the cops while you 're waiting for us to show up .
We 're probably busy .
Even if we 're not , do n't expect us to come tear - assing across the precinct lights and sirens to get to you 2 minutes sooner .
I have no intention of broadsiding a livery cab and getting fired just because you got your sidekick took .
7 ) When we do arrive : get in the car , tell us what they looked like and where they went .
Something simple .
" AGE / RACE / RED HOODIE / BLUE JEANS / NORTH ON BROADWAY " Really all we need .
8 ) We are now going to " canvass " .
Get in the fucking car .
We are n't going to get you shot you fucking pussy .
Also , comments like " I can't believe this happened to me " or " I'm in shock " or " OH GOD WHY " - shove it .
Save it for the bar later .
If you have n't actually gotten shot , shived or stomped grow a fucking pair and close your mouth .
9 ) We are now going to drive around and try to arrest someone .
Quick con-law refresher for the lib hippy types : if you 're in my car , and have given me a description , THAT MEANS WE ARE STOPPING PEOPLE WHO FIT THAT DESCRIPTION .
If you told me they are violent or armed , it 's probably going to be a felony stop .
So when you tell me it 's a 15 year old black kid in a red hoodie with a silver pistol , do n't be surprised when the car slams to a halt and we jump out and stop a 15 year old black kid in a red hoodie .
I am not violating his rights , I am not hassling him because he 's a minority .
I 'm stopping him because YOU GAVE US HIS FUCKING DESCRIPTION .
If the kid is not the one who robbed you , he 'll be on his way in five minutes .
On the other hand , if he is the one who robbed you , he may decide to run / fight / pull out a gun - you do n't stop suspected armed robbers by asking pretty please .
If this offends you , get the fuck out of my car and go find the guy who mugged you yourself .
10 ) We failed to find your robber .
No surprise : they 've probably done this before and had an escape route all planned out .
They were probably back in their apartment / subway / taxi before you even called 911 .
Do n't bitch .
It happens .
This is n't Law And Order .11 )
Yes , you are coming back to the precinct to make a fucking report .
I 'm sure the CO , Kelly and Bloomberg would be fucking thrilled if you did n't make a report as this helps the compstat stats ( you watch the Wire , right ? ) but if I did all this fucking work , you 're taking 30 minutes out of your day to make a god - damn report .
Also , after you 've finished venting about how we 're all corrupt , racist , incompetent morons who probably got bullied in High School , you 'll remember that you need a police report for your credit card companies , and you 'll show up the next morning with a sheepish expression and ask to make a report .
Let 's do this now while the memory is still fresh .
11a ) " You 'll never catch the guy " , " I do n't remember much " and variations thereof are just insulting .
Our detectives have been doing this job for years , and despite what TV / Movies taught you , only a small fraction are burned out alcoholics .
They probably are going to catch this guy ... eventually .
12 ) No racial language please .
The odds are good you just got robbed by a black or hispanic male , and your buried - deep racism may be bubbling to the surface ( especially if you 're an out of town transplant / college student ) .
The majority of the co-workers on my shift and in the DT squad are minority .
It 's embarrassing when you use racial slurs in front of them .
Amazingly , most cops are n't racist , although we do have a universal contempt for crackheads , gang members , and dumbass white people .
In conclusion : Do n't be stupid , pay attention , call the cops , and do n't be a dick .

The rats are jumping from the ship , and the biggest rat of them all , Karl " I should be in jail " Rove , sits down with Chris Wallace to admit that indicators are not good for the McCain campaign :
WALLACE : One thing that we are witnessing already is dissension within the ranks of the McCain campaign .
There 's a big article today in the New York Times Sunday Magazine about it .
There have been a bunch of other reports .
People pointing fingers at each other about what went wrong with the McCain campaign even before we get to the election .
Why do you think that this has started so early and so publicly ?
ROVE : Well , look , we 've seen this a couple of times this year .
We saw it in the Clinton campaign .
Now we 're seeing it in the McCain campaign , where before the election is totaled up , before the votes are all cast , before the decision is made , people start pointing fingers and blaming each other .
It is a sign of undisciplined people who do not have the loyalty that they ought to have to the candidate whom they 're serving and it's -- it 's a sad sight to see .
Nobody makes themselves look good by this process .
WALLACE : It is not generally a phenomenon we see in winning campaigns , however , is it ?
ROVE : Occasionally you see it .
You 're right , it 's in campaigns that are behind and people want to make certain they escape with the best reputation they can .
Frankly , considering how many of them came from Rove 's coterie , I think that ship has sailed .
Rove also acknowledges the fact that even Sarah Palin has gone " rogue " with a non-answer answer that points to the end of John McCain 's presidential aspirations :
WALLACE : Let me ask you about another aspect of this , because there are growing reports about dissension with regard to Sarah Palin .
That supposedly she has turned on some of the McCain advisers who were assigned to her campaign .
That they did a very bad job rolling her out .
They conversely are saying that she ’s a diva and she has gone – I love these expressions — gone rogue , which means she ’s not following the McCain talking points what do you know about that and what do you make about this fight between the McCain camp and the Palin camp ?
ROVE : Yeah , look this is a storyline the media likes .
I do know this , talking to some people inside the McCain campaign who are working with Palin .
They have enormous respect for her abilities and I think may be a little be overblown , but look , again , as you say not the kind of thing you ’d like to have happening in your campaign and it ’s generally a sign that people are throwing in the towel and thinking they ’re going to lose .
On the other hand , we got two people inside the McCain campaign who I know are not throwing in the towel .
One of them is the presidential candidate , John McCain and the other is the vice presidential candidate , Sarah Palin .
Both of them are energetically out there on the campaign trail and this is what is really going to matter in the last ten days , not what staffers are trying to cover themselves with as we get into the final ten days .

Let me say — and this is a point of personal privilege — I was particularly amazed by the attacks this morning in the New York Times on Steve Schmidt .
You can blame the campaign for doing good things and bad things , but when Steve Schmidt began to assume more control over the campaign in June , was when the campaign began to get up on its legs and get into the fray and you know , the tactics that he led them , got them to you know , a slight lead at the time of the convention and a clear lead by the time of the economic meltdown .
And I was appalled by the sort of the personal attacks on him .
You never like to see this but you particularly do n’t like to see this 10 days before an election .
WALLACE : Let me ask you about another aspect of this , because there are growing reports about dissension with regard to Sarah Palin .

Shares of General Motors plunged thirty - one percent today — and maybe more , it ’s hard to tell because ten minutes after the market closed stocks kept dropping due to pent up sell volume .
Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services put the auto maker 's debt rating " on CreditWatch with negative implications . "
S& P credit analyst Robert Schulz said the classification reflects " the rapidly weakening state of most global automotive markets , along with capital market conditions that will remain a serious challenge for the foreseeable future . "
Translation : no one can afford a car , and no one can borrow to finance one .
Even Schulz ’s reassurance is unsettling .
" We believe GM currently has adequate liquidity for at least the rest of 2008 as measured by cash balances and available bank facilities , but the accelerating deterioration in industry fundamentals will be a serious challenge to liquidity during 2009 , " he said .
Oh , totally great .

Rep. William Jefferson , D - La. , left , with granddaughter Phaelin Jones , was charged last year with accepting bribes .
Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , was found guilty Monday of concealing more than $ 250,000 in gifts he received .
WASHINGTON  Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens is the only member of Congress running for re-election as a convicted felon , but he 's not the only one running from scandal .
From admission of adultery by a Florida incumbent to a candidate under indictment in Louisiana , lawmakers in both parties are wrestling with embarrassment and imbroglio as they seek another term in Congress .
NO APOLOGIES : Sen .
Stevens not afraid to use clout POLITICAL ACTION : McCain calls for Stevens to resign from Senate Even so , the historic presidential campaign may make candidate indiscretions less significant than they were in 2006 , experts said .
" Voters are paying attention to the presidential race to the exclusion of other developments , " said David Wasserman , who tracks House races for the Cook Political Report .
Ethical matters , he said , are " pretty far down the list of priorities for voters . "
A jury found Stevens guilty Monday of concealing more than $ 250,000 in gifts he received from wealthy friends .
The 84 - year - old Republican vowed to appeal the conviction and also to continue campaigning for an eighth term even as the presidential candidates , fellow Sens.
John McCain and Barack Obama , called for his resignation .
A campaign spokesman did not return a call seeking comment , but Stevens told Fox News he would return home today to restart his campaign .
Asked why Alaskans would vote for him , Stevens said : " Ask them .
I know they will . "
Alaska Democratic Senate candidate Mark Begich has mostly avoided the issue .
But on Tuesday , as Stevens announced he received an endorsement from an Eskimo whaling group , Begich spoke up .
" The charges against Senator Stevens were serious and the conviction sends a strong message that no man is above the law , " Begich said in a statement .
Although Begich had remained quiet , the national Democratic Party aired television spots publicizing the trial .
The party developed a slogan , " Ted Stevens : It 's not about Alaska anymore . "
State Democrats have launched a website , retireted.com .
Candidates running against someone under investigation or in turmoil must be cautious in their attacks , said Bruce Gronbeck , director of the University of Iowa Center for Media Studies and Political Culture .
" You have to be careful you do n't generate sympathy , " Gronbeck said , noting that scandals get a lot of exposure .
" If any of these opponents comes out really strongly they just have n't been paying attention to what 's happening in the media world . "
Republicans have tread lightly with Florida Democrat Rep. Tim Mahoney , who admitted to having extramarital affairs .
Cook predicts the race is likely to be won by his Republican opponent , Tom Rooney .
Louisiana Democratic Rep. William Jefferson has faced little criticism despite being charged last year with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes .
He is likely to win re-election , Cook says .
Scandals have sunk incumbents .
In 2006 , Curt Weldon , a 10 - term Republican from suburban Philadelphia , was facing a strong opponent when the FBI raided his home .
Though associates later pleaded guilty , Weldon was not charged .
He lost 56 % to 44 % .
Another Republican under investigation , Rep. Jerry Lewis of California , is considered by Cook to be a safe bet to keep his seat , even though his opponent , Tim Prince , has made Lewis ' conduct a centerpiece of his campaign in radio ads and mailings .
" Our whole campaign theme has been ' restore principles to Congress , ' " said Patrick Kahler , Prince 's campaign manager .
Authorities have contacted Lewis ' lawyers , but Lewis is not sure what the investigation is about , spokesman Jim Specht said .
" His position is that he 's always done everything to meet the highest ethical standard , " Specht said .

So who is this Catholic priest from Fresno who stood up and spoke out against Proposition 8 , putting his career on the line ?
As a gay man who finds the church ’s views on homosexuality so objectionable , why has he been a priest for more than 20 years and subjected himself to such moral conflict ?
After reading my colleague Duke Helfand ’s story about Father Geoffrey Farrow and his recent career - suicide from the pulpit , I was curious .
Farrow agreed to meet me for lunch in the middle of a schedule that ’s gotten very busy since he became persona non grata to his employer .
He ’s been asked to appear all over the state for rallies against Prop. 8 , which would amend the California Constitution to say marriage can only be between a man and a woman .
Father Farrow , who was suspended by his bishop two weeks ago , strolled into the lobby of the Kyoto Grand Hotel in downtown Los Angeles wearing the collar .
Advertisement
“ I ’m still a priest , ” he said over lunch , though he fully expected to be disciplined for speaking to his congregation about Prop.
8 and would n’t be surprised if he ’s ultimately fired .
For the moment , he ’s staying with friends in Los Angeles .
Farrow , 50 , does n’t know what he ’ll do after the election .
He was suspended without pay and said his medical benefits run out at the end of the month .
Farrow , who lived in Cuba until the age of 4 , grew up Catholic in Florida and knew as a teenager that he was gay .
He dated girls “ to keep up appearances ” but was miserable about it , and he began questioning his faith .
“ If God is omnipotent , why is there evil in the world ? ” he asked himself as body bags returned to the U.S. from Vietnam .
Advertisement
He looked into agnosticism and atheism , neither of which offered the answers he wanted .
In his first year of college in Florida , he studied philosophy , read Cicero and mused on the meaning of history , civilization and the nature of God .
“ I have a hunger for the transcendent , ” Farrow said .
“ This is too precise , ” he said of man and the universe , “ to be a coincidence . ”
And so he became a believer , once more , in the church he had been “ carried to in diapers . ”
When I told Farrow that as an agnostic , I do n’t understand that leap , he described God as love and faith as trust .
“ Trust is fundamental of all human relationships , ” he said .
“ Part of the attraction of the relationship with that person is that you ’re always familiar with them and yet always discovering them . ”
Advertisement
I love and trust my wife , I said , but she ’s real and does n’t need to prove that she exists .
“ Precisely , ” Farrow said with a smile , as if I ’d described his relationship with God .
When his family moved from Florida to Redondo Beach in the 1970s , Farrow , still closeted as a gay man , joined St. John ’s Seminary in Camarillo .
Is it possible , I asked , that becoming a priest was a way of avoiding coming to terms with his sexuality ?
Farrow had , after all , once prayed to God to “ please make me normal , please make me normal . ”
Advertisement
“ That ’s a valid question , ” he said , but he believes he was addressing his spiritual rather than sexual identity in becoming a priest .
Was n’t it a suffocating compromise ?
I asked .
He had given himself over to a church that has , despite moderating its views in recent decades , condemned homosexuality and marginalized gays , even though in Farrow ’s opinion a sizable percentage of priests are gay .
Farrow conceded that he has considered church teachings “ monstrous , ” especially given the history of violence and suicide victimizing gays .
But he said he has always believed in the church , if not in the men who led it .
It ’s like loving a family member despite a falling out , or loving your country even as you doubt its leaders .
“ I ’m not happy with the current administration , ” Farrow said , “ but I have n’t shredded my passport . ”
I asked if he ’d had any relationships while serving as a priest .
Advertisement
Yes , he confessed .
He seemed near tears and stopped short of sharing the details .
But he said it had ended .
I wondered again how anyone could go through such an ordeal and remain committed to a church that considers it a sin for a gay person to act on biological urges .
Whom do you even talk to for help ?
I asked .
“ There are a lot of clergy who deal with this , ” Farrow said , telling me many priests in the Fresno diocese are gay .
“ You speak to each other . ”
But that ’s a form of silence as well as hypocrisy , and Farrow was increasingly troubled by his double life .
Not long ago , he saw a woman crying in a church hallway and asked what was wrong .
Advertisement
“ My son just came out to me , ” she said .
“ I was having a dinner party and I told him he could n’t bring his boyfriend . ”
“ Do you know what you just did ? ” Farrow asked her .
“ You just told your son he was not as important to you as your dinner guests . ”
Farrow then had his epiphany when he was asked by a Prop. 8 supporter in Fresno to speak up in favor of the measure .
He knew he could n’t and that in fact he had to do just the opposite .
“ I am morally compelled to vote no on Proposition 8 , ” he told his congregation , saying he had to break “ a numbing silence ” about church prejudice against homosexuals .
Advertisement
Among the critics in his own parish and beyond , there are those who quote the Bible to condemn homosexuality and gay marriage .
“ The Bible is not a book , it ’s a library written over 15 centuries , ” Farrow told me , suggesting that Christianity has and should continue to evolve .
“ People who approach scripture in a literal fashion are attempting to manipulate God himself . ”
To Farrow , condemning gay and lesbian marriage is as offensive as the condemnations of interracial marriage not too many decades ago .
“ ‘ Think about the children , ’ they said , and they ’re doing the same with this , ” Farrow said indignantly .
“ If a child is raised in a home where he ’s loved , that ’s a good home . ”
Advertisement
So why not just quit his job rather than wait to get fired ?
Farrow said he still sees the church as home , and believes his new mission is to force this issue whether he ’s wearing a collar or not .
“ They said I ’ve caused scandal to the church , ” he said .
“ I think the real scandal is the thousands of gay and lesbian children who feel abandoned by the church of their baptism . ”
When he was in seminary , Farrow interned as deacon at St. Vincent ’s Medical Center and worked with terminally ill patients .
As the end nears , Farrow told me , people say the things they never could utter .
They are “ more alive than ever . . . because they realize the futility of fear . ”
He found them all contemplating the same questions .
Advertisement
“ Were you true to your conscience ?
Did you do what you felt was right ? ”
And one more .
“ What do you have in the end but the love you gave away ? ”

A federal wildlife official in Billings said the government planned to retreat for now from its attempt to take gray wolves in the Northern Rockies off the endangered species list .
The official , Ed Bangs of the Fish and Wildlife Service , said the government in the next week planned to withdraw a rule issued this spring .
The rule was based on the assertion that the region ’s approximately 1,500 wolves were recovered fully , opening the way for public hunting of wolves to begin this fall in Montana , Idaho and Wyoming .
Those hunts had been in doubt since July , when Judge Donald Molloy of Federal District Court blocked them pending resolution of a lawsuit by environmentalists .
Here was me complaining about the lack of good build tools for Python and in a wonderful synchronicity Bruce Eckel 's gone and made a new one .
The post is part of a longer series on Python decorators , which is worth reading in its own right .
Aside from the unfortunate name ( can we hope it gets changed to something more googlable ? ) , the tool looks interesting .
The basic idea is to use decorators to define rules and plain Python functions to fulfill them .
It looks based on the older style build tools ( like Make , Ant and Rake ) where one uses recipes to build rather than inferring targets from project structures and compiler configurations ( like Maven and Buildr ) .
This is n't necessarily bad , as it gives more finegrained control of what happens as a part of a build .
The key feature that build .
py brings from Rake is that the build tool allows you to use a fully featured programming language to define how tasks are executed .
This is important for allowing users to create tasks that are n't predicted by plugin makers for the original build tool .
This is still just the first release , and it should be more fleshed out as he finishes the Python book he 's using build .
py for .
I look forward to seeing future developments and adoption .
( Incidentally , someone mentioned Vellum in the comments on the post .
It 's probably worth looking into as well . )
Vote by phone and other fun tricks
November 1 , 2008 by twitterpaters

via Threat Level on October 31 , 2008 :
The residents of Broward County , Florida have recently received misleading robocalls telling them that they can vote by phone on Election Day , according to a report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on Friday .
um , what ?
Another unknown group is distributing flyers ( see the flyer after the jump ) with official - looking letterhead around the area of Hampton Roads , Virgina that erroneously inform recipients that because of the crowds at the polls , the Virginia State Board of Elections is scheduling Republicans to vote on November 4th , and Democrats on the 5th .
they … really expect that to work ?
Meanwhile , the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review reports that people in the area have been receiving robocalls with the same message .
This particular trick is an old one :
In 2004 , the New York Times reported the same message going out in the Pittsburgh area via flyers .
apparently , yes .
update : via CBS News on November 2 , 2008 :
In Nevada , for example , Latino voters said they had received calls from people describing themselves as Obama volunteers , urging them to cast their ballot over the phone .
…
Complaints have surfaced in predominantly African - American neighborhoods of Philadelphia where fliers have circulated , warning voters they could be arrested at the polls if they had unpaid parking tickets or if they had criminal convictions …
In Pennsylvania , e-mails appeared linking Democrat Barack Obama to the Holocaust .
“ Jewish Americans cannot afford to make the wrong decision on Tuesday , Nov. 4 , ” said the electronic message , paid for by an entity calling itself the Republican Federal Committee .
“ Many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s and made a tragic mistake .
… Other reports of intimidation efforts in the hotly contested state of Pennsylvania include leaflets taped to picnic benches at Drexel University , warning students that police would be at the polls on Tuesday to arrest would - be voters with prior criminal offenses .
In his Jewish neighborhood , Stalberg said , fliers were recently left claiming Obama was more sympathetic to Palestinians than to Israel , and showed a photograph of him speaking in Germany . …
In New Mexico , two Hispanic women filed a lawsuit last week claiming they were harassed by a private investigator working for a Republican lawyer who came to their homes and threatened to call immigration authorities , even though they are U.S. citizens .
…
Trying to mislead voters is nothing new .
In 2006 , automated phone calls in the final days leading to the federal election wrongly warned voters they would not be allowed to vote without a photo ID .
In Colorado and Virginia , people reported receiving calls that told them their registrations had expired and they would be arrested if they showed up to vote .
The White House contest of 2004 was marked by similar deceptions .
In Milwaukee , fliers went up advising people “ if you ’ve already voted in any election this year , you ca n’t vote in the presidential election . ”
In Pennsylvania , a letter bearing what appeared to be the McCandless Township seal falsely proclaimed that in order to cut long voting lines , Republicans would cast ballots on Nov. 2 and Democrats would vote on Nov. 3 .
update : The Brennan Center is tracking voter suppression incidents .
update : Just in case you have n’t heard what happened when Oprah tried to vote …

Radiohead MacBook Pro Kontakt 3 Image 2 of 2 Jonny Greenwood keeps it old school with a PowerBook and a Kenton Control Freak .
Jonny Greenwood live setup
Radiohead 's live technician has been discussing the band 's secret performance weapon during their current world tour - a MacBook Pro running Native Instruments Kontakt 3 .
Russ Russell is the man tasked with attending to the laptop during the band 's shows - this is hooked up to a rack of daisy - chained audio interfaces and receives MIDI from two on - stage keyboard stations that are played by Jonny and Colin Greenwood .
As Russ explains , Kontakt is loaded up with all the sample - based sounds that Radiohead require .
" It has allowed us to get completely away from all the frustration of hardware samplers , " he says .
" Editing and importing becomes quicker and easier , which allows the band to make changes or try new ideas without delay or fuss . "

As you 'd expect , much of Radiohead 's current live set is taken from In Rainbows , their latest album , and Russell reports that the sounds for these songs came from both the original studio productions and adapted parts of the Kontakt library .
However , for the band 's older material , a different approach was required .
" I basically went through the entire Radiohead catalogue and converted all the old sample material for Kontakt , " reveals Russ .
" I sampled a few hardware instruments and created multisamples .
It 's just made the organisation of all the keyboard sounds so much easier . "
When it comes to triggering the sounds , Colin Greenwood uses both keyboard and floorboard devices , while brother Jonny also works with a selection of analogue devices and his own laptop .
All songs are played live , though on more ' electronic ' numbers such as 15 Step , the Greenwood brothers are known to trigger percussive loops in real time .

Competing Tax Plans : Two Perspectives
Here ’s an interesting example of how different graphical presentations of the same data can hit the eye differently .
First , an explanation of the likely distributional impacts of the McCain and Obama tax plans , from The Washington Post :
Compare this with the depiction at chartjunk , which presents the same data , but this time with a scale that also emphasizes the number of people in each category :
It looks like it tells a different story , does n’t it ?
Here ’s a third chart that gives emphasis to the total tax paid by each group rather than the number of people in each group .
( Note that the numbers here are only approximate . )
You will surely protest that this scaling exaggerates the importance of the rich , which it does .
But if you are concerned about balancing the budget , the rich are very important .
The chart above does a useful job of trying to assess whether ( and how ) each tax plan pays for itself .
( This chart would be more useful if it weighted people by their taxable incomes rather than their tax burdens . )
For those who prefer to see the raw numbers , the latest Tax Policy Center analysis was released on Friday , and is available here .
( Note that the charts above were based on their previous analysis . )
More generally , I highly recommend the Tax Policy Center analysis ; it is careful , non-partisan , and broadly accepted by professional economists .
It is rare for me to contemplate new gadgetry without a pang of regret for the early passing of Douglas Adams .
I miss him both as friend and technology guru .
For years , we played with digital toys together , swapping software and finding new ways to make our systems crash .
Back in the 80s , we had acoustic coupler modems , capable of what we thought was a dazzling half - duplex 1,200 bps .
In those pre-internet days ( or , more accurately , pre-ISP days ) , we communicated with each other 's Macs via these modems : plugging telephone receivers into the rubber - grommeted holes of the coupler , we spoke into the Mac 's inbuilt microphone and waited for it to emerge from the other end as ( broadly ) intelligible speech .
It took us a week to fine - tune the system , but in the end we could hold a conversation .
We triumphantly told Douglas 's wife , Jane , who asked why we did n't get rid of the computers , the acoustic couplers , the miles of wiring and the discs .
" It 's called a telephone conversation , " she said .
Doh .
Douglas never lived to see his beloved Apple rise from near - collapse in the 90s to today 's position .
He died a few months before the arrival of the first generation of iPods ; I missed his response to them dreadfully , as I have every new arrival in the digital sphere since .
Some Christians have What Would Jesus Do? as a motto ; I have What Would Douglas Think ?
I 'm looking now at the SanDisk Sansa e2x0 ( x=memory option , from 2 Gb to 8 Gb ) , a new media player from the flash data card people .
Playing with it over the week , my mind has been turning on one of Douglas 's theories .
When asked if everyone should become " computer literate " , he harked back to a 30s Boy 's Wonder Book Of Science in which one article extolled the virtues of the new generation of brushed DC motors and how they were going to revolutionise the world .
There were diagrams of a " house of the future " , a huge electric motor in the attic with a series of belts driving everything from the washing machine to the rotisserie .
The piece concluded that , as a result , everyone would be very handy with DC motors - " electric motor literate " .
What its authors failed to predict was that such motors would indeed revolutionise the home , but instead of one big master , there 'd be dozens of small motors , invisible to the user .
They are still with us , in our washing machines , computers , cars - even in the first six generations of iPod .
We do n't have to be motor literate , however - they are just there .
Douglas argued the same with computer literacy .
We used to believe that homes would have one great computer controlling music , lights and heating .
In fact , we have them in our tumble - driers and thermostats , cars and coffee machines .
But we do n't have to be computer literate any more than we need to know how a car engine works .
All we have to learn is how to negotiate the traffic .
The Sansa is good , but it is hard to get excited about an audio video player , even a cheap one with such a good battery life ( its most impressive feature ) .
Most of us have them built into our phones , and we 'll soon have them in our cameras , fridges and cars .
It will be interesting to see how Apple copes with the diminishing excitement of new iPods .
Meanwhile the SanDisk is fine .
Small , good value , better sound reproduction than an iPod - ideal for DRM free music .
But surely it wo n't be long before MP3 players go the way of the electronic calculator : from eye - popping novelty to consumer essential to gift from the estate agent to dusty , solar - powered in a drawer .
Being flash memory , of course , the Sansa does n't have an electric motor .
Shame : Douglas and I would have enjoyed taking it apart and proving our electric motor illiteracy .

While Barack Obama enters the final days of the presidential campaign with a clear lead in the polls - but not so big as to rule out a surprise victory for John McCain - the impact of the 2008 presidential campaign will depend not only on who wins but also on whether the results signify a deeper realignment in American politics .
" We like to tell the election story through the candidates , " said Thomas Patterson , a professor at Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government .
" But this time there are larger forces in play . "
And while Obama 's lead , between three and seven percentage points in most national polls , is big enough to make him the favorite going into Tuesday , the other big questions of the election are all too close to call .
Is the " Reagan Revolution " over ?
Going down the stretch , McCain is campaigning heavily on Obama 's comment that he wants to " spread the wealth . "
And McCain has even discovered a seven - year - old radio interview suggesting that Obama may believe in " redistributive " economics .
During the heyday of the Democrats ' New Deal coalition , which dominated politics from 1932 until 1980 , the idea of spreading the wealth around was hardly political poison - it was the backbone of the party 's economic philosophy .
Since 1980 and the " Reagan Revolution , " however , using tax policies to redistribute income has been widely viewed as an outmoded approach that chokes off economic growth .
Obama has n't fully embraced ' 60s - style tax - and - spend liberalism , but he has n't run away from it as much as other Democratic presidential nominees since 1984 have done .
Bill Clinton , the most successful Democratic vote - getter of that period , went out of his way to declare that " the era of big government is over , " and assure voters that he is a " pro-growth " Democrat who favors " third way " policies .
Obama also touts his policies as pro-growth , but has emphasized that he believes people earning more than $ 250,000 should bear the brunt of tax increases to cover social initiatives that would disproportionately benefit lower - income people .
To the extent that such a mechanism " spreads the wealth , " he 's in favor of it .
Many observers have noted that Americans want more economic security in their lives , including guaranteed healthcare , pensions , disaster relief , and improvements to public infrastructure .
And the McCain campaign , in a break with Ronald Reagan 's creed of smaller government , has called for the government to pay up to $ 300 billion to buy up home mortgages and chop the monthly payments to reflect diminished home values .
In addition , the McCain proposal that follows the Reagan creed most closely - his call for extending the Bush tax cuts and adding new cuts of business taxes - seems to be falling on deaf ears ; in recent weeks , the GOP nominee has concentrated more on warning of tax hikes under Obama than touting the benefits of his own tax - cut plan .
David Brooks , the conservative New York Times columnist , has predicted that the economic uncertainty will lead to a Democratic sweep followed by an intensive return to tax - and - spend liberalism .
" What we 're going to see , in short , is the Gingrich revolution in reverse and on steroids , " Brooks wrote last month .
McCain believes that voters still fear the kind of overreach that Brooks predicts .
A modest victory for Obama could easily be ascribed to a simple desire for a change , benefiting a candidate who tried to present his policies in modest terms .
A big Obama win , however , could be read as a mandate for just the kind of liberalism that Brooks fears .
And it could signal a much longer - term political realignment .
The New Deal era and the Reagan Revolution each followed failed presidencies that , fairly or not , are still invoked as cautionary tales - the Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter administrations .
George W. Bush 's administration , with record - low approval ratings , may join the list .
Is America prepared to move beyond its racial divisions ?
On the day of Obama 's Democratic nomination acceptance speech , tens of thousands of African - Americans , most with children in tow , waited for hours in security lines to enter Denver 's football stadium to celebrate the crowning of the nation 's first black presidential nominee .
Despite the football setting , it was more of a church crowd - uplifted , generous , and full of faith .
While some black voters would express concerns for Obama 's safety and nervousness about his campaign , many others have remained quietly confident , even when polls narrowed and other Democrats worried that Obama was n't as far ahead as he should be , given the country 's problems .
Much of black voters ' faith is in Obama himself .
But there is also a quiet recognition among many that , whatever the extent of racial divisions , they do n't preclude a majority - white country from electing a black president .
That by itself could change racial pathologies that have existed throughout American history .
Since George Washington , the president has been the symbol of the nation , as much as European monarchs once embodied their nations ' identity .
Having a black president just four decades after the end of legal segregation would force a reconsideration of almost all assumptions about race relations in America .
But if Obama were to lose - and if white resistance to a black nominee were cited as a major factor - black hopes would be dashed in a way that could increase racial tensions , at least in the short term .
Still , the legacy of the Obama campaign , win or lose , on race relations probably wo n't be clear until long after Tuesday .
Are young people becoming a driving force in American politics ?
Back in the '60s , the emerging Baby Boom generation pushed American politics leftward .
But through the ' 80s and '90s , voters under 30 see - sawed between backing Democrats and Republicans , while turning out in smaller numbers overall .
Their strongest sentiment seemed to be their indifference .
In the 2000 race between Al Gore and George W. Bush , only 40 percent of registered voters from ages 18 to 29 bothered to vote , compared with 65 percent of voters over 30 , according to a survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center .
In 2004 , the turnout of voters under 30 jumped by nine percentage points , to 49 percent , while that of older voters increased by only three .
And those younger voters supported Democrat John Kerry over Bush by a seven - point margin , 48 to 41 percent .
This year , voters between 18 and 29 are backing Obama by a whopping 29 points - 61 to 32 , according to a Pew survey .
And while more young voters showed up for this year 's Democratic primaries than in 2004 , no one is sure whether turnout of young voters will take another big leap in the general election .
" We 're expecting them to at least match their turnout level of 2004 , if not increase it , " said Scott Keeter , Pew 's director of survey research .
" Given the enormous lead Obama has among young voters , they 'll be a key to whether he wins or not . "
How much do Americans care about their image in the world ?
Arguably , the opinions of foreigners have never counted for anything in US politics .
Some of the most unpopular American presidents in the outside world - such as Reagan - were hugely popular at home , while those most concerned with the world - like Hoover and Carter - were domestic flops .
But the latest plunge in America 's standing in the world , spurred by the policies of the Bush administration , has gotten some political attention at home , especially when linked to the administration 's failure to persuade enough allies to share the costs of intervention in Iraq .
Obama has cited his own racial background and time spent in Indonesia as a reason why " the world will look at America differently when I 'm president . "
That argument drew voters to Obama during his primary race against Hillary Clinton .
And he reinforced just how much his election could do to improve relations with US allies by staging a campaign - style rally in Berlin , attended by hundreds of thousands of adoring Germans .
Elsewhere in the world , from Europe to Asia , there has been intense scrutiny of the American election - and excitement over the Obama campaign .
The global interest suggests that millions of foreigners might be prepared to change their opinions of the United States under a President Obama .
But in recent weeks , foreign policy has taken a back seat in the election , so it will be hard to judge how much an Obama victory would be a mandate to be more attentive to US allies .
And it remains to be seen whether a President Obama would be able to meet the high expectations that American allies seem to have for him .

A testy back and forth between Dan Savage and a Christian conservative over Gay Marriage :
Posted by Sir Cucumber at on Tuesday , November 4 , 2008
There 's nothing like that fresh and hopeful feeling you get from exercising your franchise .
Sure most of us live in states where our votes mean nothing , but we get to push a button !
A big button !
In some polling places it 's even a big lever !
Punch ballots also have a powerfully classic aesthetic ... unless you 're too old and feeble to press a hole all the way through , which results in a hanging chad ...
And all you people living in miserable places like Nevada , Missouri , or North Carolina - today is the one day that the rest of us care what you think !
I know it 's an imposition .
I know it 's a pain .
I know you 've got to get to work and punch in , or get home and cook dinner for the kids .
But you could have voted early and you did n't , so whose fault is that ?
Neither one of these chumps have all the answers - but government never does .
It 's clear though that something must be done , and leaders follow people , so let 's all push a button for the Republic today !
The UK 's ethical banking sector is not only surviving the meltdown , it is experiencing new levels of consumer confidence and investment .
At Bristol - based Triodos Bank , profits are up more than 50 % , inflows into its cash Isa are up 25 % , and the amount of money deposited by savers is up by 15 % - nearly four times the mainstream bank saving rate of 4 % .
So why are Triodos , and other ethical institutions , bucking the trend ?
" We operate a transparent and easy - to - understand business model , " explains UK managing director , Charles Middleton .
" We raise money from individual savers to fund projects that benefit people and the environment .
We do n't invest in any of the complicated bundled investments , such as derivatives , that are n't connected to the real economy , and we show exactly what we are investing in . "
But people nervous about banks with overseas parent companies following the collapse of Icesave , should be aware that Triodos is a subsidiary of a Dutch banking group .
If it were to go bust , savers would have to apply to the Dutch deposit guarantee scheme .
However , this recently raised its maximum payout threshold to € 100,000 ( £ 77,700 ) - significantly more than the £ 50,000 offered to UK savers .
The Ecology Building Society , which only provides mortgages for properties that have a positive environmental benefit , has seen the amount deposited this year already exceed amount for the whole of 2007 .
" We are witnessing a flight to safety , with people increasingly recognising that the mutual model is less affected by the current volatile market , " says Paul Ellis , its chief executive .
The Co-operative Bank has also been able to weather the storm , thanks to " a historically prudent approach to lending and a strong reputation for trust " .
It says : " Our lending capital is generated from customers ' investments and savings , leaving us a good deal less exposed to the markets ... we actually increased mortgage business during the first half of 2008 . "
The Co-op Bank says people 's money will never be used to support regimes that abuse human rights , and that on the positive side , " it will always be invested according to sound environmental principles " .
It has also seen significant increases in savings balances during the first six months of the year ; retail savings have grown by more than 11 % .
But there is a price to be paid for this prudence , and for knowing your money is not supporting unethical practices such as the arms trade or tobacco , and this often takes the form of lower rates .
With a rate of 3.85 % , Triodos 's online cash Isa is n't the best return you can get .
At the Ecology , you will get 5.1 % if you take out its Earthwise cash Isa ; this rate includes a 1 % annual interest bonus payable if no more than one withdrawal is made during the tax year .
The Co-op Bank , meanwhile , has some good deals , including a one - year fixed - rate savings bond paying 6.5 % gross , and two - and three - year bonds paying 6.59 % ( the minimum deposit is £ 2,000 ) .
However , a recent poll for Triodos found that 38 % of consumers would be prepared to take a lower rate in return for a sound ethical and environmental policy .
So what lessons do these banks think their battered and bruised high street competitors need to learn from the whole experience ?
Paul Ellis believes that the fundamental problem at the root of the crisis " is a lack of transparency surrounding the complex financial products that have caused so much damage " .
Charles Middleton agrees : " The credit crunch is making people think hard about what their money is doing and what their bank is using it for . "
Have you just recently bought a Mac ?
It ’s not surprising why you ’d choose one .
Perhaps you ’ve opted for the new MacBook Pro 16 inch .
Or maybe you want a thinner , less expensive model such as the MacBook Air .
They are great machines that enable you to be more productive .
But if you ’ve recently bought a new Mac you ’re probably now wondering about how to use it and are thinking about what magic keyboard shortcuts are available .
Especially since the latest MacBook Pro comes with a new keyboard to use .
Here ’s everything you need to know about MacBook shortcuts and the Mac hotkey .
Command + F – Search Function
If you are searching for a document , a photo or an application in your Mac system sometimes it can be hard to know where to look .
The Mac does have a color - coding system included with it called tags and the folder system is quite intuitive .
However , sometimes you want to find a document fast .
You do n’t want to have to sift through endless folders or tasks .
You can use Siri by simply asking it to find the name of your document but Siri is not always reliable .
Pressing command + f on the desktop page will bring up the Mac search shortcut and allow you to search with your keyboard for the document you want .
Remember you can search for files in external drives as well .
But to connect these with a new Mac that uses USB - C you ’ll need to purchase a MacBook docking station to help you on your way .
Searching Within Documents
One of the great features of the search function is not only that you can search for documents but that you can search within documents and other programs as well .
Let ’s say you are working on a Ph.D. thesis on your Mac or a novel and you ’ve discovered that you ’ve spelled a word incorrectly .
Do n’t waste time looking for each instance of the word .
Instead , use command + f to bring up every time the word is mentioned .
You can use the match case as well if you are looking for a version of the word or sentence , perhaps only when something occurs in the middle of the sentence and not at the start .
You can also use the command + f search function to search web pages .
This is handy if you are reading a long essay or article and lose your page or you are looking for a specific reference .
Command +
Shift + V – Paste With Correct Formating
One of the most annoying things about copying and pasting a phrase from a website is that when it appears in your document it usually arrives with the formatting from the website .
It does n’t fit into your document .
Imagine that the website you are reading from the text is size 24 comic sans and you want to insert it into your formal Word document as a quote .
Pasting it in , directly , will not only look out of place if you ’ve been writing in size 12 Times New Roman , but it could also mess up the formatting .
The size of the font could push the content into new pages and also mess up the alignment of any pictures you ’ve placed into the document .
One way around this is to paste the text without its previous formatting so that it matches the style and format of your document .
To do this you can copy as you usually would by either clicking ‘ cut ’ via the trackpad or using the shortcut command + x .
Then instead of using the usual command + v , use command + shift +
v. ,
This will ensure your formats match when you paste into a new document .
Command + Shift + 3 – Screenshot
Another common feature you need to take advantage of when using a Mac is the screenshot feature .
Maybe we want to take a screenshot of a conversation with a friend we had on Facebook to share with another friend .
Or perhaps we want to share an issue or bug we are having with our Mac to share with an expert who can help resolve the problem .
Taking a screenshot is an invaluable tool that you should try .
To do this try using command + shift +
3 . This shortcut will take a screenshot of the entire screen .
You can always crop this later if you so wish .
Command + Shift + 4
But what if you only want to take a screenshot of a particular part of your screen rather than the whole screen ?
Perhaps you want to highlight a particular tweet on Twitter or a singular Facebook Page and you do n’t want those you send it to see your entire Facebook feed .
Then there is a way to do that .
Use the command + shift function but instead of pressing 3 this time hit 4 .
A selector icon will come up and you will be able to drag and select the parts of your screen you want screenshotting .
There Are Many Magic Keyboard Shortcuts To Learn
If you have bought a new MacBook then you will want to take advantage of all the features that are available to you .
But one of the reasons for buying a Mac is to be able to get stuff done .
This is where MacBook shortcuts come in handy .
You can try the Mac search shortcut if you want to find a specific document and you can even use this function to search within documents .
This is great if you ’ve written a long and complex document .
If you want to copy and paste whilst ensuring the formatting remains intact then use the shortcut command + shift+v .
If you are interested in reading more about magic keyboard shortcuts or the search shortcut then be sure to check out the rest of our site for more .

No sex is secret to long life , says 105 - year - old Clara , Britain 's oldest virgin
Just too busy : Clara Meadmore says sex seemed a ' hassle ' and she 's glad she did without it
Over the years many a centenarian has delivered their secret for a long life .
Not smoking , daily exercise , moderate drinking , being married ( and sometimes not being married ) have all had their champions .
But , at the ripe old age of 105 , Clara Meadmore could trump the lot : a life of celibacy .
Miss Meadmore says she has always been too busy for relationships and thought of physical intimacy as a ' hassle ' .
The former secretary , who will celebrate her birthday tomorrow , said she had no regrets about remaining a virgin and had turned down several marriage proposals .
Miss Meadmore said : ' People have asked whether I am a homosexual and the answer is no .
I have just never been interested in or fancied having sex .
' I imagine there is a lot of hassle involved and I have always been busy doing other things .
I 've never had a boyfriend - I 've never been bothered about relationships . '
She added : ' When I was a girl you only had sex with your husband - and I never married .
' I 've always had lots of platonic friendships with men but never felt the need to go further than that or marry .
' Everything seems so fast these days .
I do n't know a lot about young people or the way they do things .
I 'm sure it 's very different .
I made my mind up at the age of 12 never to marry and I 've not gone back on that .'
Miss Meadmore was born in Glasgow in 1903 , two years after the death of Queen Victoria .
She remembers hearing about the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the outbreak of the First World War .
Her family emigrated when she was seven , first to Egypt , then Canada and later New Zealand .
But Miss Meadmore returned to Britain alone in her twenties and worked as a secretary and housekeeper .
She said : ' I grew up in an era where little girls were to be seen and not heard so I had to learn to stand up for myself and earn my own living .
' Some men do n't like that in a woman and before long I was too old to marry anyway . '
Instead of boyfriends , Miss Meadmore filled her time with reading , gardening , cooking and listening to the radio .
Yesterday her friend and former neighbour Josie Harvey , 72 , said : ' When she was a little girl she told her mother that she would never marry and for Clara no marriage meant no sex .
She is fiercely independent .
' Maybe never having a man to get under her feet has kept her young all these years .
She has her hobbies and her friends and that is all she needs .
' She has always believed in doing things her own way and that has allowed her to live a long life .
Clara listens to Radio 4 all day long and knows what is going on in the world better than most people in their 30s . '
Miss Meadmore trained as a secretary and served in the Army , undertaking administrative duties in Egypt during the Second World War .
She was one of the first members of the Youth Hostel Association and a keen member of the Women 's Institute .
Her only surviving family are two nieces in New Zealand who keep in touch by post .
Miss Meadmore will celebrate reaching 105 with a card from the Queen and a glass of wine with her friends at the Perran Bay nursing home in Perranporth , Cornwall .
But she is determined not to let things get out of hand .
' I 'm hardly likely to get drunk and do something silly at my age , ' she said .
The BBC seriously has some of the best documentaries .
I just viewed one called Brothers and Sisters in Love , and as the title would suggest , it 's about incest .
Most of the couples featured live as husband and wife .
Some of them even have children together .
( And some of those children have severe birth defects . )
Initially , while watching , you want to cringe …or ralph .
But one couple , who was by far the most " taboo " , were able to explain their lust for each other really succinctly .
They are a mother and a son , and she was forced to give him up for adoption when she 14 .
27 years later they reconnected , and , as they explain it - they had a deep desire , that was n't necessarily sexual - to be one .
They both wanted him back inside her .
They are both disguised in the clip above .

In golf , a handicap creates a level playing field , so players of unequal ability can play at the same course on equal footing , making the match fairer .
So the same methodology is being used by McCain , who is not sure that the VP debate will go in their favor .
If you ca n’t debate on a level playing field handicap it in your favor .
At the insistence of the McCain campaign , the Oct. 2 debate between the Republican nominee for vice president , Gov. Sarah Palin , and her Democratic rival , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , will have shorter question - and - answer segments than those for the presidential nominees , the advisers said .
There will also be much less opportunity for free - wheeling , direct exchanges between the running mates .
McCain advisers said they had been concerned that a loose format could leave Ms. Palin , a relatively inexperienced debater , at a disadvantage and largely on the defensive .
The Commission on Presidential Debates , which is non-partisan , came to a decision Saturday .
A commission member said that the new agreement on the vice - presidential debate ; calls for shorter blocks of candidate statements and open discussion than at the presidential debates .
McCain advisers said they were only somewhat concerned about Ms. Palin ’s debating skills compared with those of Mr. Biden , who has served six terms in the Senate , or about his chances of tripping her up .
Instead , they say , they wanted Ms. Palin to have opportunities to present Mr. McCain ’s positions , rather than spending time talking about her experience or playing defense .
I am so stunned over this one .
With McCain demanding these restrictions –he is basically saying –Palin does n’t have a chance under normal debating structure .
Why should Biden have to compensate for Palin ’s inadequacies on all the major issues ?
He wo n’t be given the opportunity to challenge her on McCain ’s talking points .
I ’m amazed that the Obama campaign agreed to this one .
But , they probably figure Biden will beat her so badly in this debate–it really does n’t matter how many conditions they try to impose .
It only makes the McCain / Palin ticket look even weaker than it did before …

Advertisement I love reading newspapers .
Really I do .
But whenever I read one on the train to work or on the bus , I always seem to end up sparking complete chaos .
Either the passenger sitting next to me gets it in the face with my elbow , or half the pages of my daily collapse onto the floor into an embarrassing heap which , in rush hour , is rather difficult to clear up .
But soon my problems with paper could be over .
At Plastic Logic 's factory in Dresden , British engineer Dean Baker shows me a new kind of newspaper .
What 's new about it ?
Well , for a start there 's no paper - it 's electronic .
The device looks just like a table mat , it 's as light as a magazine .
We have paper being distributed all over the country which is consumed on that day and then discarded into the bin .
This does n't need to be the case .
Dean Baker
But onto it you can download hundreds of newspapers and - at the touch of a button - browse through them quite safely , without elbowing anyone ever again .
" It 's very robust , " says Mr Baker .
To prove it he whacks the screen with his fist .
Not a scratch .
The machine 's so tough , because everything , from the screen to the electronics inside , is made of plastic .
That 's why the electronic newspaper is so light , flexible and revolutionary .
Mr Baker believes the device will help consign ordinary paper to the rubbish bin of history .
" There 's a huge amount of waste , " says Mr Baker .
" We have paper being distributed all over the country which is consumed on that day and then discarded into the bin .
This does n't need to be the case .
" All of that content could be transmitted electronically and stored on a single e-reader , with the same visual appeal as paper .
" Ralf Oberthuer believes paper remains more user - friendly British origins
The plastic microchips are produced in a top security " clean room " in Dresden .
The Plastic Logic factory , which opened last month , is the world 's first ever commercial scale plastic electronics manufacturing plant .
It may be in Germany , but the company itself was born in Britain .
It was at Cambridge University that scientists pioneered the whole idea of replacing silicon chips with plastic ones .
A few miles down the road from the electronic newspaper factory is something a little more traditional - Dresden 's printing press .
Here paper is king .
The giant presses rattle and whir .
They get through 60 tonnes of paper a day here , churning out 15 copies of the local paper every second .
You might think that in this old fashioned kind of place an electronic paper would be considered a dangerous competitor .
Paper cuts it But printing manager Ralf Oberthuer believes that - even if paper is n't perfect - it 's still far more user - friendly than an electronic upstart .
" The advantage is the feeling of a newspaper , " Ralf says .
" And you can take it everywhere you are going - to breakfast , to the bathroom , to the toilet .
Or if you go to work with you in the train , no problem .
The electronic reader is flexible , and very robust " And if you lose it , it 's also no problem - 50 cents .
But if you lose an electronic newspaper it will be expensive for you . "
The electronic newspaper will only hit the high street next year .
So , for now , I 'll have to continue to wreak havoc on the way to work with all that paper .
But , as Mr Oberthuer made clear , it 's not all bad news with newspapers .
And , sitting on a commuter train , I suddenly realise there 's another good thing you can do with an ordinary newspaper that you could n't do with a flashy electronic one .
Leave it behind for someone else to read .

Politics - Federal Harper Buys Two More Years By Ryan McGreal
Published October 15 , 2008
By winning another minority government , Stephen Harper 's Conservative Party of Canada have bought themselves another two years or so of power against a divided electorate and , quite possibly , a leaderless opposition .
Harper may have missed the best opportunity to win a majority earlier in the summer , but this snap election was still in his party 's interest , if only to pull the plug on Parliamentary investigations into Conservative scandals , get in before the coming recession , and beat next year 's constituency redistribution that will put more seats in urban strongholds .
Many pundits are saying that Harper 's failure to capture a majority represents a clear failure on his part and a rejection of his policies by most Canadians .
There 's plenty of truth to that sentiment , particularly given the weakness and inarticulation of his main opponent , but Harper still managed to achieve his main objective , which was to get the jump on bad news and win a mandate to stay in power a little longer , during which time he can continue to tweak the Canadian government in a more conservative direction : harsher laws , lower corporate taxes , more social wedge issues .
Dion : Unclear Future
At the same time , Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion will come under considerable pressure to step down after a disappointing campaign .
He specifically failed to communicate his Party 's Green Shift carbon tax plan and broadly failed to connect with voters on a personal level .
At the same time , he demonstrated some rapid on - the - job training and made a considerable improvement over the course of the campaign , especially once he began allowing other high profile Liberals into his campaign strategy .
If the Liberals do decide to keep him , it wo n't be the first time a duffer had a chance to mature into a polished , confident , competent leader .
However , if the pressure to replace him becomes irresistable , that will take the Liberals out of the Parliamentary picture for at least a year , during which Harper can continue to govern as if he has a majority .
FPTP Follies
Above all else , resignation seems to have ruled the day , as the new government emerged substantially the same as the old one .
Turnout fell from 65 percent in 2006 to just 59 percent , possibly because many Canadians felt this election to be a pointless waste of time .
Demonstrating the distortionary effects of Canada 's first - past - the - post ( FPTP ) voting system , the Conservatives managed to increase their seat count by 19 , or 12.6 percent , over their 2006 results while increasing their share of the popular vote by only 1.4 percent , to 37.6 percent .
The Liberals , by contrast , dropped 27 seats or 20 percent with only a four percent drop in the popular vote .
The NDP jumped from 29 to 37 seats , or 23.3 percent , with less than one percent increase in the popular vote .
The Green Party increased their popular vote by two and a half percent to just under seven percent , but won no seats .
The Bloc Quebecois increased from 50 seats to 51 , with their share of the popular vote dropping by half a point .

Question :
What 's the difference between dinosaurs and family vacations ?
Answer : Dinosaurs are already extinct .
If there 's one thing Americans need more of , it 's vacation time .
Sure , we 've got the Grossest Domestic Product on the planet .
But American society is no longer healthy for children and other living things .
Consider that in 1980 , people in only 10 other countries lived longer than we do .
Now , people in 41 other countries live longer .
Consider that if you lived in Europe you'd be only a little more than half as likely to suffer from chronic illnesses such as heart disease , hypertension and Type 2 diabetes after age 50 .
And why is that ?
A big reason is time .
Europeans work about 300 fewer hours on average each year than Americans .
Consequently , they have a lot more free time to exercise , eat slowly and healthily , sleep longer and socialize with friends and family .
Each of these does wonders for their health .
This explains a big part of the fact that they only pay a little over half as much as we do for health care .
A big part of the extra free time Europeans enjoy can be attributed to their longer vacations .
At a minimum , every European worker is guaranteed four weeks paid vacation by law ; most get six or more .
By contrast , a new poll of 1,000 Americans , conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation found that 29 percent of American workers took no paid vacation time last year and another 24 percent took a week off or less .
Have you noticed the number of Europeans on the streets of San Francisco this summer ?
Or on the trails in Yosemite ?
It 's not only because they have the time to travel .
They have the money , too .
Their generous paid vacations have n't meant economic ruin .
The euro has been soaring relative to the dollar , and U.S. firms have been investing heavily , and profitably , in Europe , earning - contrary to popular knowledge - far more from Germany than from China .
This is not about slacking or laziness .
Meaningful labor is an essential element in the pursuit of happiness .
But so is free time to enjoy the fruits of that labor .
It 's about balance , really , and in our zeal to out - produce and out - consume everyone else , America has gotten out of balance .
A recent Pew Research Center survey found that more middle - class Americans ( 68 percent ) responded that having free time was a high priority for themselves and their families than any other goal .
By contrast , only 12 percent said becoming wealthy was highly important to them .
If we really want more time , here 's a simple place to start :
Let 's guarantee three weeks of paid vacation to all American workers ( prorated for part - timers ) , a proposal of my nonprofit organization , Take Back Your Time ( see www.right2vacation.org).
One hundred thirty - seven countries in the world have paid vacation laws ; the United States is the only industrial country that does n't .
The new Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 69 percent of Americans would support a law guaranteeing paid vacation time to all workers , with a plurality favoring a time period of three weeks or more .
Other studies show that men who take regular vacations are 32 percent less likely to die of heart attacks than those who do n't .
The Framingham Heart Study found that women who do n't take vacations are up to eight times more likely to suffer from heart disease than women who take two vacation breaks a year .
We 're talking big numbers here - and high costs to our health care system .
Another study showed that women who do n't take vacations are more than twice as likely to suffer from depression as those who do .
It is n't rocket science ; vacations make us healthier .
They also make us more productive .
An Air New Zealand study found that after vacations , workers got an extra hour of quality sleep and their reaction times were 30 - 40 percent faster .
And the gains lasted for months .
This does n't happen with " daycations " - a day off here and there , usually spent running errands .
We need time to unwind .
Getting it can reduce workplace stress and burnout dramatically .
Here 's a scary statistic :
The number of Americans taking family vacations has dropped by a third in the past generation .
Yet experts like University of Minnesota family therapy Professor William Doherty say such vacations are a primary source of bonding , and among the family experiences most likely to be remembered by children .
With less vacation time , children are also more likely to experience " nature - deficit disorder . "
Fewer get out in the woods with their families or spend a night there .
Vacations matter for health , family , the environment and productivity .
Enlightened businesses recognize that .
Many , like Patagonia , offer their employees generous vacation time .
But the majority does not .
An enlightened United States would protect the right of workers to a block of vacation time each year .
Are you taking a vacation this year ?
If not , you just might end up with Irritable Growl Syndrome .
Ever notice that people seem crankier these days ?
Been caught in traffic jams when road rage erupts ?
Slammed down the phone in disgust when an automated answering service cheerfully told you your call would be answered " in approximately 57 minutes " and that if you hung up you 'd lose your place in line ?
Been asked to work overtime one too many times ?
Snarled at your boss when he or she told you it was too bad you 'd prepaid for those airplane tickets but the office could n't get along without you for a week this summer ?
Well , you get the idea .
As another summer comes to a close and fewer of us get the real pause that refreshes , it 's time to vaccinate America against the scourge of Irritable Growl Syndrome .
It 's time to guarantee paid vacations for all Americans and restore balance to our hurried lives .

Ninety - eight percent of all companies in the United States have less than 100 employees .
Twenty - seven million firms fall into the category of small business , and small businesses employ 56 percent of our nation ’s population .
These companies are responsible for over 90 percent of the new jobs , over 90 percent of U.S. exports and over 90 percent of innovation in American business .
Congress realized America ’s small businesses were the heart and soul of our nation ’s economy when they passed the Small Business Act in 1953 .
Our nation is in the midst of one of the most dramatic economic downturns in modern history .
More than ever , America ’s 27 million small businesses need the economic benefits the Small Business Act was designed to provide .
None of this seems to matter to President George W. Bush .
Although President Bush regularly panders to small businesses in his speeches , his policies paint a different picture .
At the same time that President Bush backed the $ 700 billion dollar Wall Street bailout , he continued to dismantle existing federal programs designed to assist American small businesses .
During his two terms , President Bush has systematically dismantled each and every program established under the Small Business
Act to assist American small businesses , especially those firms owned by women , minorities and veterans .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
President Bush ’s anti-small business policies began during his first week as president .
The first thing he did to dismantle America ’s small business programs was to remove the Administrator of the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) from the President ’s Cabinet .
Then he began to cut the SBA ’s budget and staffing more than any other federal agency .
Since 2003 , over a dozen federal investigations have been released , which have all found rampant and government - wide fraud , abuse , loopholes and a blatant lack of proper oversight in federal small business contracting programs .
Several of the investigations found that the Bush Administration has diverted billions of dollars in federal small business contracts to many of the largest corporations in the world .
Current federal law requires that a minimum of 23 percent of the total value of all federal contracts and subcontracts be awarded to small businesses .
However , every year the federal government awards billions of dollars in small business contracts to some of the largest corporations in the U.S. and Europe .
Report 5 - 15 from the SBA Office of Inspector General states , “ One of the most important challenges facing the SBA and the entire Federal Government today is that large businesses are receiving small business procurement awards and agencies are receiving credit for these awards . ”
Several Bush officials have privately acknowledged that at least 50 percent of all federal small business contracts or about $ 70 billion a year actually go to corporate giants .
Based on information obtained in a series of successful Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuits filed against the Bush Administration , the American Small Business League ( ASBL ) estimates legitimate small businesses are being cheated out of over $ 100 billion each year .
Last year , the Bush Administration adopted a policy that will allow Fortune 500 firms to continue to receive government small business contracts until 2012 .
( http://www.asbl.com/showmedia.php?id=592)
Last month , Bush officials began to dismantle one of the government ’s only programs to assist minority - owned firms , the Small Disadvantaged Business contracting program .
Senator McCain has never objected to any of the Bush Administration ’s anti-small business policies .
During more than two years of campaigning , not once has Senator McCain mentioned his intention to restore America ’s small business programs .
If Senator John McCain is elected president , he will likely finish what Bush started and completely dismantle all federal programs designed to assist American small businesses .

As people following our energy situation are aware , many if not most energy stocks are down 60 - 70 % or more from their summer highs .
In a bizarre but not completely surprising announcement after the close ( we knew someone was liquidating ) , Chesapeake , ( the US largest natural gas producer ) CEO Aubrey McClendon has been involuntarily liquidated out of his rougly 30,000,000 remaining shares of CHK in the past 3 days due to margin calls .
CHK , which in July was over $ 70 per share , hit as low as $ 11.99 today , and then had a 38 % rally to close at $ 16.52 on 5 times normal volume .
We do n't typically comment on individual stocks or price movements on TOD but this and related NG stock developments could have a significant impact on the industry 's future - CHK and XTO in addition to being top 2 gas producers also operate over 12 % of our nat gas rigs .
In addition to McClendons margin call , Chesapeake also announced further reductions in capex budgets going forward which means lower natural gas production , and thus higher prices , ceteris paribus .
To make things more complicated , the majority of complicated financial hedges undertaken by CHK , are at Morgan Stanley , which fell to single digits today .
This is all very good news for natural gas prices but bad news for both Aubrey McClendon and the North American energy situation .
Mr. McClendon , who has been recently highlighted in national TV commercials about expanding future of natural gas usage as recently as July held 33,500,000 shares which at one point traded over $ 70 per share .
" I am very disappointed to have been required to sell substantially all of my shares of Chesapeake .
These involuntary and unexpected sales were precipitated by the extraordinary circumstances of the worldwide financial crisis .
In no way do these sales reflect my view of the company ’s financial position or my view of Chesapeake ’s future performance potential .
I have been the company ’s largest individual shareholder for the past three years and frequently purchased additional shares of stock on margin as an expression of my complete confidence in the value of the company ’s strategy and assets .
My confidence in Chesapeake remains undiminished , and I look forward to rebuilding my ownership position in the company in the months and years ahead . ”
This news was on top of an announcement to substantially reduce 2009 and 2010 capital expenditures ( drilling ) .
Many ( all ? ) natural gas companies stocks have been in freefall this week , though in hindsight that was perhaps fast money front running the rumour of margin calls on McClendon .
But concerns about CHK were real , as pointed out in this Bloomberg story
Investors are concerned that Chesapeake and other U.S. oil and gas producers have hedging contracts with financial firms and other counterparties that wo n't be able to pay for their output at the agreed - upon prices because of the global credit crisis , said Robert Goodof , who helps manage $ 25 billion at Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston .
Chesapeake also has so - called knockout swap contracts on more than one - third of its 2009 production , and those deals do n't obligate the buyers to take gas when prices drop to $ 6.28 per thousand cubic feet of the heating and power - plant fuel , according to analyst Joseph Allman of JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York .
U.S. gas futures dropped to $ 6.65 today and have plunged 50 percent since the end of June .
According to Allman , Morgan Stanley is Chesapeake 's biggest counterparty .
Morgan Stanley shares fell 39 percent , dropping for a fifth straight day , after Moody 's Investors Service said it may cut the investment bank 's credit rating .
Allman said that if gas falls to $ 6 per thousand cubic feet , Chesapeake would have to sell $ 3.5 billion of assets .
`` In our view , getting through 2009 is tough , but Chesapeake has a lot of non-producing assets it could sell and discretionary spending it could cut , '' Allman said .
Investors were ostensibly concerned about a natural gas train wreck if Morgan Stanley were to go under , that would cause Chesapeake to follow .
I just can't imagine that happening .
The government might let Chuck E Cheese go under , but not our largest natural gas producer and rig operator .
I was thinking during the day that the financial types that were shorting Chesapeake and other nat gas companies into the ground ( and buying Credit Default Swaps just like they did with Lehman and AIG ) would pat themselves on the back for making good coin , then go home to find no heat , plastic bottles or diapers .
Yet another juxtaposition of money and energy ... But it becoming more clear that hedge fund margin liquidations are contributing to the equity sell - off .
The margin clerks typically are instructed to start liquidating positions at 3 pm if the account has n't come up with margin - all week the volume in the days final hour dwarfed the trading earlier in the day .
This has been a vicious cycle as banks are reducing leverage and increasing margin requirements for clients - more selloff equals more margin calls equals more selloff .
Personally , I think its worse ' this time ' because of the number and size of hedge funds , which became more popular after outperforming the bear market of 2000 - 2003 .
But I think we 've seen ' peak hedge fund ' .
Finally , as discussed 2 weeks ago after the first cap - ex cut by Chesapeake , the marginal cost of natural gas is over $ 8 per MCF , and the average cost being close to $ 6 in North America .
Natural gas is on average getting more expensive to procure .
Now that capital is less available , we are going to see more and more production cuts .
We need to analyze what it really means - 5 % drop ?
15 % drop ?
Aubrey McClendon has been seen on TV advocating the Pickens Plan to use natural gas as a vehicle fuel .
I wonder if recent events will change the landscape of our natural gas industry and this plan .
At prices during mid-day today , I was wondering if ExxonMobils $ 40 billion in cash ( less $ 10 billion in debt they could just assume ) might be put to work .
The landscape has seemingly changed daily .
I think even people who have never had an ecology class or never heard of theoildrum understand , or at least have an inkling , that natural gas and oil are more precious than dollar bills .
Is it too early for nationalization of the energy industry ?
Here are some previous TOD posts discussing the natural gas situation in North America , and although we have ' more ' gas recently , it comes at higher costs :

( EDIT : It seems that the contagion spread to CHKs financial twin , XTO , where it was just announced that their Chairman has been selling stock :
XTO Energy Inc. ( NYSE : XTO - News ) announced today that during the past week Chairman and CEO Bob R. Simpson sold 2.8 million shares of XTO common stock .
This sale satisfied all considerations for debt , personal interests and family liquidity .
As a Company founder , Mr. Simpson continues to own 6.8 million shares of XTO and has options to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares .
Of equal concern is that CHK operates 130 rigs , and XTO 70 , which is fully 1/8 of rigs drilling for natural gas .
( 1600 )
And a bigger question is : WHAT ARE THESE VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE DOING BUYING THEIR OWN STOCK ON MARGIN ?
Having worked for a decade on Wall St , I know the answer to that , and the mechanisms underlying this behaviour are why I see our current situation as unsustainable , even if we were to find more gas and oil .
The dopamine feedback loop for more , culturally defined , is nearly unstoppable .

STONY MOUNTAIN , MAN .
–A 15 - year - old boy died in a horrific construction accident yesterday when he was buried under a mountain of searing - hot asphalt .
The boy , too young to work on construction jobs under Manitoba labour laws , was part of a paving crew working on a parking lot in the Winnipeg bedroom community of Stony Mountain .
" I believe ( the truck ) dumped off way too much asphalt unexpectedly , " said Stony Mountain fire Chief Wallace Drysdale .
" I was one of the first members on scene and we just saw the hair sticking out of this individual .
It was extremely hot asphalt .
Our crews , when we were digging out , had to shuttle different members in and out in about four - or five - minute intervals because our feet were burning . "
Police and labour officials were investigating .
Richard Hill , who lives less than 100 metres from the accident scene , heard screaming and ran over .
" I guess it was the truck driver that said , ` There 's a guy buried in here ' and I ... found a shovel , and me and another guy tried digging him out , " Hill said .
It took about 15 minutes to get the teen out .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
" We got to the back of his head and there was no movement , " Hill said .
" We pretty much knew there would n't be any hope because of the heat and the weight of that ( asphalt ) .
There 's no way a person can breathe with asphalt . "
RCMP said they had identified the boy but were not releasing his name immediately at the request of his family .
Manitoba workplace health and safety officials were trying to figure out how the accident occurred and would not comment .
Having teenagers work at such jobs is not uncommon , according to Drysdale .
" It 's usually a good summer job for them . "
However , Manitoba 's Employment Standards
Code bars people younger than 16 from working on construction sites , as well as other industrial locations where there are drilling rigs and scaffolding .
The RCMP did n't say whether charges would be laid .
The death has touched everyone in Stony Mountain , Drysdale said .
" Our ( fire department ) members knew this person , ' cause it 's a small town , " he said .
" It 's very hard . "
Hill said there were a lot of stories floating around the community as to how the asphalt got dumped on the teen .
" One rumour I heard is that asphalt sticks in the box ( of a truck ) , and I guess he banged it and the whole load came down on him , " Hill said .

Lightweight Metal Foam Makes Autos Safer
November 9th , 2008 by Susan Kraemer
Almost half a million dollars invested by the National Science Foundation over the last 5 years has just yielded a space age material so light and strong that it makes a 28 mile per hour crash feel like a gentle fender blip at 5 mph .
Afsaneh Rabiei has invented a metal foam with such a high strength - to - density ratio that it could revolutionize the auto industry .
She says it is n’t the first metal foam , but hers has tested out as the strongest , partly because it utilizes a metallic matrix to support the cell walls .
Existing metal foams have varying sized cells — tiny pockets of space inside the material .
Instead Rabiei made the cells of standard sizes .
That ( and the metallic matrix ) help the foam absorb energy much better than current metal foams .
“ This material showed a much higher strength - to - density ratio than any metal foam that has ever been reported , ” said Rabiei , associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University , and the recipient of $ 452,250 in funding for this purpose since 2003 from the National Science Foundation .
She wanted to use her funding to develop a light , strong material needed to improve safety and fuel economy in the automotive , aerospace and other industries .
It looks like she succeeded .
The National Science Foundation has picked another winner .
Who says government should n’t try to pick winners and losers .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens vowed to fight his Monday conviction on federal corruption charges , a verdict he attributed to " repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct . "
Sen .
Ted Stevens leaves federal court Monday as the jury deliberated in his corruption trial .
" I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have , " the 84 - year - old Stevens , the Senate 's longest - serving Republican , said in a written statement after the jury came back Monday afternoon .
" I am innocent . "
Stevens was convicted of seven counts of making false statements on Senate ethics forms to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and work on his Alaska home from an oilfield contractor at the center of a corruption investigation in the state .
" This verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the Justice Department lawyers conducted this trial , " he said .
Watch how the trial unfolded »
The senator 's lawyers twice sought to have the charges thrown out during the month - long trial , accusing prosecutors of hiding evidence favorable to the defense .
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan rejected those efforts , but blasted prosecutors for " hiding the ball . "
" I ask that Alaskans and my Senate colleagues stand with me as I pursue my rights , " Stevens said .
He vowed to get the trial 's results overturned and added , " I remain a candidate for the United States Senate . "
Watch Alaskans sound off on Stevens »
The verdict came days before he is to face voters in a neck - and - neck re-election bid against his Democratic challenger , Mark Begich .
Stevens hopes to retain the seat he has held since 1968 .
A poll by Ivan Moore Research conducted October 17 - 19 found Begich slightly leading the race 46 - 45 , within the poll 's margin of error of plus - or - minus 4.4 percentage points .
The longest - serving Republican senator in history , Stevens becomes the first senator to be convicted of a felony since 1981 .
Stevens faces a maximum sentence of up to to 35 years in prison -- five years for each of the seven counts Watch CNN 's Kelli Arena explain the verdict »
Legal experts note the judge has the discretion to give Stevens as little as no jail time and probation when he is sentenced .
He sat expressionless as the seven verdicts were read out at the end of his trial , less than a day after the jury began deliberations from scratch because of a change in jurors .
After the second guilty verdict was read , Stevens ' lead defense attorney , Brendan Sullivan , patted his back , leaving his hand there .
As Stevens left the defense area , he and his wife exchanged a kiss on the cheek .
Stevens said : " It 's not over yet . "
Stevens ' defense team said they will move for a new trial .
" This is a sad day for Alaska and a sad day for Sen .
Stevens and his family , " Alaska Gov. and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said after the verdict .
" The verdict shines a light on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company up there in Alaska that was allowed to control too much of our state .
And that control was part of the culture of corruption that I was elected to fight , and that fight must always move forward regardless of party affiliation or seniority or even past service , " she said .
Stevens accepted " hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies " from a major oil services company in his state , acting assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said after the verdict .
" This company was not a charity , " he said , saying it solicited Stevens for help in Washington at the same time it was transforming Stevens ' single - story A - frame Alaska house into a two - story structure with a deck , new gas grill and other accouterments .
Judge Emmet Sullivan has scheduled a hearing on any pending motions for February 25 .
The charges against Stevens related to renovations on his family home in Girdwood , Alaska .
The remodeling was done by his longtime friend , Bill Allen , and Allen 's oil industry services company , VECO Corp .
The prosecution accused Stevens of knowingly failing to declare hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and work on his house in Alaska between 1999 and 2006 .
Members of the Senate are required to fill out forms each year stating what gifts they have received and from whom .
Watch the prosecutor talks about ' freebies ' given to Sen.
Stevens . »
Stevens ' defense said Allen , the senator 's friend , had quashed bills without the senator 's knowledge .
Allen testified that he had done so because he " liked Ted . "
The defense said Stevens had paid the bills he received , thinking they covered the full cost of renovating the house in Girdwood , Alaska .
Allen , the government 's star witness , earlier pleaded guilty to trying to bribe a number of Alaska state lawmakers , not including Stevens .
He is awaiting sentencing .
The jury began deliberations at noon Wednesday , but started anew Monday morning when an alternate replaced a juror who left town abruptly last week because of the death of her father .
The verdict comes after jurors spotted a discrepancy Monday between the government 's indictment and a key piece of evidence .
The judge declined to throw out the related charge against Stevens
The indictment accuses Stevens of checking " No " in response to a question about whether Stevens or his family had " any reportable gift ... more than $ 260 " in 2001 .
But the form introduced as evidence in court shows he checked " Yes . "
The jury sent out a note on the issue , prompting a debate between defense and prosecution attorneys about what instructions Sullivan should send the jury .
Prosecutors said the error was simply a " typo " on the indictment , and that other charges and evidence covered Steven 's alleged failure to disclose the home renovations at issue in the case .
Stevens ' defense said the judge should toss out the count that no longer matched the evidence .
The juror who left last week was Juror No. 4 , a paralegal in her 40s .
She told a U.S. marshal that she had to leave the state for a family emergency after the jury was dismissed Thursday .
Judge Sullivan dismissed the jury Friday morning after the woman left for California , hoping to resume with her on the panel as soon as possible .
Since then , court officials made several unsuccessful attempts to reach the woman .
Defense attorneys for Stevens , who was in court Sunday , had asked the judge to put off deliberations another day as they awaited the return of the juror , arguing against inserting an alternate in the middle of the process .
Last week , the judge dealt with another juror issue after the panel sent him a note Thursday accusing juror No. 9 of " violent outbursts " and other misconduct .
They asked that she be dismissed , but Sullivan gave what he called a " pep talk " to the 12 and told them to resume their deliberations .
CNN 's Paul Courson , Carol Cratty and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .
All About Ted Stevens • Alaska
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Mayor Michael Bloomberg won the right to seek re-election as New York ’s City Council voted on Thursday to extend the two - term limit for elected officials as the city grapples with the global financial crisis .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg attends a meeting with Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit in Berlin , October 5 , 2008 .

Bloomberg , a former Wall Street trader and self - made billionaire who was elected in 2001 and in 2005 , wants to run again on grounds that his financial experience will be valuable in guiding the city through lean fiscal times ahead .
The 51 - member council voted 29 - 22 to approve the measure .
About two - thirds of the council would have been forced out of office under the two - term limit , but they can now run for a third term in the November 2009 election .
Bloomberg welcomed the decision as the “ the right choice . ”
“ Those of us who work on both sides of City Hall must now move forward with the important decisions that face us , particularly finding ways to soften the fallout from the economic downturn and balancing our budget as revenues decline , ” Bloomberg said in a statement .
“ We have a lot of work to do together to get New York through these tough times , ” said Bloomberg , a longtime Democrat who was elected mayor as a Republican but is now an independent .
In 1993 and 1996 , New Yorkers voted to limit the mayor and other city officials to two four - year terms .
A Quinnipiac University poll on Tuesday found 89 percent of voters say a referendum , not a council vote , should decide the issue .
Council Speaker Christine Quinn told the council that New Yorkers could express any disagreement with the council ’s decision at next year ’s election by not voting for Bloomberg or other members seeking a third term .
“ In a time like this what you need is New Yorkers to have the opportunity to have consistent leadership , ” she said .
LEGAL CHALLENGE
A court challenge by two council members -- represented by Randy Mastro , who served as deputy mayor under Bloomberg ’s predecessor , Rudy Giuliani -- failed on Wednesday to stop the vote .
Bloomberg and Quinn rejected holding a referendum on the issue and an amendment proposed on Thursday calling for a referendum was not passed by the council .
Ten New York taxpayers immediately sued the council , Bloomberg and individual council members in Manhattan federal court , saying their civil right to vote in a referendum on the issue was violated by the council ’s action on term limits .
Several council members also pledged to challenge the term limit extension in court .
Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner has pledged to run against Bloomberg in the 2009 election and said the term limit extension was “ a sad day for New York ’s democracy . ”
“ Everyone can see that this is a back - room , insider deal that takes away New Yorkers ’ right to vote .
I do n’t believe it will be forgotten , ” Weiner told reporters after the vote .
Comptroller Bill Thompson , also a candidate for mayor in 2009 , called the vote “ an affront to New Yorkers . ”
“ I am saddened that our mayor and majority of city council members have put individuals before principles .
Today our government chose to empower itself rather than the people it serves , ” he said in a statement .
Giuliani sought to stay on as mayor when his second term was ending in 2001 after the September 11 attacks .
But his proposal proved unpopular and he backed down .

The Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to vote on a measure that would free up unused TV airwaves , known as " white space , " for wireless Internet and other uses .
You 've heard of Wi-Fi , WiMax and 3G wireless technologies .
Add another ( oddly named ) wireless creation to the list : white space .
White space is industry lingo for the unused airwaves that abut TV spectrum and provide a buffer from stray signals and other interference .
On Tuesday , the Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to vote on a measure that would make white space available for wireless broadband .
Under the proposal , these airwaves would be treated like Wi -Fi — unlicensed and free to everybody .
" It will be like the Wi -Fi you get at Starbucks , only a lot better , " says FCC Chairman Kevin Martin , who first proposed the idea four years ago .
The FCC 's goal : to serve the expanding broadband needs of U.S. consumers .
" We are trying to make sure we 're using this spectrum in the most efficient way possible , " Martin says .
The amount of white space varies , but in some markets there 's the equivalent of six TV channels .
Allowing that spectrum to lie dormant , as it has for 50 years , is n't helpful to consumers , the FCC chief says .
Broadcasters are howling .
They say white - space devices — which do n't yet exist — might interfere with TV signals .
That view is shared by Broadway theater owners , sports leagues and others that use electronic microphones , which use the same airwaves .
Bruce Mehlman , executive director of the Technology CEO Council , which represents tech giants such as IBM and Intel , has another theory : " ( Broadcasters ) were mentally reserving the right to use the spectrum for their own profit , " he says .
Not so , says Dennis Wharton at the National Association of Broadcasters .
" We 're concerned about interference . "
NAB has asked the FCC to delay its vote for two months so it can review the FCC 's latest engineering report , released two weeks ago .
" What 's the rush ? " Wharton says .
One thing everybody agrees on : White - space airwaves are awesome .
Signals in the spectrum can penetrate walls , making it ideal for wireless broadband .
When the FCC offered a licensed chunk of the spectrum earlier this year , wireless carriers pounced , paying a record $ 20 billion .
Martin says the FCC is keen to concerns laid out in more than 25,000 comments submitted over the past four years .
White - space devices would n't be allowed to operate near TV broadcasters in major markets .
Others could petition the FCC for similar " safe zone " treatment .
Other safeguards are in place , he says .
" I do n't think the commission should ever be so afraid of something that could happen , in the negative , that we do n't move forward with something that has significant consumer benefit , " he says .

The lavish Diamond Club at the Emirates Stadium , where season tickets cost £ 25,000 , is an incongruous venue in which to extol the virtues of prudence in football finance .
Arsenal chairman Peter Hill - Wood believes that his club can succeed without having to sell the family jewels to the mega-rich .
He is adamant that his club will resist the current trend for overseas benefactors .
They have no intention of presenting board member Stan Kroenke , worth an estimated $ 2bn ( £ 1.1 bn ) , with a begging bowl , nor do they welcome any extra involvement from their oligarch shareholder Alisher Usmanov , whose wealth exceeds $ 5 bn ( £ 2.7bn ) .
' If you are expecting some sort of sugar daddy to top up the coffers every time you overspend , that leads you into having a business that is unsustainable .
I do n't think that would be our way of doing things at all , ' Hill - Wood says .
' The guy could easily get bored or decide to buy another yacht or go into horse racing .
It makes you pretty slack in how you run the business and it deludes everybody . '
Such sentiment is the polar opposite of the noises currently coming from Manchester 's nouveau riche , who boast the kind of deep pockets Hill - Wood accepts has changed the modern game .
' Regarding Manchester City and the Arabs buying it , we obviously can't compete with the money they are spending so there is no point trying , ' he admits .
' We 've got to succeed some other way .
We bore people silly saying we 've got to have a business plan that is sustainable .
We want the club to be thriving in 50 years ' time , not just this year . '
Tellingly , the club generate two - thirds more income at the Emirates than they did at Highbury .
He insists Arsenal are on a sound enough financial footing to swat aside any unwelcome bids for players , with Cesc Fábregas being the obvious target .
' I do n't think for us to sell our best players for any figure makes commercial sense , ' Hill - Wood explains .
' If someone paid us £ 100 million , you pay 40 per cent tax on the damn thing and what the hell are we going to do with the extra £ 60 million ?
I 'd rather have a couple of good players .
We will resist any overtures made for our star players . '
In order to do so , Arsenal clearly have to pay competitive wages .
Last week 's financial results put the club 's salary costs at more than £ 100 m .
That figure includes improved contracts for the young players they need to keep happy and a new deal for Arsène Wenger .
Surprisingly , that total is similar to the wage bill at Manchester United .
' Wages are a continual problem , ' Hill - Wood concedes .
' There is a story that we do n't pay as much as a lot of other people .
If you look at the figures , that is n't quite true .
' Chelsea have a bigger wage bill than us , but Manchester United and us are on a par .
We do n't like to go completely potty , but we are not mean either . '
United have two sizeable trophies to show for their outlay , but Hill - Wood is not convinced the champions are in the best financial shape .
' They have bigger debt repayments than we have and pay a pretty hefty interest rate , which we do n't , ' he argues .
' I am sure the Glazers are not in a position to pump a lot more money into United .
Anyway , they have taken it out rather than put it in as far as I can gather . '
Arsenal are so focused on sustainability their budgets are based on attendances of 50,000 - around 10,000 fewer than the regular gates - and on forecasts of only qualifying for the Champions League every four years .
They owe it to Wenger that it has not come to that yet .
And if he wants funds to strengthen the team in January , Hill - Wood promises they are available .
( The Frisky ) -- Despite what that old chestnut love story will have you believe , love does n't mean never having to say you 're sorry .
Few occasions warrant an e-card .
Screwing up and begging forgiveness is not one of them .
In fact , one of the most important components of any relationship is the ability to suck it up and apologize every now and again .
It 's hardly brain surgery , but who among us has n't been the recipient of an apology that wound up making you feel even worse than the original transgression ?
For something that 's basically a no - brainer , there 's a bevy of ways to get it very , very wrong .
In fact , the late Randy Pausch 's bestseller , " The Last Lecture , " has an entire chapter called " A bad apology is worse than no apology . "
Now granted , men are definitely more prone to the botched apology ( see John Edwards , Bill Clinton , etcetera ) , but we ladies have also been known to blow an act of contrition on occasion .
Here are some apology strategies to avoid :
1 . The blame shifter
Witness the number one worst way to say sorry of all time : " I 'm sorry you feel that way . "
Interesting game plan -- blaming the person you 're ostensibly making amends to for getting rightfully pissed off at your horrendous behavior .
If you 're not sorry for your actions , do n't apologize .
If you are genuinely repentant , take off the training bra , squeeze 'em into the underwire , and take responsibility like a woman .
2. Lady liquor made me do it
So you had a little too much to drink at a friend 's birthday party and ended up making out in the bathroom with the bartender .
When your boyfriend finds out , it 's probably best to just own up to the mistake rather than say , " But I was drunk ! "
Those five shots of tequila only gave you the courage to do something stupid and regretful , it did n't actually do it for you .
3 . It 's all in the genes
What I would n't pay to be a fly on the wall the first time some cheater tries to use the new study showing that some men have a genetic predisposition towards non-monogamy .
Sorry ladies , so far there 's no equivalent study for us female types , so do n't even think about it .
4. Forcing forgiveness
" You have to forgive me -- you must ! "
Demanding absolution is possibly more annoying than your original sin .
This is a lose / lose .
5 . The big but
An acquaintance 's wife apologized for sleeping with a coworker with the caveat , " But he came onto me ! "
So obviously she had no choice but to cozy up .
Oh , please .
Inserting the word " but " into any apology immediately negates it .
6 . The sympathy bid
A boyfriend once " apologized " for standing me up by ruefully rambling on about how his tragic childhood left him ill - equipped to deal with obligations .
What this had to do with blowing off dinner still eludes me .
You 're supposed to be making a plea for forgiveness , not hosting a pity party for one .
7. e-Sorry
There are very few occasions that warrant an e-card .
Screwing up and subsequently begging forgiveness via an animated teddy bear and a terrible jingle is definitely not one of them .
8. Skirting the issue
" I 'm sorry I hurt your feelings , " is not the same as " I 'm sorry I cheated on you with your best friend , in your bed , while you were at your uncle 's funeral . "
Though either way you phrase it , I would n't hold my breath waiting for forgiveness on that one .

This essay is about future derivatives problems .
But before we look to the future , let ’s recap what happened yesterday , to gain some perspective .
Post - Game Analysis on Lehman
As the Washington Post writes today about yesterday ’s auction of some $ 400 billion dollars in credit default swaps for Lehman :
‘ If we see defaults from the standpoint that protection sellers do n’t pay up , then we ’re going to have a huge problem in the market , ’ Telpner said .
‘ But we do n’t have any explicit evidence indicating that sellers ultimately are not going to be able to pay the amounts owed to buyers . ’
And the Sunday Times writes today :
“ The valuation leaves the insurers of the debt a bill of about $ 365 billion .
It is not clear whether the insurers , which are required to settle the bill in the next two weeks , will be able to pay – a development that could further undermine increasingly stressed capital markets . ”
Will the insurers ” of Lehman ’s CDS be able to pay up ?
The big bank insurers to the Lehman swaps have been hoarding cash , and so can presumably pay .
The bigger question is whether the hedge funds – such as Citadel – will be able to pay up or will go belly up .
The next couple of weeks will tell .
But even if no companies are wiped out by their Lehman CDS obligations , it is clear that yesterday was , indeed , a traumatic day for the world economy .
As today ’s Sunday Times article put it :
“ Lehman ’s corporate debt default promises to increase the stress across global credit markets .
Sean Egan , of the Egan - Jones ratings agency , said : ‘ This is a killer .
Lehman said a month ago that it was in terrific shape and now you ca n’t even get ten cents on the dollar for its debt .
‘ It underscores the deep structural flaws in our financial system , knocks confidence in the financial markets and raises the cost of capital .
It also demonstrates that we are experiencing not only a crisis of confidence , but a crisis . ' ”
Next Up : Automakers
The next phase of the derivatives wipeout will hit insurance companies and auto makers .
Initially , Standard and Poor ’s is saying that GM and Ford may very well go bankrupt .
As of 2004 , “ GM was among the five companies most frequently included in credit - derivatives contracts in 2004 , along with Ford Motor Co. , France Telecom SA , DaimlerChrysler AG and Deutsche Telekom AG , Fitch said .
Investors bought more contracts protecting payments from Korea , Italy and Russia than any other governments . ”
Indeed , according to Fitch ’s , as of 2004 and 2005 , there were perhaps billions of dollars in GM credit default swaps traded per day .
Fitch ’s noted that “ GM CDS are the second most included named in synthetic collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , behind Ford , as disclosed in several Fitch analyses of the CDS market . ”
On October 3rd , Bloomberg wrote :
General Motors Corp. saw its credit default swaps rise to a record after the automaker said Sept. 19 it was going to draw down the remainder of a $ 4.5 billion revolving credit line to preserve cash because of the instability in the financial markets .
Detroit - based GM , the largest U.S. carmaker , has lost almost $ 70 billion since 2004 .
As of June of this year , “ The cost to insure GM ’s debt with credit default swaps rose to 33.5 percent upfront . . . plus annual payments of 500 basis points ” and “ Ford saw its credit default swap spread increased to 30.5 percent upfront , plus 500 basis points annually “ .
According to financial advisor Mike “ Mish ” Shedlock , there are appromixately one trillion dollars of credit default swaps for GM .
If GM went bust , there would be huge credit default swap liability .
While I have seen no estimates of the current amount of Ford CDS , it is probably also quite high , given that it was one of the most common CDS issued in 2004 .
Insurance
The insurance companies are also getting hit hard by CDS .
The October 3rd Bloomberg article goes on to state :
“ The cost to protect against default by Hartford , Prudential Financial Inc. and MetLife Inc. soared to records and shares fell yesterday on speculation that turmoil in financial markets may be spreading to insurance companies . ”
As an article at Naked Capitalism explains :
First it was banks and securities firms , and now the focus of worry has widened to include insurance companies .
Reader John referred us to a Reuters article that MetLife credit default swaps are now trading on an upfront basis , which means buyers of protection against the default of MetLife bonds must make an upfront payment as well as agreeing to periodic fees .
Only companies seen as being in serious risk of failure trade on an upfront basis .
Another story shows similar pricing of XL Capital CDS .

So my wife is on her third round of antibiotics and her first batch of steroids for what the doctors believe is a sinus infection migrated south to retire permanently in her lungs as bronchitis .
My son has awakened us every night for the past two weeks complaining of a recurring nightmare involving a bad man with a tail who lives in a lamp .
I have a rash that I do n't want to talk about , and my dog has had a recurrence of something that requires its own special canine dermatologist .
So something 's up .
Because besides the bee death cult and the devil dreams and the wife 's death rattle chest , there 's also now the flood .
In my previous post I believe I mentioned the possibilities for floods ?
Sometime last week , possibly on Thanksgiving but who really cares , a very small pinhole leak developed in a hot water pipe in my attic .
An attic , that , due to a condition I possess which I can only define as " ladder - impairedness , " is hardly a place that I frequent .
It 's dark up there , lots of air - conditioning ducting , a creaky wood beam floor , and most likely very large furry jumping spiders from Brazil .
This leak , tiny as tiny can be , sprayed hot water continually for days and days , drenching the creaky wood floor of my attic until such wood could no longer contain all of the water and passed it along to various portions of my house .
The ceiling of my office .
The wall behind a built - in bookcase .
A large wall along a staircase .
The ceiling in my kitchen .
And the wall of my basement .
It was a very ambitious little leak , an uptight little overachieving leak , the kind of leak you want to beat the shit out of in high school .
One that did its dirty work under the cover of darkness until paint started bubbling off my walls and small , amber colored drops of water started landing in my King Vitamin cereal at breakfast .
So for two days now my house has been the L.A. equivalent of the Amish barn - raising scene in Witness except you take out Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis and replace them with my handyman George and four other dudes who , every time you walk by them , smile and shake their heads and say : " Mucho trabajo . "
Which I understand now is Spanish for " Is n't this black mold ?
" It 's enough to make a man pine for the Hochleitners .
Plastic hangs over my doorways like a Dexter death room and rolls of butcher paper have been spread all over my floors with such enthusiasm that I am beginning to feel like a pork loin .
One wall was dried out and plastered over and six hours later that wall had turned an ugly shade of brown -- suggesting that it was not actually dried out in the first place or I am living in Fucking Amityville .
In my previous post I rolled these bones and saw signs of the labor apocalypse .
And given the AMPTP 's recent " New Economic Partnership " proposal it 's certainly possible that the latest pox on my house is simply an anaphylactic shock brought on by the Big Media Beast as it slouches towards the Ivy to eat crab cakes and Rickey 's Fried Chicken .
However .
As devoted father and loving husband it is my DUTY to explore alternate explanations for whatever dark materials have found their way to my family and my hearth .
So .
If we are to eliminate : a ) nature and all naturally occurring sourcesb ) the Old testament and related religious explanationsc ) coincidenced ) the possibility that I am a delusional paranoid hypochondriac who is so fucked up that his family , pets , and house suffer from Munchausen 's by Proxy -- We are left with only one option : Joss Whedon is very upset with me for casting Summer Glau and has somehow invoked a powerful curse and relocated the Buffy Hellmouth underneath my home .
I saw how the Hellmouth operated for many years , I know its signs and symbols .
And while there may not be any vampires yet to slay , I swear to God I saw Alyson Hannigan tongue - kissing a werebear in my laundry room when I was washing my strike shirt .
What kills me is I saw Joss two weeks ago at the Showrunner March .
We talked about Summer .
I did n't sense anything weird .
Looking back I do remember seeing Shawn Ryan and the dude from the 4400 both give packages to Joss that at the time I assumed were Mrs. Beasley 's muffin baskets but now I clearly believe were animal sacrifices .
( At another point during the march I saw Joss and Ron Moore huddled together but when I tried to eavesdrop on what they were saying I got this hot burning sensation in my ears and I may have blacked out and peed for a second .
)
So because I think there is no other choice and also because I 'm on strike with a lot of time on my hands I decide to make a donation to the Church of Joss .
I buy the Firefly boxed set ( 24 cents to Joss ) ; I watched Serenity on cable ( maybe .5 cents to Joss ) , I already own and have watched the entire Buffy series on DVD ( 75 cents to Joss ) .
I have spent DAYS OF MY LIFE devoted to the works of Joss Whedon and I 'm pretty sure I have n't even sent A WHOLE DOLLAR OF RESIDUALS in his direction .
Which is obviously not enough of a sacrifice to break the curse .
So I 'll offer up one of the most humiliating moments for me as a professional writer :
Some years ago I am invited to a dinner party for screenwriters .
There 's about fifty of us there -- including most of the A list people I had always wanted to call my peers .
At the time the only credit I had was a shared story on Chain Reaction but I knew a couple of the people throwing the dinner and so I was invited .
Terrified , but invited .
At some point I am introduced to a writer / director whose work I had admired for years .
He was a little older , kind of a legend .
Here 's how the conversation went :
ME : God , I can't tell you how great it is to meet you .
I love your work .
Especially ( BIG MOVIE ) .
LEGEND : No. the pleasure is mine .
I 'm such a huge fan of your writing .
ME : Really ?
LEGEND : Of course .
It 's fantastic .
My kids absolutely love Buffy .
Just love it .
ME : Uhmmm .... LEGEND : They 're gonna be so impressed I met you .
They 're always going on about you ... ME : Uh , Mr. Legend ?
As much as I want to be Joss Whedon right now ... I 'm not .
I'm Josh Friedman .
LEGEND : Josh Friedman ?
ME : Josh Friedman .LEGEND : Hm. Oh .
Well , I 'm sure you 're a good writer , too .
And then he walked away .
So please , Joss .
Do my family a favor .
Take Back the Hellmouth .
I know it 's fucking huge and you might not have room for it at your place .
Maybe you could donate it .
Maybe we could include it in the New Economic Partnership .
Just a thought .

“ Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ?
The answer is no .
That ’s not America .
Is there something wrong with a seven - year - old Muslim - American kid believing he or she could be president ?
Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion that he is a Muslim and might have an association with terrorists .
This is not the way we should be doing it in America .
I feel strongly about this particular point because of a picture I saw in a magazine .
It was a photo essay about troops who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And one picture at the tail end of this photo essay was of a mother in Arlington Cemetery , and she had her head on the headstone of her son ’s grave .
And as the picture focused in , you could see the writing on the headstone .
And it gave his awards — Purple Heart , Bronze Star — showed that he died in Iraq , gave his date of birth , date of death .
He was 20 years old .
And then , at the very top of the headstone , it did n’t have a Christian cross ; it did n’t have the Star of David ; it had crescent and a star of the Islamic faith .
And his name was Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan , and he was an American .
He was born in New Jersey .
He was 14 years old at the time of 9/11 , and he waited until he can go serve his country , and he gave his life . ” — Colin Powell today during his endorsement of Democratic Senator Barack Obama for President

PCC streetcars were manufactured from 1936 to 1952 , and ultimately almost 5000 were built .
San Francisco operated a fleet purchased during the 1940s , but four decades later , the cars were worn and tired , and they looked ridiculous when painted in Muni 's Disco - era " rainbow " livery .
By 1982 , Muni had acquired a modern fleet of " Light Rail Vehicles " from Boeing , the last of San Francisco 's PCCs was finally removed from service , and a few of the old streetcars were sold off to the highest bidder .
The unusual name comes from the fact that the car was designed by a committee , formed in 1929 , representing various electric street railways .
The Electric Railway Presidents ' Conference Committee , or ERPCC , was tasked with producing a new type of streetcar that would help fend off competition from automobiles .
The committee produced a high - performance design that was commonly used in the following decades .
The cars were popular because of their distinctive streamlined design and smooth acceleration .
How did these streetcars end up so far from home ?
The story turns out to be an only - in - California mixture of romantic fantasy and radical idealism , and it begins during the early 1980s , when Muni , San Francisco 's public transit agency , decided to retire the last of it's streamlined " Presidents ' Conference Committee " streetcars .
If you happen to be driving east along Highway 50 in the Sierra Nevada Mountains , keep an eye out as you approach the town of South Lake Tahoe .
Look carefully to your left a few yards before the entrance to the local airport and you may catch a glimpse of an improbable sight : a faded fleet of decomissioned San Francisco streetcars resting in the high alpine snowdrifts almost 200 miles from the city where they once carried passengers .
Telstar Logistics has not interviewed Mr. Henrioulle , but one former Sacramento transit worker calls him as " a railfan who has had a dream of starting a solar powered streetcar line in Lake Tahoe for many years . "
Our source says Mr. Henrioulle acquired about 20 cars from Muni when they came out of service in late 1982 , and he described Mr. Henrioulle as being " a few fries short of a Happy Meal . "
( We think this was meant as a compliment .
Sort of . )
A review of some of Mr. Henrioulle recent writings suggests that he is a lifelong train enthusiast , devoted public transit advocate , Peak Oil neo-millenialist , and occasional candidate for local political office .
He uses all - caps for emphasis in some sentences , such as when he asserts that " railways in the US are of IMMENSE INTRINSIC VALUE . "
His mini-autobiography reads as follows :
My hands on steam engine credentials are limited to some work with Hal Wilmunder 's Antelope & Western in 1960 .
On a dare , I stole a ride on SP 4460 from Palo Alto to 3rd & Townsend in July 1957 .
Only cab ride on big steam at speed .
Got in trouble ... After that I was with CalDWR - Water Resources .
Then Aviation Maintenance , Pupil Transportation , and some railway experience , passed the Railway Rules Test ( GCOR ) and am presently working on rail transportation planning issues on the US50 Corridor between Sacramento , CA and Reno NV .
Please see " Tahoe Valley Lines Mission Statement " in MASS TRANSIT MAGAZINE , 11 - 04 , P.70 . ( Cygnus Publications ) .
Former member High Speed Rail Association , American Public Transit Association .
There 's an official - looking sign on the fence of Mr. Henrioulle 's alpine streetcar salvage yard that depicts the logo for a transportation company called Tahoe Valley Lines .
In 2004 , Mr. Henrioulle wrote a desciption of his plans for the proposed railway :
In South Lake Tahoe , Ca. , TAHOE VALLEY LINES is proposing to use a dozen rehabbed electric PCC Trolley Cars , circa 1945 , to form the basis of a sustainable energy ( solar & Hydro ) public transit system .
The track route would link the Airport ( TVL ) users , such as Virgin Atlantic ( one possible airline ) with resorts at Stateline , NV. , and waterborne service on big blue Lake Tahoe .
The system route would be engineered to be part of a future electric railway along the American River corridor from Sacramento / Placerville , which would run on to Carson Valley & Reno , NV .
The railway would junction near Strawberry Lodge , with the Lake Tahoe Line running thru a five - mile tunnel to the Tahoe Valley floor , with the main passenger / freight route using a 15 + mile bore to access the Carson Valley near Genoa , NV .
This is compatible with existing demographics , not to mention projected growth .
The intercity railway will gain momentum with the inexorable constricting of surface transport with the onset of peaking oil , and the necessity to move more freight trans - Sierra via rail , as well as the growth in passenger numbers .
The existing Sierra rail crossings will be inadequate to meet the growth in traffic , and are slow running as well .
The 1869 & 1909 rail line capacity will be severely strained as the effects of oil depletion take hold , and shall prove inadequate ; hence the US50 / American River ( HydroPower at hand ) rail crossing is requisite .
This brings us more or less to the present day .
While the exact status of Mr. Henrioulle 's plan remains unknown , we assume it remains little changed and perpetually ongoing .
To increase liquidity , he recently sold four PCC cars back to San Francisco for use on the city 's restored F Market line , while San Diego acquired two in January 2006 .
The rest of the cars are still in the yard , and one of them , former San Francisco Muni streetcar No. 1127 , can be photographed without trespassing significantly upon Mr. Henrioulle 's property .
Here 's No. 1127 as it looked in 1970 :
Here 's how it looked last week :
Only Gunnar Henrioulle knows what it might look like tomorrow .
UPDATE .
MAY 17 , 2007 :
In the spring of 2007 , Gunnar Henrioulle sold off much of his PCC streetcar fleet .

It 's been painted as a reconciliation , but McCain 's appearance on Letterman last night was a sorry spectacle .
Letterman spent half the interview talking to McCain like he talks to Paris Hilton — an object of obvious scorn — and half of it trying quite hard to get McCain to admit that the Ayers line is useless bullshit and that Sarah Palin is an embarrassment .
McCain squirmed .
He has n't done The Daily Show in a while , either , presumably for fear of a similar line of questioning .
Which is sad !
Because McCain loved doing those shows !
He loved being the funny , charming , lovable , funny old man of the Senate !
Watching him at the Al Smith dinner , you see the obvious joy he took in just getting laughs in a friendly room again .
Which is exactly why McCan needs to lose this race .
We 're not going to argue about the security of this country , about McCain 's sense of " honor , " about the toxic atmosphere of the campaign , no — we 're just talking about McCain 's simple enjoyment of his own privileged life .
McCain 's humor has always been caustic , mean , sarcastic , and cruel — " thanks for the question , you little jerk " is hardly an example of wit , funny though it is — and it is sometimes a window into a dark , deep embitterment .
It does n't work politically , in the way the Reagan 's genial old wisecracks worked .
A president needs , to a certain extent , to be somewhat humorless .
McCain 's sense of humor is dark enough to make that need doubly true in his case .
And it 's clear McCain hates the grab - and - grin aspect of the race .
He 's never cared for the idiot rabble of " the base , " and they 've never cared for him .
He 's energized by the Sunday Morning Shows , not by a rally crying for blood .
He took the mic away from that crazy lady because she was embarrassing him .
Those are n't his people .
He 's not enjoying himself .
And McCain palling around with Jon Stewart and Dave Letterman was certainly more fun to watch before this miserable race .
It 's easy to say that all McCain wants in this world is to be president , but honestly it sometimes seems like all he wants is to already have been president .
Who would n't want to be Bill Clinton before he embarrassed himself during this campaign ?
Or Bush Senior after everyone forgot his miserable single term in office ?
Should McCain lose , he can hopefully look forward to a happy post- election media good will tour , and all his sins will be again forgotten .
Maybe he can crack wise on Palin and Ayers .
We 'll happily let him go back to the way things were , with only a minimum of chastising those who take him back — as long as he promises never to run for president again .

A Spectre in the Eastern Veil
Credit & Copyright : Paul Mortfield , Stefano Cancelli
Explanation : Menacing flying forms and garish colors are a mark of the Halloween season .
They also stand out in this cosmic close - up of the eastern Veil Nebula .
The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant , the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star .
While the Veil is roughly circular in shape covering nearly 3 degrees on the sky in the constellation Cygnus , this portion of the eastern Veil spans only 1/2 degree , about the apparent size of the Moon .
That translates to 12 light - years at the Veil 's estimated distance of 1,400 light - years from planet Earth .
In this composite of image data recorded through narrow band filters , emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong emission from oxygen atoms in greenish hues .
In the western part of the Veil lies another seasonal apparition , the Witch 's Broom .

UKIP says it has " unanimously rejected " an offer from the British National Party for an electoral pact at next year 's European elections .
It says ex-tennis star Buster Mottram , a UKIP member who claimed to represent the BNP , made the " astonishing offer " at a meeting in London on Monday .
Under the deal the BNP would fight seats in the north while UKIP would focus on the south in the elections .
The BNP said a deal made sense .
UKIP says it would not work with the BNP .
The UK Independence Party , which campaigns for Britain to withdraw from the European Union , says Mr Mottram has since been expelled from the party .
' No deal ' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said : " There are no circumstances , no possible situations , in which we would even consider doing any type of deal with the BNP whatsoever .
" I 'm simply amazed that the BNP thought we would even consider such a thing , given that we are a non-racist , non-sectarian party . "
We are aware there are people very highly placed in UKIP who are very sympathetic to the logic that the vote could be split , that was where we were coming from
Simon Darby
BNP
He told the BBC there had been an attempt " over many months " to infiltrate and try to " demoralise " UKIP members into thinking there was no future without a deal with the BNP .
" We had worked out who those people were , that had infiltrated UKIP , we were on the verge of getting rid of them , and they began to panic so they thought they would play their trump card . "
The party says it expects more people to leave within the next few months .
Mr Farage added there were " no circumstances whatsoever " in which UKIP would do a deal with the BNP .
" What is shows is frankly , they are desperate , they think that people that vote UKIP might be tempted to vote BNP and they are wrong on every count . "
In the 2004 European elections , UKIP more than doubled its share of the vote to 16 % , with 12 MEPs .
The BNP 's vote share was 4.9 % - more than 800,000 votes - although it failed to get a seat in the Brussels parliament .
But the BNP 's candidate in this year 's London mayoral elections came fifth with 69,710 votes and won the party 's first seat on the London Assembly .
UKIP 's candidate came seventh with 22,422 .
BNP leader Mr Griffin told the BBC it made electoral sense for the two parties to avoid standing against each other at the European elections in June 2009 .
BNP spokesman Simon Darby said the approach had been made " with a view to ending this ridiculous situation of splitting the anti-Euro federalist vote " .
" We are aware there are people very highly placed in UKIP who are very sympathetic to the logic that the vote could be split , that was where we were coming from .
" Someone has to take a lead on this if we are not to continue to be propelled into this federalist monster . "
Two UKIP national executive committee members the party accuses of campaigning against Mr Farage 's leadership were also expelled earlier .

HONG KONG — China ’s central bank is in a bind .
It has been on a buying binge in the United States over the last seven years , snapping up roughly $ 1 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage - backed debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Those investments have been declining sharply in value when converted from dollars into the strong yuan , casting a spotlight on the central bank ’s tiny capital base .
The bank ’s capital , just $ 3.2 billion , has not grown during the buying spree , despite private warnings from the International Monetary Fund .
Now the central bank needs an infusion of capital .
Central banks can , of course , print more money , but that would stoke inflation .
Instead , the People ’s Bank of China has begun discussions with the finance ministry on ways to shore up its capital , said three people familiar with the discussions who insisted on anonymity because the subject is delicate in China .
The central bank ’s predicament has several repercussions .
For one , it makes it less likely that China will allow the yuan to continue rising against the dollar , say central banking experts .
This could heighten trade tensions with the United States .
The Bush administration and many Democrats in Congress have sought a stronger yuan to reduce the competitiveness of Chinese exports and trim the American trade deficit .
That is the way it works in theory .
But at Citigroup , many say , it was a bit different .
David C. Bushnell was the senior risk officer who , with help from his staff , was supposed to keep an eye on the bank ’s bond trading business and its multibillion - dollar portfolio of mortgage - backed securities .
Those activities were part of what the bank called its fixed - income business , which Mr. Maheras supervised .
One of Mr. Maheras ’s trusted deputies , Randolph H. Barker , helped oversee the huge build - up in mortgage - related securities at Citigroup .
But Mr. Bushnell , Mr. Maheras and Mr. Barker were all old friends , having climbed the bank ’s corporate ladder together .
It was common in the bank to see Mr. Bushnell waiting patiently  sometimes as long as 45 minutes  outside Mr. Barker ’s office so he could drive him home to Short Hills , N.J. , where both of their families lived .
The two men took occasional fly - fishing trips together ; one expedition left them stuck on a lake after their boat ran out of gas .
Because Mr. Bushnell had to monitor traders working for Mr. Barker ’s bond desk , their friendship raised eyebrows inside the company among those concerned about its controls .
After all , traders ’ livelihoods depended on finding new ways to make money , sometimes using methods that might not be in the bank ’s long - term interests .
But insufficient boundaries were established in the bank ’s fixed - income unit to limit potential conflicts of interest involving Mr. Bushnell and Mr. Barker , people inside the bank say .
Indeed , some at Citigroup say that if traders or bankers wanted to complete a potentially profitable deal , they could sometimes rely on Mr. Barker to convince Mr. Bushnell that it was a risk worth taking .
Risk management “ has to be independent , and it was n’t independent at Citigroup , at least when it came to fixed income , ” said one former executive in Mr. Barker ’s group who , like many other people interviewed for this article , insisted on anonymity because of pending litigation against the bank or to retain close ties to their colleagues .
“ We used to say that if we wanted to get a deal done , we needed to convince Randy first because he could get it through . ”
There Is Still No Silver Bullet In Programming October 13 , 2008
In 1986 Fred Brook wrote an article called No Silver Bullet : Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering ( pdf ) .
In it he speculated that there were no " silver bullets " on the horizon that could bring rapid advances to developing software similar to those in hardware .
It 's an interesting read even today .
So have we made that much progress in 22 years ?
Despite all the efforts of a lot of smart people I still do n't see any silver bullets that guarantee massive gains in productivity , correctness , performance and maintainability .
I managed to experience a lot of the changes in programming since I was a kid in the late 70's , yet despite all the advances I 've tried , they barely keep up with the growth in demands being made by the " customers " .
I always cringe when I hear or read someone who essentially says " if you do n't do X your code will suck " .
It does n't matter if X is a technology , a methodology , a language , a style or a tool , someone will always promote it as a perfect solution to all problems .
Yet inevitably people switch to it and discover that it only works in limited circumstances or provides only marginal improvements at best , and may actually make development worse .
A silver bullet seems like it would slay the development beast and make programming so easy anyone can do it .
In all my years I 've heard that for everything from OO programming , 4GL tools , graphical programming , modeling tools , methodologies and management techniques .
Some of these help but I 've never seen anything that universally made programming easy .
Programming is still hard and after all these years it seems to be getting harder instead of easier .
Much of the reason of course is that much more is expected of the modern software project ; the best hope for silver bullets today is to keep things from getting more difficult in the face of more complexity .
Making things easy seems a hopeless wish .
Now for me I found PHP to be a silver bullet of sorts for my web development projects , compared to the Java I worked with for the past 10 years .
I 've also worked for a bit in Ruby - On - Rails and dabbled with Groovy , which both seems to improve on my Java experience yet none of these represents a common solution to all of programming 's issues .
Many of my irritants in Java projects had more to do with how the projects were run ( into the ground mostly ) than the language itself .
With PHP
I am doing things my own way which might be a large part of the improvement .
I 've always thought the biggest silver bullets in any project are the qualities of the people working on the team ( not just programmers , everyone involved is important ) .
Smart , experienced people who work by consensus or at least in a trusting hierarchy , able to pick the right tools and technologies for the job , and given the right level of support by management , QA , product and everyone else who contributes to the end result .
My 10 years of desktop application experience certainly taught me the value of have really good people who work well together .
Working on Deltagraph for 5 years , we had basically 6 programmers , 2 QA and one product manager and turned out 5 major releases ; the teams at other companies with similarly complex applications generally had much larger teams .
When I 've worked in places or on teams which were mismatched , poorly lead , used tools incompatible with the team members , had overly complex methodologies , the result was uniformly bad .
The dumbest project I ever worked on had 40 programmers who flew into Mexico ( some from inside ) every week for months to work on a project trying to customize a product ( Websphere Commerce Server ) not designed to be customized , led by people utterly unfamiliar with software development , and with a deadline every week .
The use of WCS was supposed to be silver bullet to get an online store up quickly ; yet the way it was used led to two years of expensive development before the entire company vanished and nothing ever came of it .
Sometimes I think people buy silver bullets and then forget to buy a gun !
I am in complete with Mr. Brook 's argument that he could see no silver bullets in the future .
I wo n't repeat his discussion of why but I agree in principle that building software is still a complex solution to a complex problem , and that assuming that some magic elixir will be found to make simple solutions for those complex problems to appear is to ignore the many small improvements that do appear to help .
Everyone wants to find a silver bullet ( not just in programming , but , for example important today , in things like banking ) that make everything a breeze .
It 's human nature to believe in these things .
Will be still be saying the same thing 22 years from now ?
Will software development be so easy that anyone can do it ?
Will software be built by AI without human help ?
A realist would say no , but like the humans we are , we sure hope so .

Here is one of the better entries from the recent Peugeot Design Competition that seems not only practical , but cheap to manufacture and solves many of the problems associated with modern car design .
Its scissor - like frame contracts to accommodate tight parking spaces or narrow lanes and the wheels work much like the recent NASA concept car , allowing it to drive sideways or do a 360 on its wheelbase .
The car also solves the problem of having a talkative passenger distracting you from driving ( or just generally doing your head in ) by placing them in a separate pod .
Ah…just imagine , no more inane conversations , getting to play music that you like and taking a route of your choosing .
Excellent selling points , me thinks .
The car would run on electricity ; though I can’t imagine where the batteries , or the engine for that matter , would be stored .
In the tails of the pods , maybe ?
The simple nature of the design should allow for easy manufacture and its flexibility is really something car makers should pay attention to .
I ca n’t see why something similar to this could n’t make it onto the road .
It may be too radical for mass - production just yet , but should provide plenty of inspiration for all you street - rodders out there .

EDMONTON–
In a case police call a diabolically cruel convergence of art and life , local filmmaker Mark Twitchell will appear in court Monday charged with first - degree murder .
The 29 - year - old fervid fan of the psycho - slasher TV show Dexter is accused of luring now - missing Johnny Altinger to a garage and killing him in a scenario that resembled Twitchell 's latest film project – in which a man is abducted , tortured , and hacked to bits .
" We have a lot of information to suggest he definitely idolizes Dexter and a lot of information that he tried to emulate him during this incident , " said Edmonton police homicide Det. Mark Anstey .
" It was definitely planned .
He put a lot of thought , a lot of work , into it . "
Dexter , a program on the Showtime network , follows Dexter Morgan , who studies blood spatters for Miami police but leads a secret life as a serial killer , hacking up victims in the name of vigilante justice .
In August , Twitchell – on his Facebook social networking site – referred to himself in the third person , saying " Mark has way too much in common with Dexter Morgan . "
Another said , " Mark is set to evil . "
Altinger , an oil and gas industry worker originally from White Rock , B.C. , disappeared three weeks ago .
Police say the 38 - year - old motorcycle enthusiast who came to the Alberta capital a decade ago , recently met a girl online on Oct. 10 and reportedly went to meet her at a southside detached residential double garage , where Twitchell had recently filmed a movie .
He has n't been seen since , but police believe even without a body , they still have enough evidence to lay a charge .
" The movie was about luring a male from a dating Internet site and basically killing the male in the garage and chopping up his body parts and getting rid of the body , " said Anstey .
Police declined to reveal more details about the crime to protect the integrity of the investigation .
The garage was rented separately from the house .
Police believe Twitchell acted alone and did n't previously know Altinger .
In the movie , the victim was also forced to reveal personal banking information and passwords for his social network sites .
Shortly after Altinger 's disappearance , he appeared to send friends an email message saying : " I 've met an extraordinary woman named Jen who has offered to take me on a nice , long tropical vacation .
We 'll be staying in her winter home in Costa Rica . "
It said he would n't be back until December .
Friends said it did n't sound like the normally reserved man they knew and Anstey agreed .
" It definitely was not Mr. Altinger . "
Police say they also want to talk to a man who may have been lured to the garage a week before Altinger on the same premise of an online date .
Two area residents reported seeing a man running from the garage on Oct. 3 , eluding a pursuer who had been wearing a black - and - gold - painted hockey goalie mask .
" The victim was able to break free and run into the lane , " said Anstey .
Police say the mask was used in Twitchell 's movie and was found in his home in St. Albert – a city on Edmonton 's northern outskirts .
Twitchell was arrested at his parents ' north - end home on Halloween and returned there with police a day later in an apparent search for evidence .
Twitchell had been educated in Edmonton and was working on the fringes of the movie business as an independent director and producer .

" The world is getting bigger and so is my influence on it , " the father of two tells readers on his MySpace social networking site .
" My lifeblood is filmmaking , " he adds .
" I 'm hooked .
" If I do n't end up doing it for a living , I 'll feel that I failed somewhere down the line .
" My other passion in my life is my beautiful wife Jess .
I 've never been so in love in my life . "
In late August , Twitchell was between projects , so he posted a Facebook request for actors to work for free on a mystery thriller short titled House of Cards , set to shoot over the last weekend of September – just days before the first alleged victim was seen running from the garage pursued by the man in the goalie mask .
Among the advertised roles for House of Cards were : The Killer ( " Need a male , playing mid to late 20s .
Needs to deliver in a cold sociopathic voice " ) and The Victim ( Male , playing age mid-40s ) .
" I 'm casting all these roles personally so just contact me through Facebook to start the process .
We 're short on time so the sooner the better , " wrote Twitchell on Facebook .
Just three days before the shooting date , Twitchell was back on Facebook .
" Mark , " he wrote .
" Is gearin ' up for a crazy weekend of filmin ' action . "
On his blogsite , Twitchell says he does n't drink , does n't smoke and counts the Star Wars Luke Skywalker character as among his heroes .
Star Wars has been core to his work .
He had been finishing post - production on a low - budget tribute movie titled Star Wars : Secrets of the Rebellion – a work Twitchell 's production company Xpress Entertainment trumpeted as one that emulates an " $ 80 - million film on a budget of just $ 60,000 . "
Though the project is not affiliated with Lucasfilm , Twitchell , on his blogsite , said it was his life 's calling to fix what Star Wars creator George Lucas had ruined by focusing on special effects over storyline .
" Often I feel beside myself , stunned that it's me who gets the divine opportunity to tell this story , " says Twitchell .
" I was born to do this and every turn I 've taken on the path to life has led me to this .
It 's my destiny to revive the electricity of Star Wars and invoke that chill in the spine that Lucas was too focused on the money to do .
" He ( Lucas ) is more machine now than man . "

By Gideon Long
BBC News , Santiago
Ten years ago , on 16 October , UK police officers marched into a London clinic and arrested Chile 's former military leader Augusto Pinochet as he lay convalescing from surgery .
Gen Pinochet died in 2006 without facing trial for human rights abuses
His dramatic detention sent shockwaves around the world , producing both euphoria and condemnation .
It is still reverberating today .
Lawyers at Human Rights Watch and at the US - based International Center for Transitional Justice ( ICTJ ) say it contributed to the establishment in 2002 of the International Criminal Court in The Hague , which has investigated atrocities in Uganda , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan .
In Chile , where Pinochet ruled for 17 years , the knock - on effect of that arrest in London was felt again last year in the decision by the Chilean Supreme Court to extradite the former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to Lima to face human rights charges .
" Pinochet 's arrest changed the whole conversation about upholding human rights , " said Juan Mendez , president of the ICTJ .
In Chile , some of us remember where we were when Kennedy died , but all of us remember when Pinochet was arrested
Felipe Aguero
Ford Foundation , Chile " Before it , many of us in the human rights arena were aware of the notion of universal jurisdiction , but we never really thought it would be applicable in our lifetime . "
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 , 1998 .
" If I had been head of state , I would have declared it a public holiday , " said Roberto Garreton , a Chilean lawyer who documented hundreds of cases of torture and murder during the general 's 1973 - 1990 rule .
The detention convulsed Chile , where the former general was a senator - for - life and was largely deemed to be above the law .
" In Chile , some of us remember where we were when Kennedy died , but all of us remember where we were when Pinochet was arrested , " said Felipe Aguero , programme director of the Ford Foundation in Chile .
Immunity no more
The arrest had a dramatic effect in Chile where , until then , the legacy of the Pinochet era had largely been politely swept under the carpet in favour of reconciliation and the transition to democracy .
Almost overnight , victims of the dictatorship were emboldened to come forward and seek justice , and lawyers were prepared to take on their cases .
Many people in Chile have been calling for truth and justice for years
But the arrest had implications far beyond Chile 's borders too .
It was important because it was ordered not by a judge in Chile but in Spain .
For the first time , lawyers were using the principle of universal jurisdiction against a former head of state .
Their argument was that the whole world - not just Chile - had an interest in bringing Pinochet to trial .
Although universal jurisdiction had been enshrined in international law since 1948 , when it was incorporated into the UN .
Convention on Genocide , it had been largely ignored - until Pinochet 's arrest .
Suddenly , it seemed , former heads of state no longer enjoyed immunity .
In the end , the general was freed on health grounds and returned to Chile , where he died in 2006 without standing trial .
But even though he was never brought to court , his case opened the door for countless other cross - border prosecutions .
Other cases
In February 2000 , just days before Pinochet returned home , a court in Senegal indicted Chad 's former president , Hissene Habre , on torture charges .
It was the first time that a former African head of state had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country .
Mr Habre , sometimes dubbed " Africa 's Pinochet " , settled in Senegal after he was deposed in 1990 .
The case is ongoing .
In the Fujimori case too , Pinochet 's arrest set an important precedent .
Mr Fujimori , who fled Peru when his government collapsed in 2000 , was under house arrest in Chile from 2005 pending an extradition request from Peru .
Everything suggested the Chileans would reject the request and allow him to stay in Chile .
Mr Fujimori waged a long fight to avoid extradition
But in a dramatic ruling , the Supreme Court sent Mr Fujimori back to Lima , where he is now on trial , charged with authorising death squads during the country 's crackdown on Maoist guerrillas in the 1990's .
" It 's very difficult to imagine that happening without the Pinochet arrest , " said Sebastian Brett of Human Rights Watch in Chile .
" The fact that they ordered Fujimori 's extradition reflects a significant change within the Chilean judiciary regarding human rights . "
Think twice However , Juan Mendez of the ICTJ says some governments , particularly in Africa , are now starting to challenge the principle of universal jurisdiction , saying it is being used by the West to target them unfairly , often to punish atrocities committed in times of war or civil unrest .
" You could see that sooner or later there was going to be a backlash to all this and that has indeed happened , " Mr Mendez said .
" The real danger is that there is a negative reaction from governments in the Third World and that we lose the ability to bring cases to court . "
But Robert Funk , a professor in political science at Chile 's Diego Portales University , says that thanks to the Pinochet case the principle of universal jurisdiction is now well established .
It will make , he believes , make some leaders think twice before they step outside the confines of their home countries .
" With Pinochet 's arrest it became clear that international law did have jurisdiction and did have some teeth .
It instilled the idea that there are some universal principles that the law can address and indeed will address , " Professor Funk said .

The McCain campaign has put out a memo complaining about what they call voting irregularities in Pennsylvania , Florida , New Hampshire , and Virginia .
The party that brought you Florida 2000 , and Ohio 2004 is claiming that the Democrats are trying to steal this election .
According to Fox News the Black Panthers are intimidating voters at polling places in Philadelphia , “ In Philadelphia , PA , Black Panthers Are Intimidating Voters By Standing Outside Of A Polling Station While Holding A Night Stick .
Fox News ’ Rick Leventhal : “ I do not even know where to begin , but we have reached a polling place in the city of Philadelphia .
One of the two black panthers who was allegedly blocking the door is standing right over here , [ and ] accused us of intimidating voters because we were here with a camera and microphone . ”
They also claimed that Democrats for Obama is trying to suppress the McCain vote by calling people and give them fake information about changes in their polling place .
In Florida , they claim that out of state Obama volunteers are casting ballots in the state .
They also claim that voters in Palm Beach are having trouble locating the McCain / Palin option on the second page of the ballot .

In New Hampshire they say that Republican officials are being kept away from locations inside the polling place where they are supposed to be verifying voters .
In Ohio Republicans say that non credentialed election observers were inside the polling place , and in Virginia the McCain campaign believes that voters are casting multiple paper ballots .
Most of these reports are coming from right wing blogs and Fox News .
Apparently , the Republicans are already working on a conspiracy theory to explain McCain ’s loss to Obama .
McCain could n’t lose to Obama because more people wanted to vote for a Democrat .
No , if McCain loses , then the election must have been stolen .
This kind of whining should make Democrats sick after they did have an election stolen from them in 2000 .
Only when Republicans are losing are they champions for fair elections .
McCain memo
A U.S. military intelligence report has determined that the Twitter microblogging tool could be used by terrorists to coordinate their movements , activities and attacks .
The report from the U.S. Army 's 304th Military Intelligence Battalion , now posted on the Federation of American Scientists Web site , details several scenarios where terrorists could use Twitter as an operation tool .
The report noted that human rights groups , communist organizations , anarchists and others are already using the Twitter to communicate with each other and send messages to broader audiences .
" Twitter is already used by some members to post and / or support extremist ideologies and perspectives , " the report said .
" For example , there are multiple pro and anti Hezbollah Tweets .
In addition , extremist and terrorist use of Twitter could evolve over time to reflect tactics that are already evolving in use by ' hacktivists ' and activist for surveillance .
This could theoretically be combined with targeting . "
Twitter is increasingly being used to broadcast short messages , or Tweets , from various newsmaking entities , including NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander and members of Congress .
Some companies are even monitoring Twitter for customer service complaints .
Last month , Republicans in Congress used Twitter to help stage a protest over a piece of legislation .
The report cites Computerworld 's coverage of how protesters at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul used Twitter to organize its movements and to help protesters elude and fend off police as an example of how terrorists could use the technology .
The report listed some Tweets used by the protestors , including :
" Arrest teams are approaching seated protesters on Marion bridge .
Resisters are told they 'll be met with force . "
" Protestors are now fighting back .
First reports of violence now . "
" Western Ave. bridge , west of capitol can be safely crossed . "
Such Tweets could be used by terrorists for counter surveillance and as command and control and movement tools , according to the report .
The report cited several potential terrorist scenarios , including one where a terrorist operative could use Twitter with or without a cell phone camera / video function to send and receive messages to and from members of his cell .
The operative could also have a coded Google Maps / Twitter mashup of his location noted , which other cell members could view from their mobile phones .
Members of the terrorist cell could receive near real - time updates -- similar to those sent by activists at the Republican convention -- on the location of and number of opposition troops .
In another scenario , a terrorist could use one mobile phone to send and receive Tweet messages and images , and another that 's an explosive device that can be remotely detonated .
A second terrorist has the detonator and a mobile phone to view the first terrorist 's Tweets and images .
" This may allow [ the second terrorist ] to select the precise moment of remote detonation based on near real - time movement and imagery that is being sent by [ the first terrorist ] , " the report noted .
The report also cited several examples of real Tweets sent from by unknown users , likely U.S. military personnel , to unknown recipients .
They include :
" Drove off base today down Route Irish [ Baghdad airport road ] in an ' NTV and did n't get blown up fun fun "
" Today is my day off .
115 already in Camp Bucca Iraq . "
In addition , the report noted this Tweet detailing an operational change at Fort Huachuca , home the US Army Intelligence Center and School :
" Email I just got : ' We are changing all the PMs tasks at Ft. Huachuca .
I hope this does not add a lot of extra work on your end . '
Ha ! "
The potential for use of Twitter and other Web tools and mobile technologies by terrorists is dependent on the availability of mobile service , the report added .
" For example , terrorists could theoretically use Twitter social networking in the US as an operation tool , " the report said .
" However , it is unclear whether the same theoretical use would be available to terrorists in other countries and to what extent . "

Though unlikely , Democrats could still get filibuster - proof majority John Byrne
Published : Friday November 14 , 2008

Though top Democrats say it remains unlikely , the party of Barack Obama could still achieve a filibuster - proof majority of 60 seats if all the chips fall their way -- and Sen. Joe Lieberman ( D - CT ) remains in the Democratic caucus .
To reach a 60 - vote majority , Democrats would have to pick up Alaska , win a Georgia runoff and a Minnesota recount , and hold onto feisty independent Sen. Lieberman .
" Let me beat you to the punch : Will we get 60 seats ? " said Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( N.Y. ) , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , cutting off reporters yesterday as reported by the Washington Post .
" It 's possible , but unlikely . "
Democrats currently hold 55 seats , plus the support of two independents .
Should they gain a 60 - member caucus ( which would include the backing of Lieberman and liberal independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ) , they would have a filibuster - proof majority that would allow them to pass any bill in the Senate without the support of a single Republican .
" In Alaska , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich pulled 814 votes ahead of Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R ) late Wednesday night after officials tallied 59,000 votes that included absentee , early and questionable ballots whose validity was verified , " the Post noted Friday .
" An additional 40,000 votes are set to be counted in the days ahead . "
" Final results are expected Wednesday , with a certified winner on Dec. 1 .
That is one day before the runoff election in Georgia , where Sen.
Saxby Chambliss ( R ) led initial voting but did not clear the required 50 percent mark .
As a result , he must once again face former state representative Jim Martin ( D ) , " the paper added .
" Both the DSCC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have aired TV ads attacking the opposing candidate . "
And in Minnesota , Republican Sen. Norm Coleman is facing off against comic and former Air America host Al Franken .
" Franken remains 206 votes behind Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) .
More than 24,000 ballots that electronically recorded votes in the presidential race but did not record any vote in the Coleman - Franken contest will now be examined , and legal challenges have been lodged , " the paper continues .
" Hundreds of lawyers on both sides are volunteering to help resolve the dispute . "
Traffic jams are the bane of modern life .
But could it be possible that one of this planet ’s more ancient life forms could show us how to better regulate road traffic ?
That ’s the claim of congestion expert Dirk Helbing at the Dresden University of Technology in Germany and pals using a remarkable insight gained from the study of ants .
It turns out that ants are able to regulate ant traffic with remarkable efficiency .
Let ’s face it , you never see ants backed up and idling along a pheromone scent trail .
On the contrary , ant colonies are a constant blur of organized and directed motion .
How do they do it ?
To find out , Helbing and pals built an ant motorway with several carriageways between a nest and a source of sugar .
The carriageways had several interchanges where the ants could switch between longer and shorter routes .
Some ants soon found the shortest route to the sugar and others followed the pheromone trail they left behind until this shortest route became saturated with ants going to and from the sugar .
Then something interesting happened at the interchanges between the carriageways .
When the route was about to become clogged , the ants coming back to the nest physically prevented the ants travelling to the sugar getting on to the highway .
It was n’t a conscious action , there simply was n’t room for two ants to pass at these congested spots .
So these ants were forced to take a different route .
The result was that just before the shortest route became clogged , the ants were diverted to another route .
Traffic jams never formed .
That ’s an impressive feat because the efficient distribution of limited resources by decentralized , individual decisions is still an open problem in many networked systems .
As Helbing puts it : “ This is one of the most challenging problems in road traffic and routing of data on the internet . ”
But one that ants seem to have cracked and this gave Helbing an idea .
Obviously , you ca n’t allow cars to collide with vehicles coming in the opposite direction as a form of traffic control ; but you could do the next best thing and allow them to communicate .
His plan is to force cars traveling in one direction to tell oncoming vehicles what traffic conditions they are about to encounter so that they can take evasive action if necessary .
And it ’s not just road traffic that might benefit .
Helbing speculates that all kinds of routing processes could benefit from a similar approach .
Simple really , if you ’re an ant .

Campaign Boogeyman William Ayers Talks to ' GMA '
Chicago radical says he was just another " guy around the neighborhood . "
Nov. 14 , 2008  -- William Ayers , the 1960s radical whose violent history became a focal point in the 2008 presidential election , said today that the Republicans unfairly " demonized " him in an attempt to damage the campaign of President - elect Obama .
Ayers defended his bomb - throwing past and repeated a statement that has infuriated his critics : " I do n't think we did enough . "
The college professor also argued to " Good Morning America 's " Chris Cuomo today that the bombing campaign by the Weather Underground , the group he helped found , was not terrorism .
The Weather Underground bombed the Capitol , the Pentagon and the New York City Police Department in protest of the Vietnam War .
" It 's not terrorism because it does n't target people , to kill or injure , " Ayers said .
Ayers became a boogeyman for Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin , who demanded to know more about Obama 's relationship with his Chicago neighbor .
Palin accused Obama of " palling around ... with a terrorist . "
Breaking his silence today , Ayers said that the GOP attack was a " dishonest narrative ... to demonize me . "
" I do n't buy the idea that guilt by association should have any part of our politics , " he said .
Ayers scoffed at the Republican effort to make his ties to Obama appear suspicious .
" This idea that we need to know more , like there 's some dark , hidden secret , some secret link , " Ayers said .
" It 's a myth thrown up by people who want to exploit the politics of fear . "
But he was unapologetic about his militant actions during the Vietnam War .
" What you call the violent past , that was a time when thousands of people were being murdered every month by our own government .
...
We were on the right side , " he told " GMA . "
The co-founder of the Weather Underground was , as McCain has claimed , unrepentant about the the bombings his group committed during the 1960s .
" The content of the Vietnam protest is that there were despicable acts going on , but the despicable acts were being done by our government .
... I never hurt or killed anyone , " Ayers said .
" Frankly , I do n't think we did enough , just as today I do n't think we 've done enough to stop these wars , " he said .
Ayers Says He Is a ' Family Friend ' of Obama
Ayers softened his stand on violence during the " GMA " interview .
" We knew it was wrong .
We knew it was illegal .
We knew it was immoral , " he said , but the group 's members felt they " had to do more " to stop the Vietnam War .
He urged people today " to participate in resistance , in nonviolent , direct action " to stop the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Ayers , 63 , currently a distinguished professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago , became a political pinata for McCain and Palin during the presidential campaign .
Despite Obama 's attempt to portray their relationship as a distant one , Ayers , in a new afterward to his book " Fugitive Days , " describes Obama as a " neighbor and family friend . "
On " GMA , " Ayers again downplayed any close ties to Obama despite the reference to " family friend . "
" I 'm talking there about the fact that I became an issue , unwillingly and unwittingly , " he said .
" It was a profoundly dishonest narrative .
... I 'm describing there how the blogosphere characterized the relationship . "
" I would say , really , that we knew each other in a professional way on the same level of , say , thousands of other people , " he said .
He added , echoing a phrase that Obama used to describe Ayers , " I am a guy around the neighborhood . "
Ayers acknowledged that he held a reception in his home when Obama began his political run for state office .
" He was probably in 20 homes that day , " Ayers said .
During the campaign , Obama tried to defuse the Ayers issue by condemning Ayers ' past actions as " detestable . "
" The notion that ... me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was 8 years old , somehow reflects on me and my values , does n't make much sense , " Obama said .
Palin Still Concerned About Ayers Tie
Ayers remained silent during the presidential race , but his proximity to Obama was highlighted on Election Day when the two men nearly ran into each other in the same polling place .
As recently as Wednesday , Palin was still raising the Ayers ' issue , telling NBC that she was still concerned about Obama 's relationship to the former radical .
Palin was the fiercest critic of the Obama - Ayers tie , accusing Obama of " palling around with a domestic terrorist . "
While he was a fugitive , he married Bernardine Dorhn , another member of the Weather Underground .
Obama and Ayers have several connections .
The two men have also served on boards together , including the Woods Fund of Chicago and the Chicago Annenberg Challenge .
I can understand that , and I 'm all for a system that protects children .
But last year , I had the decidedly uncomfortable task of answering the door all night to young teenage girls who seemed to think they'd get the biggest grab bag if they dressed in the sluttiest costume they could find .
It 's an uncomfortable moment - you do n't want to react , but somewhere there 's that bad voice in your stomach that starts to giggle .
Fathers , I beg you - take note - DO NOT LET YOUR DAUGHTERS DRESS LIKE TARTS .
Sheesh .
Let 's have a look at some of the worst examples I could find .
Because Halloween is a holiday in which large numbers of children interact with strangers , the concern among parents and other community members about sexual offenders in their neighborhoods is naturally intensified during this time of year , " Patrick McGee , interim director of the state ’s Division of Parole and Probation , wrote in the Oct. 1 letter .
According to Neatorama , Maryland are making registered sex offenders put a sign in their windows to make sure that children do n't inadvertently knock on the door this Halloween and get a little more sugar than they bargained for .
The Pink Leopard Dress
I was always a fan of Josie and the Pussycats , but everything from the Steve Madden sandals to the neck choker screams " I 'll be the kitty , you be the doggie " with this one .
Do n't let your daughter become a pussy , Mr worthington .
The Wicked Schoolgirl
I 'll admit that in my darker moments , I 've often wondered about that Hermione chick from Harry Potter ( who is now of legal age , I might add ) but dressing your schoolgirl AS a schoolgirl - and a naughty one at that - is just asking for detention .
The Pink Kitty
See above comments about Josie , but ten times worse .
A tail and legwarmers ?
And another damn choker ?
They all call these Kitty costumes but you know they were all thinking of another word
Sheherazade
Is n't this the temptress that got John The Baptist 's head delivered to her on a plate after she did the dance of the seven veils ?
And what 's with the halter top that lifts and separates , bringing as much attention as possible to the boob area ?
For shame .
Lolita
What do you want to be for Halloween this year , sweetheart ? " I want to be a Lolita , Daddy " .
Christ almighty , do these people even understand the Lolita reference ?
Jailbait
Nuff said .
10 years minimum .
Child Ravager Costume
Here 's one with a very honest title - the Child Ravager . "
Our Child Ravager Costume features a spectacular dress with buckles . "
Shudder .
Police Woman
Not to knock our girls in blue , but this is n't a child 's police woman costume , it 's a child 's " strippergram dressed as a policewoman " costume .
The Minnie Mouse
Somewhere Mickey is rolling in his grave , while the marketing people fuck Walt Disney 's frozen head in it 's eye socket shouting " Who 's the big cheese NOW , Walt , ole biuddy ? "
Well , that 's how I imagine it with this Minnie Mouse complete with Stay Ups .
The French Maid
A French Maid ?
You 're going to dress your pre-teen daughter as a French Maid ???
OK , I 'm done .
There 's no hope .
i'm locking the doors , turning out the lights and reading me some Nabakov .
On February 17 of next year , 5,100 new digital TV channels are scheduled to become operational .
Every single one of them is stolen .
The biggest theft of the public airwaves in US history is nearly complete , a crime perpetrated in semi-secret that transfers a brand new universe of the digital broadcast spectrum into the possession of wholly undeserving corporations .
As a result Blacks , other minorities , unions , community organizations and all other non-rich societal stakeholders may be shut out of the main streams of television for the foreseeable future .
The Congressional Black Caucus and most of what passes for African American “ leadership ” have done virtually nothing to thwart the scheme to gift corporate media four high - quality digital TV channels for every single full - power channel license they currently hold .
Where science has made possible a new age of programming possibilities — a chance , finally , to create islands and archipelagos of meaningful news , information and cultural TV programming that serves and reaches all the people — corporate - bought politicians have snatched away the prize .
Acting as agents of the broadcasting industry , rather than representatives of the people , Congress awarded the already filthy rich a digital TV bonanza valued at $ 80 billion .
It is an unearned gift of a priceless resource made possible by digital technology ’s capacity to deliver far more information than analog technology .
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) is overseeing the mega - theft .
Ironically , corporate media , already in possession of 1,700 highly profitable , full - power TV channels , does n’t know what to do with its 5,100 - channel windfall .
But the industry is united in its determination to keep the channels out of anyone else ’s hands .
Such is the nature of monopolies .
This historically unprecedented heist of the airwaves has been hidden in plain sight .
By now , everyone that owns a television set knows that something big will happen early next year , that viewers who are not hooked up to cable or already own a digital converter box might find themselves without a TV signal when stations shut down their analog broadcasts and switch to digital , on February 17 .
Far fewer people are aware that the digital changeover will multiply the number of broadcast channels four - fold .
And most Americans will be totally shocked to learn that these thousands of additional channels have already been given away — stolen , really — further enriching the corporations that have turned American commercial TV into a “ vast wasteland . ”
Daylight Robbery
The women of the Harlem Consumer Education Council , gathered last week in a meeting room of the massive Church of the Intercession , at 155th Street and Broadway , certainly had no idea they were being robbed of the possibility of seeing their lives and organizing activities reflected through a vastly expanded array of digital New York City TV channels .
They were vaguely aware of the ( inadequately funded ) campaign to inform consumers about coupons available for digital conversion .
But only the council leadership , veteran organizers Florence Rice and Marjorie Moore , knew anything about the broader outlines of the digital transition – possibly the biggest public rip - off since the Congress conspired to grant millions of acres to the railroad barons .
And Rice and Moore had only learned about the scheme through Bruce Dixon ’s June 11 article in Black Agenda Report , “ Grand Theft Digital : How Corporate Broadcasters are Hijacking Digital TV . ”
“ For more than a decade they have kept the public misinformed about the most important development in TV since the first commercial broadcast , in 1941 . ”
The broadcasting industry and its servile accomplice , the FCC , are committing daylight robbery .
In the public arena , the conspirators educate consumers on the technical aspects of the digital changeover .
At the same time , they are engaged in a conspiracy of silence about the ownership and obligations of the new digital TV regime .
The thieves have been spectacularly successful .
For more than a decade they have kept the public out of the loop — purposely misinformed — about the most important development in TV since the first commercial broadcast , in 1941 .
The official FCC website on the digital transition , DTV.gov , claims to contain “ What you need to know about DTV . ”
Yet there is not a word to explain how and why the same corporations that controlled the airwaves before the transition are to be enriched with 5,100 new channels .
Nor is there any discussion of the corporate license holders ’ obligations to the public .
The FCC and the station owners think the public does n’t “ need to know ” about such matters , which might lead to questions like , “ Why was n’t the citizenry given an opportunity to decide how they would like to use the new channels ? ”
Unearned Resource
Everyone in the broadcast business has known since the mid-Nineties that the digital transition was inevitable .
Big Media was , however , anything but eager to take on the responsibility of additional channels : Channel 2.1 , Channel 2.2 , Channel 2.3 , Channel 2.4 .
Back then – and now – commercial TV owners viewed the prospect of quadrupling their channels as more of an imposition than an opportunity .
From an advertising standpoint , the industry felt it had nothing to gain from taking control of so many new channels .
Audiences do n’t grow when new channels are added ; they fracture .
Corporate broadcasters would much prefer to preserve the “ general audience ” approach to television — bland content aimed at huge numbers of people — than be compelled to create program content targeting much slimmer demographic slices .
Additional channels were extraneous and potentially costly , according to their business model .
But the digital future could not be avoided .
What would be circumvented was public interference in the disposition of the new stations .
As far as Big Media were concerned , the only thing worse than being burdened with thousands of new channels , each of them begging for programming dollars , was the prospect of others getting possession of the resource .
The industry ’s strategy , slavishly implemented by the FCC , illuminates how monopoly capitalists actively frustrate scientific advances that threaten existing business models .
Corporate media compelled the Congress and FCC to structure the transition so that current owners would inherit three additional channels for each license they held , with no obligations to the public as to the channels ’ content .
Home shopping network clones outsourced weather maps — whatever the licensee chooses to splash on the screen is his business .
The great channel expansion made possible by science — humanity ’s common patrimony — would be contained and rendered useless .
The Dream Derailed
As various U.S. media and technical organizations gradually reached agreement on standards for digital television in the late Nineties ( the Americans lagged behind Europe and , especially , Japan in this regard ) , it became apparent that the multiplication of channels could usher in a brand new day for ethnic ( and political ) minorities in television .
Corporate television had always defended the “ general market ” — a euphemism for “ white ” — character of its programming , including its news orientation , as necessitated by the limited number of television frequencies .
Minority - oriented programming was better suited for radio , we were told , where there were plenty of places on the dial .
Suddenly , with digital transmission , the television spectrum promised to become as accommodating to minorities as the radio spectrum .
Cities with six or seven full - power stations would be transformed into 24 - or 28 - channel markets .
Surely , at least a few of these new channels in scores of markets would , based on local market forces , cater to Blacks !
It seemed that the digital television business model could one day soon resemble the radio model , with multiple Black - oriented stations in markets with significant African American populations .
The demand for informational and cultural content for these outlets could fuel a renaissance in Black creative and political expression .
For once , the “ free market ” might work in African Americans ’ favor , since the same logic that led to ethnic segmenting of radio markets should also apply to an expanded television channel universe — especially with the rapid fall in equipment costs .
One could easily envision at least a hundred Black - oriented TV channels throughout the nation .
But of course , monopolies abhor “ free ” markets ; their entire purpose is to cage and destroy them .
The FCC is a captive of broadcasting monopolists , who instructed their federal minions to deliver the new channels to the old masters — as if all products of science and technology belong to them , as a right .
By 1999 , a coalition of civil rights and public interest groups were demanding hearings to establish a “ digital public interest standard ” to govern the new channels .
These groups included People for Better TV , Consumer Federation of America , American Academy of Pediatrics , U.S. Catholic Conference , NAACP , Civil Rights Forum on Communications Policy , National Organization for Women , National Association of the Deaf , Project on Media Ownership , and League of United Latin American Citizens .
However , nothing resembling full hearings on the obligations to the public of digital channel license holders ever occurred – much less a national conversation on who should receive those licenses .
The corporate media were too powerful , the FCC too devious , and civil rights groups too weak and beholden to corporations .
Only supporters of children ’s programming succeeded in winning concessions on advertising and a requirement of three hours per week of children ’s shows on each of the new channels .
Blacks and other minorities got nothing .
In 2005 , 15 members of the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) sent a letter to powerful committee chairmen , requesting the setting aside of portions of the outgoing analog TV spectrum for bids by minority entrepreneurs .
The CBC members made no requests regarding the public obligations of the new digital television spectrum — thus revealing that they cared more about making a couple of Black businessmen into millionaires than for putting some democracy into the operations of the television system that the entire nation would soon be watching .
Why was the CBC so reluctance to demand elementary fairness in the disposition of 5,100 new channels ?
The next year , 2006 , told the tale .
Two - thirds of the Black Caucus sided with the telecom companies to vote for the infamous COPE Act , which would have rolled back Black gains in cable TV access and endangered Internet neutrality .
The CBC ’s support for the telecom giants was proportionately greater than among Democrats as a whole .
The Black Caucus showed itself to be largely in Big Telecom ’s pocket .
In 2007 , the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights ( LCCR ) took the lead in pressing for some semblance of public accountability in digital TV .
Mark Lloyd , writing for the Center for American Progress , noted that the FCC and the Bush administration constantly spoke of the “ benefits ” that would accrue from the corporate - owned digital regime that was being established :
“ Yet the biggest problem with the transition to digital television in the United States … is that the Federal Communications Commission under the Bush administration has locked the public out of the process of determining what those benefits might be .
What ’s more , yesteryear ’s Republican - controlled Congress set the rules regarding this transition .
Thus the public interest obligations of digital broadcasters remain undefined and insufficient money has been set aside for the digital conversion .
Both problems need to be addressed by Congress this year . ”
“ The FCC , ” said Lloyd , “ has yet to reopen the proceeding begun in 1999 to define the public interest obligations of digital broadcasters . ”
The FCC is determined to keep the new channels in the old corporate family .
The single “ concession ” granted by FCC Chairman Kevin Martin , last year , was to “ encourage ” broadcasters to lease time on stations ’ digital channels to “ new entrants in the broadcast area ” — meaning , those who have been shut out of the digital cornucopia by Chairman Martin and his corporate friends .
The Gannett Company and Media General Inc. , corporations that own TV stations and newspapers , promptly responded to Martin ’s “ trial balloon ” by offering to support leasing time to minorities and women if restrictions were lifted on their ability to buy more TV stations .
Imagine the gall of these corporate blackmailers .
Having used their political and economic power to take possession of digital channels they have done absolutely nothing to earn , they demand more privileges in return for allowing minorities and women the honor of paying them rent !
However , GOP malice , FCC deviousness and corporate media greed do not excuse Black capitulation to Big Media .
There has been no sustained African American resistance to corporate Grand Theft Digital .
Instead , a Who ’s Who of Black and Latino organizations have joined with the Titans of monopoly broadcasting to shift all attention to making sure that everyone is equipped to consume the digital television experience , on February 17 , 2009 .
This consumer project is , of course , a matter of simple justice and of great importance to the 20 percent of the public that is in danger of losing TV reception , entirely .
But there is no reason to treat the digital TV transition as a simple consumer issue while abjectly abandoning the arena of media democracy .
Much of so - called Black leadership is collaborating with the same corporations that are busy stealing 5,100 of the people ’s channels .
Do n’t Steal Anything Small
Two weeks ago , the FCC held hearings in Rep. Edolphus Towns ’ district , in Brooklyn .
The Black Congressman expressed no irritation at corporate theft of the digital TV spectrum .
Instead , his greatest fear was petty criminals .
“ There is no shortage of swindlers willing to capitalize on the confusion and fears that could surround the DTV transition , ” said Towns .
“ With vulnerable populations as their main prey , people are already scheming to dupe people into the purchase of unneeded televisions or converter boxes or scheming to siphon coupons from the limited supply that is supposed to be for people who really need it . ”
All this is , of course , quite true , and requires vigorous government and community attention .
But Rep .
Towns would rather rail against ghetto converter box swindlers than offend the corporate criminals who are stealing $ 80 billion worth of TV spectrum .
Unfortunately , Towns ’s behavior is the norm in the CBC , which as a body is utterly incapable of confronting Power .
Almost as an afterthought , the FCC decided to do a “ test ” roll - out of the new digital regime in one city , on September 8 .
They chose Wilmington , North Carolina , a town with a population of about 100,000 , one - quarter Black .
Wilmington has no Black - oriented radio station , and no Black college .
The head of the local NAACP knew nothing about the FCC ’s “ test ” when telephoned by BAR in June .
The state NAACP chief was only slightly better informed .
Clearly , FCC Chairman Martin knows how to pick his test locations — to avoid concentrations of organized minorities and other stakeholders who might demand media democracy .
But then , New York City these days seems no better organized than Wilmington .
There is one bright spot on the horizon .
Corporate TV still has no idea what to do with the thousands of channels it has stolen .
They have no business plan to exploit their plundered booty .
Program - wise , the transition should be a disaster , a bleak digital expanse of uselessness and waste .
The shock may finally bring home the enormity of the crime , and cause the public to awaken to the challenge — to take possession of the pilfered spaces and fill them with programming that means something .
The commonwealth of Kentucky issued a seizure order on September 18 , ordering 141 domains be taken from their registrants .
order - of - seizure - of - domain - names ( adobe Reader Required )
“ ” The Domain names shall be immediately transferred by their respective registrars to an account of the Commonwealth of Kentucky “ ” .
The seizure was taken after the Commonwealth found that the “ domains were being used in connection with illegal gambling activity ” .
However some of these domains are simply parked domains not sites taking bets .
The domains seized include : ( the full list is on the adobe file )

As far as I can tell , no notice of this action was given to any of the registrants , nor was any hearing held giving the registrants an opportunity to appear
The order does talk about the court holding a hearing sometime in September to for registrants who want to claim there domain “ qualifies for return ”
Obviously a very scary tactic taken by one state .
Another reason you might want to consider moving your domains to a registrar outside of the US , as this order is to the registrars of the domains , not the central registry .
Whether this move can stand legal challenge is highly questionable .
The order did state that the “ domain configurations shall remain unchanged ” , so the domains should continue to resolve to the registrant ’s sites .
This may be an attempt to greatly limit the commonwealth damages in the event this “ order ” is overturned .
What is another state decided tommorow to seize adult domains , because they contained illegal obsence material ?
This will not cause the registrants to hire legal representation , go to Kentucky and try to get their property back .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
With two weeks and one day until Election Day , a new national poll of likely voters suggests the race for the White House may be tightening up .
Sen . Barack Obama holds a five - point advantage in a new CNN poll , down from eight points .
In a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday , 51 percent of likely voters questioned Friday through Sunday back Barack Obama for president , with 46 percent supporting John McCain .
That five - point advantage for Sen.
Obama , D - Illinois , is down from an eight - point edge he held over Sen.
McCain , R - Arizona , in the last CNN / ORC national poll , conducted October 3 - 5 .
One reason behind the tightening of the race appears to be a drop in the number of people who think McCain , if elected , will mostly carry out President Bush 's policies .
Forty - nine percent of those questioned in the new survey say McCain would mostly carry out Bush 's policies , down from 56 percent in the previous poll .
" It 's clear from the final presidential debate that one of McCain 's top priorities was to distance himself from Bush , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" It looks like McCain has convinced growing numbers of Americans that his policies would be different than Bush .
" The next task is to convince voters that his policies would be better than Bush's , and , on the economic front at least , that may be a more difficult task . "
CNN is also updating its Poll of Polls of the national general election , thanks to the new CNN / ORC survey , plus the release of other new surveys Monday morning .
Obama retains his six - point advantage in the new Poll of Polls , with 50 percent of voters saying the Democratic presidential nominee is their choice for president , and 44 percent backing McCain , the Republican presidential nominee .
Six percent of voters are undecided .
The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the latest national surveys .
The polls included in this newest edition are the CNN / Opinion Research Corporation Survey ( October 17 - 19 ) , a Reuters C- SPAN / Zogby poll ( October 17 - 19 ) , a Gallup poll ( October 16 - 18 ) and a Diageo / Hotline survey ( October 17 - 19 ) .
The new CNN / ORC poll also indicates that Americans think Obama would do a better job dealing with the tough economic times .
Fifty - three percent of those questioned say Obama would better handle the current financial crisis , with 38 percent saying McCain would do a better job .
And 63 percent feel Obama would better handle helping the middle class , almost double the 32 percent who feel McCain would be of better service to the middle class .
" The economy remains the number one issue , and Americans appear to be more confident in Obama on that topic , " Holland said .
" Both candidates tried to pitch their plans as the best thing for the middle class .
Obama appears to have won that argument . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted by telephone , with 1,058 adult Americans questioned .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .

A federal judge is awarding Tanya Andersen , who defeated the Recording Industry Association of America 's file sharing lawsuit , $ 108,000 in legal fees to compensate for defending herself against the RIAA .
The award , made public Wedesday by U.S. District Judge James A. Redden of Oregon , marks the second time that a target of the RIAA who beat a lawsuit was awarded attorney 's fees .
In August , a federal judge ordered the RIAA to pay $ 68,685 in litigation costs to two Oklahoma women whose case was dismissed .
Whether RIAA defendants who successfully defend such suits are automatically entitled to legal fees is on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
The dispute is whether judges must award fees to a prevailing party under the Copyright Act .
Judge Redden ruled ( .pdf ) that RIAA 's arguments against legal fees were " misplaced . "
" An award of attorney 's fees to the prevailing party are ' the rule rather than the exception ' under the Copyright Act , and ' should be awarded routinely , ' " Redden wrote .
The RIAA dropped the case against Andersen last year after concluding her hard drive did n't contain purloined music tracks .
The RIAA initially claimed a Kazaa shared directory that linked to her internet - protocol address was unlawfully distributing thousands of songs .
In response to the lawsuit against her , Andersen has countersued the RIAA in a case seeking class - action status to represent what her attorneys say is thousands of persons wrongly sued by the RIAA .
That case has been dismissed three times , and its fourth try is pending .
Andersen attorney Lory Lybeck requested $ 300,000 and the RIAA suggested $ 30,000 was more appropriate .
The award is upwards of $ 190 a hour .
The RIAA has sued more than 20,000 people for copyright infringement .

To help keep you safe and give you the space you need , we ’re launching a new reservation system that prioritizes pass holders .
Of the 5,000 or so “ erotic services ” ads on the Twin Cities craigslist Web site , the word “ Republican ” appears twice .
In an ad looking for event “ hostesses ” during next week ’s presidential nominating convention in St. Paul , and in another ad promising “ your secret is safe w/me ! ”
A third recently posted ad promises “ RNC fun . ”
That ’s not a lot .
From the mountain of tongue - in - cheek speculation among local prostitutes , you ’d expect more .
Just wait , they say .
“ The day before the convention , you ’ll see a hundred of ’em pop up , ” said Jennifer , who has been a prostitute for 27 years , she said , in seven major cities , from Fresno to Chicago .
Now , she ’s in St. Paul .
It ’s nothing personal , she said .
Nothing to do with the word “ Republican , ” despite some partisan aspersions .
It has a lot more to do with the fact that a convention of about 45,000 people — people with significantly more disposable income than an average “ john ” — is in the Twin Cities .
And the first thing prostitutes do when they get to a new city , Jennifer said , is find out when the conventions are coming .
“ Any convention .
The science convention , maybe not , but the medical convention — it ’s just you ’re going to be making more money . ”
And the Republican National Convention ?
“ It ’ll be just like the Super Bowl . ”
“ I ’ve definitely had a lot of inquiries for that time frame , ” said Tiffany , 25 , a Twin Cities escort who originally worked in the Washington , D.C. , area and was asking for a “ donation ” twice the price in a typical craigslist ad .
“ There will be an increase .
Absolutely .
Ab - so- lutely . ”
“ Women are going to be looking for better clientele .
Not so much b.s. Better money , ” said Laura , 20 , who has been a sex worker for about 18 months .
“ I probably would feel safer ( at the convention ) than seeing someone in North Minneapolis . ”
Social worker Beth Jacobs heads day and night support groups for St. Paul - based Breaking Free , a nonprofit organization that works to help women and girls get out of prostitution .
She reiterates some of the recent talk : “ It ’s going to pick up , no question .
It ’s the money .
It ’s the money game . ”
Still , St. Paul police Cmdr. Rob Thomasser , in charge of the vice unit , expects the usual activity , based on other cities ’ experiences .
“ We heard this could be a trend .
But in checking with New York and Boston ( the sites of the 2004 Republican and Democratic conventions ) , we found that was not the case .
The ( St. Paul ) advance team went there , that was one of the things they specifically asked about .
“ I ’m not anticipating it will be any worse than it is now . ”
He is backed up by current reports from Denver , site of this week ’s Democratic National Convention , according to police there .
Denver police spokesman Lt. Ron Saunier said as of Wednesday afternoon , there had not been a single solicitation arrest during the convention by the department ’s vice squad .
He maintained the crime was still being given equal priority , even with all the other convention duties .
However , while suspicious
Web site ads dipped a couple of weeks ago , this week they jumped , the department noted .
Boston even reported a decrease in activity — “ because there was such a presence of law enforcement , ” Thomasser said .
Neither Boston nor New York police returned calls to explain how they measured activity .
Still , one thing prostitutes do n’t mind doing : scoffing at police predictions .
“ They ( police ) do n’t know really what ’s going on in the undercover world , ” Tiffany said .
“ I have two or three girlfriends coming in from Chicago .
I ’m sure they will do a sweep , but that wo n’t stop people from coming in from out of town , ” Jennifer said .
“ Any police , they ’ll have their hands full monitoring the convention .
Whatever is going on will go on behind closed doors , on the Internet , over the phone . ”
Do n’t expect RNC delegates to be out trolling Rice Street or Payne Avenue , she said .
“ They ( prostitutes ) are not going to be out walking on the street .
Minnesota ’s never been like that , except for in your drug areas . ”
Aside from prostitution , “ there is not an adult entertainment venue in the area that is booking private parties for this event .
Usually an event of this nature would n’t book a private party . …
I can say that because we all talk to each other , ” said Julian Royal , area director of VCG Holdings , which owns the upscale gentlemen ’s club Schieks Palace Royale in downtown Minneapolis .
“ But we are expecting increased business , ” he added — meaning additional staff and mandatory work hours — and noting that the business has secured a license to stay open until 4 a.m .
“ Let ’s put it this way : Everyone ’s working . ”


World leaders converging here this weekend will try to reverse the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , amid a change in the White House that leaves a key player on the sidelines .
The agenda for the meeting of 20 top economies — among the most important summits of its kind since World War II — includes discussions of how to stimulate the slumping economy , impose more government control over lending and create more transparency within financial markets .
Missing from the talks will be President - elect Barack Obama , who will assume a leading role in helping to solve these issues when he takes office .
He declined to participate because President Bush , the man he will succeed , is the summit 's official host .
Obama has been wary of projecting presidential authority before his inauguration .
APPOINTEES : Obama sends Albright , Leach to economic summit No dramatic action is expected .
Participants such as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown call the summit an important step that could lead to revised missions for key institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
Both were created after the last financial summit of this kind , the 1944 conference at Bretton Woods , N.H. " It 's clear this meeting is more about long - term perspective than immediate measures , " Arkady Dvorkovich , economic adviser to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , said Thursday .
Bush set the tone for the summit , calling on world leaders not to " reinvent " the free - market system .
" Our aim should not be more government , " Bush said in a speech on Wall Street .
" It should be smarter government . "
The summit will allow the delegates , who represent 90 % of the world 's economy , to get their ideas on the table and discuss actions already taken in their own countries .
The U.S. is changing its $ 700 billion financial bailout , shifting from buying troubled assets to providing aid to failing banks .
Brown , for example , wants regulators to oversee the world 's 30 largest banks .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is seeking international restrictions on executive pay .
Growing economic giants such as China , India and Brazil also are interested in revamping the world economic system .
Bush said changes are needed , but too many rules will choke off the economic growth required for recovery .
" The surest path to that growth is free markets and free people , " he said .
Bush invited the world leaders in late October , as the presidential race was ending .
While the summit 's timing is awkward , economic experts say it cannot wait until Obama 's inauguration on Jan. 20 .
" There 's got to be a baton passed , but the runner ahead cannot slow down , " said Brian Bethune of Global Insight U.S. , a forecasting firm .
" The current administration needs to remain totally focused on this and move forward . "
Obama is sending former secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former Iowa congressman Jim Leach , a Republican , to speak with foreign leaders outside of the official settings .
The event kicks off tonight at a dinner hosted by Bush , with meetings Saturday .

Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann took time in his Monday " Special Comment " segment to point out an " orgy of condescending elitism " in recent tactics , " divisive , ugly , paranoid bleatings " of " Us vs. Them " by McCain surrogates , that he says do more to undermine America than anything they can accuse Senator Obama of doing .
Olbermann recalled writer Dick Young , " whose work , with ever - increasing frequency , became peppered with references to ' my America , ' -- ' I can't believe this is happening in my America , ' ' We do not tolerate these people in my America , ' ' This man does not belong in my America . ' "
" His America gradually revealed itself , " he said : " Insular , isolationist , backwards - looking , mindlessly flag - waving , racist , no second chances , a million rules ... but only for the other guy .
" Dick Young died in 1987 but he has been reborn in the presidential campaign as is has unfolded since last Thursday night .
In that time , Governor Sarah Palin , Congresswoman Michele Bachmann , McCain spokeswoman Nancy Pfotenhauer and Rush Limbaugh have revealed that there [ are ] measurable portions of this country that [ are ] not interested in that which the vast majority view as democracy or equality or opportunity -- they want only control , and they want the rest of us , symbolically -- perhaps physically - - out . "
Olbermann indicted Alaska Gov. and McCain running mate Palin for her stated appreciation of a " real America , " while fostering a climate of mob rule by tacitly accepting yelled incitements against her opponents at her rallies .
Minnesota Senator Michele Bachmann received harsh criticism for her statement that members of Congress should be separated into ' pro-America and anti-America ' categories after calling Obama the " most liberal senator " and lining him up once more with pastor Jeremiah Wright and Weather Underground founder Bill Ayers .
Bachmann 's statements resulted in a boost in donations for her Democratic opponent Elwyn Tinklenberg , topping $ 1 million between 20,000 donors in a 96 - hour period .
This is an indication , Olbermann said , that the America Bachmann sees , " with its goblins and ghosts and vast unseen hordes of traitors and fellow travelers ... exists only in your head , and in the heads of others who must rationalize the failures in their own lives , and of their own policies , as somebody else 's fault -- as a conspiracy to deny them an America of exclusionism and religious orthodoxy and prejudice . "
Pfotenhauer was called out for her recent statement that insinuated that northern Virginia was n't the " real Virginia , " compounding a joke from Senator McCain 's brother Joe that the DC suburbs were " communist country " .
It 's boiled down to the " us and them ; the pro and the anti , " Olbermann said .
" Never mind , madam , that the bisecting of this country that you happily inspire means taking a tiny crack in a dam and not repairing it , but burrowing into it .
" It is not enough that Senator McCain and Senator Obama might differ -- one must be real , and the other false .
One must be pro-America and the other anti .
Go back , and as your boss Rick Davis said today , ' rethink ' Mr. McCain 's insistence not to drag the sorry bones of Jeremiah Wright into this campaign .
And , whatever you do , Ms. Pfotenhauer , allow no one enough time to think about the widening crack in the dam . "
Radio talk host Rush Limbaugh recently insinuated on his radio show that General Colin Powell 's endorsement of Senator Obama was based on race .
" I am now researching his past endorsements to see if I can find all the inexperienced , very liberal , white candidates he has endorsed , " Limbaugh said .
" I 'll let you know what I come up with . "
" It is not conceivable that Powell might reject McCain for the politics of hate and character assassination or just for policy , " Olbermann said .
" In the closed , sweaty world of the blind allegiances of Limbaugh , one of us who endorses one of them must be doing so for some other blind allegiance , like the color of skin . "
Senator McCain has n't caused these people to speak as they have , he continued , but at the same time has n't done much to counter it .
" I disagree with you on virtually every point of policy and practice , " he charged , " and yet I do not think you anti-America .
I would not hesitate to join you in a time of crisis in defense of this country . "
But it is the responsibility of a man who uses the phrases " Country First " and " reach across the aisle , " Olbermann closed , to rein in supporters who are labeling people like Colin Powell as part of the " unreal America " when Powell may indeed have put " country first " by " reaching across the aisle " to openly back his choice for president .

Under the McCain plan ( now the McCain - Palin plan ) employees who continue to receive employer - paid health benefits would look at their pay stubs each week or each month and find that additional money had been withheld to cover the taxes on the value of their benefits .
Image Bob Herbert
While there might be less money in the paycheck , that would not be anything to worry about , according to Senator McCain .
That ’s because the government would be offering all taxpayers a refundable tax credit  $ 2,500 for a single worker and $ 5,000 per family  to be used “ to help pay for your health care . ”
You may think this is a good move or a bad one  but it ’s a monumental change in the way health coverage would be provided to scores of millions of Americans .
Why not more attention ?
The whole idea of the McCain plan is to get families out of employer - paid health coverage and into the health insurance marketplace , where naked competition is supposed to take care of all ills .
( We ’re seeing in the Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch fiascos just how well the unfettered marketplace has been working . )
Taxing employer - paid health benefits is the first step in this transition , the equivalent of injecting poison into the system .
It ’s the beginning of the end .
When younger , healthier workers start seeing additional taxes taken out of their paychecks , some ( perhaps many ) will opt out of the employer - based plans  either to buy cheaper insurance on their own or to go without coverage .

Internet Affiliate Marketing is the system of promoting web based businesses in which a third party usually referred to as an affiliate is rewarded for every visitor , customer or sale he / she provides .
In layman�s term , Affiliate marketing is using one site to drive traffic to another .
Multi tier programs
In single tier Marketing programs the affiliates are paid based on the direct sales he has referred to the merchant .
In two tier marketing , the affiliate is not only paid for the direct traffic he / she has referred to the merchant site , but also on traffic / sales made by other affiliates who joined the program through his / her recommendation .
When this chain extends to a number of different tiers , it�s known as Multi - Tier affiliate marketing .
The process is referred to as snowballing , and occurs with or without the affiliate�s being aware of each other�s existence .
This marketing structure has been successfully adopted by a company called Quixtar , a division of the hugely successful Alticor .
Quixtar website has implemented the structure for Major Corporations such as Sony and Office Depot .
Multi Level Marketing and Multi Tier Affiliate Marketing share a similar modus of operandi , but unlike MLM there are no legality strings attached to affiliate marketing .
Conventional direct selling firms are on a Multi - tier program adoption spree .
The reason is that they have such a huge turnover that they have to pump enormous capital into recruiting new reps .
The new recruits were better and stuck around longer and also the price tag for an upstream rep was far less than what the companies had been paying in the conventional model .
Most active online affiliates are part of a multi tier chain without being aware of it .
The base commission with a multi-tier affiliate grants you 30 % .
Other online affiliates who sign up using your affiliate code generate sales of which 10 % finds its way to you .
They key in Multi - Tier affiliate programs is to craft a second tier with people who are known to work hard and provide substantial results .
If the second tier affiliates screw up they could easily suffocate a successful income stream for the upper level affiliates .
It can be extremely rewarding as one can build on many different models and positives of other web marketers to drive their message , thus increasing their profit .
Not as easy as made out to be
Most sites would like you to believe that multi tier program is about lazing around and partying with friends while your sub affiliates mint money for you , nothing can be further from the truth .
Multi - tier affiliate marketing is not the self - dynamic entity it�s hyped out to be .
The major flaw with multi-tier internet marketing is that higher up reps are literally digging their own grave by promoting those below them .
This cannibalization of one�s productivity by spawning competitors against self makes little sense .
The trick is to know a number of productive affiliates , so that you don�t saturate the market .

Lawsuit : Thousands of voters illegally purged in Colorado Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday October 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Election watchdog groups are accusing the Colorado Secretary of State of purging up to 30,000 voters in violation of federal law .
Common Cause of Colorado , Mi Familia Vota , and the Service Employees International Union have filed suit in U.S. District Court in Denver .
The suit seeks to prevent any more voters from being removed in violation of the National Voting Rights
Act of 1993 , which mandates that a voter cannot be removed from the rolls less than 90 days before an election except due to felony conviction , death , incapacitation or a specific request to be removed .
Also sought is a preliminary injunction to restore the names of those removed .
The case is expected to be heard Wednesday morning .
( A PDF copy of the complaint is available at THIS LINK . )
CSU student Alexandra Vitale is one voter whose registration was nullified with no explanation : " I said to them ... I 'm not dead , and I have n't moved , so why did this happen ?
And they said they did n't know . "
Voters unable to re-register in time will be allowed to cast provisional ballots and challenge their county clerk 's office .
" We are not systematically purging any voter registrations , " Colorado Secretary of State Mike Coffman told KCNC - TV .
" I continue to believe , " he added in a statement , " that Colorado has followed all applicable laws and look forward to concluding this case quickly and in the best interest of the state .
Voters can rest assured that maintaining accurate voter rolls is our top priority . "
Coffman further said that 14,049 records were removed starting July 21 , 2008 , but they were people who moved or had duplicate registrations .
The state , Coffman said , did find 2,454 duplicate records that were cancelled inside the 90 - day window .
Coffman has faced scrutiny over the rejection of thousands of applications due to an unchecked box .
People without Colorado ID numbers are instructed on the form to check a box and fill in the last four digits of their Social Security number .
While a 1971 federal law mandates that incomplete voter forms be processed if eligibility can be confirmed , the registrations in question were not completed .
Eight signatories sent a letter to Coffman urging him to allow such applications to be processed , warning of the potential for massive voter disenfranchisement .
Coffman , backed by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers , maintained on Tuesday that approximately 5,000 voters who did n't check the appropriate box on the forms would have to correct their applications or remain ineligible per state law .
" The opinion from the attorney general makes it clear that the treatment of these voter registrations as incomplete is the only option available under state law , " Coffman said .
" The assertion that there is conflict within the law is simply not the case . "
The accompanying video report was broadcast on KCNC - TV on October 28 , 2008 :

Secretary of State Jennifer Bruner is trying to work out the discrepancies by the Friday deadline .
Some are as simple as misspellings , others are more significant .
She is working overtime to make sure all county election boards can locate the mismatches .
More on this breaking story from the Associated Press .
Close to one in every three newly registered Ohio voters will end up on court - ordered lists being sent to county election boards because they have some discrepancy in their records , an elections spokesman said Wednesday .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner estimated that an initial review found that about 200,000 newly registered voters reported information that did not match motor - vehicle or Social Security records , Brunner spokesman Kevin Kidder said .
Brunner previously cross-checked new - voter registrations with databases run by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicle and the Social Security Administration and made the results available online , but the 6th Circuit said the information was not accessible in a way that would help county election boards ferret out mismatches .
Brunner , a Democrat , told The ( Cleveland ) Plain Dealer on Wednesday that she is concerned the court decision is a veiled attempt at disenfranchising voters .
“ I ’m very concerned with these new requirements as we get closer to Election Day , ” said Steve Harsman , director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections in Dayton .
He said his staff already is working 16 hours a day , seven days a week .
I give it up to Brunner for trying to keep up with all the GOP strategies to disenfranchise voters here .
All the Election Boards around the state are working overtime to keep up .
I want to thank all of the hardworking people involved that are trying to make a smooth election day here in Ohio .

A new image from NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope reveals generations of stars amid a cavity carved from a colorful cosmic cloud .
The striking infrared picture shows a region , called W5 , which is similar to N44 F , or the “ Celestial Geode ” that was discussed in a Universe Today article last week .
The gas cavity , which looks similar to a geode - like cavity found in some rocks , is carved by the stellar wind and intense ultraviolet radiation from hot stars .
W5 is studded with stars of various ages , and provides new evidence that massive stars â€ “ through their brute winds and radiation â€ “ can trigger the birth of new stars .
The image was unveiled today at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles as part of Spitzer ’s five - year anniversary celebration .
Spitzer launched on August 25 , 2003 , from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Fla .
A high - resolution version of the image is available here .
It shows a family history full of life and death .
But are the deaths of some stars responsible for the birth of new stars ?
“ Triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove , ” said Xavier Koenig of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
“ But our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the W5 region . ”
The most massive stars in the universe form out of thick clouds of gas and dust .
The stars are so massive , ranging from 15 to about 60 times the mass of the Sun , that some of their material slides off in the form of winds .
The scorching - hot stars also blaze with intense radiation .
Over time , both the wind and radiation blast away surrounding cloud material , carving out expanding cavities .
Astronomers have long suspected that the carving of these cavities causes gas to compress into successive generations of new stars .
As the cavities grow , it is believed that more and more stars arise along the cavities ’ expanding rims .
The result is a radial “ family tree ” of stars , with the oldest in the middle of the cavity and younger and younger stars farther out .
The astronomer who last week explained the N44F image , Dr. You - Hua Chu from the University of Illinois , said along the walls of the cavity there are dust pillars sticking out and young stars are being formed at the tips of these pillars .
Similar features are seen in the new Spitzer image of W5 , where younger stars ( seen as pink or white in the image ) are embedded in the elephant - trunk - like pillars as well , and also beyond the cavity rim .
The most massive stars ( seen as blue dots ) are at the center of two hollow cavities .
With Spitzer ’s infrared vision , Koenig and his colleagues peered through the dusty regions of W5 to get a better look at the stars ’ various stages of evolution and test the triggered star formation theory .
The results from their studies show that stars within the W5 cavities are older than stars at the rims , and even older than stars farther out past the rim .
This ladder - like separation of ages provides some of the best evidence yet that massive stars do , in fact , give rise to younger generations .
“ Our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars , ” said co-author Lori Allen of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
“ We plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ’ ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim . ”
Millions of years from now , the massive stars in W5 will die in tremendous explosions .
When they do , they will destroy some of the young nearby stars – the same stars they might have triggered into being .
W5 spans an area of sky equivalent to four full moons and is about 6,500 light - years away in the constellation Cassiopeia .
The Spitzer picture was taken over a period of 24 hours .
The color red shows heated dust that pervades the region ’s cavities .
Green highlights the dense clouds , and white knotty areas are where the youngest of stars are forming .
The blue dots are older stars in the region , as well as other stars in the background and foreground .
A paper on the findings will appear in the December 1 , 2008 , issue of the Astrophysical Journal .

A West Vancouver , B.C. journalist has reportedly been kidnapped in a tribal area of northern Pakistan .
Beverly Giesbrecht , a Web magazine publisher in British Columbia who adopted the name Khadija Abdul Qahaar after converting to Islam after 9/11 , was seized at gunpoint on Tuesday while gathering material for an upcoming documentary in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan .
An English language Pakistani newspaper reported the incident Wednesday , saying the journalist and her translator were seized by armed men , and police were combing the area to locate her .
Lisa Monette , spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs , would not confirm the report , but did say a Canadian is missing in Pakistan .
On an Oct. 22 posting to her publication 's website , Jihad Unspun , Qahaar appealed to her contributors for money to help her secure a visa to exit Pakistan , citing kidnapping fears .
" We have managed to get very good material out of the country to our production group but our physical safety is now paramount , " Qahaar writes .
" As a woman , I have already had a few close calls in the tribal areas as kidnappers . "
In the late 1980s , Qahaar worked in sales for Vancouver mayoral candidate Peter Ladner 's Business in Vancouver , before buying the publication .
She later developed a magazine called Venture Quest , before moving on to focus her efforts on the website jihadunspun.com .
A friend calls the website " an alternative source of news on the Islamic world . "
" She had become very interested in Muslim and Islamic issues and was publishing in that whole arena , " Ladner told CTV News .
" This is distressing , especially if this is becoming a trend . "
Foreign Affairs '
Monette says she is not aware of any media requests to withhold news of the abduction as had been the case when CBC reporter Mellissa Fung was kidnapped in Afghanistan last month .
After being asked to honour a news blackout , Canadian news media did not publish reports on Fung 's kidnapping until she was released safely last week .
Bush Intervenes in Ohio Voter Dispute
In a déjà vu moment from Campaign 2006 , President George W. Bush again is asking his Attorney General to launch an investigation into the registration of hundreds of thousands of new voters , many of whom are expected to vote Democratic .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Bush forwarded to Attorney General Michael Mukasey a Republican request that he intervene in the battleground state of Ohio to force 200,000 new voters to either verify the information on their registration forms or cast provisional ballots , which are often thrown out after the voter leaves the polling place .
Similarly , two years ago when Bush feared Democratic victories in congressional races , the President “ spoke with Attorney General [ Alberto ]
Gonzales in October 2006 about their concerns over voter fraud , ” according to a Justice Department Inspector General ’s reported released earlier this month .
In 2006 , the White House and some congressional Republicans also put pressure on the Justice Department and U.S. Attorneys around the country to bring last - minute indictments against pro-Democratic voter registration drives .
When some federal prosecutors balked because they found a lack of evidence , they were purged as part of an unprecedented firing of nine U.S. Attorneys , who were deemed not “ loyal Bushies . ”
That “ prosecutor - gate ” scandal led to the resignations of several senior White House and Justice Department officials , including Attorney General Gonzales .
President Bush then asserted broad executive privilege to block testimony by Karl Rove and other top White House officials .
Now , two years later , Bush is again putting the Justice Department in position to act on a new round of “ voter fraud ” suspicions pushed by Republican leaders and his favored successor , Sen. John McCain .
While the goal in 2006 was to salvage Republican control of Congress , Bush ’s latest move appears aimed at keeping the White House in Republican hands .
Federal intervention – if ordered by Mukasey – could wreak havoc at polling places across Ohio , with Republican operatives using data on mismatches to challenge thousands of voters and causing long lines in Democratic strongholds .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , sent a letter to Bush asking for his extraordinary intervention after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to get involved in the Ohio dispute .
“ Unless action is taken by the [ Justice ]
Department immediately , thousands , if not tens or hundreds of thousands of names whose information has not been verified through the [ Help America Vote Act ] procedures mandated by Congress will remain on the voter rolls during the Nov. 4 election . …
“ There is a significant risk if not a certainty , that unlawful votes will be cast and counted .
Given the Election Day is less than two weeks away , immediate action by the Department is not only warranted , but also crucial . ”
On Friday , White House spokesman Carlton Carroll said Bush had referred Boehner ’s letter “ to the Department of Justice for their review . ”
Little Evidence
However , independent studies have shown that phony registrations rarely result in illegally cast ballots because there are so many other safeguards built into the system .
For instance , from October 2002 to September 2005 , a total of 70 people were convicted for federal election related crimes , according to figures compiled by the New York Times last year .
Only 18 of those were for ineligible voting .
In recent years , federal prosecutors reached similar conclusions despite pressure from the Bush administration to lodge “ election fraud ” charges against voter registration groups seen as bringing more Democratic voters into the democratic process .
Federal investigative guidelines also discourage election - related probes before ballots are cast because of the likelihood that the inquiries will become politicized and might influence the election outcomes .
“ In most cases , voters should not be interviewed , or other voter - related investigation done , until after the election is over , ” according to the Justice Department ’s guidelines for election offenses .
In 2004 , Republican - controlled Ohio was one state where voters complained that their votes cast on electronic voting machines for Sen .
John Kerry , the Democratic presidential candidate , were recorded for Bush .
Additionally , tens of thousands of voters were purged from voter registration rolls .
Early exit polls showed Kerry leading Bush in Ohio , but Bush carried the state by 119,000 votes .
At issue now is a federal law – the Help America Vote Act , which was passed when Republicans dominated Congress in 2002 – that requires states to verify the eligibility of voters .
Lawsuit Filed
The Ohio Republican Party filed a lawsuit last month against Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat , claiming that voter registration information for hundreds of thousands of new voters did not match official government data , such as Social Security records and driver ’s licenses .
But in court filings , GOP officials did not provide documentary evidence to back up those claims .
Voting advocates also note that many mismatches can be irrelevant , such as the use of a middle name in one form but not another or a typographical error in a database .
Still , Republicans faulted Brunner for her “ steadfast refusal to provide the HAVA ‘ mismatch ’ data to the county boards of elections in a meaningful way . ”
They accused Brunner of violating federal election laws by “ actively working to conceal fraudulent activity . ”
Brunner said the lawsuit was “ politically motivated ” and could result in disenfranchisement of voters because of " misstated technical information or glitches in databases . …
“ Many of those discrepancies bear no relationship whatsoever to a voter 's eligibility to vote a regular , as opposed to a provisional , ballot , '' Brunner said , adding that mismatches “ may well be used at the county level unnecessarily to challenge fully qualified voters and severely disrupt the voting process . ”
Last week , the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ’s ruling that had favored the Republicans .
The high court said lawsuits “ brought by a private litigant " could not be used to force states to abide by federal laws .
Boehner then sought , via the letter to Bush , to have Mukasey force Brunner to comply with HAVA ’s requirements .
Sen .
McCain also has elevated the issue of irregularities in registration forms , saying during the third presidential debate that the grassroots group ACORN “ is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . ”
Although McCain ’s comment was largely hyperbole , it set the stage for widespread Republican challenges to new voters , what GOP critics say is just the latest chapter of a long history of Republican “ voter suppression . ”
Recent investigations launched against ACORN – now including the reported involvement of the FBI – have raised other concerns , especially that Republicans are flogging this issue in an effort to stir up anger , to revive McCain ’s campaign , and to intimidate new voters .
Ohio ’s 20 electoral votes could be crucial for McCain to achieve a comeback victory over his Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama , who is leading in Ohio by five to seven percentage points , according to most polls .
Republican success in disqualifying large numbers of new voters – while creating long lines in Democratic precincts – could tip Ohio into McCain ’s column on Election Night .
On Friday , Sen. Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio , said he was " disappointed " that Bush " chose to interject partisan politics into the election .
My confidence in Secretary Brunner 's work remains unchanged .
She will ensure that every eligible Ohio vote is counted . "
Brown asked Mukasey not to intervene in the matter .

Everyone has been watching the returns in Alaska , where Senator Ted Stevens , 84 , seems to have pulled out a re-election victory despite his recent felony convictions in a federal case that exposed his acceptance of gifts from developers for renovations of his home in Girdwood .
Mr. Stevens has been adamant that his conviction is an aberration , that he will surmount this obstacle and that he will survive .
In essence , the senator refuses to give up his longtime seat , despite calls for his resignation from fellow Republicans , like the Senate minority leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky ; the Republican presidential nominee , Senator John McCain of Arizona ; and even Sarah Palin , who was Mr. McCain ’s running mate and is the governor of Alaska .
On CNN today , the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , declared that Mr. Stevens would not be in the Senate come the next session .
Asked about a declaration by a fellow Democrat , Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii , that Mr. Stevens could return , Mr. Reid said :
All the Republicans — John Ensign , head of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee , Republican Leader McConnell and a long list of people — said that he ’s going to be kicked out of the Senate .
Of course he is .
He is not going to survive .
CNN ’s John King : You ’re the Democratic leader of a new Democratic government .
Do you want a committee chairman who stood up for a man moments after he was convicted of federal corruption charges ?
Mr. Reid :
The other way of looking at that , do you want a guy on that committee who is loyal to his friends ?
Dan Inouye , who we all know is a very close personal – they are like brothers .
Now I think that what happened with Senator Stevens is wrong and that ’s an understatement .
He ’s been convicted of seven felonies .
He ’s not going to be in the Senate .
If Senator Stevens continues to battle for his future , that means the Senate will move toward an extraordinary measure — expulsion — of one of its members .
How does that goes forward ?
Will a leading Republican lead the charge ?
One more Senate contretemps : What happens to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , the Democrat - turned - independent from Connecticut who campaigned tirelessly for Mr. McCain , a friend , and broke with the Democratic caucus to appear at the Republican National Convention and have a larger - than - life speaking role endorsing Mr. McCain ?
Senators Lieberman and Reid met last week over Mr. Lieberman ’s chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee .
And Mr. Lieberman had already stopped going to the Democratic caucus luncheons during the fall .
On CNN today , Mr. Reid said :
I know Joe Lieberman very well .
He is a senior member of the Senate .
He is on Armed Services ; if something happens to the chairman he becomes chairman .
If something happens to the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , he becomes chairman .
So he is a senior member – person around here .
And I want to remind all of the people that are watching this newscast or however this program is going to air that I would not be majority leader but for his vote .
We could not have passed our budget – we passed a budget the Republicans could n’t pass .
They had 55 senators .
We had 51 .
They could n’t pass a budget , we did .
Why ?
Joe Lieberman voted with us .
So I recognize what he did was wrong and quite frankly , I do n’t like what he did .
I told him so all during the campaign …
So we ’ve had a number of conversations , we ’re going to have more .
But for those people beating up on Joe Lieberman , I ’ve done my share .
Recognize the glass being half full , not half empty . …
I think a lot of this is very private stuff , but Joe Lieberman has done something that I think was improper , wrong , and I ’d like — if we were n’t on television , I ’d use a stronger word of describing what he did .
Still , it sounds as though Mr. Reid believes that he needs the Lieberman vote on many issues besides Iraq .
By Ruben Navarrette - October 19 , 2008
SAN DIEGO --
You would n't have picked up on it during the debates , but John McCain and Barack Obama actually agree on some issues .
One of them is gay marriage .
Both candidates oppose the concept , preferring instead the squishy alternative of civil unions .
They 're both wrong .
I can sympathize .
In 2000 , when 61 percent of California voters approved Proposition 22 , a ballot measure that defined marriage as between a man and a woman , I was an opponent of gay marriage .
I thought that gay rights activists should concentrate on a more achievable goal such as a federal civil rights bill outlawing private - sector discrimination based on sexual orientation .
Then a gay family member helped me see that the issue was n't as complicated as I was making it .
I now believe we simply can't have a two - tiered system where some of us have the right to marry and others do n't , based on sexual orientation .
The fact that gays and lesbians -- including some who are already in committed relationships -- want to get married does n't weaken the institution .
It strengthens it by allowing more people to participate .
As more states allow gays and lesbians to marry -- Connecticut recently joined the list -- I 've taken note that civilization has not crumbled .
Here in California , some people are still worried it might .
Proposition 22 was struck down last spring by the California Supreme Court , thus clearing the way for gay marriages .
Now the opponents of gay marriage have proposed another ballot initiative , Proposition 8 , which would amend the state constitution to ban gay marriage .
McCain has endorsed the measure .
But Obama 's position is all over the map .
Despite having said that he opposes same - sex marriage and that each state should reach its own decision , Obama has also said that he opposes " divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the California Constitution " in order to prohibit gay marriage .
There you have one of the inconsistencies in the " No on 8 " campaign .
After President Clinton signed the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 -- defining marriage as between a man and a woman and excusing states from recognizing gay unions approved by other states -- supporters of gay marriage said the matter should be settled by the states .
Now that Californians are trying to do just that , the supporters of gay marriage are yelling foul .
If the federal government can't settle this issue , and the states can't either , then where do opponents of gay marriage -- misguided though they may be -- go to make their voices heard ?
The " Yes on 8 " campaign has its own built - in contradiction .
Opponents of gay marriage make a fuss over the fact that a handful of judges overrode the wishes of millions of voters .
You do n't say ?
These people are all too eager to use ballot initiatives to play citizen legislators , as they did eight years ago .
But when real legislators pass a law , whatever they come up with must be able to survive judicial review .
The same goes for a voter - approved initiative .
The opponents of gay marriage want all the power that comes from making laws , but none of the responsibility of making sure the laws they pass are constitutional .
Meanwhile , the California campaign is topsy - turvy .
A Field Poll released on Sept. 18 found that 38 percent of likely voters backed Proposition 8 and 55 percent opposed it .
Now , just one month later , a Survey USA poll -- conducted on behalf of four California television stations -- finds that 47 percent of likely voters support the initiative while just 42 percent oppose it .
One reason for the turnaround seems to be radio and television ads .
A despicable offering from the " Yes on 8 " camp plays on the fear that , if gay marriage continues , it will make its way into the public school curriculum .
The television ad features a little girl who comes home from school and informs her mother that she 's reading a book about a prince who can't find a princess to marry and so instead he marries another prince .
And , she says , when she grows up , she can marry a princess .
Good heavens .
The spot does not explain that California parents have the right to be notified of any instruction of sexually implicit material and to pull their children out of class if they so desire .
Instead , what you wind up with is Willie Horton meets Sesame Street .
This is the web site for a textbook about practical engineering with the Coq proof assistant .
The focus is on building programs with proofs of correctness , using dependent types and scripted proof automation .
I 'm following an unusual philosophy in this book , so it may be of interest even to long - time Coq users .
At the same time , I hope that it provides an easier introduction for newcomers , since short and automated proofs are the starting point , rather than an advanced topic .

. NET 3.5 SP1 was released in August and , theoretically , it should not break applications based on previous versions of the CLR , respectively 2.0 , 3.0 , 3.5 .
But there are reports that some applications are broken including the open source project Castle .
Scott Hanselman , a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft , wrote on issues existing with .
NET 3.5 SP1 .
First , he asked : " Will the . NET Framework 3.5 SP1 break my 2.0 apps ? " , then he answered " Almost certainly not . " .
After explaining why 3.5 SP1 should not affect existing .NET applications , based on CLR 2.0 and later , he admits he has " hit an edge case " .
He advises on doing in - house testing to make sure the SP1 wo n't break anything :
It IS possible that something could break , so as with all SP ’s you should do compatibility testing to make sure you ’re not hitting an edge case .
Castle Project founder , Hamilton Verissimo de Oliveira , who has joined Microsoft this year , has complained about SP1 breaking Castle .
He explains what is broken and what they did to work around it :
The SP broke DynamicProxy 2 when creating a proxy for generic interfaces / methods
The code that started to throw an exception is there to deal with a very edge case
Breaking DynamicProxy breaks everyone that uses it ( Rhino Mocks , Castle Windsor , NHibernate and Moq - those are the main ones I can think of now )
I recently confirmed the problem and changed DynamicProxy code to not use those methods “ r5323 : Disabled the GetOptional / RequiredCustomModifiers calls so all tests ( but one ) pass ”
Hamilton recommends :
If some team on CLR decided to run Castle tests cases with SP1 , they would have detected that .
Mono does aggregate external tests cases repositories to test their platform implementation .
MS could do the same for a handful of OSS projects , where license is not a problem .
If that ’s not possible due to legal issues , the CLR team can streamline the communication with OSS teams and get early feedback .
Scott Hanselman promises there will be a patch to .NET 3.5 SP1 before SP1 will be rolled out through Windows Update , some time in November .
When that happens , all machines currently with .NET 2.0 will be upgraded to 3.5 SP1 .
In the meantime , those who are having problems with .
NET 3.5 SP1 are encouraged to post the bugs on Microsoft 's Connect site .
Turning one in three of the German Democratic Republic 's 17 million citizens into informers , the Stasi injected fear , uncertainty and suspicion into every walk of life , making sure few people ever uttered anything which might anger the regime .
Credit NBC with putting together back - to - back lures for political junkies .
Sarah Palin 's long - rumored appearance on " Saturday Night Live " this weekend is a done deal .
And folks watching for that can just keep their sets tuned to the network when they go to bed , because the " must - see " TV on Sunday morning will be Colin Powell 's appearance -- announced today -- on NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
Credit Powell with having starred in this campaign 's longest - running guessing game :
Would the famed former Army general and former secretary of state under President Bush , who flirted with seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 , cross party lines and publicly back Barack Obama ?
The buzz today is that he will do so in the Sunday show spotlight .
If so , it will end speculation that began more than a year ago -- and periodically would reignite .
In an interview on " Meet " in June , 2007 , Powell created a stir when he pointedly declined to commit to endorsing whomever might emerge as the GOP presidential nominee .
This year , his every word and action have been closely watched -- and usually interpreted as indicatin of a pro-Obama slant ( see here , here , and here ) .
One report -- off - the - mark , as it turned out -- suggested Powell would deliver a dramatic speech at the Democratic National Convention on Obama 's behalf .
If anything , anything less than a Powell embrace of Obama this weekend would be a letdown for the Democrat .
As for its potential benefit , here 's what Jonathan Martin astutely has to say at Politico.com :
It would n't exactly be a profile in courage on Powell 's part to get behind Obama now , but it would help rehabiliate his post - Iraq image in some quarters .
And it would be the sort of validating endorsement -- Republican , military man , well - known elder statesman -- that the Democrats would trumpet in the closing days of the campaign to assure voters that Obama is a " safe " pick .

Congress to McCain : You 're not helping Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Friday September 26 , 2008
Print This Email This McCain agrees to leave DC , debate Obama Congressional leaders have a message for John McCain :
You 're not helping .
The Republican presidential candidate 's garish attempt to sweep into the Capitol at the 11th hour and take credit for crafting an economic bailout package has coincided with a collapse in negotiations over that $ 700 billion proposal .
Three days after declaring he would " suspend " his presidential campaign and skip Friday 's presidential debate , McCain reversed course and agreed to leave Washington .
McCain said he will travel to Oxford , Miss. , Friday for his first debate with Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential candidate .
Congress had been functioning just fine for the last five months in which McCain had n't bothered to show up , and some lawmakers would like to keep it that way .
" The insertion of presidential politics has not been helpful , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters Friday , referring to McCain .
" It 's been harmful . "
Republican Sen. Bob Corker echoed a similar sentiment earlier in the day during an interview on Fox News .
The Tennesseean said the presidential candidate 's presence in Washington " adds a tension and distraction that candidly is not healthy at this moment in time . "
Reid acknowledged that he had asked McCain to help unify his party behind a bailout package -- although he never asked McCain to return to Washington -- but he accused the Arizona senator of choosing grandstanding over leadership .
" A few days ago , I called on Sen. McCain to take a stand , let us know where he stands on this issue , on this bailout , " Reid said .
" But all he has done is stand in front of the cameras ; we still do n't know where he stands on the issue . "
Reid and Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , who chairs the Senate Banking Committee , unveiled a " discussion draft " of their latest proposal to pump money into the economy in the hope of staving off a collapse .
Lawmakers remain optimistic that a deal on the bailout package will be reached over the weekend .
President Bush similarly tried to ease fears in a brief address Friday morning .
" The legislative process is sometimes not pretty , " the president said .
" But we are going to get a package passed . "
Democrats say they wo n't pass any bailout bill that does n't include limits on CEO compensation in companies that take the taxpayer bailout and include provisions to ensure the government sees some return on its $ 700 billion investment .
Reid said Senate Democrats and Republicans had reached a tentative agreement Thursday afternoon and then " guess who came to town , and that fell apart . "
Objections from House Republicans also were key in preventing that deal from going forward .
Reid accused House Minority Leader John Boehner of not being sufficiently engaged in negotiations and said the GOP should not hold up the bailout to achieve long - sought changes like cuts in the capital gains tax .
" The Republican House has to decide what they want to do , " Reid said .

Joe Biden Thursday night told Sarah Palin not to lecture him on patriotism , after weeks of attacks mocking him for his statement the wealthy should be patriotic and pay higher taxes because not enough has been asked of them .
" Sarah Palin had great fun saying Joe Biden thinks paying taxes is patriotic .
Well , let me tell you what Joe Biden thinks , " the Delaware senator said at an outdoor rally .
" Joe Biden thinks that anybody who takes millions of dollars offshore to avoid paying their fair share is unpatriotic . "
" That is not patriotic and it will stop , it will stop in an Obama - Biden administration !
Enough !
I 've had it up to here !
Do n't lecture me on patriotism , " shouted Biden , getting drowned out by the applause of his supporters .
" I 'm dead tired of being taken advantage of .
I 'm getting tired of it . "

They 're ads you may have seen around New York City .
They 're supposed to be promoting storage , but they have a political and comical edge to them .
But their latest ad does n't have too many people laughing .
Its billboards have always been edgy , but has Manhattan Mini Storage gone over the edge ?
The ad causing controversy depicts a coat hanger and takes a stance on abortion , along with the slogan : " Your closet space is shrinking as fast as her right to choose . "
Needless to say , it did n't take long for the backlash to come .
" These billboards , we think they 're absolutely disgusting , " said Kiera McCaffrey of the Catholic League . [..]
Manhattan Mini Storage often uses liberal messages in its billboards , reflecting the politics of a city in which three - quarters of voters picked John Kerry over George Bush in 2004 .
We recently showed you how Intel was intent on upping the ante in Solid State Disk performance , with our evaluation and performance analysis on the release of their X25 - M series SSDs .
Though offerings from other SSD manufacturers like OCZ and Samsung have come to market with better performance since then , there was no question Intel 's SSD flat out smoked the competition in the cost - effective , consumer grade MLC ( Multi - Level Cell ) SSD market .
With an average sustained throughput of ~ 225 MB / sec for reads , around 74MB / sec observed write performance , and blistering fast sub- millisecond random access , we were left thoroughly impressed by Intel 's first consumer - ready effort in SSD technology .
However , at the time of launch , we only had access to one of these new SSDs from Intel and as such could n't provide you with RAID performance metrics back then .
Of course , that changed the other day when the local courier delivered another Intel kit to our door .
As such , and with a bit of that " Friday on our minds " attitude adjustment going on in the lab , we decided to RAID a pair of these SSDs up to see what they could do .
Blinding speed in RAID 0 mode ?
Yes , you could say that ...

Suspicious powder temporarily shuts Reuters office Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008
Print This Email This NEW YORK ( AFP ) 
The Reuters news agency on Monday evacuated its New York newsroom after the delivery there of an envelope containing what later proved to be a harmless powder .
Police ordered the evacuation in central New York as a precaution after the company 's managing editor for the Americas noticed a " puff of powder " from an envelope , Reuters said in a statement .
Nearly three hours later , authorities said the powder posed no danger and told employees they could resume work , Reuters spokeswoman Jolie Hunt said .
The scare followed a similar incident last week at The New York Times building , also in midtown Manhattan , and at branches of Chase bank .
The newspaper 's lobby was closed for nearly four hours on October 22 after an employee opened an envelope containing a suspicious substance .
The substance was later deemed not hazardous , but three Times employees were asked to take showers as a precaution .
In 2001 letters containing anthrax killed five people and spread panic .
Since then , police and fire officers have been called out on thousands of occasions to investigate suspicious mailings -- most of them harmless .
President Bush , as part of his ongoing diplomatic feud with the government of Bolivia , has now decided to take aim at the jobs of more than 20,000 innocent Bolivian workers .
It is a mistake – morally , diplomatically and economically .
It adds one more episode of turning innocent people into collateral damage , from an administration that has delivered such damage in abundance .
We have to stop him .
A Trade Agreement Everyone Likes
Nearly two decades ago , under President Bush ’s father , the U.S. began the Andean Trade Preference Act ( ATPDEA ) .
That program offers Bolivia and a handful of other Latin American nations reduced U.S. tarriffs , allowing them to develop new industries and jobs exporting products such as textiles and handmade furniture .
For the U.S. , the aim is to create opportunities for employment as an to alternative to growing coca for the illegal drug market .
In September , as part of the Bush administration ’s diplomatic battles with Bolivian President Evo Morales , President Bush announced that he will use his executive authority to axe Bolivia out of those trade preferences .
The actual victims of President Bush ’s move , however , wo n’t be President Morales , but women and men who eke out modest livings as weavers , jewelry - makers and carpenters , creating products for U.S. markets .
The U.S. Congress knows that , and just two weeks ago approved a six - month extension for Bolivia .
But yesterday in Washington President Bush repeated his intent to sidestep Congress and use his powers to cut Bolivian workers out of the program .
Listen to the Voices of the People who Will be Affected by Bush ’s Plan
We profiled some of these workers for our new book , Dignity and Defiance , and after President Bush ’s announcement last month we traveled out across Bolivia to ask them how his threat would affect their lives .
Today we have posted a five - minute video of their own words on our website .
We hope that you will take a moment to listen to what they have to say , here .
We also demanded and won the right to have their video testimony from Bolivia played next week in Washington when the Bush administation holds the public hearing required by law before he implements his plan .
Administration officials told us that this will be the first time that video testimony like this has been played in such a proceeding .
On October 23 in Washington , those officials will hear directly from people like Joaquín Aquino , a carpenter in his 50s who hand - makes furniture for the U.S. market and Natalia Alanoca Condori , a 28 - year - old mother who makes clothing sold in American stores .
These are the people , along with thousands others like them , who will be the real victims of President Bush ’s actions against Bolivia .
What You Can Do to Help
We have an opportunity and an obligation to these workers to take action and help stop President Bush ’s plan .
Here are three simple ways that you can help :
1 . Share this request for action with others
All across the United States there are people and organizations that care about making U.S. policy in Latin America more just .
Help us spread the word about the need to act on this now , by forwarding this email to others .
2. Sign the Democracy Center ’s online petition
You can directly add your voice to the campaign to stop President Bush ’s threat against Bolivian workers .
In less than sixty seconds right now you can add your name to an online petition that the Democracy Center will be submitting as part of the formal public record against Bush ’s anti-Bolivia policy .
Sign that petition here .
If your organization wants to join the petition please send us an email telling us so at : gro.rtcycarcomednull@aiviloB .
We need your petition endorsements no later than midnight October 30 .
3. Submit Formal Comments to the Bush Administration
If you or your organization want to do more , federal law guarantees the right to submit formal comments to the Bush administration ’s Trade Representative .
To do that you must submit your comments by e-mail no later than 5 pm on October 31 .
Those comments must be sent in the form of an attachment and must include the subject line , “ Review of Bolivia ’s Designation as a Beneficiary Country Under the ATPA and ATPDEA . ”
The address is : vog.poe.rtsunull@2180
RF .
You must also include in the attachment a cover letter with your name , address , telephone number and e-mail address .
Even if we ca n’t make President Bush back down on his plan to put Bolivians out of work , taking action now helps build the case for Congress and the new President to reverse it .
Those leaders need to see that people in the U.S. care about this issue .
Raising Up Voices from Latin America
President Bush ’s move against the Bolivian people is just one more example of how we , as citizens , need to not only change leaders but also change the political winds that drive U.S. policy toward Latin America .
To help do that the Democracy Center is launching a new campaign – Voices from Latin America .
Voices from Latin America marries new technology and old - fashioned organizing to build a bridge between citizens in the U.S. and Latin America .
It is a platform from which we can work together to help educate one another and take joint action , like the one we are starting today on Bush ’s assault on Bolivian workers .
On the website you will find :
Briefing papers ( in English and Spanish ) on some of the main issues in U.S. / Latin America relations , on topics such as trade , the ‘ U.S. war on drugs ’ , and immigration .
Video testimonies from across the region in which people tell how U.S. policy affects their lives and their nations .
How to get involved , and real examples from people who have .
As citizens we have to be educated and involved in U.S foreign policy in ways that we never have before .
That includes making sure that the people in other countries who are so affected by what the U.S. does have their voices heard in the U.S.
Help us do that by visiting the Voices from Latin America web site .
Pictured : First images of planets outside our solar system as new era in astronomy dawns
By Daily Mail Reporter
Scientists have taken the first snapshots of another solar system , ushering in a new era in astronomy .
The infrared images show a family of three giant worlds orbiting a young hot star in the constellation of Pegasus , 130 light years from Earth .
A light year is the distance light travels in a year - 6 trillion miles .
In another development also reported in Science , Nasa 's Hubble Space Telescope photographed a single Jupiter - sized planet called Fomalhaut b orbiting a close neighbour of the Sun just 25 light years away .
In future , astronomers hope to capture images of Earth - sized planets in other solar systems .
Analysing the light from their atmospheres could reveal the existence of life .
' It is a step on that road to understand if there are other planets like Earth and potentially life out there , ' said astronomer Bruce Macintosh , one of two teams who make the ' extra - solar ' system photographs .
This image shows the newly discovered planet Fomalhaut b in the box in the bottom right of the image .
The inset box indicates the movement it has made .
The white dot in the centre of the red dust cloud is the Fomalhaut star which it orbits
This Nasa image explains the details of the newly discovered planet .
It is pictured in the small white box to the right of the Fomalhaut star
None of the four giant gaseous planets are remotely habitable or remotely like Earth .
But they raise the possibility of others more hospitable , and Macintosh said it 's only a matter of time before 'we get a dot that 's blue and Earthlike ' .
In the past 13 years , scientists have discovered more than 300 planets outside our solar system , but they have done so indirectly , by measuring changes in gravity , speed or light around stars .
• Watch an animation of the planet in motion
Nasa 's space sciences chief Ed Weiler said the photos are important .
He compared it to a hunt for elusive elephants : ' For years we 've been hearing the elephants , finding the tracks , seeing the trees knocked down by them , but we 've never been able to snap a picture .
Now we have a picture . '
Fomalhaut b which circles the star Fomalhaut , pronounced FUM - al - HUT , and is Arabic for ' mouth of the fish ' was found by astronomer Paul Kalas , from the University of California and his team .
Artist 's concept of the star Fomalhaut and the Jupiter - type planet that the Hubble Space Telescope observed
' I nearly had a heart attack at the end of May when I confirmed that Fomalhaut b orbits its parent star , ' he said .
' It 's a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen . '
Until now , astronomers have relied on indirect methods to detect ' extra - solar ' planets - those outside our solar system - which are normally impossible to see because of the blinding glare of their parent stars .
But the planets described today in the journal Science were photographed directly , using high - precision ground - based telescopes and sophisticated computer processing to cancel out the light from the star .
Christian Marois of the Herzberg Institute for Astrophysics and his team used the Keck and Gemini telescopes in Hawaii to find the three planets near the star called HR 8799 , which is just visible to the naked eye .
" We thus do not have a full picture , ' he told BBC News .
" The detection of the three planets around HR 8799 does not mean that no planets are orbiting at smaller separations .
Other gas giant or even rocky planets could reside there . "
In future , astronomers hope to capture images of Earth - sized planets in other solar systems .
Analysing the light from their atmospheres could reveal the existence of life .
This image projected out from Earth shows Fomalhaut 's location in the cosmos
' You see an object next to a star and you might think it 's a planet , ' Mark McCaughrean , an astrophysicist at the University of Exeter , told BBC News .
' But you have to watch it for several years and make sure that it moves around the star and with the star as it moves across the sky .
Though I 've been very sceptical in the past , these ones all seem pretty real to me .
' It 's like a London bus - you 've been waiting for one for ages and suddenly four come along at once . '
The parent star of the three - planet family is known as HR 8799 .
It is 1.5 times more massive than the Sun , and five times brighter , but less than 100 million years old .
In comparison , the Sun was formed around 4.5 billion years ago .
Two of the planets are thought to be around ten times heavier than Jupiter , and the third is about seven times more massive .
In size , they could have diameters 20 per cent to 30 per cent larger than Jupiter's .
The planets are very young , only about 60 million years old , and still glow with the heat generated by their formation from contracting lumps of dusty debris .
This image shows the comparison between ( left ) unprocessed and ( right ) processed images of the star HR 8799 .
The processed image shows three planets orbiting the star , which is among the first images of another solar system , ushering in a new era in astronomy
Like the giant planets orbiting the Sun , they lie in the outer regions of their solar system , roughly 25 , 40 and 70 astronomical units ( AU ) from their star .
An astronomical unit is the distance between the Earth and the Sun , about 93 million miles .
Previously astronomers have only managed to detect planets orbiting relatively close to stars , usually at distances of less than five AU .
Imaging the planets directly also made it possible to analyse their atmospheres .
All three are said to have ' complex ' atmospheres containing dusty clouds .
Since the 1990s , astronomers have collected a tally of around 200 detected extra-solar planets .
Most have been found using the ' wobble ' method which looks for tiny disturbances caused by gravity .
As a large planet orbits a star , the gravitational tug between them causes the star to ' wobble ' slightly , which affects the light it emits .
Another technique detects the minute dimming of a star 's brightness when a planet passes in front of it , an event called a ' transit ' .
This infrared image shows more clearly the three planets ' b ' , 'c ' and ' d ' orbiting the star HR 8799
Dr Bruce Macintosh , from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , California , said : ' Until now , when astronomers discover new planets around a star , all we see are wiggly lines on a graph of the star 's velocity or brightness .
' Now we have an actual picture showing the planets themselves , and that makes things very interesting .
' We 've been trying to image planets for eight years with no luck .
This is a milestone in the search and characterisation of planetary systems around stars .
' I 've been doing this for eight years and after eight years we get three at once . '
HR 8799 is a hot , blue A - type star , yet only faintly visible to the naked eye .
It was being studied as part of a survey of 80 similar stars located in the Sun 's stella neighbourhood .
This image shows an artist 's impression of the star HR 8799 and its family of planets
The historic pictures were captured using the Gemini North and Keck telescopes , both situated on Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
Adaptive optics , which bend a telescope 's mirror to counteract the blurring effect of the Earth 's atmosphere , were used to produce the highly detailed images .
Advanced computer processing was also applied to block out the light of the star so the planets could be seen .
The Hubble images are of a planet about the size of Jupiter buried in a dust belt surrounding the star Fomalhaut , which is easily visible to the naked eye in the southern constellation of Piscus Austrinus ( Southern Fish ) .
Formally given the designation Fomalhaut b , scientists believe the planet could have a ring system .
It is a long way from its parent star , at a distance of around 119 AU .
The planet 's existence was suspected in 2005 when it was discovered that Fomalhaut had a dust belt with a sharp edge that was slightly off - centre .
This suggested that a planet 's gravity was shaping the inner edge of the belt .
Astronomer Dr Paul Kalas , from the University of California at Berkeley , who led the discovery , said : " It 's a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never seen before . "
Even using Hubble 's " starshade " or coronograph to reduce a star 's glare , the planet would have remained hidden had it not been in such a wide orbit .
Fomalhaut is around 200 million years old and 16 times brighter than the Sun .
It will burn out in about a billion years , making it a very short - lived star .
Both teams of astronomers had to take a number of photos over a period of years to be sure they really were seeing planets and not background objects unrelated to the stars .
Dr Bruce Macintosh said he suspected more planets exist in HR 8799 's family that cannot be detected using current technology .
' One of the things that distinguishes this system from most of the extra - solar planets that are already known is that HR 8799 has its giant planets in the outer parts - like our own solar system does - and so has ' room ' for smaller terrestrial planets , far beyond our current ability to see , in the inner parts , ' he said .
He is leading a team constructing an adaptive optics system designed to find planets that will be 100 times more sensitive than the one used to observe HR 8799 .
Estimated to be no more than three times Jupiter 's mass , the planet , called Fomalhaut b , orbits the bright southern star Fomalhaut , located 25 light - years away in the constellation Piscis Australis , or the " Southern Fish . "
Fomalhaut has been a candidate for planet hunting ever since an excess of dust was discovered around the star in the early 1980s by NASA 's Infrared Astronomy Satellite , IRAS .

In 2006 the National Research Council ( NRC ) came out with its groundbreaking fluoride report produced by a panel of experts who reviewed hundreds of fluoride toxicological studies revealing that consuming even small amounts of fluoride from tap water can be hazardous to your health .
While dental groups and individual dentists claim this report has nothing to do with fluoridation , the following has occurred because the NRC report has everything to do with fluoridation ( the addition of fluoride chemicals into public water supplies attempting to reduce tooth decay ) .
Both the American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) cited the NRC report when they advised that fluoridated water should not be used to make infant formula .
The National Kidney Foundation , citing the NRC report , withdrew its support of fluoridation and replaced it with this warning : " Individuals with CKD [ Chronic Kidney Disease ] should be notified of the potential risk of fluoride exposure . "
A January 2008 Scientific American article reported that after 3 years of scrutinizing hundreds of studies , the NRC expert panel " concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function , especially in the thyroid - the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism , " reports its author Dan Fagin .
Fagin quotes John Doull , professor emeritus of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Kansas Medical Center , who chaired the NRC expert panel : " The thyroid changes do worry me . "
" Many Americans are exposed to fluoride in the ranges associated with thyroid effects , especially for people with iodine deficiency , " - said Kathleen Thiessen , PhD , co-author of the government - sponsored NRC report .
" The recent decline in iodine intake in the U.S could contribute to increased toxicity of fluoride for some individuals , " - says Thiessen .
She and at least two other panel members publicly call for an end to water fluoridation .
" A low level of thyroid hormone can increase the risk of cardiac disease , high cholesterol , depression and , in pregnant woman , decreased intelligence of offspring , " - said Thiessen .
A meta-analysis of fluoride / IQ studies e-published 8/10/08 " found a consistent and strong association between the exposure to fluoride and low IQ ( published in Biological Trace Element Research el al . ) .
An Institute for Children 's Environmental Health report published February 2008 and revised July 2008 said " The primary question remains as to whether exposures to fluoride via multiple routes of exposure , from drinking water , food and dental - care products , may result in a high enough cumulative exposure to contribute to developmental effects " - emerging science suggests we need to further study the dose at which fluoridation may increase risks of neurodevelopment disorders , cancer and skeletal or dental fluorosis , particularly for sensitive individuals . "
Over 1,800 professionals signed a statement urging Congress to stop water fluoridation until Congressional hearings are conducted ..
See : http://www.fluorideaction.org/statement.august.2007.html
An Online Action Petition to Congress in support of the Professionals ' Statement is available on the Fluoride Action Network 's web site , http://congress.fluorideaction.net and over 13,000 individuals have signed so far .
Organized dentistry and many individual dentists in government and in private practice continue to promote fluoridation and ignore and / or lie about this scientific NRC report .
Their actions are beneficial to corporations who financially support dental unions such as the American Dental Association and its state constituent groups .
Fluoride product manufacturers have made the American Dental Association one of the richest and politically powerful lobbying groups in the country and one which often crafts laws that benefit dentists .
Because of the ADA 's money and power , most dentists make three times as much as physicians while working fewer hours and days doing less critical work .
They are the rich " guys " contributing to political coffers in cities and towns across America .
However , 80 % of dentists refuse to treat Medicaid patients and 108 million Americans do n't have dental insurance .
People in America are dying from untreated tooth decay .
Fluoridation gives legislators a false fact ( that it 's safe and effective ) to fall back upon when asked why they support water fluoridation .
The truth is legislators support the American Dental Association and the fluoride producing corporations who shore up political campaigns to get them re-elected .
In return , they pass laws favorable to dentists .
The New York Times reported how the NY Dental Society , in effect , buys laws that benefit themselves .

Arvind Narayanan , a Ph.D candidate at the University of Texas at Austin , has a great post up on his LiveJournal blog about what could have been for the once great blogging platform .
Narayanan thinks that LiveJournal missed a golden opportunity to become the social networking site on the Internet .
Narayanan seems to think that LiveJournal could have been Facebook , WordPress , and Twitter all at once , but it fumbled the ball by making one fatal mistake : it listened to its users when it should n’t have .
But let ’s back up .
According to Narayanan , social ideas that LiveJournal helped to originate earlier this decade are finally starting to be implemented across the web .
Facebook has redesigned to emphasize its activity streams as a response to Twitter , Google ’s Blogger added “ following ” in response to Facebook , and WordPress acquired IntenseDebate to take on third party commenting systems that are rising in popularity , such as Disqus .
Go back 5 years ago , says Narayanan , and you ’d notice that LiveJournal had all of those killer features .
It also had a technical lead over its competitors — it developed the now ubiquitous memcached memory caching system ( of which Facebook is largest user ) , and the growing in popularity OpenID also came out of LiveJournal .
It had a huge user base by 2003 standards , and the site had an open API that allowed developer access to user profile data .
All the things that make social networks like Facebook and Twitter and platforms like WordPress so special today , LiveJournal had the foundations of five years ago .
Hindsight is always 20 / 20 , but had LiveJournal put syndication front - and - center , allowed users to import external feeds , and added a Disqus - like commenting widget , LJ could have cemented itself as the world ’s top social network , blogging platform , and web - wide commenting system , Narayanan believes .
And these were things that they would have done , he says , if not for making one major mistake : they listened to their users and stuck to a “ design philosophy of being an island cut off from the rest of the Web , ” that proved to be disastrously wrongheaded .
Narayanan goes into more detail about what the LiveJournal users of 2003 unfortunately impressed upon the company , and what LiveJournal should have done instead , but the lesson is simple : sometimes you need to say no to your users .
In July , we wrote about video site Vimeo who angered a vocal minority of its user base when it decided to say no and ban video game movies from the site .
Sometimes your users are right , and listening to them is beneficial , but sometimes they ’re not , and following the advice of a vocal minority or those early adopters that are resistant to change will lead you down the wrong path .
Facebook has made a habit of pissing off its users but riding out the storm during major changes .
They did it when they opened the site to non-college users .
They did it again when they added the News Feed .
And most recently when they rolled out their feed - centric redesign to the entire site .
In each instance , a very vocal minority put up a huge stink about how awful the change was .
And in each instance , Facebook stuck to their guns and users eventually capitulated and got used to the change , and sometimes even began to love it .
The result ?
Facebook is now the biggest social networking site in the world and is riding a $ 15 billion valuation .
As I noted in July , I will mention here that I argued an opposing view in February at ReadWriteWeb .
( Though , to a certain extent , I think both ideas can be reconciled — there are times when letting your users define your app is okay , and other times when you have to say no .
The tricky part is figuring out when to say yes and when to say no . )
In the dark of night over the weekend when most people were snoozing , the Treasury dramatically expanded its bailout plan to include buying student loans , car loans , credit card debt and any other “ troubled ” assets held by banks .
The changes , which were included in draft language that also opened the bailout program to foreign banks with extensive loan operations in the United States , potentially added tens of billions of dollars to the cost of the program .
Although it was a major addition to what was already the nation ’s largest - ever bailout , it did not become part of the debate between Democrats and the Treasury over details of the program .
A Monday counterproposal by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd included such consumer loans as well as mortgages , just as the Treasury ’s draft did Saturday night .
“ The costs of the bailout will be significantly higher than originally considered or acknowledged , ” said Joshua Rosner , managing director of Graham Fisher & Co. , who charged that the Treasury and Federal Reserve have not been “ forthright ” about the ultimate cost to the public .
The plan gives Treasury the discretion to buy the non-mortgage loans and securities in consultation with the Fed .
Conservatives cited the move as a sign that the massive plan to take over bad mortgage debt already is opening the door to further government bailouts .
“ Such a large takeover by the government will surely be accompanied by adverse , unintended consequences , ” said Pat Toomey , president of the Club for Growth , a conservative advocacy group .
“ Already , other companies and industries are lining up at government ’s door asking for their own bailout . ”
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. stressed that the additions were needed to ensure that student loans and credit cards - which have become indispensable to the spending habits and career plans of many Americans - do not become victims of the widening credit crunch .
Student loans , which Wall Street firms packaged and sold to investors just like mortgages , already were hit hard in the widening credit crisis earlier this year , with much of the private loan market disappearing .
That forced the government to step in and beef up its direct loan programs for college students .
Many financial analysts feared that the credit card market would be the next domino to fall .
Credit card debt also is packaged and sold to investors in complicated “ derivative ” securities that have become difficult or impossible to sell in recent months .
Investors are spurning the complex securities because they are worried about rising defaults in nearly every category of consumer loans , which reduce the value of individual loans and have made it hard to determine the value of pools of loans that back the securities .
Many of the unsellable loans have been sitting on the balance sheets of banks , forcing them to take losses and preventing them from making further loans .
Richard Berner , chief economist at Morgan Stanley , one of the investment banks that stands to benefit from the loan buyback plan , said the program will help ease frozen loan markets and ensure consumers continue to have access to credit .
“ The Treasury proposal is crucial to the credit and risk - taking repair process , ” he said , predicting that plan will have “ dramatic consequences ” in helping to “ renormalize ” loan markets .
But some financial analysts were not sure whether the massive bailout plan will accomplish its goal of calming markets .
“ The credit squeeze gripping the financial market wo n’t disappear soon as a result of this program .
Financial institutions will continue to hoard cash , raise credit standards and increase risk premiums ” on loans , said Sung Won Sohn , economics professor at California State University .
Sen . Jim DeMint , a South Carolina Republican who announced his opposition to the bailout Monday , said he simply does n’t believe Mr. Paulson when he says it will solve the market problems .
“ His predictions have been consistently wrong in the last year , ” he said .
“ It ’s a sad fact , but Americans can no longer trust the economic information they are getting from this administration . …
There are much better ways of dealing with this problem than forcing American taxpayers to pay for every asset some investor does n’t want anymore . ”

Federal prosecutors are going after a Florida college student who allegedly installed spyware on a woman 's laptop to covertly snap nude photos of her through her webcam .
Craig Matthew Feigin__Craig Matthew Feigin__ , 23 , is charged ( .pdf ) in U.S. District Court in Gainesville with violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Feigin was arrested by local police last July .
The case began when the victim noticed changes in her computer 's behavior after giving it to Feigin for overnight repairs , the * Gainesville Sun* reported at the time .
Every time she got near her laptop , the light on her webcam switched on .
A friend with IT experience examined the system , and found that someone had installed the remote access program Log Me In , and software called Web Cam Spy Hacker , which Feigin himself sold online as a tool for catching cheating spouses .
Over three weeks , the software allegedly uploaded some 20,000 images of the woman to an Eastern European web server before it was detected .
Feigin reportedly told police he 'd pulled the same scam on eight or nine other women .
A federal magistrate issued an arrest warrant for Feigin on September 23 .
Two Pennsylvania men are in trouble this week for electronic snooping of a different sort .
Artur Grigoryan and Artur Hurutyunyan allegedly persuaded an associate to take a job as a clerk at the local Rite Aid in Wayne , Pennsylvania .
Once there , she installed a skimming device inside the debit card pad at the cash register , which began scooping up ATM card numbers and PINs from drug store customers .
A Flying J in Lordsburg , New Mexico
* Courtesy Texas Hillsurfer * From January to April of last year , the two men periodically returned to the store and distracted other cashiers while downloading the captured information from the wiretapped PIN pad , according to a five - count federal information ( .pdf ) filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia .
They allegedly programmed the captured magstripe data onto other cards and used the PINs to withdraw some $ 351,050 from Rite Aid shoppers with accounts at Citizens Bank , PNC Bank and Wachovia .
A Texas trucker struggling with the high price of diesel fuel is accused in a similar scam , after MasterCard customer Amanda Anderson noticed mysterious charges to her card from the Flying J truck stop chain .
The FBI traced the charges ( .pdf ) to truck driver Armenak Abulyan by way of his " Frequent Fueler " card , which offers discounts and incentives to Flying J customers .
Abulyan was apparently a particularly faithful customer , who swiped his loyalty card at Flying J pumps from Knoxville to Nebraska , while using Anderson 's credit card number , and at least seven others , to gulp down $ 20,000 in gas from May to September 2008 .
Anderson told the FBI the charges began after she used her card at a convenience store .
The clerks there told her that the store 's card reader was broken , then briefly took her MasterCard into another room to use " the back unit . "
Jay Echouafni
Perhaps bolstered by its success in extradition proceedings against British UFO hacker Gary McKinnon , the feds this week reopened and Europeanized a 2004 case involving a satellite TV entrepreneur who allegedly shelled out cold , hard cash to have three competitors DDoSed off the web .
Jay Echouafni__ , __ 41 , allegedly paid an employee to organize crippling distributed denial - of - service attacks against competing websites selling satellite TV gear in 2003 .
The employee , Paul Ashley , pleaded guilty to the attacks and has already served a two - year prison term , while Echouafni skipped out on $ 750,000 bail and is now believed to be hiding out in Morocco , where he was born .
Alleged botmaster Lee Graham Walker , of the United Kingdom , was charged alongside Echouafni in the original federal complaint in 2004 .
On Thursday federal prosecutors in Los Angeles turned that into a formal indictment ( .pdf ) , perhaps clearing the way for extradition proceedings .
At the same time , the feds added German hacker Axel Gembe to the case .
Gembe last came up as the prime suspect in the Half Life 2 source code theft .
He 's named in the new indictment as the purported creator of the Agobot malware used in some of the attacks .
Charges filed in 2004 against three other men in the case were later dropped .

Ideas in Political and Social Science
The general contours of my thinking on poli sci and socially oriented philosophy is articulated in an essay , Innovism : A Primer , that I first drafted in 1999 , and have nipped and tucked from time to time in the years since .
Alongside it is an experiment in legal constitution design , The Constitution of Innovism .
These both describe a moderate philosophical approach and political system with various reforms to try to contain the excesses of plutocracy , democracy , capitalism , the welfare state , oligarchism and monopolism , narrow selfishness , etc .
There 's plenty in it for anyone to like , and surely something in it to make most people cranky , but of course that 's what reform looks like .
I have n't updated the online version of the experimental constitution in many years , but I 've continued jotting down ideas and hope to get the online version updated soon .
In 2005 , I wrote an online book , Returning to Eden :
How an ancient religious myth inspired a modern political movement , that all these years later still has some neat ideas in it .
It 's a polemic on utopianism .
Back in 2012 , I discovered a book by Joseph A. Tainter , The Collapse of Complex Societies , first published in 1988 .
It is a fascinating read , highly recommended !
RIGHT TURNS
Right turns are easiest .
Just stay in the right lane , look around for traffic and go around the corner .
To avoid being squeezed against the curb , ride in the middle of the right lane if it 's narrow , just as you would on a straightaway .
Remember that the rear end of a car cuts the corner as it makes a right turn .
At a stop sign or legal right turn on red , yield to traffic coming from the left on the cross street .
You 're always required to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks .
Bicyclists follow the same set of rules as motorists do .
A right - turn signal is a useful courtesy to drivers who would have to wait for you if you were going straight .
Pointing with your right arm is the most effective right - turn signal .
CHANGING YOUR LANE POSITION
To prepare for most intersection maneuvers , you need to change your lane position .
Even between intersections or when making a right turn , as just described , you may have to move farther toward the left side of the right lane .
So far , we 've gotten by with a quick description of how to look back and check for traffic .
But when making a left turn , you often have to move across more than one lane .
It 's time to go into more detail .
Before you change your lane position , you must always look back for traffic .
Your sense of balance is in your head , so you need some practice to turn your head without swerving .
Some bicyclists change lane position without looking back , because they 're afraid of swerving .
Do n't trust your ears !
Many cars are very quiet , and a bicycle behind you is even quieter .
Practice looking back in an empty parking lot .
Ride along a straight , painted line .
Turn your head to glance back , and then look forward again to see whether you 're still riding straight .
To keep from swerving , think about the position of your arms .
If you do n't turn the handlebars , you wo n't swerve .
Turn your head to look even if you have a rear - view mirror .
A mirror can help you to keep track of the traffic directly behind you , but no mirror will show cars or bicyclists at your side .
The best way to look back depends on your riding position .
If you 're sitting upright , swivel your neck and your back .
If you 're in a low crouch , duck your head sideways .
Some bicyclists even duck their heads underneath their arms .
GETTING A DRIVER'S COOPERATION
So now you 've looked back .
What next ?
If there 's a car close behind you , let that car go by , and deal with the next car .
Usually , the next driver will have time to react to your signals .
If you make your intentions clear , the driver will almost always let you into line .
Extend your left arm to signal that you want to move to the left .
Wait a couple of seconds , then look back again to check that the driver has slowed down or moved aside to make room .
Turning your head to look back is a signal , too .
In slow , crowded traffic , you need to keep your hands on the handlebars , ready to brake .
You can usually move into line with the cars while signaling only with a turn of the head .
Whatever signal you use , always make sure that the driver behind you has noticed your signal and made room for you .
Do not change your lane position until you 're sure that the driver has made room for you .
Most drivers will , but there 's no guarantee .
Your signal does n't make it safe to change lane position .
Only the driver 's response to your signal makes you safe .
If you begin your lane change early enough to deal with two drivers , you 'll almost always succeed ; if the first driver does n't make room for you , the second one almost certainly will .
So anticipate turns and plan for them in time .
In high - speed highway traffic , drivers may not have time to react to you .
Then you need to wait for a gap in the traffic and move across all of the lanes at once .
LEFT TURNS
To prepare a left turn , change lanes until you reach the left - turn position in traffic .
As you move toward the center of the street , this is where no cars on your left will go straight ahead .
If the lane carrying left - turning traffic also carries through traffic , ride at its left side .
If it 's a left - turn - only lane , ride at its right side or in its center , depending on its width .
On an ordinary two - lane street , turn left from just to the right of the centerline .
It may seem dangerous to move to the middle of the street , but in fact , the middle is the best position for a left turn .
When you 're in the correct position , all the traffic you have to deal with is in front of you .
Since you 're to the left of the through traffic coming from behind you , you do n't have to look back while making your left turn .
You can concentrate on the traffic from the left , right and front .
You may have to cross more than one lane to reach the left - turn position .
Cross each lane in two steps .
With one step , cross the lane line so you 're just inside the next lane .
With the next step , cross to the far side of the lane .
At each step , look back and get a driver to make room for you .
When in position for your turn , yield to traffic from the left , right and straight ahead .
So you do n't have to come to a stop , you may move slowly out to the middle of the intersection , the same way cars do .
Then you can get moving faster when there 's a gap in the traffic .
Pass an oncoming left - turning car right side to right side .
When turning left , do n't let left - turning cars behind you pass you on the right .
While waiting , keep near the middle of the lane or make a slow signal with your right hand .
As you enter the intersection , ride straight ahead a short distance so the left - turning cars behind you can pull to your left .
If you do n't make it to the left - turn position by the time you reach the intersection , do n't force the situation .
Go straight through the intersection .
Make your left turn at the next intersection , or cross to the other side of the street , double back and make a right turn .
It 's also okay to make a left turn as a pedestrian .
This way , you can turn left legally at a " no left turn " sign or handle traffic situations you feel are beyond your abilities .
At the far right corner of the intersection , come to a complete stop .
Do not swerve left ; it 's never safe because you would have to look for traffic in all four directions at once .
Instead , stop and walk to where you can safely reenter the traffic flow .
GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH
Going straight through an intersection is easy compared with a left turn .
You may have to change lanes , but not usually as many .
When going straight through , stay out of a right - turn - only lane .
Make sure right - turning traffic passes you on your right .
If there 's a lane marked for right turns and through traffic , ride near its left side .
You may sometimes have to merge into the second or third lane from the curb to avoid the right - turning traffic .
When you approach an intersection where cars are waiting for a stop sign or traffic light , never pass the first car .
You never know for sure when or in which direction that car will move .
Besides , while you 're passing the car , it may hide a pedestrian or other hazard .
The most difficult intersection to ride straight through is the one that looks simplest - on a small , two - lane street .
Traffic in the right lane goes in three different directions - right , straight and left !
Still , on a street with parallel parking , the empty space between the parked cars and the corner serves as a right - turn lane .
Do n't wander right , into this space .
Keep going straight ahead .
On a street without parking , pull a little farther into the lane to discourage right - turning drivers from passing you on the left .
With a little finesse , you can position yourself just far enough from the curb so cars can pass you on the right to make a legal right turn on red .
Some motorists hesitate to pass between a bicyclist and the curb even to make a right turn .
Wave them by with your right hand .
SUMMARY
You can ride smoothly and confidently through most intersections .
Correct lane position is the key .
Plan ahead to change lanes well in advance if needed , especially for left turns .
Even when going straight , you often need to adjust your position to avoid conflict with right - turning traffic .
Your practiced ability to look back for traffic is essential .
Using the correct lane position keeps you visible and gets you to where you can concentrate on traffic in front of you as you enter the intersection .
Be sure to stay alert for drivers who fail to signal , fail to yield , or change their mind about which way to go .

A Vice - President has a really great job , because not only not only are they there to support the President 's agenda .
They are like the team member , the teammate to that President .
But also , they 're in charge of the United States Senate .
The framers also devoted scant attention to the vice president 's duties , providing only that he " shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no Vote , unless they be evenly divided " ( Article I , section 3 ) .
In practice , the number of times vice presidents have exercised this right has varied greatly .
John Adams holds the record at 29 votes , followed closely by John C. Calhoun with 28 .
Since the 1870s , however , no vice president has cast as many as 10 tie - breaking votes .
While vice presidents have used their votes chiefly on legislative issues , they have also broken ties on the election of Senate officers , as well as on the appointment of committees in 1881 when the parties were evenly represented in the Senate .
The vice president 's other constitutionally mandated duty was to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for president and vice president and to open the certificates " in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , " so that the total votes could be counted ( Article II , section 1 ) .
Only a few happy vice presidents — John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Martin Van Buren , and George Bush — had the pleasure of announcing their own election as president .
Many more were chagrined to announce the choice of some rival for the office .

Developing software is an indoor job with no heavy lifting .
How dangerous can it be ?
Actually , the long term dangers to your health are all too real .
Humans have bodies evolved for running around the African savanna , not sitting motionless in front of a computer for hours at a time .
I have heard several stories of developer careers cut short by RSI .
Imagine if you could n’t type any more , because it was too painful ?
Yes , it could happen to you .
I started to write an article about ergonomics for developers .
Then I realised I knew someone who was a lot more knowledgeable about it than me .
Derek kindly agreed to write it instead .
It may seem hard to believe that working at your desk can cause you long term harm , but unfortunately the real toll of sitting in the same location and doing the same operations over and over again may not be felt until it is too late .
Here are some simple precautions you can take .
1. Setup your work environment to be ergonomic
Make sure that your whole working environment is set up correctly .
This includes your monitor , keyboard , mouse , your desk height , your chair , and possibly a foot rest .
Adjusting your seating position relative to your workstation layout encourages good posture .
Do this on a regular basis , not just when the ergonomic assessment forms come around once a year .
Setting up your chair correctly is probably the most important step and is covered in detail at healthycomputing .com .
2 . Try using an ergonomic mouse and keyboard
There are a wide range of ergonomic mice available nowadays , and while some of them may look a little strange , you may be surprised how comfortable they are compared to conventional mice .
The Evoluent VerticalMouse is ergonomic , easy to use and available in left and right hand variants .
If you find an ergonomic keyboard inconvenient for programming , consider looking into one with a small key travel distance , like the keyboards on laptops where the keys only need to be depressed a small amount , as this reduces the finger movements and effort required .
3. Remember to look up from your monitor
Staring at your computer screen for long periods will lead to eye strain , tiredness , headaches and dry eyes .
Every few minutes , look up from your monitor and focus on objects in the distance , either by looking out of the window or at the most distant end of the room .
You can do this by using ScreenRest set to remind you at fixed time intervals .
It is also worth adjusting your monitor screen to eliminate reflections from light sources behind and above you .
4 . Sit up and stop slouching
Leaning forward , sinking down in your chair or resting you elbows on the desk places unnecessary pressure on your back .
Poor posture , maintained over a period of time , leads to back pain and more serious back conditions .
Make sure that you regularly correct your posture , sitting slightly reclined and supported in your chair with your shoulders relaxed .
5 . Keep yourself hydrated
Do n’t forget to keep up your fluid levels throughout the day .
Even mild dehydration can leave you feeling lightheaded or bring on a headache .
Often when you feel hungry it is actually that you ’re thirsty , so do n’t reach for the biscuits , get a glass of water first .

6 . Take regular rest breaks
Get up and walk around regularly , taking a few minutes to relax .
Try to avoid the temptation of carrying on with that feature that is “ nearly finished ” , or doggedly tracking down that bug that you ’ve “ almost fixed ” .
Taking a break will refresh you both physically and mentally .

As a programmer your livelihood depends on you being able to use a computer .
Pay attention to any discomfort , tension or pain you may feel while using the computer .
Do n’t think that computer - related conditions wo n’t happen to you and ignore those nagging pains until they become something more serious .
Do not underestimate how severe and uncomfortable repetitive strain injury pains can become and how long they will persist throughout the day and even into the night and will eventually impact leisure activities you enjoy doing .
Once the damage has been done even the simplest of movements , not just using the computer , can be enough to trigger pain .
There are tools available , such as speech recognition software , to help with basic computer tasks such as emails and browsing basic websites , but it is of no use when controlling complex development IDEs .
Speech recognition can frustrating to control at the best of times and is impractical in an open plan office environment , due to the background noise .

More Challenges for McCain , From Ayers to the Palin Pick Poll : Obama is more optimistic ; Palin leads many to question McCain 's judgment .
Oct. 20 , 2008  --
More challenges for John McCain : Likely voters overwhelmingly reject his effort to make an issue of Barack Obama 's association with 1960s radical William Ayers .
Fallout continues from McCain 's pick of Sarah Palin for vice president , with 52 percent saying it weakens their confidence in his judgment .
And on optimism , it 's Obama by 2 - 1 .
Skepticism about the Ayers issue was one of the factors cited by Colin Powell in his endorsement of Obama yesterday , and in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll , likely voters broadly agree : 60 percent say Obama 's relationship with Ayers is not a legitimate issue in the presidential campaign ; 37 percent say it is .
Click here for PDF with charts and questions .
There 's less of a split , though , on the Obama campaign 's association with the community group ACORN ; 49 percent say it 's not a legitimate issue , 40 percent say it is , with more , 11 percent , unready to express an opinion on the subject .
McCain 's accused ACORN of voter registration fraud ; the group blames some of its canvassers for filling out faked forms , and says it itself has notified the authorities of such cases .
On the vice presidential candidates , 52 percent of likely voters say McCain 's pick of Palin has made them less confident in the kind of decisions he'd make as president ; that 's up 13 points since just after the selection , as doubts about Palin 's qualifications ( also voiced by Powell on Sunday ) have grown .
Just 38 percent say it makes them more confident in McCain 's judgment , down 12 points .
Those numbers are more than reversed on Obama 's pick of Joe Biden : 56 percent of likely voters say it makes them more confident in Obama 's decision - making , 31 percent less so .
Optimism , meanwhile , is a strong point of differentiation between the two candidates .
Likely voters by 62 percent to 30 percent see Obama as more optimistic than McCain – all else equal , an attractive quality in a candidate , as Ronald Reagan demonstrated .
And in a similar attribute , voters by a 17 - point margin , 54 - 37 percent , see Obama has having the better personality and temperament for office .
INDIES – On all these , the views of swing - voting independents are critical .
They see Obama as more optimistic by 57 - 31 percent and as better - suited temperamentally by 52 - 36 percent .
The Palin pick makes them less rather than more confident in McCain 's judgment by 51 - 39 percent , while the Biden selection makes them more rather than less confident in Obama by 50 - 33 percent .
Independents by 60 - 37 percent say Ayers is not a legitimate issue ; on ACORN they divide more narrowly , 47 - 42 percent .
OTHERS – There are other differences among groups .
Views of the Palin selection , naturally , are highly partisan .
But majorities of moderates ( 62 percent ) , young adults ( 59 percent ) and women ( 56 percent ) all say it makes them less confident in McCain 's judgment .
( More women than men say so . )
So do near majorities , 48 percent , of white women and married women alike .
The pick plays better in the GOP base : 70 of Republicans , 68 percent of evangelical white Protestants and 67 percent of conservatives say the selection of Palin makes them more confident in McCain 's decision - making .
On Ayers , similarly , 62 percent of conservatives and 67 percent of Republicans say it 's a legitimate issue .
Just 29 percent of moderates , 12 percent of liberals and 10 percent of Democrats agree .
METHODOLOGY : This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 16 - 18 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 995 likely voters , including landline and cell - phone - only respondents .
Results have a 3 - point error margin for the full sample .

Rove postulated that Bush , like McKinley , had arrived at a moment when the old politics no longer applied and the new had yet to be formed .
By offering himself as a pro-immigrant , pro-growth , " compassionate " conservative , he would attract the new voters of the day , including Hispanic immigrants , as well as workers in the postindustrial economy , while at the same time mobilizing the party 's conservative Christian base .
He would be the candidate of growth and the future while casting his rival , Al Gore , as the embodiment of an exhausted big - government credo .
And this strategy worked : in 2000 , Bush made gains among Hispanics and carried 97 of the country 's 100 fastest - growing counties .
Of course , Gore won the popular vote and , by some accounts , the election .
And yet since that time , the Democrats have come to look like the party of the underprivileged and the highly educated and scarcely anyone else .

The Granger Collection
So why does n't 2006 recall the G.O.P.'s glory years ?
First of all , McKinley was facing a particularly hapless generation of Democrats .
A long period of deadlock had come to an end in the off - year election of 1894 , when the failure of the incumbent Democrats to stem a financial panic led to a colossal electoral rout .
In a shambles , the party took a decisive turn to the left in 1896 by choosing the populist Bryan , who ran again in 1900 and 1908 .
Today 's Democrats are much closer to the mainstream , and the realignment has been correspondingly shallower .
Over the last decade , as the political analyst Michael Barone observes , the national vote for president and for Congress has divided almost down the middle .
Second , while McKinley had the good fortune to arrive at the dawn of a new era , Bush came along three decades after Republicans broke into the Democrats ' solid South to establish a new majority .
The historic tide may have already been ebbing .
And finally , George W. Bush is no William McKinley .
The figure we meet in the biography by Lewis Gould , McKinley 's great champion and Rove 's teacher at the University of Texas , is a canny political veteran , more pragmatist than dogmatist .
McKinley governed from the center the Democrats began to vacate in the Bryan era .
The president not only made a show of mingling with workers but also appointed labor leaders to his cabinet and publicly supported the call for an eight - hour day for government employees .
And for all his reputation as an imperialist who provoked a war with Spain , McKinley appears to have held out as long as he could against the rabid jingoism of the public and Congress , especially after the sinking of the Maine in Havana 's harbor in February 1898 .
" What is remarkable , " Gould concludes after reviewing the evidence , " is how long the president was able to obtain time for the conducting of peaceful diplomacy . "
George W. Bush is , by contrast , a radical figure , a profoundly self - confident leader willing to stake all on his unshakable inner convictions — which is to say that this president made himself a hostage to fortune in a way that the coldly calculating McKinley never would have done .
Thanks in no small part to the supreme self - assurance , the disdain for more cautious points of view , of the president and his inner circle , the administration has run aground on Iraq .
The war in Iraq is the biggest , but not the only , reason for the growing crisis .
It is instructive that only one - third of mainline Protestants now say they approve of President Bush 's performance ( as opposed to one - half two years ago ) , according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .
A Congress that spends days arguing over the body of Terry Schiavo or the merits of a constitutional amendment to prohibit same - sex marriage does not feel like the embodiment of the future to more moderate or more secular Republicans .
Rove and Bush have driven an already conservative party to the right .
" The McKinley party was still plausibly the party of Lincoln , " as the historian Sean Wilentz observes .
" But Bush and Rove are the culmination of 30 years of realignment in which the Republicans became the party of the South the way the Democrats were in McKinley 's day . "
Apple has threatened to shut down the iTunes music store if an obscure three - person board appointed by the Librarian of Congress increase the royalties paid to publishers and songwriters by six cents per song .
The Copyright Royalty Board is scheduled to hand down its decision on these rates by Thursday .
As part of their general muscle - flexing of late , music publishers asked the board to increase the royalties paid to publishers and songwriters for the sale of digital downloads from 9 cents to 15 cents per song .
Apple – which has mightily resisted tampering in any way with its 99 cent price point for tracks – said that if the rate hike goes through and the labels refuse to absorb the entire resulting increase , the iTunes music store will become unprofitable .
And , Apple says , it likes making money .
" If the [ iTunes music store ] was forced to absorb any increase inthe ... royalty rate , the result would be to significantly increase thelikelihood of the store operating at a financial loss – which is noalternative at all , " wrote Apple iTunes vice president Eddy Cue in astatement filed with the board last year , according to Fortune .
" Apple has repeatedly made it clearthat it is in this business to make money , and most likely would notcontinue to operate [ the iTunes music store ] if it were no longerpossible to do so profitably . "
Out of each 99 cent song , Apple currently pays artists and labels an estimated 65 to 70 cents per song , 9 cents of whichthey currently pass on to publishers .
According to Apple , the 66 percent increasein publishing royalties to 15 cents per song requested by the NationalAssociation of Music Publishers ( NMPA ) is too much for the company to bear .
Of course , Apple could simply tack the extra six cents ontothe price of each song in its store and make up the difference that way .
But part of iTunes ' longstandingallure is that every track costs 99 cents ( with the exception ofDRM - free tracks in the iTunes Plus previous to October ' 07 ) .
Steve Jobs is unlikely to raise the standard track price on iTunes to $ 1.05 ,
although that would probably be just fine with the labels , which havebeen pressuring Apple to budge on its 99 cents per track policy for years by allowing Amazon to sell DRM - free albums that they insist be wrapped in DRM when iTunes sells them , among other things .
Despite this pressure , Jobs has refused to relent , continuing to insist on the 99 cent flat pricing structure .
It 's hard to believe that Apple would close iTunes rather than raise prices , but that 's exactly what iTunes vice president Cue threatened to do .
Prospects for the record labels absorbing the entire increase are dim .
They 're not trying to do Apple any favors when it comes to keeping the price of songs at 99 cents , and a 15 cents per song publishing royalty would gobble over 20 percent of their per-song revenue .
Apple will almost certainly have to pony up some of any additional fees , meaning that it 'll either have to raise prices , run the store at a loss or stop selling music altogether .
According to Cue 's statement to the board , Apple prefers the third option .
Apple and the NMPA had no comment .
The Copyright Royalty Board , pictured above , is set to announce itsruling on digital publishing royalties for the first time ever by Thursday .
Previously , digital downloads had operated under the same rate that governed the sale of physical albums .
In addition , the board will set new publishing royalty rates for physical albums and ringtones .
The new rates will be in effect for the next five years .
The previous rate of nine cents per track has been in effect since ' 96 ( updated ) – one reason publishers say it 's high time for an increase .
Update : I 'm at a conference , but Threat Level posted a follow - up story about the CRB 's decision to leave the publishing royalty rates unchanged – much ( we assume ) to Apple 's relief .
In addition , the board set the ringtone publishing royalty at 24 cents , meaning that songwriters and publishers will earn nearly three times as much for selling ringtones as by selling full - length songs .

S.F. seeks cultural authenticity for Tea Garden Commission tells bidders for lease to focus on authenticity

It 's the oldest public Japanese tea garden in the United States and one of the best - known attractions in San Francisco 's most famous park .
But alongside the geisha dolls and books about Zen gardens in its gift shop are decidedly un -Japanese snow globes , magnets and T - shirts that could be found at any city tourist trap .
And that does n't sit well with many of the city 's Japanese American leaders .
Two years after a public fight over the future of Golden Gate Park 's Japanese Tea Garden , the city 's Recreation and Park Department is seeking proposals from companies interested in leasing and managing the garden 's tea house and gift shop .
Unlike the practice in years past , however , applicants will be judged on their ability to bring an authentic , culturally sensitive experience to the more than 400,000 people who visit every year .
The Recreation and Park Commission will vote today on whether to move forward with a request for bids that outlines those requirements .
" I 'd like to see more accuracy .
People serving the tea should be dressed appropriately ... and the selection of goods in the gift shop should be more culturally relevant , " said Douglas Dawkins , the great - great - grandson of landscape designer Makoto Hagiwara , who created the garden for the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 .
Besides objections about what some Japanese Americans consider tourist schlock , Dawkins and other would like to see more high - quality , traditional types of green tea offered , plus servers who are dressed appropriately and trained in traditional Japanese tea service .
City officials and Japanese American leaders agree that the garden cannot offer a formal , traditional tea ceremony to every visitor , but they want the tea house to evoke that experience .
Two years ago , when the department went looking for a new concessionaire , the issue erupted in controversy .
The Lo family , which has leased the concession from the city for 15 years , is Chinese American , and Japantown leaders lined up behind a bid from a Japanese American cafe owner .
Some of them argued that the concession should be held by a Japanese American .
The Recreation and Park Commission rejected both bids , leaving the Los with a month - to - month lease and the tea garden in the same state as before the vote .
This time around , members of the department took their time , visiting other tea gardens , talking to experts and sitting down with Japantown leaders before crafting the request for bids .
Everyone now seems to agree that it does n't matter who wins the concession as long as they know what they 're doing .
" The community is most interested in seeing an authentic experience at the tea garden , " said Bob Hamaguchi , executive director of the Japantown Task Force , a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Japanese heritage in San Francisco .
" It does n't matter if it 's a Japanese operator .
The No. 1 concern is the proper display of Japanese culture and traditions . "
The winning bidder will , of course , have to make money for the city .
In recent years , the tea house has earned the city about $ 200,000 a year through rent payments and a percentage of revenues made at the tea house , gift shop and nearby bus parking lot .
The city also collected about $ 1.6 million last year in entrance fees .
The new operator will have to pay at least $ 180,00o a year in rent , plus an undetermined percentage of concession revenues .
The owner also will have to pay into a fund that will be used for maintenance of the garden .
Margot Shaub , the park department 's director of partnerships , said the new request for bids " throws a wide net " - the agency is asking for ideas on what products the new managers should offer and how they plan to bring traditional activities or programs to the garden .
The department is requiring applicants to be specific about their plans .
" We want to know , ' What 's the business opportunity ? '
How they will drive more revenue so the concessionaire can make a living , and so can we , " she said .
One of the challenges for the current operator has been balancing what 's traditional with what sells , said Vince Lo , whose family also holds the concession at Coit Tower .
" We now dedicate a whole section of the gift shop to selling books about Japanese gardens and origami , even though they do n't really make money , " he said .
Lo said his family will look at the new request for bids and is likely to apply to stay at the tea garden .
If the commission votes today to allow the request for bids , applications will be due by Jan. 8 , and a decision will be made by March .
The five - year lease probably will begin on April 1 .
Senate return will hold challenges for McCain
The tone of his campaign angered many Dems , though some are already moving on

John McCain has been here before , coming up short in a presidential race like so many senators before him and staring at a less - than - triumphant return to the Senate .
But the circumstances this time are vastly different .
In 2000 , McCain was welcomed back almost as a hero after he ended his primary campaign against George W. Bush .
He was prized for his openness , sought out by fellow Republicans for his endorsement and respected for the national following he had built in his gutsy effort against the future president .
There was a sense that he had been wronged , dragged down by scurrilous attacks when he had reached for a higher tone in politics .
Now it is McCain and his campaign who have been criticized as trying to paint President - elect Barack Obama as a pal to terrorists and a socialist in Democratic clothing .
In this campaign , McCain 's freewheeling relationship with the press was badly strained , he was accused of pandering to conservatives , and party strategists said he damaged the prospects of other Republicans on the ballot .
As a result , his colleagues are wondering which John McCain will be returning to the Senate for a term that extends two more years .
Will it be the John McCain who was an enthusiastic coalition builder , dealmaker and central figure in Congress , one as apt to tweak Republicans as much as Democrats ?
Or the John McCain who seemed so dismissive of Obama , who spent considerable time assailing the opposition rather than making his own case and who to many seemed to become what he had once disdained ?
" John is going to have to make a decision , " said Sen. Kent Conrad , D - N.D.
" I think he will make the right choice and pitch in . "
Many of his colleagues say they believe the same , that McCain will quickly reassert himself in the Senate and could , if he so chooses , be a valuable asset to Obama as the new administration seeks to move its agenda on the economy , national security , immigration and climate change , among other issues .
" If President - elect Obama lives up to his rhetoric to reach across party lines , and I hope that he will , he is going to need John McCain , " said Sen.
Susan Collins , R - Maine , a longtime ally of McCain's .
" He is going to be a real player . "
In his concession speech on Tuesday night , McCain said he was ready to do his part .
" These are difficult times for our country , and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face , " he said of Obama , in a speech that many Democrats hailed as promising for its conciliatory tone .
Longtime associates of McCain 's say they expect him to play a constructive role in the Senate and not sulk in the aftermath of defeat or try to undermine Obama .
" It is just not in his nature to stand still , " said one longtime adviser who would talk about the Senate return only if he was not quoted by name .
But there is serious fence - mending to be done .
Plenty of harsh words were expressed over the course of recent months , and many Senate Democrats were angered by what they interpreted as a lack of respect for Obama from the McCain campaign and the senator 's own warnings about the dire perils of liberal Democratic government .
Some of the hatchets are quickly being buried .
Sen. Harry Reid , D - Nev. , the Senate majority leader , spoke by telephone with McCain on Friday ; according to an aide , they agreed to put the attacks of the last few months behind them .
Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , said he expects his colleague to get back on track .
" He has been here a long time , " Dodd said , " and people have had their relationships with him , including good ones over the years .
And ultimately that is what you remember , and that is what will prevail . "
Republicans say it is unlikely that McCain will bear the blame for party losses in the House and Senate , with most attributing them to miserable economic conditions and President Bush 's unpopularity .
" He should come back OK , " said Sen. Pete Domenici , R - N.M .
" He did the best a Republican could do .
The headwinds were just enormous . "
A sumo wrestler who was banned for life after allegedly smoking marijuana stunned the ancient sport again yesterday with accusations that he had been forced to throw bouts in exchange for cash .
" I was forced to accept money and put in unfair bouts , " said Russian - born Wakanoho , who is suing the Japan sumo association in an attempt to rescue his career .
" If I refused I was bullied .
I want to make the sumo world clean again . "
The association is suing Shukan Gendai , a weekly magazine , for defamation after it printed allegations of match - fixing last year .
The sport is also reeling from revelations of widespread physical abuse following the death last year of a teenage recruit who had been badly beaten by other wrestlers on the orders of their coach .
Wakanoho , one of three Russian wrestlers to have been expelled for alleged drug use in the past few weeks , said he would give more details about modern sumo 's malaise when he testifies in court on behalf of Shukan Gendai later this week .
The 20 - year - old , whose real name is Soslan Gagloev , denied smoking marijuana after a cigarette containing the drug was found in his wallet last month , but said others in the sumo world indulged with impunity .
" As far as marijuana is concerned , the bosses and wrestlers who are smoking it are not being punished , " he said .
A lot has been written about Sarah Palin ’s and John McCain ’s disturbing ties to anti-semites .
And today , even more problems for John McCain and Sarah Palin , now from the ADL .
The Anti-Defamation League , probably the lead organization in charge of fighting anti-Semitism , hatred , prejudice and bigotry , today condemned pro-McCain Republicans in Pennsylvania for trivializing the Holocaust ( via email ) :
The Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) today condemned an e-mail message sent to Jewish voters in Pennsylvania , reportedly paid for by the “ Republican Federal Committee of PA – Victory 2008 . ”
The e-mail suggested that a vote for Barack Obama would be a “ tragic mistake , ” and “ Jewish Americans cannot afford to make the wrong decision , ” adding that “ many of our ancestors ignored similar warning signs in the 1930s and 1940s . ”
Abraham H. Foxman , ADL National Director and a Holocaust survivor , issued the following statement from Poland , where he is traveling with an Israel Defense Force delegation visiting Auschwitz and other historical sites associated with the Holocaust :
The next time you drive to the gas station , only to find prices are still sky high compared to just a few years ago , take notice of the rows of foreclosed houses you 'll pass along the way .
They may seem like two parts of a spell of economic bad luck , but high gas prices and home foreclosures are actually very much interrelated .
Before most people were even aware there was an economic crisis , investment managers abandoned failing mortgage - backed securities and looked for other lucrative investments .
What they settled on was oil futures .
An oil future is simply a contract between a buyer and seller , where the buyer agrees to purchase a certain amount of a commodity -- in this case oil -- at a fixed price [ source : CFTC ] .
Futures offer a way for a purchaser to bet on whether a commodity will increase in price down the road .
Once locked into a contract , a futures buyer would receive a barrel of oil for the price dictated in the future contract , even if the market price was higher when the barrel was actually delivered .

­ As in all cases , Wall Street heard the word " bet " and flocked to futures , taking the market to strange new places on the fringe of legality .
In the 19th and early 20th centuries it bet on grain .
In the 21st century it was oil .
Despite U.S. petroleum reserves being at an eight - year high , the price of oil rose dramatically beginning in 2006 .
While demand rose , supply kept pace .
Yet , prices still skyrocketed .
This means that the laws of supply and demand no longer applied in the oil markets .
Instead , an artificial market developed .
Artificial markets are volatile ; they 're difficult to predict and can turn on a dime .
As a result of the artificial oil market , the average price per barrel of crude oil increased from $ 31.61 in July 2004 to $ 137.11 in July 2008 [ source : DOE ] .
The average cost for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the United States grew from $ 1.93 to $ 4.09 over the same period [ source : DOE ] .

If you were watching the third Presidential debate , you may have noticed that John McCain had hit on a new line of attack : Barack Obama wants to " redistribute wealth . "
To those of us who interpret phrases by attaching meanings to the individual words within them , this comes off as pretty weak sauce .
Of course Barack Obama wants the government to redistribute wealth ; so does John McCain .
That 's one of the things that government does .
Every time the government takes money in the form of taxes or fees , or spends money on social services or public works or anything else at all , it redistributes wealth .
Most obviously , we have a progressive tax system : people with higher incomes ( supposedly ) pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes .
This is nothing new , and no mainstream candidate for national office proposes to do away with it .
Admittedly , as a country we are not very good at redistributing wealth .
The gap between rich and poor in the U.S. is larger than in any other developed country .
And progressive taxation is n't nearly what it appears at first blush :
Even in the United States , the rich pay a disproportionate share of the federal income tax , which mildly reduces inequality .
Other taxes , however , like Social Security , are regressive : the rich pay a lesser share .
Thus , the upper tenth of households pay 70 percent of the income tax , but only 52 percent of all federal taxes .
State sales taxes make the system even more regressive , because poorer people spend a higher share of their total income on them .
Kevin Hassett , of the American Enterprise Institute , estimates that a family of four earning $ 50,000 pays exactly the same share of its income ( 30 percent ) on taxes as one earning $ 150,000 .
There 's little question that Obama 's policies would be slightly more redistributive than the status quo .
Most obviously , he wants to raise taxes on the upper few percent of earners , and cut taxes to the middle class ; he also proposes to expand health care coverage quite a bit .
These are concrete policy proposals that are squarely in the mainstream of popular debate -- his health care proposal was notably less ambitious than those of Hillary Clinton or John Edwards -- but are certainly arguable ; a freeze on health - care spending and a giant tax cut for the wealthiest Americans is also squarely within the mainstream of popular debate .
Here is the graph of the impact that Obama 's and McCain 's tax proposals would have on different income groups :
Obama 's plan would hit the upper 1 % , who benefited the most from Bush 's tax cuts , and it would lighten the burden on the lower 80 % ; McCain 's help is targeted at the top 20 % , and ( by virtue of not raising taxes on anyone ) would cost an extra trillion dollars over ten years .
Given what passes for a mainstream consensus in contemporary U.S. politics , the choice between these two options is considered to be a close one .
So there is nothing crazy or desperate about criticizing Obama 's proposals on the merits .
But McCain and his supporters are n't fretting over graphs of the growth of American inequality , or even over the distribution of tax rates .
They are fretting over this , the histogram of likely electoral - college outcomes from fivethirtyeight.com :
As a response to this stark reality , they have decided to seize upon " redistribute wealth " not in terms of the actual meaning of its actual words , but as a slogan of SECRET SOCIALISM .
For whatever reasons -- this is a matter for future psychohistorians , not for humble physicist / bloggers -- a substantial segment of right - wing punditry refuses to believe that Barack Obama is what he says he is , or what he has actually acted like his entire adult life : a thoughtful center - left politician .
They have no doubt that he is
the most radical figure ever to come this close to the Presidency
.
Obama 's entire campaign is built on class warfare and human envy .
The " change " he peddles is not new .
We 've seen it before .
It is change that diminishes individual liberty for the soft authoritarianism of socialism ...
Unlike past Democrat presidential candidates , Obama is a hardened ideologue .
He 's not interested in playing around the edges .
He seeks " fundamental change , " i.e. , to remake society .
To these folks , " redistribute wealth " is n't a straightforward description of how the government operates under the present system .
Rather , it 's a slip of the tongue , revealing the dictatorship - of - the - proletariat leanings hidden behind the nonthreatening exterior .
And here is the revealing moment to which McCain was referring in that debate , when Obama explains to Joe the Plumber how his plans will remake Amerikkka as a socialist utopia :
Whew .
Scary .
This sort of wild - eyed communism is just what leads to endorsements from the Financial Times .
Which is why McCain 's allies are crowing with glee over the discovery of a 2001 radio interview with Obama , in which he again uses the phrase " redistributive change , " which is not precisely the same but close enough .
Here is the kind of reaction this dramatic finding is receiving :
We have , in our storied history , elected Democrats and Republicans , liberals and conservatives and moderates .
We have fought , and will continue to fight , pitched battles about how best to govern this nation .
But we have never , ever in our 232 - year history , elected a president who so completely and openly opposed the idea of limited government , the absolute cornerstone of makes the United States of America unique and exceptional .
If this does not frighten you — regardless of your political affiliation — then you deserve what this man will deliver with both houses of Congress , a filibuster - proof Senate , and , to quote Senator Obama again , " a righteous wind at our backs . "
That a man so clear in his understanding of the Constitution , and so opposed to the basic tenets it provides against tyranny and the abuse of power , can run for president of the United States is shameful enough .
We ’re just getting started .
You can listen to the entire interview here , in RealPlayer .
As an Obama supporter , all I can say is : please listen .
( The interview was conducted on the late , lamented WBEZ program Odyssey , hosted by the redoubtable Gretchen Helfrich .
Other Obama appearances here . )
The response of any non-crazy person to that interview would be " Hmm , he sounds like a thoughtful guy .
It sure would be nice to have someone as President who understood some of the nuances of separation of powers and the role of the Supreme Court in the federal government . "
Because that 's all the interview is about .
Obama is talking about the role of the Warren Court in the civil rights movement .
He makes a simple and true point , one that conservatives should love to hear : policy - making should not be done through the courts .
The Warren Court , he says , was not very radical , even if it was painted as such at the time ; it was essentially reactive , and that 's always going to be a feature of the appellate court system .
If you actually want to enact substantive changes that have a chance of sticking , the right mechanism is political action and the passage of legislation , not relying on the courts to fix things .
You know , I ’m not optimistic about bringing about major redistributive change through the courts .
The institution just is n’t structured that way .
[ snip ]
You start getting into all sorts of separation of powers issues , you know , in terms of the court monitoring or engaging in a process that essentially is administrative and takes a lot of time .
You know , the court is just not very good at it , and politically , it ’s just very hard to legitimize opinions from the court in that regard .
Communist !
Oh wait , sorry , that did n't seem very communist at all .
The above quote is in response to a question from a caller , who wants to know whether the Court is " the appropriate place for reparative economic work to change place . "
And Obama 's response is : no .
Hardly very dramatic , really .
As David Berstein at the Volokh Conspiracy , usually a reliably conservative voice , puts it :
The whole interview is worth listening to for another reason : Obama gives a very impressive performance as a constitutional scholar .
Even though he was holding down other jobs while teaching at Chicago , he clearly had thought a lot about constitutional history , and how social change is or is not brought about through the courts ...
What I do n't understand is why this is surprising , or interesting enough to be headlining Drudge [ UPDATE : Beyond the fact that Drudge 's headline suggests , wrongly , that Obama states that the Supreme Court should have ordered the redistribution of income ; as Orin says , his views on the subject , beyond that it was an error to promote this agenda in historical context , are unclear . ] .
At least since the passage of the first peacetime federal income tax law about 120 years ago , redistribution of wealth has been a ( maybe the ) primary item on the left populist / progressive / liberal agenda , and has been implicitly accepted to some extent by all but the most libertarian Republicans as well .
Barack Obama is undoubtedly liberal , and his background is in political community organizing in poor communities .
Is it supposed to be a great revelation that Obama would like to see wealth more " fairly " distributed than it is currently ?
It 's true that most Americans , when asked by pollsters , think that it 's emphatically not the government 's job to redistribute wealth .
But are people so stupid as to not recognize that when politicians talk about a " right to health care , " or " equalizing educational opportunities , " or " making the rich pay a fair share of taxes , " or " ensuring that all Americans have the means to go to college , " and so forth and so on , that they are advocating the redistribution of wealth ?
Is it okay for a politician to talk about the redistribution of wealth only so long as you do n't actually use phrases such as " redistribution " or " spreading the wealth , " in which case he suddenly becomes " socialist " ?
If so , then American political discourse , which I never thought to be especially elevated , is in even a worse state than I thought .
It is in a worse state , Prof. Bernstein !
You have every right to be concerned about that .
The generous reading of the spectacle of right - wing pundits leaping on the word " redistribute " is that it serves as a litmus test -- to most people , it 's straightforwardly descriptive , but to a certain segment of the punditocracy that has long been convinced that Obama is a closet radical , it 's a rare glimpse at the socialist core of this man 's being .
The less - generous reading ( depending on one 's preferred mode of generosity ) is that they know exactly what they are doing , and they understand perfectly well that Obama is not any more socialist than any other mainstream Democrat , but they are desperate to sling poop around and hope that something sticks , because the electoral college prognostications are not good .
If those prognostications hold true , and Obama wins on November 4 , the conservative movement is going to have to do some serious soul - searching .
Do they want to engage politically with the other side and discuss different policy options on the merits , or do they prefer the screeching - monkey approach ?
Do thoughtful economic free - marketers want to continue to tie their hopes for success at the ballot box to goggle - eyed know - nothing social conservatives , or do they want to try to construct a winning coalition among intellectually respectable lines ?
Politics is cyclical , and there is no question that conservatives will bounce back .
But it 's not clear how quickly it will happen , or what form the resurgence will take ; that 's up to them .
Clark said she felt certain this was what the patient had .
But the other doctors caring for the patient were skeptical .
Every year thousands of patients develop some kind of encephalitis .
It ’s quite likely that some small percentage of these patients will have one of these common cysts , and yet , for most , the two conditions will be completely unrelated .
There have been only a handful of cases that have linked a teratoma and encephalitis over the past 11 years .
The odds of this patient falling into that category were infinitesimally small .
But Clark persisted .
A sample of the patient ’s blood was sent to the author of the paper to have him look for the antibody he found in his patients .
If that test was positive , then they would take out the tumor .
For the next two weeks , Clark checked for the results daily .
She eventually discovered that the blood was never tested .
Clark almost cried with frustration .
While they had been waiting for these results , the patient became even sicker .
Another OB - GYN , Dr. Rebecca Kolp , was now in charge of Clark ’s team .
Clark sought out the doctor and described the patient and what she ’d found in her research .
She told her about the lost test .
Should they wait another two weeks , or should they operate now ?
Kolp thought about it for only a moment .
The intern made a strong case , and although it seemed an unlikely diagnosis , Kolp thought it was worth the risk .
Would the girl ’s mother be willing to let them operate on her daughter ?
The mother agreed to the operation immediately .
The girl had been sick for so long and seemed only to be getting worse .
That afternoon , Kolp removed the tumor .
3. RESOLUTION
The next morning it was still dark when Clark arrived at the I.C.U .
As she entered the patient ’s room she called out the young woman ’s name in a hushed voice .
No response .
The doctor checked the surgical site — it looked fine — and then tried once more to rouse the young woman .
No change .
Her heart sank .
In the paper she ’d read , recovery was rapid — often within hours of the operation .
At rounds , Clark told Kolp that the patient was no better .
The attending physician was disappointed but not surprised .
They had done all they could .
But later that morning Kolp phoned Clark .
“ Rachel , you ’re not going believe this , ” she reported excitedly .
“ Your patient is awake . ”
Clark sprinted up the stairs , arriving at the patient ’s room out of breath .
And there she was — awake , alert , fully dressed .
Her mother was beaming .
“ Can you believe it ? ” she said and laughed giddily .
The patient looked at her mother , looked at Clark and then she laughed , too .
Her voice was raspy , and her words were slow , but she was awake ; she was talking .
About a week later she was discharged .
Recovery was slow , but after several months she went back to work .
Rachel Clark was elated .
Just a few months into her residency , she diagnosed a rare disease , one that she figured she would never see again .
She was wrong .
A year later another patient arrived with the same story of headache , psychosis and coma .
A CT scan revealed a teratoma , and she was operated on the next day .
This patient also recovered .
It ’s worrisome , Kolp said .
“ It makes you wonder how many other woman are languishing out there who might be saved . ”
Cisco announced the launch of its Global Talent Acceleration Program in Bangalore , India .
GTAP is a long - term Cisco initiative aimed at creating Cisco ’s next - generation local engineering and sales talent in India and other emerging countries .
Through the GTAP in India , Cisco plans to train Indian engineering students at the CCIE level , the highest stage professional certification offered by Cisco .
Cisco Learning Solutions Partners , Datacraft , Fast Lane Global Knowledge , and NIIT will act as Cisco ’s initial primary partner delivery organizations in India .
“ India , which is at the centre of Cisco ’s globalisation strategy , is experiencing tremendous growth , and the demand for technical talent undoubtedly exceeds supply .
The development of a sustainable talent pipeline , with market - ready skills , is imperative to sustain momentum , ” said Leo Scrivner , vice president of human resources for Cisco Services and the Globalisation Centre East .
“ The launch of the Global Talent Acceleration Program in India reiterates our commitment to both incubating skills and developing our top talent here that will respond to the market needs immediately . ”
GTAP is designed as a rigorous 37 - week program that combines classroom training , industry exposure and hands - on experience .
The program offers two tracks : Professional , aimed at students with three to five years ’ experience , and Associate , for fresh graduates .
Initially , these students will be recruited for work at Cisco ’s Bangalore Technical Assistance Centre as well as Cisco ’s Bangalore Advanced Services Worldwide Service Provider practices organization .
An example of Global Talent Acceleration Program Success Story ?
Mr. Ziad Alghamdi .
“ I started the program with basic networking knowledge , and now after 5 months , I ’ve passed the CCNA , CCDA , CCNP , and the CCIE written exams .
It seemed like an impossible mission on the first day of the program , but here I am making it real and possible .
Within the Technical Assistance Center ( Cisco TAC ) , real life scenarios are experienced case by case .
The feeling is indescribable when connecting the pure technical lessons to the life network of the Cisco customers and to see their reaction when I make a difference .
I cannot wait to work on the next case with another customer .
I remember wondering about joining the program and how beneficial starting such a track at this period of my life would be .
Now , after only 5 months , I understand why .
By achieving my goals with all of Cisco ’s support what I have is a life - time opportunity that cannot be missed . ”

“ Fuzzy logic ” is a way of describing situations that cannot be described in absolutes : yes or no , true or false , white rice or brown .
Fuzzy logic is used in automated technology that must sense and adjust for various factors , like mixing cement ( depends on humidity ) and changing traffic lights ( depends on traffic ) .
In rice cookers , fuzzy logic can take into account the type of grain , its age and hardness and its desired consistency .
Frequent rice cooks who work with a variety of grains and have room on the countertop will not be disappointed by the performance of these machines .
Inexpensive rice cookers with just two settings can handle many of the same tasks , though they require more attention .
A mastery of regular binary logic is quite sufficient to operate these simpler models , but the initial process of measuring the rice and water can be mystifying .
There are many recipes for rice cooker dishes , on the Internet and in books like “ The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook ” ( Harvard Common Press , 2002 ) , but many of them are really recipes for steaming , or involve other pots and appliances .
The most intriguing recipes are those that have been developed , out of necessity or curiosity , entirely for the rice cooker , like the ones here .
Hui Leng Tay , a food blogger in Singapore , is unusually committed to her rice cooker , having developed recipes for fried rice , bibimbap , Thai tom yum rice and many others at teczcape.blogspot.com .
She sees herself as seeking the elusive grail of cooks everywhere : the make - ahead , not - too - unhealthy , tasty meal .
“ I try to figure out which ingredients get better when kept over low heat for a long time , like cabbage and onions , and which ones get droopy , ” she said .
Shabnam Rezaei , an editor and producer , who grew up in Tehran in the 1970s and now lives in New York and Vancouver , said that a fundamental expectation for women in Iran is the ability to make tender , fluffy rice .
“ There are all kinds of jokes in Farsi about how women must keep their eyes on the rice pot or they will not find a husband , ” she said .
Making Persian rice correctly requires the cook to rinse and soak the grains , parboil them , dump them out , oil the pot , put the rice back and steam it , covered with a towel , until tender and surrounded by a golden crust on the bottom and sides called the tahdig .
It is perhaps not surprising that rice cookers , with a built - in tahdig function , have become standard in Iran .
“ In a culture where rice is so important , such a staple , ” she said , “ the rice cooker can bring a kind of liberation for women . ”
Ratios in Translation
Rice cookers are usually sold with a plastic measuring cup that holds about three - quarters of an American cup .
It is the size of the traditional Japanese tool for measuring rice : the masu , a wooden box sometimes used for drinking cold sake .
“ Measuring seems to be the most difficult part for our American buyers , ” said Marilyn Matsuba , the American marketing manager for Zojirushi , the company that sells the most rice cookers in Japan .
She said cooks can use the same proportions as when cooking rice in a pot .
A ratio of two cups liquid to one cup long - grain rice will work ; for short - grain rice , the ratio of water to rice is about one and a quarter cup to one cup .
An Asian measuring method is surprisingly reliable : with the tip of the index finger resting on the top of the rice , add water until it rises just above the first knuckle .
A rice cooker can accommodate easygoing approaches to measurement , because its long steam bath evens the texture of the rice .
( Adds action by Standard & Poor ’s , rewrites throughout )
NEW YORK , Oct 23 ( Reuters ) - Standard & Poor 's on Thursday slashed its ratings on the New York Times Co NYT.N into junk territory and cited concerns about the newspaper publisher 's revenue outlook , after it posted a third - quarter loss .
Moody ’s Investors Service also said it may follow the move , adding the publisher faces risks in refinancing its debt .
The New York Times posted a quarterly loss from continuing operations on Thursday and said advertising revenue at its news media group dropped 16 percent for the quarter .
For details , see [ ID : nN23398087 ]
S&P said a likely U.S. recession will exacerbate declining advertising revenues and prolong the time until the declines will be made more manageable , possibly until 2010 .
Until advertising declines are moderated the publisher will not be able to execute revenue strategies and cost cutting measures that are key to stabilizing its earnings , the rating agency added .
“ It is our estimate that the company ’s total revenue will decline in the mid-teens percentage area in 2008 year over year , and that earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( after buyout expenditures ) will decline by more than 30 percent in 2008 and by about an additional 30 percent well into 2009 , ” S&P said .
It cut the Times ’ rating three notches to “ BB - minus , ” three levels below investment grade , from “ BBB - minus . ”
The outlook is negative , indicating an additional cut may be likely over the next one - to - two years .
Moody ’s said it may cut the company from “ Baa , ” the lowest investment grade .
Rating downgrades into junk territory can substantially increase a company ’s borrowing costs .
Newspaper advertising market conditions are likely to remain challenging in 2009 and continuing revenue declines will make it difficult for the company to bring its credit metrics in line with its investment - grade rating , Moody ’s said in a statement .
It will also make it hard for the publisher to execute its plans to improve liquidity , Moody ’s added .
Risks from refinancing maturing debt also prompted the review for downgrade , the rating agency said .
The Times said it is looking for ways to reduce its debt , but said it is a difficult time to make asset sales .
The cost to insure the company ’s debt with credit default swaps rose to 501.5 basis points on Thursday , or $ 501,500 per year for five years to insure $ 10 million in debt , from 460 basis points on Wednesday , according to Markit Intraday .

There are a lot of young gay men and lesbians out there who need an open mind to accept them so that they can accept themselves
I did n’t know it wasto be there in these situations .
I just did what all the other girls did .
What a follower I was , sheesh .
( * LOL ) Hey I did n’t know any better – what did I know in the 5th grade ??
Then in the 6th grade I went into middle school , and oh boy was my Gaydar WAY off that year !
I had a girl in my class ( who shall remain nameless ) approach me with a letter .
In the letter she told me how she never felt this way with anyone before and wanted to be my best friend .
( hmmm … )
Well , right around the same time a boy in my class wrote me a letter to the same effect , just not as poetically and he was asking to be my boyfriend .
Well I did n’t see anything wrong with having a best friend and a boyfriend so I said yes to both .
I did n’t understand it at the time , but this caused conflict and jealous feelings between the two of them .
Our school was having a fair which included a ‘ marriage booth ’ .
My best friend wanted to take a picture with me , my boyfriend wanted to marry me .
So what did I do ?
I avoided the conflict and married the next guy that came along of course !
Hahaha Remember , I was in the 6th grade .
In retrospect , I can see just how off the mark I was with my feelings and attractions , and I wonder how I could have been so blind ?
I was completely unaware of the fact that I had an affinity for girls , even though I did in fact have an affinity for girls .
As the years went on , I pretty much said yes to any boy that wanted to be my boyfriend .
Part of this was out of pure curiosity , but I mostly said yes just to be polite .
Mama was big on manners .
But the ‘ funny feeling ’ , well , it was mostly only there when I would see an attractive girl .
I told myself I was just looking at her hair , her clothes , her style – and I was .
I was just in denial that I was looking at those things because of anything other than physical attraction .
Checking girls out was for research purposes ; purely fashion related of course .
It just did n’t click in my head that “ Hey stupid , you like girls . ”
It just did n’t occur as a possibility to me that two women could have a relationship the same as a man and woman do .
I guess it did n’t help that my parents never presented the option .
They mostly instilled the idea of going to school , getting married , and having kids .
I guess because the gay community is at a loss when it comes to natural reproduction , the thought never occurred to my parents that becoming a lesbian might possibly be an option for me .
Well let me tell you my friends , they missed a BIG component when they overlooked the gay possibility , and I learned to look for love with a man .
But for some reason , things just were n’t working out .
We could n’t see eye to eye .
Here I was a grown woman with two children of my own and I did n’t realize that the reason I was n’t happy with my husband was because I really wanted a wife .
Things got really nutty here and I thought I could solve the problem and fix my marriage by pro-claiming myself ‘ bi ’ .
I was a married woman who had girlfriends .
My parents were happy that I was keeping up with their charade , and my husband was happy that I was keeping up with his .
But there was one thing I forgot to factor in , and that was my kids .
By not staying true to myself and compromising I had brought them into a totally chaotic situation and there was only one way to make things right – I stood up for myself .
I showed them that it does n’t matter who you love , as long as you legitimately love them ; and that you ca n’t love another until you find a way to love yourself .
Now I ’ve found my true life partner , another ‘ daddy ’ for my kids , and one helluva human being in my ‘ wife ’ .
I totally scored and so did my kids !
We ’ve grown a lot together and she ’s really made the difference in how I perceive myself .
I am finally able to tell the world I am gay and not wince , LOL .
It ’s been a journey from the straight side to the life of a lesbian , yet I ’ve found my Rainbow Pride and joined the Same Sex Marriage band - wagon .
I know this because I recently made the mistake of thinking another mom at the kids ’ school was a lesbian .
I asked her “ Are you from a two - mommy family ? ”
She said very matter - of - factly that her mom was as close to a second mom her son was going to get .
Whoops .
Now I just keep my mouth shut and smile .
Having lived the straight life and the lesbian life , I have felt the change in perception that people have had about me .
Plus , most people assume that I am straight , and when they find out I am a lesbian they usually say , “ Oh ” , like “ Oh I ’m sorry ” Or “ Oh that ’s too bad ” .
It ’s like being able to tell someone ’s race over the phone , or tell what religion they are by what clothes they are wearing .
Does it change the content of the person ?
Will you treat them differently once you ’ve discovered their orientation ?
I do n’t know who is gay any more than I know who is straight , and I decided that I really do n’t care !
We were n’t all made to be clones , the fact that we are unique is a given .
So rather than judging differences we need to celebrate them instead .
If your Gaydar does n’t work , its okay , you ’ll get along just fine without it as long as you avoid being naive and judgmental .
If you ’ve got working Gaydar , you do n’t know how lucky you are to have it , especially if you are gay , but I beg you to please use it for good and not evil !- enough said .

Take few minutes and actually write a cover letter .
It just screams “ lazy ” if you do n’t .
Be sure to use the old F7 key .
It amazing how much nonsensical gibberish someone who is careless can put in a cover letter .
This is an actual quote from a cover letter for a Marketing Manager I received yesterday , “ … your career posting for immediately caught my attention . ” .
Fucking brilliant .
You would think something as important as your cover letter would glean a bit more attention .
Rants & Raves on craigs - who gives a fuck if your syntax is perfect .
Your resume should be given more care .
Check the email address you are sending from .
Is it an inside joke ?
Is it your wife ’s / boyfriend ’s / fuck puppet ’s ?
Is it an actual reflection of the first impression you want to make ?
If not , there are a zillion places to get a free email address that is .
I seldom consider resumes from Ms_Thang or pigdaddy .
I do n’t care if you have kids , what your marital status , height , weight or nation of origin is .
Keep it to yourself , Skippy .
If anything on your resume could be used in a discrimination suit , remove it .
Especially the kid references .
I do n’t give a shit if you have extra mouths at home .
Your choice , your problem .
Talent , not sympathy , is what gets you in the door .
If you have a template cover letter , make sure that your cut & paste job is formatted correctly and any reference to a specific job or company actually marry to who you are sending the resume to .
I ca n’t count the number of resumes I get with an obvious cut & paste that did n’t translate word wrap .
If your document is wider than my screen , into the bin you go .
If you tell me how much you want to work at Cisco or Seibel – or any of the other bazillion companies that are n’t mine , into the bin .
Do not pass go , continue to collect unemployment .
Resist the urge to put your photo on your resume .
The photo is always awful and it emits this desperate , creepy vibe .
Double plus true if you are actually desperate and send in your photo for every job I post , no matter what department .
If I set up a call – BE THERE .
Preferably on a land line .
Giving me your full attention .
Chasing the kids , answering email , or dropping my call 5 times is unprofessional .
Take 4 seconds & type the position you are applying for in the subject line .
Make sure it is actually the title for the position I am recruiting for .
You would think this would be a no- brainer , but I get this mystery shit everyday .
If you do n’t bother , why should I ?
Do not send a .zip file .
I consider you to be a virus and delete you immediately .
Always put your resume in the body of the email .
I know your attachment has the pretty lay out and all of the tables and borders .
All of those annoying formatting things that get fucked up when I move your resume over into Outlook .
Give me a plain text version , bring your polished version to the interview .
That ’s right , BRING YOUR RESUME to your interview .
A copy for each person you are going to meet .
Trust me on this , I ’m a professional .
Use a font that is actually readable .
This is email .
I ca n’t tell if your resume is one page or not .
So let ’s up the font size from 8 .
The whole one page resume is passé anyway .
Actually be qualified for the position you are applying to .
If my job ad states that 2 + years at an online ecommerce company are mandatory , and you are a used dildo salesman from Indiana , perhaps you should be looking at opportunities elsewhere .
Having an MBA does not mean you are qualified in any way shape or form for the real world unless you have experience to back it up .
The universities really need to stop telling you that as a fresh grad you are worth 85 K .
You are worth dick without relevant experience .
If you quit your lucrative career as the receptionist at the Liz Arden day spa to go back to school , be prepared to take a 55 K job as a junior financial analyst and stop applying for Director roles .
This is not 1999 .
Everyone thinks they can do customer service or marketing .
This is simply untrue .
Selling phones at the Cingular booth in the mall does not qualify you for a position in affiliate marketing .
Send your fucking resume in when you apply for a job .
Not a link to some geocities , freehost , slow loading , ad heavy , piece of crap community server .
Ctrl+DEL immediately .
Should you be someone who is submitting portfolio work –spend a few bucks and get a domain .
And cut back on the flash if you do n’t have bandwidth .
If it takes more than 10 seconds from my T - 1 your work remains unseen .
NEVER refer to yourself in the third person .
I groan every time some fat head sends in a resume that reads , “ Larry is an exceptional sales monkey .
Larry had beat quota by 4000 % every minute of his existence , because Larry is so freaking awesome . ” .
Hey asshat , you ’re writing the resume Not some underling .
This is not a job reference from on high – it is you promoting yourself .
You self - important jack ass .
Why in the hell would anyone hire such an annoyance ?
I am not a total raging bitch .
I try and let candidates who follow up with me and who are not qualified for the position know why they are not being invited in for interviews .
I am specific .
Sometimes resumes are not a true reflection of skill set .
I understand that .
If someone is enthusiastic enough about the position to follow up , I take the time and walk thru my concerns or issues and let them submit a rebuttal .
Often this is a productive exchange and the candidate gets a better grasp of what we are looking for and I get a better idea of what they bring to the table .
However , there is always that segment of the herd that thinks stubborn muscle is going to get them into the door .
I am the gatekeeper .
Respect that .
It is my job to screen out the under - qualified , the nut - bunnies , the pricks and the princesses .
I am intimately aware of what we are looking for in an employee .
Attempting to go around me via a department head , mailing your resume to the CEO , or dropping by the office to have it out face to face makes you look like a whiney fucksicle .
No one wants to work with a whiney fucksicle .
This approach is not going to get you anywhere .
It really is not hard to stand out in the stack of resumes .
90 % of everything is crap – music , movies , cars , people .
Do n’t be stupid & you are instantly ahead of the game .
WASHINGTON --
This year 's flood of newly registered voters heavily favor Sen.
Barack Obama in the presidential contest , but they wo n't necessarily show up to support him on Election Day , a new survey indicates .
A nationwide poll of Americans who are eligible to vote for the first time , or who skipped the previous election but are registered now , found that they back Sen. Obama over Sen. John McCain by a margin of 61 % to 30 % .
( See full poll findings . )
The survey , conducted by the Wall Street Journal , NBC News and the MySpace networking Web site , also found these voters have distinctly more positive impressions of Sen.
Obama than any of the other three candidates atop the Democratic and Republican tickets .
But that hardly means the Obama campaign can count on them .
When asked to rank their interest in the Nov. 4 election , just 49 % said they were " very interested . "
By comparison , 70 % of voters of all age groups said they were " very interested , " according to a separate Journal / NBC News national poll taken a week ago .
Moreover , 54 % of the new voters said they would definitely vote Nov. 4 .
“ Southern Drinkways ” was the theme of this year ’s Southern Foodways Alliance Symposium at Ole Miss .
Bourbon , Coca - cola and iced tea were the clichés -- the unexpected discovery was Cruze Farm Churned Buttermilk .
We saw a short film by Joe York about Cruze Farm owner Earl Cruze on Friday night .
The next morning , we got a pint of his buttermilk and some corncakes with cracklins and sorghum syrup for breakfast .
Earl swears that buttermilk is better than Viagra , but more of the symposium attendees I met sought its benefits as a hangover cure .
Cruze Farms in Tennessee is one of a number of Southern dairies that ’s gone back to making old - fashioned buttermilk .
Earl Cruze uses creamy whole milk and churns it hard until little bits of butter form .
It ’s got a richer and creamier flavor than the cultured stuff .
Once upon a time , buttermilk was beloved in the South , mainly because it kept better than sweet milk .
It ’s still favored for making biscuits , baking cakes and dipping chicken in before frying , but not so many people drink it anymore .
Consumption of buttermilk has fallen off by 60 percent in the last 25 years .
But in a recent article in the Atlanta Constitution Journal , John T. Edge interviews dairy farmers who are hoping that buttermilk will soon take off the same way another once - obscure dairy product did .
It was n’t that long ago that yogurt was considered a weird ethnic food , the Southern dairymen point out .
They are banking on a buttermilk comeback .
I drink mine the way my grandfather did , with a little salt and pepper sprinkled on top .
Anybody heard of a Texas dairy making premium buttermilk ?

I think I 've made my feelings about Bill Kristol very clear in the past , but allow me to reiterate :
He is never right .
He is wrong constantly .
Anything and everything he says is a pathetic mix of lies and ignorance .
Now that we 're clear , I have to ask , what will it take before the New York Times realizes that they are paying for utter and complete wrongness to pollute their paper ?
In less than six months since his column began , the New York Times had already issued at least three corrections for factual errors in Bill Kristol columns .
Today , he 's given his editors another reason to keep their red pens close at hand .
Kristol 's assertion that the 9/11 attacks " did not result in a much - feared ( by intellectuals ) wave of popular Islamophobia or xenophobia " in this country will surely come a surprise to the millions of Muslims and immigrants in this country .
This goes against plentiful data and the lived experience of Muslims , Arab Americans and immigrants in our country .
Many Muslim Americans reported increased hostility toward them after 9/11 .
Shockingly , Kristol 's " non-existent " Islamophobia and xenophobia have also proved deadly for a number of Americans who became victims of hate crimes after 9/11 .
( See Divided We Fall for a moving account of this painful reality . )
Considering the amount of xenophobia that Bill Kristol and his PNAC buddies have unleashed on this country in pursuit of their agenda , I 'm surprised he thinks he can write this without bolts of lightening striking him down .
Sarah Palin has gone on the type of journey that is only possible in America .
She came out of nowhere ; a little - known politician from a relatively insignificant state .
As governor of Alaska , she participated in many questionable acts .
She took funding from Congress for a project that was going nowhere , she abused the same earmarks that John McCain claims to fight against , and she has the same kind of shady past that McCain supporters have claimed that Barack Obama has .
So how exactly did she become a GOP superstar ?
The simple fact behind the choice of Palin was that John McCain needed a woman .
It did n’t matter to him who it was ( many more qualified women in the GOP ) , he just had to have a woman .
Now he is allowed to use sexism and the gender card as a firewall against any attacks .
This came at a perfect time for McCain , as people were beginning to accept the fact that being a former prisoner of war does n’t mean he can never be questioned .
Now , McCain can use anything Obama or Biden say against Palin , or even himself , and twist it into sexism .
This poses an instant problem for Obama , who is good with words but cannot possibly tell what can be twisted one way or another , and for Biden , who does n’t exactly have a reputation for saying what people want to hear .
By picking Palin , McCain also dug into two key demographics : young people , and women .
Young Republicans who may have felt alienated when their party passed on Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee for a 70 + year old with a documented history of health issues , are now being excited by the McCain / Palin ticket .
Also , women now view McCain more favorably than before , even though any intelligent women would know that he was attempting to pander to them with the pick of Palin .
A true feminist would never vote McCain , but unfortunately women voters have n’t come as far as we thought they had .
While the pick of Palin should not have worked and on Election Day likely will not work , for now it ’s certainly interesting , and sad , to watch .
" Our attack " ?
What , NY owns the 9/11 attack now ?
It belongs to them and them alone ?
I agree with her message , and I 've noticed it too .
New Yorkers are brave heroes ... until we 're not talking about 9/11 anymore and then all of a sudden they 're elitist , treasonous scum - bags .
But that one line kinda ... twigged me a little .
Now , however , American officials say they have faith in the independence and professionalism of the army , which has become thoroughly integrated to include all of Lebanon ’s many religious and ethnic factions , and has avoided interfering in politics .
American - driven audits have shown that almost nothing given to the army has ended up in Hezbollah ’s hands .
“ They have demonstrated year after year after year that when we give them equipment , they take responsibility for it , ” said Mark T. Kimmitt , assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs .
An important moment for the army came in the summer of 2007 , when it fought and won a three - month battle with Islamists in the Nahr al - Bared Palestinian refugee camp in the northern city of Tripoli .
That struggle , in which 168 soldiers and an unknown number of militants were killed , vividly underscored the need to re-equip the army .
With no combat helicopters or precision weapons , the army had to resort to dropping bombs by hand from its Vietnam - era Huey helicopters , a hopelessly inaccurate method that resulted in the near - leveling of the camp .
Although the United States rushed them 40 loads of C - 17 transport planes full of ammunition and other gear , army commanders bitterly resented the failure to provide them with more sophisticated arms .
“ Nahr al - Bared lasted 105 days , ” said one high - level Lebanese officer involved in procurement issues , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
“ If we had had attack helicopters , it would have been over in 15 days . ”
Another stark illustration of Lebanon ’s new military ambitions , and its gaping needs , is visible right now on the country ’s northern border with Syria .
In recent weeks , after a string of bombings in Tripoli that left 20 people dead  most of them Lebanese soldiers  the military sent 8,000 soldiers to the border to monitor smuggling routes across the northern mountains .
That effort alone was a measure of Lebanon ’s new independence from Syria .
But the border control force was too small , and it lacked necessary equipment , Lebanese military officials say .
The economy has “ crystallized the tradeoffs that consumers are willing to make , ” she said .
“ Fair trade is nice , but fair trade may fall off the shopping list where organic milk may not . ”
Thomas J. Blischok , president of consulting and innovation for Information Resources , a market - research firm , said shoppers were not moving entirely away from categories like organic products in the grocery store .
But they are becoming more selective , buying four or five products instead of seven or eight , he said .
Mr. Blischok conducted a survey of 1,000 consumers in the first half of the year and found that nearly two - thirds said they were cutting back on nonessential groceries and nearly half said they were buying fewer organic products because they were too expensive .
Such consumer attitudes have compounded problems for Whole Foods Market , the Austin , Tex. , chain that served as a launching pad for many organic and natural brands .
The company ’s stock has dropped by more than 70 percent since the first of the year , and analysts expect more grim news when fourth - quarter earnings are announced next week .
Recently in Boston , on the sprawling convention floor of the Natural Products Expo East , some vendors said they had been hurt by the economic malaise and others said they had not yet felt the impact .
Several of them noted that Whole Foods Market faces a broad array of problems , including increased competition from traditional grocers , and should not be viewed as a proxy for the whole industry .
But many also worried that if the economy continues to flounder , consumers — particularly those who only occasionally shop for their products — may decide they can no longer afford to let their conscience dictate their shopping list .
Theresa Marquez , the chief marketing executive for Organic Valley , which sells primarily dairy products , said she was not worried about core customers because they were so committed to buying organic .

In science fiction , aliens frequently mistake fiction for fact , with generally amusing consequences .
We list some aliens who could use a lesson in telling truth from television .
Thermians ( Galaxy Quest ) : The Thermians lack any concept of non-truth .
Not only can they not lie , they have no understanding of fiction .
So when they intercept broadcasts of the popular science fiction series Galaxy Quest , they misinterpret it as historical records of a group of bold space explorers .

The Aliens of Theta VIII ( Star Trek : The Next Generation ) :
When a NASA ship called the Charybdis crashes on Theta VIII , the only survivors are Colonel Stephen Richey and a trashy paperback called Hotel Royale .
Hoping to let Richey live out a normal human life , the planet ’s aliens recreate the novel , one that Richey ironically detested .
Another alien race , the Iotians , also created a society based on a book , but it was a historical record of Chicago mobs , giving them an accurate , if limited , idea of a particular sliver of human society .

ALF ( ALF ) : Stranded on Earth , the alien ALF takes solace in all manner of minor vices : television , gambling , and tabloid magazines .
When he reads in the Weekly Inquisitor that another cat - loving , large - snouted extraterrestrial is living nearby , ALF believes it and demands to go to the alleged alien ’s home .
Of course , plenty of humans make the same mistake all the time .
Harry Solomon ( 3rd Rock From the Sun ) :
The explorers of Ohio ’s favorite alien sitcom family may be advanced , but they tend to miss the nuances of human society .
TV - addled Harry is especially vulnerable to taking things at face value .
He interprets an ad for skin cream – claiming it is “ the fountain of youth ” – literally , and becomes distraught when he learns his mall ’s Santa is n’t the real Saint Nick .

The Goths ( Nemesis the Warlock ) : Influenced by the Earth ’s earliest radio broadcasts , the Gothic Empire models itself on Victorian Britain , creating a strange mesh of English culture and alien technology .
But there little distinction is made between actual 19th century culture and the fictions invented then .
Although many of the people , place , and events found in the empire are real , such as Queen Victoria and the Whitechapel Murders , others are fictional , such as Professor Frankenstein and the Rue Morgue .

Martians ( Spaced Invaders ) :
When Orson Welles broadcast the alien invasion drama
War of the Worlds over the radio , many humans mistook it for a news broadcast of an actual invasion .
In Spaced Invaders , the Martians prove no less gullible , intercepting a rebroadcast of the drama and mistaking it for their marching orders .
They land in Illinois and attempt to take over the world , but soon find they ca n’t even take over a small town .
Glagoliths ( Alien Adventure ) : The Glagoliths travel the universe , seeking a new home planet .
They send a team to Earth to scout it out , but the team first encounters Adventure Planet , a new amusement park .
They mistake the fake alien setting for a real human city , and ride the rides to learn more about Earth ’s culture .

Photonic Aliens ( Star Trek : Voyager ) : Voyager crewmen Tom Paris and Harry Kim like to partake in a retrofuturist holodeck program called “ Captain Proton . ”
But when a group of photonic aliens from another dimension land in the holodeck , they mistake the roleplaying game for reality .
Unfortunately , in some ways it is ; the program ’s evil characters perceive the aliens as a threat , and their light - based weaponry , which is harmless to meat creatures , proves fatal to the accidental photonic tourists .
The Hierarchy ( Star Trek : Voyager ) : Voyager employs the trope a second time when the ship ’s Emergency Holographic Doctor tweaks his own programming to allow himself to daydream .
A technician from a Hierarchy spy ship intercepts the daydream stream instead of Voyager ’s factual broadcasts , misinterpreting Voyager ’s workings through the Doctor ’s imagination .
The Master ( Doctor Who ) : Even Time Lords are susceptible to some fictional misinterpretation .
In “ The Sea Devils , ” the Master finds himself mesmerized by the “ alien creatures ” on the television , only to learn that he is watching the popular children ’s television show The Clangers :

We Do Not Consent - Open Letter To The Media SEND THIS EMAIL TO THE MEDIA ( Note : you will need to look up an email address ) A Public Media Campaign Launched By Dave Berman Of We Do Not Consent
Dear Media Colleagues ,
You are receiving this message because you are known to American progressives as a truth - teller .
In this presidential campaign , despite the typical horse - race coverage , we also see the overall corporate media narrative influenced by daily debunking efforts from candidates ' rapid response teams , the blogosphere , and the reality - based coverage and reporting that you provide .
We need to take this to the next level .
There are three very simple basic facts about the way US federal elections are conducted now , and we think they lead to an inescapable conclusion that must be addressed .
See if you agree :
1 . We have secret corporate vote counting computers counting more than 95 % of the votes cast in the United States ;
2 . The absence of paper ballots , and in some cases state 's law , prevents meaningful re-counts throughout much of the country ;
3 . These electronic voting machines frequently produce results impossible in a legitimate election , such as John Kerry 's negative 25 million votes in Youngstown , OH ( Nov. 2004 ) , or Palm Beach County 's 12,000 votes in excess of the number of voters ( Aug. 2008 ) .
To us this suggests the conclusion that federal election results are unprovable , even though the media reports them as fact .
Can you draw any other conclusion ?
It will surprise nobody this November when the outcome is a spoiled mess , riddled with controversy .
In fact , we can already say the results -- based on the conditions -- are guaranteed to be inconclusive , unknowable and unprovable .
We must challenge our industry to refuse to report as fact what can't be proven and has n't been independently verified , particularly when the only source of the information is the government itself .
The reality is that the media should be the greatest advocates of hand counting paper ballots because this method of counting allows media greatest access to observing and documenting the process , affording the reported results the greatest credibility .
Transparent coverage of a transparent counting process would create a basis for confidence in the reported results where none currently exists .
As we all know , there is a vibrant community of engaged citizens across the US who collectively self - identify as the " election integrity community . "
They are asking us truth - tellers to challenge our industry , essentially reframing the debate .
Many of them have appeared on our shows and in our columns over the past few years , and they are eager to be sources for us now .
But they are also counting on us to take this message forward and we do n't see how we can be truth - tellers without doing that .
Please join us in this concerted effort to use truth - telling yet again to change the corporate media narrative of this presidential campaign .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
Wonder if the world is really paying attention to the U.S. presidential election ?
Look no further than Britain 's betting parlors .
The U.K. gambling industry is expected to rake in around 5 million pounds ( $ 8.1 million ) in bets tied to the 2008 U.S. elections , said Robin Hutchison , a spokesman for Ladbrokes ( LAD ) , Britain 's largest gambling firm .
That 's more than double the amount wagered in 2004 .
Others have estimated U.K. bookmakers could take in as much as 10 million pounds .
That does n't rival an event like the Grand National -- Britain 's premier horse race attracts bets totaling around 250 million pounds -- but it is on par with betting seen in a typical British general election .
The historical implications of the election have fed near - saturation coverage of the U.S. presidential race , starting with last winter 's primaries and caucuses , in the British media , Hutchison said .
Plus , " it 's not just an election in the United States ; it 's the election for the leader of the free world ... because it just affects so many countries around the globe , " Hutchison said .
" We take bets in 120 countries , and we 've taken bets [ on the presidential election ] in all those countries . "
Of course , British gambling shops are well - known for taking a wide variety of bets .
And British gamblers are far from novices when it comes to wagering on U.S. elections .
More than 110 years ago , a London correspondent for the New York Times reported intense interest in the contest between Democrat William Jennings Bryan and Republican William McKinley .
" The Stock Exchange was the scene of unusual excitement today , more time being devoted to betting on the result of the presidential election in the United States than in the conduct of legitimate business , " the Times reported .
“ ' It 's not just an election in the United States ; it 's the election for the leader of the free world . ' ” — Robin Hutchison , Ladbrokes
London 's oddsmakers proved reliable , with McKinley , the victor in the 1896 election , favored 4 - to - 1 over Bryan .
Going into Tuesday 's election , Republican John McCain is much more of a longshot than was famed orator Bryan .
Ladbrokes was offering odds of 13 - 2 on a McCain victory .
A win by Democrat Barack Obama offers a meager payoff , with the Illinois senator a 1 - in - 12 favorite .
In other words , a gambler would have to bet 12 pounds on Obama to win one pound if the Democrat is the victor .
Meanwhile , political futures markets , which have a strong track record in recent elections , also cast Obama as the heavy favorite .
See full story .
While British bettors can lay wagers in any of thousands of local betting shops , U.S. gamblers must turn to political futures markets operated by offshore firms such as Intrade , or take positions in the Iowa Electronic Markets , which opened in 1988 .
In a recent paper , economists Paul W. Rhode of the University of Arizona and Koleman Strumpf of the University of Kansas noted that political betting markets were common features of U.S. presidential elections from just after the Civil War until the 1940s .
And such organized betting markets were hardly an American invention .
The scholars found that quotes of odds on papal succession appear as early as 1503 , noting that such wagering was already considered an " old practice " at that time .
And in England , wagering on a myriad of political events predates American independence , they found .
One historian , writing in 1880 , noted that as far back as the late 1600s , " foreigners had observed that , on matters great and small , the only sure test of English opinions was the state of the odds . "

The film features a 10 - year - old boy who moves to England
A court in India has postponed the release of a film entitled Hari Puttar , after complaints from the makers of the blockbuster Harry Potter films .
Hollywood company Warner Bros has filed a lawsuit against all parties involved in the production and distribution of the Hari Puttar film .
It has been quoted as saying the the title of the Indian movie is confusing .
Mirchi Movies , the makers of the Bollywood children 's film , have denied the accusations .
It told the BBC that India 's Hari Puttar had nothing to do with the Harry Potter wizard movies , to which Warner Bros owns the rights .
Mirchi says that Hari is a popular Indian name , and Puttar means ' son ' in Hindi and Punjabi .
The Indian film tells the story of a 10 - year - old boy who moves to England with his family and becomes involved in a plan to save the world .
The Indian production house says the name of their film was registered in 2005 .
But the legal proceedings mean that scheduled release of Hari Puttar has been postponed .
It was meant to hit cinema halls on Friday , but has now been pushed back to the end of this month .
CHICAGO , Oct 25 ( Reuters ) - Examiners with the Federal Reserve have questioned Wall Street counterparties in recent days about their exposure to debt and other holdings of Citadel Investment Group , the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday .
The report came a day after Citadel , one of the world ’s largest hedge funds , said it has more than $ 10 billion in available credit .
The Chicago - based fund was seeking to stop rumors it was liquidating some portfolios after its two main funds had lost 35 percent since January .
Citing people familiar with the matter , the Journal said the Fed had questioned the counterparties in at least two instances .
Talk has swirled in the market that Citadel had asked the U.S. government for a cash injection and that financial regulators were coming to inspect its accounts .
Citadel manages roughly $ 18 billion .
The firm ’s main Kensington and Wellington funds have lost 35 percent this year .

You might have heard of the latest invention in C++0 x –rvalue references ( see for instance , A Brief Introduction to Rvalue References ) .
Depending on your point of view , rvalue references are the best thing since STL , or yet another kludge invented to fix accumulated language design errors in C ++.
This distinction is pretty important when you are trying to design a new language .
Should the D language have rvalue references , or is there a better way ?
In order to figure that out , one has to understand what problem they solve and what previous language design decisions led to their emergence .
I ’ll start with some pretty obvious things , so bear with me .
A new perspective on old things often leads to better generalizations .
Lvalues vs rvalues
There are two ways of passing arguments to functions–by value or by reference .
In C , passing by reference meant passing a pointer to data .
If a function took a pointer , the client had to call it with a pointer –for instance , by taking the address of some data .
Not every piece of data has an address .
The ones that do are called lvalues , the ones that do n’t are called rvalues .
Data has to sit in a named memory location in order to have an address .
If it sits in a register , it ’s not addressable in the usual sense ( what ’s a pointer to EAX ? ) .
Any data that , even theoretically , could be stored in registers without having a backup copy in main memory , is considered an rvalue .
Examples of rvalues are data returned from functions ( by value ) , or immediate results of arithmetic expressions .
In C ’s pointer notation , it ’s pretty obvious when you can and ca n’t take the address of data .
Consider these examples :
void f( int * pi ) ; int g( ) ; f( &g ( ) ) ; // error ! f( & ( 1 + 1 ) ) ; // error !
Notice that small modifications will make this code compile :
int tmp1 = g( ) ; f( &tmp1 ) ; int tmp2 = 1 + 1 ; f( &tmp2 ) ;
Why ca n’t the compiler create temporary variables for us and forgo error messages ?
Not a good idea !
The fact that f takes a pointer to integer rather than an integer usually means that it wants to modify the integer and make the modification visible to the caller .
For instance :
void f( int * pi ) { ++* pi ; }
Calling such a function with the address of an ephemeral temporary variable that ’s not addressable by the caller is usually a bug .
We do n’t want compilers to bury our bugs .
Taking the address of an rvalue is therefore an error both in C and C ++.
References
C++ made things a little more complicated by introducing references .
When you call a function that takes a reference , you no longer have to explicitly take the address of data you ’re passing to it .
The compiler will do it implicitly .
So the previous example no longer looks so wrong when function f is declared to take a reference :
void f( int & i ) { ++i ; } int g( ) ; // caller 's code f( g ( ) ) ; f( 1 + 1 ) ;
These calls are still flagged as errors –you ca n’t take a reference to an rvalue–but you can’t figure it out just by examining the caller ’s code .
However , passing by reference has other unrelated uses .
For instance , passing large data structures by reference may be more efficient than passing them by value .
In that case we do n’t really care if the original data is an lvalue or an rvalue .
We ’d like such calls to compile .
Const references
How can a C++ programmer have a cake and eat it too ?
How can he or she tell the compiler that the argument is passed by reference not because it is to be modified but for the sake of performance , and it ’s okay to call it with rvalues ?
That should be easy :
Since the callee has no interest in modifying the original data , he or she should mark the reference argument as const .
The compiler will then allow binding of an rvalue to a const reference .
Indeed , the following code compiles without errors :
void f( const int & i ) ; int g( ) ; f( g ( ) ) ; f( 1 + 1 ) ;
It all made sense at the time , until the auto_ptr entered the picture .
Next time :
The ato_ptr disaster .
JOHANNESBURG 
The government of Zimbabwe , led by President Robert Mugabe , spent $ 7.3 million donated by an international organization to fight killer diseases on other things and has failed to honor requests to return the money , according to the organization ’s inspector general .
The actions by Zimbabwe have deprived the organization , the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , of resources it needs and damaged efforts to expand life - saving treatment , said the inspector general , John Parsons .
Zimbabwe ’s actions also jeopardize a more ambitious $ 188 million Global Fund grant to Zimbabwe , due for consideration by the fund ’s board on Friday , Mr. Parsons said .
The Global Fund has continued to demand that Zimbabwe return the money , and Global Fund officials say Zimbabwean financial officials have promised to do so by Thursday .
But Mr. Parsons said Zimbabwean officials also said they had not repaid the money because they did not have enough foreign currency .
The breakdown of trust between the Global Fund and Zimbabwe ’s government comes at a time of widening humanitarian crisis and casts further doubt on the willingness of Western donors to invest heavily in rebuilding the economically broken nation as long as Mr. Mugabe is in charge , even if a deadlock over a power - sharing government is resolved .

In 1998 , the children of Whitwell Middle School took on an inspiring project , launched out of their principal ’s desire to help her students open their eyes to the diversity of the world beyond their insulated valley .
What happened would change the students , their teachers , their families and the entire town forever … and eventually open hearts and minds around the world .
PAPER CLIPS is the moving and inspiring documentary film that captures how these students responded to lessons about the Holocaust - with a promise to honor every lost soul by collecting one paper clip for each individual exterminated by the Nazis .
Despite the fact that they had previously been unaware of and unfamiliar with the Holocaust , their dedication was absolute .
Their plan was simple but profound .
The amazing result , a memorial railcar filled with 11 million paper clips ( representing 6 million Jews and 5 million gypsies , homosexuals and other victims of the Holocaust ) which stands permanently in their schoolyard , is an unforgettable lesson of how a committed group of children and educators can change the world one classroom at a time .

Hi
Thanks for this blog , theres some great ideas on how this prize money could be spent to better the World .
personally I ’d love to see the prize money go towards the developement of a childrens initiative .
So many kids comics are based on story lines where the hero outsmarts someone to get his / her own way , board games are all about beating your opponents etc .
I think this prize money would be well invested if it went to a team of developers working at bringing thoughts of altruism , caring and helping others into childrens media .
for example a board game where the idea is to help other players through obstacles and the one who is able to help most is the winner , or comics where the story lines are are to do with looking out for each other and maybe even come up with a computor game or kids tv program that instils in the youth the benefit of caring for others .
I believe if the money went to a think tank to come up with ideas to educate todays youth with altruistic values through the use of childrens entertainment then the future would look very bright .
A point further — generic ( smiling ) paper doll figures could be uses about each of the names — humanizing , increasing sense of Arvut …
Please consider the following concept for video that Google might love — introducing a new Google “ service ” — Google people planet ( or person earth , or some such ) .
voluntarily world - wide , people would submit there names ( or existing open data bases would be used — Whitepages.com , for example .
Using Google Earth as a base , the maps would be relabeled — with people ’s first names ( perhaps only first names — or nicknames , etc. ) , located at their addresses on the planet .
Other than landmass outline , there would be no other information — just names .
Video would come on with some inspiring music , families , people holding hands , a line , a plane of people , and then fade out orbiting from space down into ( Google ) People Planet .
Anyway , perhaps this could be a seed for further synergy , incorporating in the main Bnei Baruch media concepts for Google 10^100 .

Do you remember the free hugs campaign that moved around the world ?
Giving some “ love ” .
People cropped all over different cities carrying on what started in a single city .
Spreading “ Love ”
Or this lone guy who traveled around the world bringing joy , perhaps amusement , and most certainly touching the hearts of those he shared his celebration of life with his happy dance .
What I particularly like about both of these efforts is that they spread across the world !
Good Luck Changing the World to Be a Better Place where we ALL want to live in Peace with Love !

In the USA , there is a network show called “ Dirty Jobs ” that presents , in a funny way , various jobs that most people would not want to do .
At the end of the show , people are invited to send in their ideas for future shows .
So , how about a show that presents various “ do good ” jobs where at the end people are asked to suggest or nominate such “ jobs ” ?
Also in the USA , the media makes good use of what they call “ I - reports ” , meaning amature first hand accounts of news items , usually videos of natural disasters .
How about an effort where
people are encouraged to “ capture ” people doing good ?
Finally , how about commercials that play some moving music with clips of people coming together , reaching out to help each other ?

Google could hold a competition using youtube to present videos that advertise altruism .
They could then have people donate money which would be shared amongst the videos that encouraged people the most .
Each video would have an encouragement meter .
Corporations who donated to the project would receive an honor as will as any organization or person .
So it will be two ways does that place videos will receive reward for their work and those that give to the project will get honor from their donations .
There should be a condition that anyone that gets money should have to donate like most or all of it to a charity or cause .

The energy around this contest is quite contagious .
It is incredible to see the many ideas that people have .
I am reminded of a favorite quote – the words are a bit jumbled but it goes something like this .
“ When you step out in faith and do something you believe in a whole series of events begin that would otherwise never have occured . ”
Without this effort many would never have watched the videos or thought about Altruism as a solution .

I ’m really excited about this .
People respond to great ad campaigns .
Especially important will be making altruists ( those doing the altruistic actions ) look cool…hiply dressed , au courant … because this attracts others to want to be like that person .
Also I think there is merit in tugging on the heart strings of the masses .
Whenever I see altruistic actions in movies and commercial I am moved to tears instantly … this teaches me how much I long for that state .
We need to see how good it must feel to be that altruist !
and set up a huge longing for this !

Linux Advocacy in Embedded Systems San Jose , CA USA September 30th , 1999
As I mentioned yesterday , the Embedded Systems Conference has come at a very critical time for vendors using Linux , thinking about usng Linux or running companies based on Linux .
It has provided a good opportunity for a lot of key players to come together , meet , exchange ideas and form partnerships for the future .
One project coming into focus as a result of that is advocacy for Linux in embedded systems .
Lineo held a client meeting this morning with many of their partners and potential partners to discuss ways to promote Linux in the embedded systems market .
They asked for feedback on the idea of creating an entity to promote and advocate Linux on embedded systems .
They got a very positive response overall .
Discussion ranged around the idea of forming a non-profit , vendor - based group like Linux International , but focused on Linux on embedded systems .
Why is a separate organization being considered for embedded systems ?
That 's a good question .
Taking a look at the existing computer market does provide some answers , though .
Embedded systems is a highly technical area with its own jargon .
Historically , the mainstream press has followed this area only very superficially , if at all .
Note as a result the success of magazines like EETimes , which focus on it more narrowly .
The concerns of the vendors currently involved in Linux International are not necessarily the same as the vendors in the embedded systems area .
Most importantly , though , these people feel like , in the embedded space , they are really at the beginning .
Linux is trickling into people 's awareness in the embedded space only slowly .
We 're looking at a show here with only a handful of vendors fully identified with Embedded Linux .
They want the opportunity to band together and say , " We understand just how exciting the potential of Linux is in embedded systems .
We want to show other people how exciting it is , so the groundswell can build , so that our businesses can build .
We want to mark a piece of this new territory for ourselves , but yet do everything we can to make sure the territory is so vast , there is room for many , many more . "
Of course , given that this discussion took place at a client meeting , it did not include Lineo 's closest competitors in the market , Cygnus and Montavista .
Some of the partners present , though , were pleased enough with the idea to immediately take it back to Jim Ready at Montavista and Michael Tiemann at Cygnus , who also got an opportunity to discuss it in more detail with Lyle Ball and Tim Bird from Lineo .
Clearly , of course , Lineo hoped for a benefit from introducing the idea to their clients first , before involving Montavista and Cygnus and Jim and Michael were certainly aware of this positioning .
The goal , though , was important and one they very much support : promotion and advocacy of Linux in the embedded systems market .
As a result , they agreed to join the discussion to determine the best way to achieve this shared goal , via a new organization , a working group of Linux International , or whatever else develops .
Both Lineo and Montavista have reserved domain name spaces that will be made available to a non -profit group if it is decided to go that direction .
Lineo has reserved emlab.org , for " Embedded Linux Advisory Board " and Montavista has available embedlinux .net .
While decisions about new organization or no organization , one name or another , are in abeyance , the http://www.emlab.org site will contain a full transcript of Lineo 's client meeting in the near future .
They have also made a mailing list available : forum@emlab.org which is open to all .
For subscription information , send a note to info@emlab.org .
Note that , if a vendor - based organization to promote Linux is formed , it must be vendor neutral to be of value .
Having Cygnus , Montavista and Lineo all involved from the very beginning will be critical to the future success of any advocacy .
Lest you get the idea , though , that these companies would be operating within a vacuum , please note that this morning 's meeting including people from QED , MCG , Trolltech , IBM , National Semiconductor , Intel , Zentropics , 3Com and more .
Nor would the open source developer community be left out .
The Linux Router Project was invited to this morning 's meeting , but unable to send a representative .
Other development projects in the embedded space are also welcome .
The objective viewpoint of the community projects is needed to season this group of business and marketing people , to keep them on track with the ideals of the community and , in exchange , to validate what they are trying to do .
What exactly would they try to do ?
Board or no board , advocacy will probably work on trade show presence , such as a Linux Pavilion at next year 's Embedded Systems Conference , presentations , white papers , and interaction with the press .
A job board for people wanting work with Linux in embedded systems was mentioned .
Ideas for standards for embedded Linux or for funding open source development in the embedded systems area were discussed , but set aside as possibly too divisive , until everyone has a chance to meet , interact and decide where to go next .
So keep an eye out !
If Linux on embedded systems is dear to your heart , sign up on the mailing list and help work to make something good happen .
No matter the outcome , it has been exciting to be here at the conference , to meet the people involved and to get a confirmation of the vast potential for Linux in the embedded systems marketplace .
Another piece of the world domination puzzle is falling into place .

Today ’s Defendent : Joe Arpaio
Statement of the Grand Inquisitor : Joe Arpaio is a man who enjoys his job .
His job is terrorizing Mexicans , always a popular pastime in the southwest .
Arpaio wins 80 - 90 per cent approval from the aged voters of Phoenix not just because he terrorizes Mexicans but because he delights his living - dead fanbase with new ways of humiliating petty criminals and vagrants .
In order to find more victims for his pranks , deputies are sent on 200 - strong sweeps of the local barrios , pouncing on any brown - skinned driver with a broken windshield , with prizes awarded for most illegals caught .
Once the new crop of ritual victims has been chained up , Arpaio grandstands to his audience of bitter white retirees , humiliating inmates with pink jails and uniforms , and arranging photo ops of chain gangs in cartoon black - and - white stripes .
Arpaio is a checklist of the most vile traits of the “ greatest generation ” : first , of course , there is his fatuous vanity .
He boasts like Capone about his fame : “ I get more press than the governor gets .
If you go anywhere in the world , all you have to do is say Arizona , and they say Sheriff Joe . ”
Next , of course , comes gross hypocrisy : Arpaio is the child of Italian immigrants who came to Massachusetts for better - paid factory jobs .
That , he says , was different .
Arpaio ’s deputies stand out for sadistic violence even by American cop standards .
They have killed or paralyzed suspects , in one case laughing and joking while they broke the neck of a paraplegic arrested for the non-crime of marijuana possession .
Though Arpaio ’s department was forced to pay the victim almost a million dollars , the incident failed to affect the adoration in which the vicious living corpses of Phoenix regard this monster , their avenger against younger , warmer people .
Statement of the Defense : Why blame Arpaio ?
His kind are legion .
Some scrap of putrid humanity will always be found ready to take up the implements of torture , especially when one tribe has tormented another as long as the Anglos have tormented the Mexicans .
If it were not this one it would be another .
It has always been so .
Response of the Grand Inquisitor :
We blame Arpaio for only one thing : still breathing .
We direct our reproofs to his victims , the Catholic peasantry of Phoenix .
The Church has always supported just wars , and the long - overdue war against Arpaio is clearly just .
Have you no men of violence ?
We hear each day of the violence your gangs direct against each other .
Is there not a single bullet left over for this man ?
Remember that we cannot begin his rehabilitation — which features an eternity of breaking rock in a pink tutu , chained to The Night Stalker–until you send him to us .
Surely , of the thousands of killers among you , there is one with a few spare hours .
The saddest aspect of the case , for us , is that to date the only plot against Arpaio ’s life to be uncovered was a false one , a classic case of entrapment , in which a vengeful inmate ’s empty talk of killing the judge who sentenced him was steered , by Arpaio ’s agents , toward killing Arpaio instead .
What a bitter indictment of your community , O Mexicans of Arizona , that the one plot against this man should have to be generated by his own minions !
We do not blame the monster for being a monster .
We merely ask the monster ’s victims , why does this monster still breathe ?
To be persecuted is no disgrace .
The disgrace is that your tormentor still draws breath .
Chairman and chief executive officer Rex W. Tillerson speaks at a news conference following the Exxon Mobil Corporation Shareholders Meeting in Dallas , Texas , May 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Stone
SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Exxon Mobil agreed to pay out 75 percent of a $ 507.5 million damages ruling to settle the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska , the Anchorage Daily News reported on Tuesday .
Citing both Exxon and the plaintiff ’s lawyer , the Anchorage Daily News said the oil giant will release about $ 383 million for distribution to the nearly 33,000 commercial fishermen and others who sued Exxon after the worst tanker crash in U.S. history .
Exxon Mobile took a $ 290 million charge in the second quarter to account for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that threw out an earlier $ 2.5 billion damages award against the company and lowered the award to $ 507.5 million .
The deal will allow fishermen and other plaintiffs to be paid a chunk of the damages as soon as October with a final payout schedule expected to be hammered out this week , the newspaper said .
The Exxon Valdez spilled some 34,000 tons of crude oil in the costliest accident of its kind .
The clean up alone cost around $ 2.5 billion .
The two sides still disagree about whether Exxon owes interest on the $ 507 million award , which would bring the final figure to $ 1 billion , according to plaintiff ’s lawyers .
There is also debate over another $ 70 million , according to the Anchorage Daily News .
David Oesting of Anchorage , the lead attorney for the plaintiffs , and Exxon were not immediately available for comment .
While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the subject , the justices sent the case back to the lower court to handle the final settlement of the $ 507.5 million award , which the Court said was the maximum damages available to the plaintiffs .
“ We ’re open to ideas and we ’ll take a look at what comes our way , ” Dana Perino , Mr. Bush ’s press secretary , said aboard Air Force One as the president was flying to a business gathering in Alexandria , La .
“ What we ’ve seen put forward so far , by the leaders in Congress , the Democrats , were elements of a package that we did not think would actually stimulate the economy . ”
Still , Mr. Bernanke ’s testimony strengthened the hand of Democrats , who are pushing for a package of spending that could total $ 150 billion to $ 300 billion .
The testimony could put pressure on Mr. Bush to either enter discussions or risk losing the initiative and appearing behind the curve .
Democratic leaders would like to pass a spending bill in a lame - duck session of Congress immediately after the elections on Nov. 4 .
But that would depend on whether Mr. Bush was willing to agree on a deal .
If Democrats cannot prevent Mr. Bush from vetoing a bill , they will most likely wait until the next president takes office in January .
To draw in the White House as well as Republican lawmakers , Democrats are casting around for measures that Mr. Bush has wanted .
One possible inducement could be passing a long - stalled free - trade agreement with Colombia .
Republicans are also pushing for additional tax cuts , and there might be ground for agreement on that front .
An earlier stimulus package , in which the government mailed out almost $ 100 billion in tax rebates during the spring and summer , provided a temporary lift to incomes and consumer spending .
But the lift faded by late summer .
Since then , the economic downturn has , if anything , accelerated .
Iran , Venezuela Push for Higher Oil Prices
In OPEC meeting , U.S. ally Saudi Arabia is told to cut back oil production .
Sept. 10 , 2008  -- Just when American motorists were starting to get a little relief at the pump , OPEC -- the cartel of oil - producing nations -- decided to cut back production , a move that could stop oil 's recent fall .
In the past two months , the price of oil has fallen nearly 30 percent from its July 3 high of $ 145 a barrel .
As this week started , it looked as if oil could fall below the psychological barrier of $ 100 for the first time since beginning of March .
OPEC oil ministers agreed early this morning in Vienna , Austria , to cut output by more than 500,000 barrels a day .
How Are You Dealing With Gas Prices ?
Tell ABC News
The move was a compromise between countries looking to keep oil prices high and others looking to give a struggling world economy some relief .
On one side are Iran and Venezuela , which want to squeeze as much money as possible out of the United States and other large oil consumers .
On the other side of the fight is Saudi Arabia , with strong political ties to the United States and President Bush 's family .
In the coming days , expect Washington politicians to lash out against Venezuela and Iran for trying to reduce to flow of oil .
" You do n't get on the US 's good side for calling for oil production cutbacks but Venezuela and Iran were scarcely on America 's good side to begin with , " said Jerry Paylor , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a Washington thinktank .
" You 'll probably see plenty of wailing and gnashing of teeth over this because it's in everyone 's interest to find easy scapegoats and there 's no easier scapegoat in American politics than OPEC . "
However , Paylor warns that there is absolutely no correlation between OPEC declarations about production cutbacks and actual OPEC behavior .
In fact , most nations are producing as much oil as they can .
" There 's a lot of evidence out there that OPEC is completely fraudulent .
The only thing that real matters is the unilateral exercise of Saudi market power , " he said .
And the Saudi 's could simply choose to ignore the cartel 's decision .
" For all the rhetoric from Iran and Venezuela about cutting back oil , you do n't actually see the two countries reducing their output , " Paylor said .
" What you essentially have is Venezuela and Iran telling Saudi Arabia to quit producing so much . "
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino in a briefing this morning said President Bush disagrees with OPEC 's decision .
" We would like to see more oil on the market , not less , " she said , adding that the president is calling on Congress to vote on additional drilling in the U.S .
Asked if the president plans to make any personal efforts to convince OPEC leaders to change their decision , she said : " Remember , it 's not just the United States , but many other countries who have asked OPEC to make sure that those oil markets are well supplied . "
" What President Bush is going to be focused on in the next three weeks is working with Congress in a bipartisan way , to the extent that we possibly can , to try to get a bill that would allow for more expanded production here in our own country , " she added .
Oil analyst Stephen Schork , who was in Vienna to monitor the meeting , said Iran and Venezuela do n't care about the economic impact of high oil prices .
" The world is having a tough time paying its bills , so let 's raise the price , " he said .
" Typical Venezuela .
Their talk is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs . "
OPEC Tries to Stay Relevant
Schork believes that speculators had a major role in the run-up in oil prices and can also profit from a quick fall in prices .
" If we can go from $ 75 to $ 150 in a few months time , there is nothing to stop it going down -- or lower -- just as fast , " he said .
He says OPEC 's move this morning was a warning to speculators not to liquidate their holdings .
Phil Flynn , senior energy trader at Alaron Trading Group , said OPEC made a big mistake .
" They 're going to be seen as piling on to a world economy that 's in turmoil right now .
This production cut is going to politically backfire on them , " Flynn said .
" If this global economic slowdown becomes more prolonged , OPEC is going to get their share of the blame and they should .
They 're withholding supply from a market that still has oil prices above $ 100 a barrel . "
Cost of Rising Gas Prices
The move is the wrong decision at a time when Flynn said " the world is trying to wean themselves off their product . "
" I think they are very short - sighted , " he added .
" If they looked at the big picture , they should be encouraging lower prices right now because lower prices would slow down the move to alternative fuels and would help the world economy rebound faster , suiting them better in the long - run . "
Flynn says OPEC wants to send a message to the market that it still controls the flow of oil .
" They are trying to say : Hey , we still matter , " Flynn said .
" I think they are panicking right now because demand is falling and they 're afraid that prices will collapse . "
More Pain at the Pump
For Americans , the price at the pump has fallen from an average of $ 4.11 on July 7 -- an all - time high -- to $ 3.65 this week .
That 's an 11 percent drop in nine weeks ; but gas prices are still 83 cents a gallon higher than they were a year ago .
OPEC 's decision could stop the recent fall of gas price in just a week or two .
The 13 - member oil cartel sets limits every few months on how much oil each member nation can produce .
In June , Saudi Arabia decided to go 500,000 barrels a day above its quota to help keep oil prices in check .
The move came after President Bush flew to the Middle East in May to lobby the royal family in the hope of giving Americans some relief from high gas prices .
At first , Bush was rebuffed in his request , but a few weeks later King Abdullah met Bush 's demand for more oil and even went one step further , increasing output more than Bush had originally sought .
Today 's move by OPEC essentially forces the Saudis to remove that extra oil from world markets and go back to their November 2007 production levels .
The move is part political and part economic .
Giant OPEC Profits
OPEC nations have seen enormous profits from the record oil prices .
Now as the price of crude has plunged the countries want to protect that windfall .
" I think it 's true to say that Venezuela and Iran did not want to see the price of oil fall below $ 100 , " said John Hall , managing director of John Hall Associates Ltd .
Hall was also in Vienna for the meeting and said that this move will hurt Saudi Arabia and the world economy .
" It 's the oil price increase that hits world economic growth more than anything else , " Hall said .
Oil prices were little changed in response to the OPEC decision , puzzling analysts including Hall .
Oil was actually trading down about a dollar mid-day today .
" We thought the price would go up but it has barely moved , " Hall said .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon , locked in a bloody battle with drug cartels , wants to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of street drugs in a plan likely to irk Washington .
Calderon , a conservative in power nearly two years , sent a proposal to Congress on Thursday that would scrap the penalties for drugs including cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine , opium and marijuana .
…
Under Calderon 's plan , people carrying up to 2 grams ( 0.07 ounces ) of marijuana or opium , half a gram of cocaine , 50 milligrams of heroin or 40 milligrams of methamphetamine would face no criminal charges .
We covered this in The Drug War Chronicle , but I think it needs more discussion :
Where shall I begin ?
1. President Calderon himself has endorsed this .
He is the golden boy of the U.S. - subsidized Mexican drug war and after accepting our financial support , he now does something certain to enrage the American Drug Czar .
2 .
Calderon ’s predecessor , Vicente Fox , tried the same thing and backed down due to pressure from Washington , D.C. Now that Calderon has established his drug war credentials , he ’s picking up where Fox left off .
Obviously , Mexico intends to decriminalize simple possession and wo n’t stop until it is done .
3 .
The timing of this move appears designed to circumvent negative attention from Washington , D.C. , which is horribly distracted right now for obvious reasons .
I ’ve been unable to find a response from the Drug Czar or anyone else .
Amazing .
Mexico is plagued by drug trade violence , the likes of which we ’ve never seen within our borders , and its political leadership is calling for an end to petty drug arrests .
It wo n’t end the bloodshed – not even close – but it is a dramatic shift away from the U.S. drug war mentality that we must continuously pursue and arrest drug users in order to " win " the war on drugs .
This is remarkable to say the least .
On the eve of the presidential election , with " Monday Night Football " from Washington as the backdrop , candidates Barack Obama and John McCain are planning to participate in one - on - one interviews on ESPN via satellite .
ESPN's Chris Berman will do the segments earlier Monday , pending last - minute schedule changes by the candidates , and they 'll air at halftime of the Redskins - Pittsburgh Steelers broadcast from D.C. , the network announced .
The game kicks off at 8:30 p.m. ET .
The interviews will give both Obama , the Democratic senator from Illinois , and McCain , the Republican senator from Arizona , a last major chance to appeal to Americans during a coveted spot on prime - time television .
" Monday Night Football " has averaged 12.2 million viewers this season .
" We worked with our partners at the NFL to schedule a Monday Night Football game in Washington on this special night , and this presents a unique opportunity for John McCain and Barack Obama to reflect upon the last few months and address a large primetime audience on the final day of the campaigns , " Norby Williamson , ESPN executive vice president , production , said in a statement .
It will be the first NFL game played in the D.C. area on the Monday night before a presidential election in 24 years .
The Redskins defeated the Atlanta Falcons 27 - 14 on Nov. 5 , 1984 ; Ronald Reagan was re-elected the following day .
The Redskins , in fact , are an accurate barometer for presidential elections .
According to Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports Bureau , who coined the term " Redskins Rule " in 2000 , the following bromide has held true for the past 17 presidential elections :
If the Redskins win their last home game prior to Election Day , the party that won the popular vote in the previous election wins the White House ; if the Redskins lose , the party that lost the popular vote in the previous election wins .
In this Monday 's case , a Steelers win would forecast an Obama victory ; a Redskins win would indicate a McCain win .
" Monday Night Football " is the most - watched series in cable television history .
Now in its third season on ESPN , MNF has registered nine of the top 10 all - time biggest household audiences in cable history , led by this year 's Eagles - Cowboys telecast on Sept. 15 , which attracted cable 's largest audience ever -- 13.0 million homes and 18.6 million viewers .
Obama previously appeared on " Monday Night Football " on Dec. 11 , 2006 , when he opened the broadcast of a game involving his hometown Chicago Bears by parodying his own upcoming official announcement of his intention to run for the presidency .
" I am ready , " he said , before putting on a Bears baseball cap , " for the Bears to go all the way , baby ! "

青汁といえば苦くて臭い飲み物を健康のために我慢して飲むものと思っていませんか？飲みにくいことから罰ゲームとしてもちいられていたこともありますが、今は飲みやすい製品が増えてきました。年配の健康志向の方だけでなく、今では若い女性が美容やダイエットのために飲んだり、子どもの健康と成長促進のために与えたりしています。人気の高まりとともに青汁の飲み方にも変化が現われ、意外な方法で青汁を使うものもあります。この記事では青汁と意外と相性が良い飲み方、組み合わせについて紹介します。
青汁は飲み物、デザート、スープ何にでも使える
青汁を水で溶かして野菜本来の味を楽しみたい方、牛乳や豆乳で混ぜて野菜独特の苦みや青臭さを消して飲む方など、青汁の飲み方は人によってさまざまあります。しかし、「青汁にはこれが合うがこれは合わない」と決めつけてしまってはいませんか？「お酒に青汁」「ココアに青汁」これらは意外性があり一見合わなさそうですが、相性が良い組み合わせです。また、青汁は工夫がしやすい健康食品で、飲み物として以外にデザートにしたり、スープに加えたりして料理の幅を広げるアイテムでもあります。以下、意外性のある組み合わせやレシピを紹介します。
青汁に混ぜるのは水や牛乳だけじゃない
お酒好きのための甘酒青汁
お酒好きのためお酒を飲みすぎてしまい、飲むたびに二日酔いが気になる方におススメなのが甘酒青汁です。甘酒に加えることで青汁の苦みが消されてほんのりと甘さが残るので、青汁が苦くて飲みにくいイメージを持っている方でも甘酒青汁なら飲めます。
青汁の効果はアルコール分解を助けるナイアシンや悪酔いを防ぐビタミンCが含まれているので、二日酔いの予防に効果的です。また、糖質を代謝してエネルギーに変えるビタミンB1もアルコールの分解に必要になりますが、アルコールを摂りすぎると不足します。ビタミンB1が不足すると身体が疲労回復できずだるさを覚えるようになります。しかし、甘酒青汁を飲むことでこれらのビタミンを補給できるので、二日酔いになったり疲れが残ったりするリスクを下げることができます。
また、青汁には血糖値の上昇を抑える効果がありますので、糖尿病の予防にもなります。

冬場に人気のココアに青汁を入れて飲んでみるのはいかがでしょうか。青汁にココアを入れると苦みを消して甘く優しい味に変えてくれます。水で溶かしただけの青汁だと身構えてしまいますが、ココアを入れることで抵抗なく飲みやすくなるので、だれにでもおススメできます。ココアといっても青汁を入れているので緑色のココアになりますが、見た目のギャップとは違い相性の良い飲み合わせです。
ココアの成分といえばカカオポリフェノールで、生活習慣病の予防に効果的な成分です。カカオポリフェノールには抗酸化作用がありコレステロールの酸化を抑えて血管にコレステロールが血栓を作るのを防ぐので、高血圧や動脈硬化を予防できます。また、ガンの原因となる活性酸素を除去するのでガン予防も期待できます。
糖尿病やダイエット中の方で糖分が気になる方は、ピュアココアという砂糖を抑えたものを選んで飲んでください。
青汁きな粉のラッシ ー
豆乳に青汁を入れて飲む方法は多くの方がされています。青汁の苦みが緩和されて大豆イソフラボンも摂取できるので、女性に人気の飲み方です。一方で大豆イソフラボンは摂取したくても、豆乳のニオイが気になる方もいらっしゃいます。そんな方にはヨーグルトに青汁ときな粉を入れて作るラッシーをおススメします。
青汁ときな粉は合わなさそうですが相性が良い組み合わせです。青汁が苦手な方の多くはニオイが原因ですが、きな粉を入れることで芳ばしい香りに変わります。もし甘味を加えたい場合ははちみつやオリゴ糖を入れても違和感なくおいしくいただけます。さらにヨーグルトを入れてラッシーにすれば子どもでも飲めるようになります。
青汁きな粉ラッシーは青汁のビタミン、ミネラル、食物繊維に加えて、たんぱく質とイソフラボンが摂れます。栄養バランスが良いので偏った栄養になりがちな食生活の方におススメです。また、大豆イソフラボンは女性ホルモンのエストロゲンに似た働きをするため、肌や髪の毛のハリやツヤを保つ効果がありますし、更年期障害対策にもなります。
青汁はデザートとしても使える
青汁ホットケー キ
野菜嫌いの子どもでもホットケーキなら喜んで食べてくれます。青汁を入れると青汁の苦みやニオイが気になりますが、こんがりと焼くことで青汁のニオイが消えますし、ケーキの甘味で苦みも気にならなくなります。もし、苦みを感じてもはちみつやメープルシロップを塗ることで甘味を調節できます。最近の青汁はお茶が含まれているものがあり、青汁が入っているといわなければ抹茶風味のホットケーキといっても差し支えないくらいです。青汁ホットケーキは子どものおやつにいかがでしょうか。
ちなみに作り方は簡単です。卵と牛乳を溶いた中にホットケーキミックスと青汁を入れてさらにかき混ぜます。それをフライパンで両面焼けば完成です。普段のホットケーキを作る方法と同じで、ホットケーキミックスを入れるタイミングに青汁を同時に加えるだけです。手間がかかりませんので、子どもの野菜不足解消に有効です。
青汁寒天ゼリ ー
青汁寒天の特徴は低カロリーなのに栄養価が高くて、さらにダイエット効果が期待できるということです。効果を具体的に説明すると、青汁と寒天には食物繊維が豊富に含まれています。食物繊維は余分な糖分や中性脂肪の吸収を抑制する作用があります。また、消化されない成分で、胃や腸に到達すると水分を吸収して膨張するので、食欲を抑える効果もあります。青汁寒天ゼリーはいくら食べても太る心配がありません。むしろダイエット効果を促進してくれるので、ダイエットをしたい方は積極的に食べてください。
材料:水400ml、寒天4g、青汁粉末6g
作り方は
水と寒天の素を入れて火にかけます。 吹きこぼれに注意しながら2分程度煮溶かす。
火を止めて、青汁を投入してかき混ぜる。 容器に入れて冷めたら冷蔵庫に入れて、固まったら完成。
これも意外。青汁でスープを味わう
スープの素を使って簡単青汁スープ
市販されているコーンポタージュやオニオンスープの素に青汁を混ぜていただきます。スープに青汁を入れるのは合わなさそうですが、市販のスープはしっかりとした味がついているので青汁の苦みが気にならなくなります。また、スープにはさまざまなダシが入っているので、コクのある青汁スープを味わえます。
スープで青汁を飲む際は注意点があります。青汁に含まれている成分には熱に弱い成分がありますので、熱湯を直接かけてスープと青汁を溶かすのは避けるようにしましょう。せっかく青汁を飲んでもビタミンB群やビタミンC、酵素などの栄養素が破壊されます。上手に青汁の栄養を補給するためには人肌程度の温度で溶かすようにしましょう。
本格的な青汁みそ 汁
みそ汁に青汁を入れるのは意外性が高いですが、味に違和感はなくおいしくいただけます。近年の青汁はケールのようなクセの強い原料だけでなく、大麦若葉や明日葉のような飲みやすいものもありますので、みそ汁の味を壊さずに飲むことができます。お茶の成分が入った青汁ならみそ汁がさわやかな風味を残すようになります。
青汁みそ汁のポイントは味だけでなく、栄養の高さです。青汁もみそ汁も栄養価が高いですが、一緒に飲むことで青汁のビタミンやミネラル、食物繊維とみそ汁のたんぱく質、脂質を摂れて栄養抜群のスープとなります。また、みそ汁の大豆にはレシチンという成分が含まれています。主な効果・効能は、コレステロール値を下げたり、新陳代謝を促進したり、脂質の吸収を抑制することからダイエット効果があります。
みそ汁を青汁と組み合わせることで相乗効果でより健康維持に期待ができるようになります。

American researchers declared that climate change threatens not only the polar region with its cold - loving animals , but the tropics as well .
They become too hot for many species which will have to move higher seeking escape from the heat .
Robert Colwell of the University of Connecticut carried out a research presenting its results in the journal Science .
He considers that if the climate continues to get warmer , the Costa Rican tropics will undergo considerable changes within the next century .
As Colwell and his colleagues predict , the current climate at 100 meters will be observed at 700 meters .
Colwell and his work - mates gathered information about 2,000 species of plants , insects and fungi in Costa Rica .
They came to a conclusion that half of the species would have to change their habitats and to move up in the mountains .
If species suffer from the heat , they will feel better in their customary climate zone .
As a result of this process , populations inhabiting lowland regions will decrease in biodiversity because other species can't survive in this climate .
But species living high in the mountains may have no space to move higher .
Colwell 's forecast differs from the suppositions made by other researchers who state that global warming will not have a considerable impact on species inhabiting tropics .
As his opponents say the climate was warmer 50 million years ago , but tropical forests still existed .
However , Colwell insists upon further investigation before making a final conclusion .
Researchers from the University of California - Berkeley pursued another study comparing changes in small mammal populations at Yosemite National Park in California to the data received in 1918 .
They also found out that mammals like shrews , mice and ground squirrels moved to high - set regions .
As it turned out , half of the species made such shifts .
Changes in nature can not be avoided , but their speed should be kept under control .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The vice presidential candidates , Democratic Sen. Joe Biden and Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , debated in St. Louis , Missouri , Thursday night .
Gwen Ifill of PBS was the debate moderator .
Here is a transcript of that debate :
Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Sarah Palin debate the issues Thursday night .
IFILL : Good evening from Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri .
I'm Gwen Ifill of " The NewsHour " and " Washington Week " on PBS .
Welcome to the first and the only 2008 vice presidential debate between the Republican nominee , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , and the Democratic nominee , Joe Biden of Delaware .
The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the two remaining presidential debates .
Tonight 's discussion will cover a wide range of topics , including domestic and foreign policy matters .
It will be divided roughly into five - minute segments .
Each candidate will have 90 seconds to respond to a direct question and then an additional two minutes for rebuttal and follow - up .
The order has been determined by a coin toss .
The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me and have not been shared or cleared with anyone on the campaigns or on the commission .
The audience here in the hall has promised to remain very polite , no cheers , applause , no untoward outbursts , except right at this minute now , as we welcome Gov. Palin and Sen. Biden .
PALIN : Nice to meet you .
BIDEN : It 's a pleasure .
PALIN : Hey , can I call you Joe ?
BIDEN : ( OFF - MIKE )
PALIN : Thank you .
Thank you , Gwen .
Thank you .
Thank you .
IFILL : Welcome to you both .
As we have determined by a coin toss , the first question will go to Sen.
Biden , with a 90 - second follow - up from Gov. Palin .
The House of Representatives this week passed a bill , a big bailout bill -- or did n't pass it , I should say .
The Senate decided to pass it , and the House is wrestling with it still tonight .
As America watches these things happen on Capitol Hill , Sen. Biden , was this the worst of Washington or the best of Washington that we saw play out ?
BIDEN : Let me begin by thanking you , Gwen , for hosting this .
And , Governor , it 's a pleasure to meet you , and it's a pleasure to be with you .
I think it 's neither the best or worst of Washington , but it 's evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies we 've ever had .
As a consequence , you 've seen what 's happened on Wall Street .
If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been , this excessive deregulation , the failure to oversee what was going on , letting Wall Street run wild , I do n't think you needed any more evidence than what you see now .
So the Congress has been put -- Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot .
But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here .
He , first of all , said there has to be oversight .
We 're not going to write any check to anybody unless there 's oversight for the -- of the secretary of Treasury .
He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street .
Thirdly , he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case .
And , lastly , what you have to do is make sure that CEOs do n't benefit from this , because this could end up , in the long run , people making money off of this rescue plan .
And so , as a consequence of that , it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Gov. Palin and me and Sen. McCain and Barack Obama , and that is that the -- we 're going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy .
We 're going to focus on the middle class , because it's -- when the middle class is growing , the economy grows and everybody does well , not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America .
IFILL : Thank you , Senator .
Gov. Palin ?
PALIN : Thank you , Gwen .
And I thank the commission , also .
I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans .
You know , I think a good barometer here , as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America 's economy , is go to a kid 's soccer game on Saturday , and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them , " How are you feeling about the economy ? "
And I 'll bet you , you 're going to hear some fear in that parent 's voice , fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market .
Did we just take a major hit with those investments ?
Fear about , how are we going to afford to send our kids to college ?
A fear , as small - business owners , perhaps , how we 're going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people .
The barometer there , I think , is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve , and we need reform to that end .
Now , John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform .
Two years ago , remember , it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures .
He sounded that warning bell .
People in the Senate with him , his colleagues , did n't want to listen to him and would n't go towards that reform that was needed then .
I think that the alarm has been heard , though , and there will be that greater oversight , again thanks to John McCain 's bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week , even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first .
IFILL : You both would like to be vice president .
Sen .
Biden , how , as vice president , would you work to shrink this gap of polarization which has sprung up in Washington , which you both have spoken about here tonight ?
BIDEN : Well , that 's what I 've done my whole career , Gwen , on very , very controversial issues , from dealing with violence against women , to putting 100,000 police officers on the street , to trying to get something done about the genocide in -- that was going on in Bosnia .
And I -- I have been able to reach across the aisle .
I think it 's fair to say that I have almost as many friends on the Republican side of the aisle as I do the Democratic side of the aisle .
But am I able to respond to -- are we able to stay on the -- on the topic ?
IFILL : You may , if you like .
BIDEN : Yes , well , you know , until two weeks ago -- it was two Mondays ago John McCain said at 9 o'clock in the morning that the fundamentals of the economy were strong .
Two weeks before that , he said George -- we 've made great economic progress under George Bush 's policies .
Nine o'clock , the economy was strong .
Eleven o'clock that same day , two Mondays ago , John McCain said that we have an economic crisis .
That does n't make John McCain a bad guy , but it does point out he 's out of touch .
Those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago .
IFILL : Gov. Palin , you may respond .
PALIN : John McCain , in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong , he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce .
And the American workforce is the greatest in this world , with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce .
That 's a positive .
That 's encouragement .
And that 's what John McCain meant .
Now , what I 've done as a governor and as a mayor is ( inaudible ) I 've had that track record of reform .
And I 've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain , also , with his track record of reform , where we 're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done .
Now , Barack Obama , of course , he 's pretty much only voted along his party lines .
In fact , 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line , not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment , too , is , you know , put the partisanship , put the special interests aside , and get down to getting business done for the people of America .
We 're tired of the old politics as usual .
And that 's why , with all due respect , I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate , but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that 's going to come with reform .
I think that 's why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House , and I 'm happy to join him there .
IFILL : Governor , Senator , neither of you really answered that last question about what you would do as vice president .
I 'm going to come back to that ...
... throughout the evening to try to see if we can look forward , as well .
Now , let 's talk about -- the next question is to talk about the subprime lending meltdown .
Who do you think was at fault ?
I start with you , Gov. Palin .
Was it the greedy lenders ?
Was it the risky home - buyers who should n't have been buying a home in the first place ?
And what should you be doing about it ?
PALIN : Darn right it was the predator lenders , who tried to talk Americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $ 300,000 house if we could only afford a $ 100,000 house .
There was deception there , and there was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street .
And we need to stop that .
Again , John McCain and I , that commitment that we have made , and we 're going to follow through on that , getting rid of that corruption .
PALIN : One thing that Americans do at this time , also , though , is let 's commit ourselves just every day American people , Joe Six Pack , hockey moms across the nation , I think we need to band together and say never again .
Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars .
We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt .
Let 's do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card .
Do n't live outside of our means .
We need to make sure that as individuals we 're taking personal responsibility through all of this .
It 's not the American peoples fault that the economy is hurting like it is , but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : Well Gwen , two years ago Barack Obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis .
John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem .
John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to The Wall Street Journal saying that I 'm always for cutting regulations .
We let Wall Street run wild .
John McCain and he's a good man , but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response , deregulate , deregulate .
So what you had is you had overwhelming " deregulation . "
You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self - regulate itself .
And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations , John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation .
As a matter of fact , John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry .
So deregulation was the promise .
And guess what ?
Those people who say do n't go into debt , they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank .
I was recently at my local gas station and asked a guy named Joey Danco ( ph ) .
I said Joey , how much did it cost to fill your tank ?
You know what his answer was ?
He said I do n't know , Joe .
I never have enough money to do it .
The middle class needs relief , tax relief .
They need it now .
They need help now .
The focus will change with Barack Obama .
IFILL : Governor , please if you want to respond to what he said about Sen.
McCain 's comments about health care ?
PALIN : I would like to respond about the tax increases .
We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here .
Now , Barack Obama and Sen. Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history .
Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the people 's side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction , 94 times .
Now , that 's not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy .
We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce .
Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if that 's what it takes to reign in the government growth that we 've seen today .
But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $ 42,000 a year .
That 's a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them .
I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : The charge is absolutely not true .
Barack Obama did not vote to raise taxes .
The vote she 's referring to , John McCain voted the exact same way .
It was a budget procedural vote .
John McCain voted the same way .
It did not raise taxes .
Number two , using the standard that the governor uses , John McCain voted 477 times to raise taxes .
It 's a bogus standard it but if you notice , Gwen , the governor did not answer the question about deregulation , did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation , letting Wall Street run wild .
He did support deregulation almost across the board .
That 's why we got into so much trouble .
IFILL : Would you like to have an opportunity to answer that before we move on ?
PALIN : I 'm still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again .
And I want to let you know what I did as a mayor and as a governor .
And I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear , but I 'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also .
As mayor , every year I was in office I did reduce taxes .
I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax .
We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up .
Now , as for John McCain 's adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations , that is another thing that he is known for though .
Look at the tobacco industry .
Look at campaign finance reform .
IFILL : OK , our time is up here .
We 've got to move to the next question .
Sen .
Biden , we want to talk about taxes , let 's talk about taxes .
You proposed raising taxes on people who earn over $ 250,000 a year .
The question for you is , why is that not class warfare and the same question for you , Gov. Palin , is you have proposed a tax employer health benefits which some studies say would actually throw five million more people onto the roles of the uninsured .
I want to know why that is n't taking things out on the poor , starting with you , Sen. Biden .
BIDEN : Well Gwen , where I come from , it 's called fairness , just simple fairness .
The middle class is struggling .
The middle class under John McCain 's tax proposal , 100 million families , middle class families , households to be precise , they got not a single change , they got not a single break in taxes .
No one making less than $ 250,000 under Barack Obama 's plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether it's their capital gains tax , their income tax , investment tax , any tax .
And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $ 150,000 will get a tax break .
Now , that seems to me to be simple fairness .
The economic engine of America is middle class .
It 's the people listening to this broadcast .
When you do well , America does well .
Even the wealthy do well .
This is not punitive .
John wants to add $ 300 million , billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class .
We have a different value set .
The middle class is the economic engine .
It 's fair .
They deserve the tax breaks , not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well .
They do n't need any more tax breaks .
And by the way , they 'll pay no more than they did under Ronald Reagan .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you .
But when you talk about Barack 's plan to tax increase affecting only those making $ 250,000 a year or more , you 're forgetting millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category .
So they 're going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity .
Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic .
In the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives , that 's not patriotic .
Patriotic is saying , government , you know , you 're not always the solution .
In fact , too often you 're the problem so , government , lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper .
An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he 's proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy .
IFILL : Governor , are you interested in defending Sen. McCain 's health care plan ?
PALIN : I am because he 's got a good health care plan that is detailed .
And I want to give you a couple details on that .
He 's proposing a $ 5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage .
That 's a smart thing to do .
That 's budget neutral .
That does n't cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obama 's plan to mandate health care coverage and have universal government run program and unless you 're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately , I do n't think that it 's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds .
But a $ 5,000 health care credit through our income tax that 's budget neutral .
That 's going to help .
And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition , we can cross state lines and if there 's a better plan offered somewhere else , we would be able to purchase that .
So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $ 5,000 tax credit also being offered .
IFILL : Thank you , governor .
Senator ?
BIDEN : Gwen , I do n't know where to start .
We do n't call a redistribution in my neighborhood Scranton , Claymont , Wilmington , the places I grew up , to give the fair to say that not giving Exxon Mobil another $ 4 billion tax cut this year as John calls for and giving it to middle class people to be able to pay to get their kids to college , we do n't call that redistribution .
We call that fairness number one .
Number two fact , 95 percent of the small businesses in America , their owners make less than $ 250,000 a year .
They would not get one single solitary penny increase in taxes , those small businesses .
BIDEN : Now , with regard to the -- to the health care plan , you know , it 's with one hand you giveth , the other you take it .
You know how Barack Obama -- excuse me , do you know how John McCain pays for his $ 5,000 tax credit you 're going to get , a family will get ?
He taxes as income every one of you out there , every one of you listening who has a health care plan through your employer .
That 's how he raises $ 3.6 trillion , on your -- taxing your health care benefit to give you a $ 5,000 plan , which his Web site points out will go straight to the insurance company .
And then you 're going to have to replace a $ 12,000 -- that 's the average cost of the plan you get through your employer -- it costs $ 12,000 .
You 're going to have to pay -- replace a $ 12,000 plan , because 20 million of you are going to be dropped .
Twenty million of you will be dropped .
So you 're going to have to place -- replace a $ 12,000 plan with a $ 5,000 check you just give to the insurance company .
I call that the " Ultimate Bridge to Nowhere . "
IFILL : Thank you , Senator .
Now ...
I want to get -- try to get you both to answer a question that neither of your principals quite answered when my colleague , Jim Lehrer , asked it last week , starting with you , Sen. Biden .
What promises -- given the events of the week , the bailout plan , all of this , what promises have you and your campaigns made to the American people that you 're not going to be able to keep ?
BIDEN : Well , the one thing we might have to slow down is a commitment we made to double foreign assistance .
We 'll probably have to slow that down .
We also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration -- of John McCain , the existing one for people making over $ 250,000 , which is $ 130 billion this year alone .
We 're not going to support the $ 300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy .
We 're not going to support another $ 4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil .
And what we 're not going to also hold up on , Gwen , is we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy , creating new jobs .
We cannot slow up on education , because that 's the engine that is going to give us the economic growth and competitiveness that we need .
And we are not going to slow up on the whole idea of providing for affordable health care for Americans , none of which , when we get to talk about health care , is as my -- as the governor characterized -- characterized .
The bottom line here is that we are going to , in fact , eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now , a number of things I do n't have time , because the light is blinking , that I wo n't be able to mention , but one of which is the $ 100 billion tax dodge that , in fact , allows people to take their post office box off - shore , avoid taxes .
I call that unpatriotic .
I call that unpatriotic .
IFILL : Governor ?
BIDEN : That 's what I 'm talking about .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : Well , the nice thing about running with John McCain is I can assure you he does n't tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group , including his plans that will make this bailout plan , this rescue plan , even better .
I want to go back to the energy plan , though , because this is -- this is an important one that Barack Obama , he voted for in '05 .
Sen .
Biden , you would remember that , in that energy plan that Obama voted for , that 's what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks .
Your running mate voted for that .
You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska ?
I had to take on those oil companies and tell them , " No , " you know , any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental , I guess , in their mode of operation , that was n't going to happen in my state .
And that 's why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips , bless their hearts , they 're doing what they need to do , as corporate CEOs , but they 're not my biggest fans , because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say , you know , the people are going to come first and we 're going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources .
And those huge tax breaks are n't coming to the big multinational corporations anymore , not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and , in this case , in a country who should be benefiting at the same time .
So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around , as a governor of an energy - producing state , and kind of undo in my own area of expertise , and that 's energy .
IFILL : So , Governor , as vice president , there 's nothing that you have promised as a candidate that you would -- that you would n't take off the table because of this financial crisis we 're in ?
PALIN : There is not .
And how long have I been at this , like five weeks ?
So there has n't been a whole lot that I 've promised , except to do what is right for the American people , put government back on the side of the American people , stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street .
And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving .
And I do n't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep , either .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : Again , let me -- let 's talk about those tax breaks .
Barack Obama --
Obama voted for an energy bill because , for the first time , it had real support for alternative energy .
When there were separate votes on eliminating the tax breaks for the oil companies , Barack Obama voted to eliminate them .
John did not .
And let me just ask a rhetorical question :
If John really wanted to eliminate them , why is he adding to his budget an additional $ 4 billion in tax cuts for ExxonMobils of the world that , in fact , already have made $ 600 billion since 2001 ?
And , look , I agree with the governor .
She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska .
That 's what Barack Obama and I want to do .
We want to be able to do for all of you Americans , give you back $ 1,000 bucks , like she 's been able to give back money to her folks back there .
But John McCain will not support a windfall profits tax .
They 've made $ 600 billion since 2001 , and John McCain wants to give them , all by itself -- separate , no additional bill , all by itself -- another $ 4 billion tax cut .
If that is not proof of what I say , I 'm not sure what can be .
So I hope the governor is able to convince John McCain to support our windfall profits tax , which she supported in Alaska , and I give her credit for it .
IFILL : Next question , Gov. Palin , still on the economy .
Last year , Congress passed a bill that would make it more difficult for debt - strapped mortgage - holders to declare bankruptcy , to get out from under that debt .
This is something that John McCain supported .
Would you have ?
PALIN : Yes , I would have .
But here , again , there have -- there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street .
We need to look back , even two years ago , and we need to be appreciative of John McCain 's call for reform with Fannie Mae , with Freddie Mac , with the mortgage - lenders , too , who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse .
And the colleagues in the Senate were n't going to go there with him .
So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people .
And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside , even putting a campaign aside , and just do what 's right to fix this economic problem that we are in .
It is a crisis .
It 's a toxic mess , really , on Main Street that 's affecting Wall Street .
And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets do n't seize up .
That 's where the Main Streeters like me , that 's where we would really feel the effects .
IFILL : Sen .
Biden , you voted for this bankruptcy bill .
Sen . Obama voted against it .
Some people have said that mortgage - holders really paid the price .
BIDEN : Well , mortgage - holders did n't pay the price .
Only 10 percent of the people who are -- have been affected by this whole switch from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 -- it gets complicated .
But the point of this -- Barack Obama saw the glass as half - empty .
I saw it as half - full .
We disagreed on that , and 85 senators voted one way , and 15 voted the other way .
But here 's the deal .
Barack Obama pointed out two years ago that there was a subprime mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of Treasury .
And he said , " You 'd better get on the stick here .
You 'd better look at it . "
John McCain said as early as last December , quote -- I 'm paraphrasing -- " I 'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis , " number one .
Number two , with regard to bankruptcy now , Gwen , what we should be doing now -- and Barack Obama and I support it -- we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate you 're paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home , but be able to adjust the principal that you owe , the principal that you owe .
That would keep people in their homes , actually help banks by keeping it from going under .
But John McCain , as I understand it -- I 'm not sure of this , but I believe John McCain and the governor do n't support that .
There are ways to help people now .
And there -- ways that we 're offering are not being supported by -- by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Gov. Palin .
IFILL : Gov. Palin , is that so ?
PALIN : That is not so , but because that 's just a quick answer , I want to talk about , again , my record on energy versus your ticket 's energy ticket , also .
I think that this is important to come back to , with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in '05 .
When we talk about energy , we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent .
It 's a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land .
And East Coast politicians who do n't allow energy - producing states like Alaska to produce these , to tap into them , and instead we 're relying on foreign countries to produce for us .
PALIN : We 're circulating about $ 700 billion a year into foreign countries , some who do not like America -- they certainly do n't have our best interests at heart -- instead of those dollars circulating here , creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very , very hungry markets .
Energy independence is the key to this nation 's future , to our economic future , and to our national security .
So when we talk about energy plans , it 's not just about who got a tax break and who did n't .
And we 're not giving oil companies tax breaks , but it 's about a heck of a lot more than that .
Energy independence is the key to America 's future .
IFILL : Governor , I 'm happy to talk to you in this next section about energy issues .
Let 's talk about climate change .
What is true and what is false about what we have heard , read , discussed , debated about the causes of climate change ?
PALIN : Yes .
Well , as the nation 's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state , Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state .
And we know that it 's real .
I 'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate .
There is something to be said also for man 's activities , but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet .
But there are real changes going on in our climate .
And I do n't want to argue about the causes .
What I want to argue about is , how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts ?
We have got to clean up this planet .
We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change , what we can do about that .
As governor , I was the first governor to form a climate change sub - cabinet to start dealing with the impacts .
We 've got to reduce emissions .
John McCain is right there with an " all of the above " approach to deal with climate change impacts .
We 've got to become energy independent for that reason .
Also as we rely more and more on other countries that do n't care as much about the climate as we do , we 're allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for .
So even in dealing with climate change , it 's all the more reason that we have an " all of the above " approach , tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel , conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change .
IFILL : Senator , what is true and what is false about the causes ?
BIDEN : Well , I think it is manmade .
I think it 's clearly manmade .
And , look , this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden -- Gov. Palin and Joe Biden .
If you do n't understand what the cause is , it 's virtually impossible to come up with a solution .
We know what the cause is .
The cause is manmade .
That 's the cause .
That 's why the polar icecap is melting .
Now , let 's look at the facts .
We have 3 percent of the world 's oil reserves .
We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world .
John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade - and - a - half against funding alternative energy sources , clean energy sources , wind , solar , biofuels .
The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting .
We believe -- Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear , we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States , we can export it .
China is building one to three new coal - fired plants burning dirty coal per week .
It 's polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States .
We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology .
We should be creating jobs .
John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks , I guess , the only answer is drill , drill , drill .
Drill we must , but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled .
In the meantime , we 're all going to be in real trouble .
IFILL : Let me clear something up , Sen. McCain has said he supports caps on carbon emissions .
Sen .
Obama has said he supports clean coal technology , which I do n't believe you 've always supported .
BIDEN : I have always supported it .
That 's a fact .
IFILL : Well , clear it up for us , both of you , and start with Gov. Palin .
PALIN : Yes , Sen. McCain does support this .
The chant is " drill , baby , drill . "
And that 's what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into .
They know that even in my own energy - producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean , green natural gas .
And we 're building a nearly $ 40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America 's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets .
Barack Obama and Sen. Biden , you 've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we 're in .
You even called drilling -- safe , environmentally - friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf .
There -- with new technology , with tiny footprints even on land , it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that .
But also in that " all of the above " approach that Sen.
McCain supports , the alternative fuels will be tapped into : the nuclear , the clean coal .
I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there is n't anything -- such a thing as clean coal .
And I think you said it in a rope line , too , at one of your rallies .
IFILL : We do need to keep within our two minutes .
But I just wanted to ask you , do you support capping carbon emissions ?
PALIN : I do .
I do .
IFILL : OK .
And on the clean coal issue ?
BIDEN : Absolutely .
Absolutely we do .
We call for setting hard targets , number one ...
IFILL : Clean coal .
BIDEN : Oh , I 'm sorry .
IFILL : On clean coal .
BIDEN : Oh , on clean coal .
My record , just take a look at the record .
My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology .
A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context .
I was talking about exporting that technology to China so when they burn their dirty coal , it wo n't be as dirty , it will be clean .
But here 's the bottom line , Gwen :
How do we deal with global warming with continued addition to carbon emissions ?
And if the only answer you have is oil , and John -- and the governor says John is for everything .
Well , why did John vote 20 times ?
Maybe he's for everything as long as it's not helped forward by the government .
Maybe he's for everything if the free market takes care of it .
I do n't know .
But he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources .
IFILL : The next round of -- pardon me , the next round of questions starts with you , Sen. Biden .
Do you support , as they do in Alaska , granting same - sex benefits to couples ?
BIDEN : Absolutely .
Do I support granting same - sex benefits ?
Absolutely positively .
Look , in an Obama - Biden administration , there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same - sex and a heterosexual couple .
The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted -- same - sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals , joint ownership of property , life insurance policies , et cetera .
That 's only fair .
It 's what the Constitution calls for .
And so we do support it .
We do support making sure that committed couples in a same - sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights , their rights of visitation , their rights to insurance , their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do .
IFILL : Governor , would you support expanding that beyond Alaska to the rest of the nation ?
PALIN : Well , not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman .
And unfortunately that 's sometimes where those steps lead .
But I also want to clarify , if there 's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners , choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves , you know , I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue , some very dear friends who do n't agree with me on this issue .
But in that tolerance also , no one would ever propose , not in a McCain - Palin administration , to do anything to prohibit , say , visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed , negotiated between parties .
But I will tell Americans straight up that I do n't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman , and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means .
But I 'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage .
IFILL : Let 's try to avoid nuance , Senator .
Do you support gay marriage ?
BIDEN : No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage .
We do not support that .
That is basically the decision to be able to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it .
The bottom line though is , and I 'm glad to hear the governor , I take her at her word , obviously , that she think there should be no civil rights distinction , none whatsoever , between a committed gay couple and a committed heterosexual couple .
If that 's the case , we really do n't have a difference .
IFILL : Is that what your said ?
PALIN : Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that I do not .
IFILL : Wonderful .
You agree .
On that note , let 's move to foreign policy .
IFILL : You both have sons who are in Iraq or on their way to Iraq .
You , Gov. Palin , have said that you would like to see a real clear plan for an exit strategy .
What should that be , Governor ?
PALIN : I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq that has proven to work , I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great American hero , Gen. Petraeus , and pushed hard by another great American , Sen. John McCain .
I know that the other ticket opposed this surge , in fact , even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so .
PALIN : And Sen .
Biden , I respected you when you called him out on that .
You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives .
And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that .
He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops .
We do have a plan for withdrawal .
We do n't need early withdrawal out of Iraq .
We cannot afford to lose there or we 're going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either .
We have got to win in Iraq .
And with the surge that has worked we 're now down to pre-surge numbers in Iraq .
That 's where we can be .
We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us and we need to grow our military .
We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and the Shia extremists who are still there , still fighting us , but we 're getting closer and closer to victory .
And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : Gwen , with all due respect , I did n't hear a plan .
Barack Obama offered a clear plan .
Shift responsibility to Iraqis over the next 16 months .
Draw down our combat troops .
Ironically the same plan that Maliki , the prime minister of Iraq and George Bush are now negotiating .
The only odd man out here , only one left out is John McCain , number one .
Number two , with regard to Barack Obama not quote funding the troops , John McCain voted the exact same way .
John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops .
And John said I 'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there 's a time line .
Barack Obama and I agree fully and completely on one thing .
You 've got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the Iraqis .
We 're spending $ 10 billion a month while Iraqis have an $ 80 billion surplus .
Barack says it 's time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military we trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over 16 months , withdrawal .
John McCain -- this is a fundamental difference between us , we 'll end this war .
For John McCain , there 's no end in sight to end this war , fundamental difference .
We will end this war .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq and that is not what our troops need to hear today , that 's for sure .
And it 's not what our nation needs to be able to count on .
You guys opposed the surge .
The surge worked .
Barack Obama still can't admit the surge works .
We 'll know when we 're finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people .
And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met .
And Maliki and Talabani also in working with us are knowing again that we are getting closer and closer to that point , that victory that 's within sight .
Now , you said regarding Sen.
McCain 's military policies there , Sen. Biden , that you supported a lot of these things .
In fact , you said in fact that you wanted to run , you 'd be honored to run with him on the ticket .
That 's an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP pick here .
You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief .
And I know again that you opposed the move he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that .
I do n't know how you can defend that position now but I know that you know especially with your son in the National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military .
Barack Obama though , another story there .
Anyone I think who can cut off funding for the troops after promising not to is another story .
IFILL : Sen . Biden ?
BIDEN : John McCain voted to cut off funding for the troops .
Let me say that again .
John McCain voted against an amendment containing $ 1 billion , $ 600 million that I had gotten to get MRAPS , those things that are protecting the governor 's son and pray god my son and a lot of other sons and daughters .
He voted against it .
He voted against funding because he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war .
He did n't like that .
But let 's get straight who has been right and wrong .
John McCain and Dick Cheney said while I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators , we would not - this war would take a decade and not a day , not a week and not six months , we would not be out of there quickly .
John McCain was saying the Sunnis and Shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years .
John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this .
John McCain has been dead wrong .
I love him .
As my mother would say , god love him , but he 's been dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war .
Barack Obama has been right .
There are the facts .
IFILL : Let 's move to Iran and Pakistan .
I 'm curious about what you think starting with you Sen. Biden .
What 's the greater threat , a nuclear Iran or an unstable [ Pakistan ] ?
Explain why .
BIDEN : Well , they 're both extremely dangerous .
I always am focused , as you know Gwen , I have been focusing on for a long time , along with Barack on Pakistan .
Pakistan already has nuclear weapons .
Pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons .
Pakistan 's weapons can already hit Israel and the Mediterranean .
Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very , very destabilizing .
They are more than - they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon that 's able to be deployed .
So they 're both very dangerous .
They both would be game changers .
But look , here 's what the fundamental problem I have with John 's policy about terror instability .
John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq .
I promise you , if an attack comes in the homeland , it 's going to come as our security services have said , it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
That 's where they live .
That 's where they are .
That 's where it will come from .
And right now that resides in Pakistan , a stable government needs to be established .
We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance and their economic well - being .
There have been 7,000 madrasses built along that border .
We should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region so that we 're actually able to take on terrorism and by the way , that 's where bin Laden lives and we will go at him if we have actually intelligence .
IFILL : Governor , nuclear Pakistan , unstable Pakistan , nuclear Iran ?
Which is the greater threat ?
PALIN : Both are extremely dangerous , of course .
And as for who coined that central war on terror being in Iraq , it was the Gen .
Petraeus and al Qaeda , both leaders there and it's probably the only thing that they 're ever going to agree on , but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq .
You do n't have to believe me or John McCain on that .
I would believe Petraeus and the leader of al Qaeda .
An armed , nuclear armed especially Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider .
They can not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period .
Israel is in jeopardy of course when we 're dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran .
Iran claiming that Israel as he termed it , a stinking corpse , a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth .
Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy , nuclear weapons .
Ahmadinejad , Kim Jong
Il , the Castro brothers , others who are dangerous dictators are one that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first .
And an issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment .
A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first .
IFILL : Governor and senator , I want you both to respond to this .
Secretaries of state Baker , Kissinger , Powell , they have all advocated some level of engagement with enemies .
Do you think these former secretaries of state are wrong on that ?
PALIN : No and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially .
I had a good conversation with him recently .
And he shared with me his passion for diplomacy .
And that 's what John McCain and I would engage in also .
But again , with some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for , with our freedoms , our democracy , our tolerance , our respect for women 's rights , those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he would be willing to do .
That is beyond bad judgment .
That is dangerous .
No , diplomacy is very important .
First and foremost , that is what we would engage in .
But diplomacy is hard work by serious people .
It 's lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there and have sanctions lined up before any kind of presidential summit would take place .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : Can I clarify this ?
This is simply not true about Barack Obama .
He did not say sit down with Ahmadinejad .
BIDEN : The fact of the matter is , it surprises me that Sen.
McCain does n't realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran .
The theocracy controls the security apparatus , number one .
Number two , five secretaries of state did say we should talk with and sit down .
Now , John and Gov. Palin now say they 're all for -- they have a passion , I think the phrase was , a passion for diplomacy and that we have to bring our friends and allies along .
Our friends and allies have been saying , Gwen , " Sit down .
Talk .
Talk .
Talk . "
Our friends and allies have been saying that , five secretaries of state , three of them Republicans .
And John McCain has said he would go along with an agreement , but he would n't sit down .
Now , how do you do that when you do n't have your administration sit down and talk with the adversary ?
And look what President Bush did .
After five years , he finally sent a high - ranking diplomat to meet with the highest - ranking diplomats in Iran , in Europe , to try to work out an arrangement .
Our allies are on that same page .
And if we do n't go the extra mile on diplomacy , what makes you think the allies are going to sit with us ?
The last point I 'll make , John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he would n't even sit down with the government of Spain , a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now .
I find that incredible .
IFILL : Governor , you mentioned Israel and your support for Israel .
PALIN : Yes .
IFILL : What has this administration done right or wrong -- this is the great , lingering , unresolved issue , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict -- what have they done ?
And is a two - state solution the solution ?
PALIN : A two - state solution is the solution .
And Secretary Rice , having recently met with leaders on one side or the other there , also , still in these waning days of the Bush administration , trying to forge that peace , and that needs to be done , and that will be top of an agenda item , also , under a McCain - Palin administration .
Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East .
We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust , despite , again , warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel , that that is what they would like to see .
We will support Israel .
A two - state solution , building our embassy , also , in Jerusalem , those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish , with this peace - seeking nation , and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements .
They succeeded with Jordan .
They succeeded with Egypt .
I 'm sure that we 're going to see more success there , also .
It 's got to be a commitment of the United States of America , though .
And I can promise you , in a McCain - Palin administration , that commitment is there to work with our friends in Israel .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : Gwen , no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden .
I would have never , ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion .
But you asked a question about whether or not this administration 's policy had made sense or something to that effect .
It has been an abject failure , this administration 's policy .
In fairness to Secretary Rice , she 's trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year .
Here 's what the president said when we said no .
He insisted on elections on the West Bank , when I said , and others said , and Barack Obama said , " Big mistake .
Hamas will win .
You 'll legitimize them . "
What happened ?
Hamas won .
When we kicked -- along with France , we kicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon , I said and Barack said , " Move NATO forces in there .
Fill the vacuum , because if you do n't know -- if you do n't , Hezbollah will control it . "
Now what 's happened ?
Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel .
The fact of the matter is , the policy of this administration has been an abject failure .
And speaking of freedom being on the march , the only thing on the march is Iran .
It 's closer to a bomb .
Its proxies now have a major stake in Lebanon , as well as in the Gaza Strip with Hamas .
We will change this policy with thoughtful , real , live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate , support their negotiation , and stand with them , not insist on policies like this administration has .
IFILL : Has this administration 's policy been an abject failure , as the senator says , Governor ?
PALIN : No , I do not believe that it has been .
But I 'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel , and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on , Sen. Biden .
I respect your position on that .
No , in fact , when we talk about the Bush administration , there 's a time , too , when Americans are going to say , " Enough is enough with your ticket , " on constantly looking backwards , and pointing fingers , and doing the blame game .
There have been huge blunders in the war .
There have been huge blunders throughout this administration , as there are with every administration .
But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future , there 's just too much finger - pointing backwards to ever make us believe that that 's where you 're going .
Positive change is coming , though .
Reform of government is coming .
We 'll learn from the past mistakes in this administration and other administrations .
And we 're going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure that our country comes first , putting obsessive partisanship aside .
That 's what John McCain has been known for in all these years .
He has been the maverick .
He has ruffled feathers .
But I know , Sen .
Biden , you have respected for them that , and I respect you for acknowledging that .
But change is coming .
IFILL : Just looking backwards , Senator ?
BIDEN : Look , past is prologue , Gwen .
The issue is , how different is John McCain 's policy going to be than George Bush's ?
I have n't heard anything yet .
I have n't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's .
I have n't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's .
I have n't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's .
I have n't heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bush's .
It may be .
But so far , it is the same as George Bush's .
And you know where that policy has taken us .
We will make significant change so , once again , we 're the most respected nation in the world .
That 's what we 're going to do .
IFILL : Governor , on another issue , interventionism , nuclear weapons .
What should be the trigger , or should there be a trigger , when nuclear weapons use is ever put into play ?
PALIN : Nuclear weaponry , of course , would be the be all , end all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet , so those dangerous regimes , again , cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons , period .
Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent .
And that 's a safe , stable way to use nuclear weaponry .
But for those countries -- North Korea , also , under Kim Jong
Il -- we have got to make sure that we 're putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong Il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire , to proliferate , or to use those nuclear weapons .
It is that important .
Can we talk about Afghanistan real quick , also , though ?
IFILL : Certainly .
PALIN : OK , I 'd like to just really quickly mention there , too , that when you look back and you say that the Bush administration 's policy on Afghanistan perhaps would be the same as McCain , and that 's not accurate .
The surge principles , not the exact strategy , but the surge principles that have worked in Iraq need to be implemented in Afghanistan , also .
And that , perhaps , would be a difference with the Bush administration .
Now , Barack Obama had said that all we 're doing in Afghanistan is air - raiding villages and killing civilians .
And such a reckless , reckless comment and untrue comment , again , hurts our cause .
That 's not what we 're doing there .
We 're fighting terrorists , and we 're securing democracy , and we 're building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country , also .
There will be a big difference there , and we will win in -- in Afghanistan , also .
IFILL : Senator , you may talk about nuclear use , if you 'd like , and also about Afghanistan .
BIDEN : I 'll talk about both .
With Afghanistan , facts matter , Gwen .
The fact is that our commanding general in Afghanistan said today that a surge -- the surge principles used in Iraq will not -- well , let me say this again now -- our commanding general in Afghanistan said the surge principle in Iraq will not work in Afghanistan , not Joe Biden , our commanding general in Afghanistan .
He said we need more troops .
We need government - building .
We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan .
Look , we have spent more money -- we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country .
Let me say that again .
Three weeks in Iraq ; seven years , seven years or six - and - a- half years in Afghanistan .
Now , that 's number one .
Number two , with regard to arms control and weapons , nuclear weapons require a nuclear arms control regime .
John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear - Test - Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported .
John McCain has opposed amending the Nuclear - Test - Ban Treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections .
John McCain has not been -- has not been the kind of supporter for dealing with -- and let me put it another way .
My time is almost up .
Barack Obama , first thing he did when he came to the United States Senate , new senator , reached across the aisle to my colleague , Dick Lugar , a Republican , and said , " We 've got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists . "
They put together a piece of legislation that , in fact , was serious and real .
Every major -- I should n't say every -- on the two at least that I named , I know that John McCain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : Well , first , McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan .
Certainly , accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different .
We have NATO allies helping us for one and even the geographic differences are huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan .
McClellan did n't say anything opposite of that .
The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan , clearing , holding , rebuilding , the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan .
And those leaders who are over there , who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that .
IFILL : Senator
BIDEN : Well , our commanding general did say that .
The fact of the matter is that again , I 'll just put in perspective , while Barack and I and Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar have been calling for more money to help in Afghanistan , more troops in Afghanistan , John McCain was saying two years ago quote , " The reason we do n't read about Afghanistan anymore in the paper , it 's succeeded .
Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there .
Again , we spend in three weeks on combat missions in Iraq , more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan .
That will change in a Barack Obama administration .
IFILL : Senator , you have quite a record , this is the next question here , of being an interventionist .
You argued for intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo , initially in Iraq and Pakistan and now in Darfur , putting U.S. troops on the ground .
Boots on the ground .
Is this something the American public has the stomach for ?
BIDEN : I think the American public has the stomach for success .
My recommendations on Bosnia .
I admit I was the first one to recommend it .
They saved tens of thousands of lives .
And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people .
But the end result was it worked .
Look what we did in Bosnia .
We took Serbs , Croats and Bosniaks , being told by everyone , I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been killing each other for a thousand years , it would never work .
There 's a relatively stable government there now as in Kosovo .
With regard to Iraq , I indicated it would be a mistake to -- I gave the president the power .
I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States , the UN in line , to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted .
I , along with Dick Lugar , before we went to war , said if we were to go to war without our allies , without the kind of support we need , we'd be there for a decade and it'd cost us tens of billions of dollars .
John McCain said , no , it was going to be OK .
I do n't have the stomach for genocide when it comes to Darfur .
We can now impose a no - fly zone .
It 's within our capacity .
We can lead NATO if we 're willing to take a hard stand .
We can , I 've been in those camps in Chad .
I 've seen the suffering , thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying .
We should rally the world to act and demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide .
IFILL : Thank you , senator .
Governor .
PALIN : Oh , yeah , it 's so obvious I 'm a Washington outsider .
And someone just not used to the way you guys operate .
Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war .
You 're one who says , as so many politicians do , I was for it before I was against it or vice - versa .
Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know , hey , if you voted for it , tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution .
And you had supported John McCain 's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama 's military strategy , including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary .
And I watched those debates , so I remember what those were all about .
But as for as Darfur , we can agree on that also , the supported of the no-fly zone , making sure that all options are on the table there also .
America is in a position to help .
What I 've done in my position to help , as the governor of a state that 's pretty rich in natural resources , we have a $ 40 billion investment fund , a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund .
When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan , we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we were n't doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur .
That legislation has n't passed yet but it needs to because all of us , as individuals , and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world .
IFILL : Is there a line that should be drawn about when we decide to go in ?
BIDEN : Absolutely .
There is a line that should be drawn .
IFILL : What is it ?
BIDEN : The line that should be drawn is whether we A , first of all have the capacity to do anything about it number one .
And number two , certain new lines that have to be drawn internationally .
When a country engages in genocide , when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it , at that point that country in my view and Barack 's view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all .
The truth of the matter is , though , let 's go back to John McCain 's strategy .
I never supported John McCain 's strategy on the war .
John McCain said exactly what Dick Cheney said , go back and look at Barack Obama 's statements and mine .
Go look at joebiden.com , contemporaneously , held hearings in the summer before we went to war , saying if we went to war , we would not be greeted as liberator , we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias , we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars .
John McCain was saying the exact opposite .
John McCain was lock - step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy .
So John McCain 's strategy in this war , not just whether or not to go , the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset .
IFILL : Governor .
PALIN : I beg to disagree with you , again , here on whether you supported Barack Obama or John McCain 's strategies .
Here again , you can say what you want to say a month out before people are asked to vote on this , but we listened to the debates .
I think tomorrow morning , the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and we 'll have proof of some of this , but , again , John McCain who knows how to win a war .
Who 's been there and he 's faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military .
He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq , especially .
He will know how to implement the strategies , working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say , taking the politics out of these war issues .
He 'll know how to win a war .
IFILL : Thank you , governor .
Probably the biggest cliche about the vice - presidency is that it's a heartbeat away , everybody 's waiting to see what would happen if the worst happened .
How would -- you disagree on some things from your principles , you disagree on drilling in Alaska , the National Wildlife Refuge , you disagree on the surveillance law , at least you have in the past .
How would a Biden administration be different from an Obama administration if that were to happen .
BIDEN : God forbid that would ever happen , it would be a national tragedy of historic proportions if it were to happen .
But if it did , I would carry out Barack Obama 's policy , his policies of reinstating the middle class , making sure they get a fair break , making sure they have access to affordable health insurance , making sure they get serious tax breaks , making sure we can help their children get to college , making sure there is an energy policy that leads us in the direction of not only toward independence and clean environment but an energy policy that creates 5 million new jobs , a foreign policy that ends this war in Iraq , a foreign policy that goes after the one mission the American public gave the president after 9/11 , to get and capture or kill bin Laden and to eliminate al Qaeda .
A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating .
And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change and replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation and , ladies and gentlemen , this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election .
This is the most important election you will ever , ever have voted in , any of you , since 1932 .
And there 's such stark differences , I would follow through on Barack 's policies because in essence , I agree with every major initiative he is suggesting .
IFILL : Governor .
PALIN : And heaven forbid , yes , that would ever happen , no matter how this ends up , that that would ever happen with either party .
As for disagreeing with John McCain and how our administration would work , what do you expect ?
A team of mavericks , of course we 're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything .
As we discuss ANWR there , at least we can agree to disagree on that one .
I will keep pushing him on ANWR .
I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy .
What I would do also , if that were to ever happen , though , is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington .
I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there , brought to Washington , D.C .
PALIN : So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress and inaction of Congress .
Just everyday working class Americans saying , you know , government , just get out of my way .
If you 're going to do any harm and mandate more things on me and take more of my money and income tax and business taxes , you 're going to have a choice in just a few weeks here on either supporting a ticket that wants to create jobs and bolster our economy and win the war or you 're going to be supporting a ticket that wants to increase taxes , which ultimately kills jobs , and is going to hurt our economy .
BIDEN : Can I respond ?
Look , all you have to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington or go to Katie 's Restaurant or walk into Home Depot with me where I spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years .
And then ask them whether there 's a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on .
On taxes , on Iraq , on Afghanistan , on the whole question of how to help education , on the dealing with health care .
Look , the people in my neighborhood , they get it .
They get it .
They know they 've been getting the short end of the stick .
So walk with me in my neighborhood , go back to my old neighborhood in Claymont , an old steel town or go up to Scranton with me .
These people know the middle class has gotten the short end .
The wealthy have done very well .
Corporate America has been rewarded .
It 's time we change it .
Barack Obama will change it .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : Say it ai n't so , Joe , there you go again pointing backwards again .
You preferenced your whole comment with the Bush administration .
Now doggone it , let 's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future .
You mentioned education and I 'm glad you did .
I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years , and god bless her .
Her reward is in heaven , right ?
I say , too , with education , America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving .
Teachers needed to be paid more .
I come from a house full of school teachers .
My grandma was , my dad who is in the audience today , he 's a schoolteacher , had been for many years .
My brother , who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year , and here 's a shout - out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School , you get extra credit for watching the debate .
Education credit in American has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax and we have got to increase the standards .
No Child Left Behind was implemented .
It 's not doing the job though .
We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind .
We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching .
We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas , I think , absolute top of the line .
My kids as public school participants right now , it 's near and dear to my heart .
I 'm very , very concerned about where we 're going with education and we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena .
IFILL : Everybody gets extra credit tonight .
We 're going to move on to the next question .
Governor , you said in July that someone would have to explain to you exactly what it is the vice president does every day .
You , senator , said you would not be vice president under any circumstances .
Now maybe this was just what was going on at the time .
But tell us now , looking forward , what it is you think the vice presidency is worth now .
PALIN : In my comment there , it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke , too , I guess , because nobody got it .
Of course we know what a vice president does .
BIDEN : They did n't get yours or mine ?
Which one did n't they get ?
PALIN : No , no .
Of course , we know what a vice president does .
And that 's not only to preside over the Senate and will take that position very seriously also .
I 'm thankful the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president 's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are .
John McCain and I have had good conversations about where I would lead with his agenda .
That is energy independence in America and reform of government over all , and then working with families of children with special needs .
That 's near and dear to my heart also .
In those arenas , John McCain has already tapped me and said , that 's where I want you , I want you to lead .
I said , I can't wait to get and there go to work with you .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : Gwen , I hope we 'll get back to education because I do n't know any government program that John is supporting , not early education , more money for it .
The reason No Child Left Behind was left behind , the money was left behind , we did n't fund it .
We can get back to that I assume .
With regard to the role of vice president , I had a long talk , as I 'm sure the governor did with her principal , in my case with Barack .
Let me tell you what Barack asked me to do .
I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate .
John McCain would acknowledge that .
My record shows that on controversial issues .
I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration .
I would also , when asked if I wanted a portfolio , my response was , no .
But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern .
So every major decision he 'll be making , I 'll be sitting in the room to give my best advice .
He 's president , not me , I 'll give my best advice .
And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing , he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and would n't be afraid to tell him if he disagreed .
That is sort of my reputation , as you know .
I look forward to working with Barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency , bringing about the kind of change this country needs .
IFILL : Governor , you mentioned a moment ago the constitution might give the vice president more power than it has in the past .
Do you believe as Vice President Cheney does , that the Executive Branch does not hold complete sway over the office of the vice presidency , that it it is also a member of the Legislative Branch ?
PALIN : Well , our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president .
And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president 's agenda in that position .
Yeah , so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there , and we 'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation .
And it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as V.P. with McCain , not only as a governor , but earlier on as a mayor , as an oil and gas regulator , as a business owner .
It is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also .
IFILL : Vice President Cheney 's interpretation of the vice presidency ?
BIDEN : Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we 've had probably in American history .
The idea he does n't realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States , that 's the Executive Branch .
He works in the Executive Branch .
He should understand that .
Everyone should understand that .
And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America , give that president his or her best judgment when sought , and as vice president , to preside over the Senate , only in a time when in fact there 's a tie vote .
The Constitution is explicit .
The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote , only when there is a tie vote .
He has no authority relative to the Congress .
The idea he 's part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us .
It has been very dangerous .
IFILL : Let 's talk conventional wisdom for a moment .
The conventional wisdom , Gov. Palin with you , is that your Achilles heel is that you lack experience .
Your conventional wisdom against you is that your Achilles heel is that you lack discipline , Sen. Biden .
What id it really for you , Gov. Palin ?
What is it really for you , Sen. Biden ?
Start with you , governor .
PALIN : My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state , a huge energy producing state that is accounting for much progress towards getting our nation energy independence and that 's extremely important .
But it was n't just that experience tapped into , it was my connection to the heartland of America .
Being a mom , one very concerned about a son in the war , about a special needs child , about kids heading off to college , how are we going to pay those tuition bills ?
About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we did n't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out how are they going to pay out - of - pocket for health care ?
We 've been there also so that connection was important .
But even more important is that world view that I share with John McCain .
That world view that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism .
And we are to be that shining city on a hill , as President Reagan so beautifully said , that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here .
We are not perfect as a nation .
But together , we represent a perfect ideal .
And that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights .
Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world .
John McCain and I share that .
You combine all that with being a team with the only track record of making a really , a difference in where we 've been and reforming , that 's a good team , it 's a good ticket .
IFILL : Senator ?
BIDEN : You 're very kind suggesting my only Achilles Heel is my lack of discipline .
Others talk about my excessive passion .
I 'm not going to change .
I have 35 years in public office .
People can judge who I am .
I have n't changed in that time .
And , by the way , a record of change -- I will place my record and Barack 's record against John McCain 's or anyone else in terms of fundamental accomplishments .
Wrote the crime bill , put 100,000 cops on the street , wrote the Violence Against Women Act , which John McCain voted against both of them , was the catalyst to change the circumstance in Bosnia , led by President Clinton , obviously .
Look , I understand what it 's like to be a single parent .
When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured , I understand what it 's like as a parent to wonder what it 's like if your kid 's going to make it .
I understand what it 's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says , " I 've got to leave , champ , because there 's no jobs here .
I got to head down to Wilmington .
And when we get enough money , honey , we 'll bring you down . "
I understand what it 's like .
I 'm much better off than almost all Americans now .
I get a good salary with the United States Senate .
I live in a beautiful house that 's my total investment that I have .
So I -- I am much better off now .
But the notion that somehow , because I 'm a man , I do n't know what it 's like to raise two kids alone , I do n't know what it 's like to have a child you 're not sure is going to -- is going to make it -- I understand .
I understand , as well as , with all due respect , the governor or anybody else , what it 's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table .
And guess what ?
They 're looking for help .
They 're looking for help .
They 're not looking for more of the same .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : People are n't looking for more of the same .
They are looking for change .
And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years .
He 's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party , because he's had to take on his own party when the time was right , when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people .
That 's what I 've done as governor , also , take on my own party , when I had to , and work with both sides of the aisle , in my cabinet , appointing those who would serve regardless of party , Democrats , independents , Republicans , whatever it took to get the job done .
Also , John McCain 's maverick position that he's in , that 's really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has .
Look at Lieberman , and Giuliani , and Romney , and Lingle , and all of us who come from such a diverse background of -- of policy and of partisanship , all coming together at this time , recognizing he is the man that we need to leave -- lead in these next four years , because these are tumultuous times .
We have got to win the wars .
We have got to get our economy back on track .
We have got to not allow the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore .
And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington , D.C. , no matter who 's been in charge .
When the Republicans were in charge , I did n't see a lot of progress there , either .
When the Democrats , either , though , this last go- around for the last two years .
Change is coming .
And John McCain is the leader of that reform .
IFILL : Senator ...
BIDEN : I 'll be very brief .
Can I respond to that ?
Look , the maverick -- let 's talk about the maverick John McCain is .
And , again , I love him .
He 's been a maverick on some issues , but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to people 's lives .
He voted four out of five times for George Bush 's budget , which put us a half a trillion dollars in debt this year and over $ 3 trillion in debt since he 's got there .
He has not been a maverick in providing health care for people .
He has voted against -- he voted including another 3.6 million children in coverage of the existing health care plan , when he voted in the United States Senate .
He 's not been a maverick when it comes to education .
He has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college .
He 's not been a maverick on the war .
He 's not been a maverick on virtually anything that genuinely affects the things that people really talk about around their kitchen table .
Can we send -- can we get Mom's MRI ?
Can we send Mary back to school next semester ?
We can't -- we can't make it .
How are we going to heat the -- heat the house this winter ?
He voted against even providing for what they call LIHEAP , for assistance to people , with oil prices going through the roof in the winter .
So maverick he is not on the important , critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table .
IFILL : Final question tonight , before your closing statements , starting with you , Sen. Biden .
Can you think of a single issue -- and this is to cast light for people who are just trying to get to know you in your final debate , your only debate of this year -- can you think of a single issue , policy issue , in which you were forced to change a long - held view in order to accommodate changed circumstances ?
BIDEN : Yes , I can .
When I got to the United States Senate and went on the Judiciary Committee as a young lawyer , I was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed , suggested by the president had a judicial temperament , had not committed a crime of moral turpitude , and was -- had been a good student .
And it did n't take me long -- it was hard to change , but it did n't take me long , but it took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference .
That 's why I led the fight against Judge Bork .
Had he been on the court , I suspect there would be a lot of changes that I do n't like and the American people would n't like , including everything from Roe v.
Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties .
And so that -- that -- that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as I got a close look at it .
And that 's why I was the first chairman of the Judiciary Committee to forthrightly state that it matters what your judicial philosophy is .
The American people have a right to understand it and to know it .
But I did change on that , and -- and I 'm glad I did .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : There have been times where , as mayor and governor , we have passed budgets that I did not veto and that I think could be considered as something that I quasi - caved in , if you will , but knowing that it was the right thing to do in order to progress the agenda for that year and to work with the legislative body , that body that actually holds the purse strings .
So there were times when I wanted to zero - base budget , and to cut taxes even more , and I did n't have enough support in order to accomplish that .
But on the major principle things , no , there has n't been something that I 've had to compromise on , because we 've always seemed to find a way to work together .
Up there in Alaska , what we have done is , with bipartisan efforts , is work together and , again , not caring who gets the credit for what , as we accomplish things up there .
And that 's been just a part of the operation that I wanted to participate in .
And that 's what we 're going to do in Washington , D.C. , also , bring in both sides together .
John McCain is known for doing that , also , in order to get the work done for the American people .
IFILL : Let 's come full circle .
You both want to bring both sides together .
You both talk about bipartisanship .
Once again , we saw what happened this week in Washington .
How do you change the tone , as vice president , as number - two ?
BIDEN : Well , again , I believe John McCain , were he here -- and this is a dangerous thing to say in the middle of an election -- but he would acknowledge what I 'm about to say .
I have been able to work across the aisle on some of the most controversial issues and change my party 's mind , as well as Republicans ' , because I learned a lesson from Mike Mansfield .
Mike Mansfield , a former leader of the Senate , said to me one day -- he -- I made a criticism of Jesse Helms .
He said , " What would you do if I told you Jesse Helms and Dot Helms had adopted a child who had braces and was in real need ? "
I said , " I 'd feel like a jerk . "
He said , " Joe , understand one thing .
Everyone 's sent here for a reason , because there 's something in them that their folks like .
Do n't question their motive . "
I have never since that moment in my first year questioned the motive of another member of the Congress or Senate with whom I 've disagreed .
I 've questioned their judgment .
I think that 's why I have the respect I have and have been able to work as well as I 've been able to have worked in the United States Senate .
That 's the fundamental change Barack Obama and I will be bring to this party , not questioning other people 's motives .
IFILL : Governor ?
PALIN : You do what I did as governor , and you appoint people regardless of party affiliation , Democrats , independents , Republicans .
You -- you walk the walk ; you do n't just talk the talk .
And even in my own family , it 's a very diverse family .
And we have folks of all political persuasion in there , also , so I 've grown up just knowing that , you know , at the end of the day , as long as we 're all working together for the greater good , it 's going to be OK .
But the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves , also .
And , again , voters on November 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create jobs .
You do that by lowering taxes on American workers and on our businesses .
And you build up infrastructure , and you rein in government spending , and you make our -- our nation energy independent .
Or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes .
And that 's what the track record shows , is a desire to increase taxes , increase spending , a trillion - dollar spending proposal that 's on the table .
That 's going to hurt our country , and saying no to energy independence .
Clear choices on November 4th .
IFILL : Gov. Palin , you get the chance to make the first closing statement .
PALIN : Well , again , Gwen , I do want to thank you and the commission .
This is such an honor for me .
And I appreciate , too , Sen .
Biden , getting to meet you , finally , also , and getting to debate with you .
And I would like more opportunity for this .
I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter , even , of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what they 've just heard .
I 'd rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did .
And it 's so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th .
I want to assure you that John McCain and I , we 're going to fight for America .
We 're going to fight for the middle - class , average , everyday American family like mine .
I 've been there .
I know what the hurts are .
I know what the challenges are .
And , thank God , I know what the joys are , too , of living in America .
We are so blessed .
And I 've always been proud to be an American .
And so has John McCain .
We have to fight for our freedoms , also , economic and our national security freedoms .
It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction .
We do n't pass it to our children in the bloodstream ; we have to fight for it and protect it , and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same , or we 're going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children 's children about a time in America , back in the day , when men and women were free .
We will fight for it , and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you , and that 's Sen. John McCain .
IFILL : Thank you , Governor .
Sen. Biden .
BIDEN : Gwen , thank you for doing this , and the commission , and Governor , it really was a pleasure getting to meet you .
Look , folks , this is the most important election you 've ever voted in your entire life .
No one can deny that the last eight years , we 've been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy , and abroad in terms of our credibility .
And there 's a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy , as well as our foreign policy .
And Barack Obama and I do n't measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well CEOs are doing , or giving another $ 4 billion in tax breaks to the Exxon Mobils of the world .
We measure progress in America based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage , whether or not they can send their kid to college , whether or not they 're able to , when they send their child , like we have abroad -- or I 'm about to , abroad -- and John has as well , I might add -- to fight , that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need .
And when they come home , they 're guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible .
You know , in the neighborhood I grew up in , it was all about dignity and respect .
A neighborhood like most of you grew up in .
And in that neighborhood , it was filled with women and men , mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves , if they were honest , if they worked hard , if they loved their country , they could accomplish anything .
We believed it , and we did .
That 's why Barack Obama and I are running , to re-establish that certitude in our neighborhoods .
Ladies and gentlemen , my dad used to have an expression .
He 'd say , " champ , when you get knocked down , get up . "
Well , it 's time for America to get up together .
America 's ready , you 're ready , I 'm ready , and Barack Obama is ready to be the next president of the United States of America .
May God bless all of you , and most of all , for both of us , selfishly , may God protect our troops .
IFILL : That ends tonight 's debate .
We want to thank the folks here at Washington University in St. Louis , and the Commission on Presidential Debates .
There are two more debates to come .
Next Tuesday , October 7th , with Tom Brokaw at Belmont University in Nashville , and on October 15th at Hofstra University in New York , with Bob Schieffer .
Thank you , Gov. Palin and Sen. Biden .
Good night , everybody .

There are some who feel that McCain can turn this disaster around in 30 days .
I had to laugh at that quote , because the election is in 23 days .
The GOP must be so upset they have forgotten basic math skills .
This is from a NYT ’s article on Sunday .
“ The main thing he needs to do , ” said Vin Weber , a former Republican congressman from Minnesota , “ is focus on a single message – a single , concise or clear - cut message , and stick with that over the next 30 days , regardless of what happens .
He ’s had a lot of attack lines .
But it ’s time to choose . ”
Republicans are coming out left and right making their displeasure known about McCain .
My suggestion to McCain this morning , do n’t read any newspapers .
A former Republican Governor not very happy with McCain speaks out .
Tommy Thompson , a Republican who is a former governor of Wisconsin , said it would be difficult for Mr. McCain to win in his state but not impossible , particularly if he campaigned in conservative Democratic parts of the state .
Asked if he was happy with Mr. McCain ’s campaign , Mr. Thompson replied , “ No , ” and he added , “ I do n’t know who is . ”
Gail Collins from The New York Times op - ed is wishing for “ Dear Old Golden Dog Days . ”
The whole op - ed is a great read .
Here is her wish list and her view of McCain .
Remember how we used to joke about John McCain looking like an old guy yelling at kids to get off his lawn ?
It ’s only in retrospect that we can see that the keep - off - the - grass period was the McCain campaign ’s golden era .
Now , he ’s beginning to act like one of those movie characters who steals the wrong ring and turns into a troll .
The Republican campaign strategy now involves sending their candidates to areas where everybody is a die - hard McCain supporter already .
Then they yell about Obama until the crowd is so frenzied people start making threats .
The rest of the country is supposed to watch and conclude that this would be an enjoyable way to spend the next four years .
Maybe the Republicans should have picked somebody else .
I miss Mitt Romney .
Sure , he was sort of smarmy .
But when Mitt was around , the banks had money and Iceland was solvent .
And , of course , when we got bored , we could always talk about how he drove to Canada with his Irish setter strapped to the car roof .
Now the Florida Republicans blame McCain for them trailing in the polls .
They can not run away fast enough from his campaign .
One even ditched a McCain rally to go to Disney World .
I ’m sorry but that is pretty bad when a Republican Governor puts Mickey Mouse before supporting the Republican nominee .
Now that ’s funny .
” When I have time to help , I ’ll try to do that , ” Crist said last week , after he flew around the state with McCain running mate Sarah Palin .
Saturday , he skipped a McCain football rally and instead went to Disney World .
” This effort lacks coordination and a cooperative spirit and it ’s showing , ” Stone said .
“ But it ’s more than mechanics .
The campaign has no consistent message . ”
The economy , an unpopular president , a strong opponent , and the inability of John McCain to reverse poll numbers despite repeatedly revising his strategy has top state Republicans looking for someone to blame .
McCain brought this on himself by running the most negative campaign in our history .
He has completely ruined the true conservative platform .
McCain should have considered the consequences of his actions – he has taken so many wrong turns in this campaign , there is no way to redeem himself at this point .
I have to agree with Gail , his POW campaign strategy , was much better than the path he chose to go down .
Expired !
Uh-oh , this campaign is not active .
Please contact the organizer for other active campaigns .
Data security is a hard enough problem to solve on even a heavily regulated corporate network , but it becomes even more difficult when users are out in the wild with PDAs , cell phones and other portable communications devices .
A recent PhD project at the University of Twente in the Netherlands has described a user - friendly solution to cryptography for ad - hoc network transfers , such as sending files over infrared or Bluetooth between two PDAs , and it 's as easy as taking a picture .
Current methods of ensuring the authenticity of a device are less than ideal .
They generally rely on a third - party , trusted system to authenticate each device , which can then use a key supplied by that system to secure communications between the two devices .
This opens the door to forgotten passwords , weak passwords that can be cracked , and compromise of the third - party trusted system .
The researchers at Twente were looking for a solution that would allow two devices that had never communicated with each other to establish a secure connection .
They focused on biometrics , which should eliminate passwords and enhance security .
Biometric data is generally regarded as being ill - suited for cryptography : each measurement , even when taken by the same device , of the same feature on the same person will differ slightly .
This noise in the data makes it difficult to extract a cryptographic key in the traditional sense .
Other recent work has shown that it 's possible to use just the noise in a biometric measurement to generate a cryptographic key — the new method relies on this principle .
Researchers put together a system that can be implemented on any device equipped with a camera .
Facial recognition software is then used to produce biometric measurements of a person 's face , which should stay constant through changes in hairstyle , makeup , etc .
Users take a picture of themselves , then uses a random string that , combined with the biometric information , forms the equivalent of a public key .
When two people need to establish a connection between their devices , they exchange these public keys , and each then takes a picture of the other device 's owner .
The biometric data from this new picture is used to try to extract the random string from the public key .
Because the two biometric readings are unlikely to match perfectly , the system will have to go through and flip bits until it manages to extract the correct string .
Since the two readings should be close , this extraction should happen within a finite time ; if it fails , the communication is canceled .
If it succeeds , the system hangs on to the bits it had to flip and uses them as a random seed for the communication session .
The authors calculate that , for anyone to eavesdrop on these communications , they would have to have access to photos of both of the participants from which to generate their own biometric data ; otherwise , listening in would require a brute - force crack .
Having both photos is possible , but not likely , given that the whole point of the system is ad - hoc communications .
Users that were given a chance to try the system , which the authors call SAfE , found it easy to use and enjoyable ; it certainly eliminates the hassle of remembering passwords .
Further reading :
Joe cited some passages from Jake Tapper ’s Palin piece earlier , but I had to share a few more juicy paragraphs :
McCain campaign sources say , Palin has developed quite a reputation on the campaign trail for shopping .
During this controversy , McCain insiders were appalled to read a blog account from Nevada noting that the day before Palin held an event in Reno , “ Palin ’s assistant stopped in at the Ann Taylor at the Summit Sierra Mall and bought the skirt suit that she wore during to her speech Tuesday at the Reno - Sparks Convention Center .
‘ She bought a short , three - quarter sleeve jacket , a skirt and a couple other items , ’ store manager Suzette Ludden said . ”
….some Republicans are starting to now say they should have seen this coming , since Palin has a reputation for making friends who can help her and then screwing them over .
….all I can tell you is that some McCain allies are now quite suspect of Palin and worried that Sen.
McCain is going to become just the latest Palin ally whom she uses – and then discards — in her rapid ascendance to power .
Threatening an imminent economic collapse , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke have bamboozled Congress into enacting the most brazen confiscatory scheme ever concocted by government .
The scheme would have American taxpayers fork over $ 700 billion of their cash to help recapitalize some of the country ’s biggest banks  the same banks that recently larded their bigwigs with $ 62 billion in bonuses .
Sensing a pushback by the world ’s dollar - surplus regions  Asia and the Mideast  to finance the largest debtor economy , the U.S. government will now plunder its own countrymen to keep capital running " uphill . "
As with most statist remedies , it is being marketed as a boon for Main Street , tantalizing its inhabitants with the prospect of profits wafting westward from those malodorous Wall Street investments .
However , Congress has inured the Treasury from accountability and legal recourse , giving Paulson dictatorial power over the nation ’s financial sector .
Rather than let this bloated segment of the economy shrink and consolidate , Paulson and his successor will extend it unlimited life support , bloodletting everything else , in a final ruin of the nation .
The problem that is vexing the financial system , we are told , is the pile of mortgage - backed securities held by financial institutions .
These have lost value as the underlying assets  the actual homes  have plummeted in value .
But this is a fraud .
This precipitating event no more caused the financial fiasco than the murder of someone named Ferdinand provoked World War I , as taught in elementary school .
Remember the war ?
Not just the current and future wars , but the one that gave us the fiat monetary system : the war in Vietnam .
Prior to that calamity the world operated under the Bretton Woods monetary system , a post - World War II arrangement that pegged all currencies to the dollar and made only the dollar convertible to gold , thereby ensuring the dollar ’s reserve currency status .
During the 1950s , the system seemed invulnerable as U.S. gold reserves exceeded foreign liabilities by threefold .
By 1970 , however , as the U.S. inflated its money supply to fund the Southeast Asian conflict , the monetary position of the U.S. reversed , with foreign liabilities exceeding gold reserves fivefold .
When France demanded gold for dollars at the statutory rate of $ 35 / oz. , President Nixon shut the gold window for good .
As a result , currencies went from a fixed to a floating ( and pegged ) rate system in 1973 .
It has vexed economists ever since .
This system of fiat currencies has given peculiar leverage to the U.S. dollar .
As the world ’s reserve currency , the dollar has preserved faith in its purchasing power among its holders , including foreign central banks .
This faith and willingness to buy U.S. low - yield debt instruments such as Treasuries has enabled the U.S. public and private sectors to go on the largest borrowing binge the world has ever seen , manifesting in the gargantuan twin deficits of budget and trade .
These imbalances would never have occurred under a gold standard .
Credit would have been constrained by statutory levels of gold reserves in the banking system , instead of being created out of thin air by the 40 - 1 leverage levels granted by the SEC in 2004 to the five now defunct investment banks .
Also , the huge influx of imported goods would have halted due to inflationary pressures in the exporting countries  a phenomenon deemed the " price - specie flow mechanism " by 18th century philosopher David Hume .
Robert Mundell , a Nobel Prize - winning economist who sparred with Milton Friedman over floating rates vs. the gold standard , had this to say about fiat currencies :
" The present international monetary system neither manages the interdependence of currencies nor stabilizes prices .
Instead of relying on the equilibrium produced by [ gold ’s ] automaticity , the superpower has to resort to ‘ bashing ’ its trading partners , which it treats as enemies . "
So here we are : a phony monetary system , $ 3 trillion wasted on wars , and a citizenry mired in debt .
And what does Congress do ?
It adds more debt  a trillion dollars , just for starters , since once starting down this slippery slope , it wo n’t be able to stop .
It then gives the Treasury the green light to buy securities that are trading as low as 20 cents on the dollar at the hold - to - maturity value , i.e. , par !
Not surprisingly it has engaged in a media blitz to " sell " this boondoggle , convincing the taxpayer that this bucket of dross will one day turn to platinum .
Sensing that working stiffs are a little perturbed about the fleecing , it has leapt to the offense : " No , this is not a bailout of Wall Street .
This is a rescue plan for Main Street . "
By embracing the mortgage waste dump , U.S. citizens are supposedly saving jobs and retirement dreams .
They are told that interest - free car loans will stream from dealerships and refi windows will again beckon , even to those with homes worth half the value of mortgage paper .
With Congress granting the Treasury ( along with an " oversight " board ) almost unlimited power over the country ’s financial landscape , the U.S. has terminated its democracy and is well on the Road to Serfdom .
As Friedrich Hayek explained in 1944 , " Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life that can be separated from the rest ; it is the control of the means for all our ends .
And whoever has sole control of the means must also determine which ends are to be served , which values are to be rated higher and which lower  in short , what men should believe and strive for . "
Farewell , America .

( CNN ) -- Bail was set at $ 50,000 Friday night for a GOP campaign worker who made up a story about being attacked by a man angered by a John McCain bumper sticker on her car .
Police say Ashley Todd admitted making up the report that she was attacked because of a McCain sticker .
Ashley Todd , 20 , of College Station , Texas , has been charged with filing a false police report , a misdemeanor , a police report said .
Todd , who is being held at the Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , did not enter a plea when she appeared in court Friday night .
She did not post bail .
She is scheduled to appear in court again October 30 , when she is expected to enter a plea .
If she posts bail , Todd must be evaluated at a behavioral clinic .
" This has wasted so much time .
...
It 's just a lot of wasted man hours , " Assistant Police Chief Maurita Bryant said at a briefing .
Todd was a volunteer for a John McCain phone bank in Pittsburgh , the campaign said .
The woman told investigators a man approached her Wednesday night at an ATM in Pittsburgh 's East End , put a blade to her neck and demanded money , said Pittsburgh police spokeswoman Diane Richard .
Police said they found " several inconsistencies " in Todd 's statement and she was not seen in surveillance videos taken at the ATM .
She was asked to take a polygraph test Friday morning , Richard said .
The results were not made public .
Later ,
Todd came to the police station to help work on a composite sketch of the alleged attacker .
When she arrived , Todd " told them she just wanted to tell the truth " -- that she was not robbed , and there was no attacker , Bryant said .
Todd originally told police a man " punched her in the back of the head , knocking her to the ground , and he continued to punch and kick her while threatening to teach her a lesson for being a McCain supporter , " according to a police statement .
The woman also told police her attacker " called her a lot of names and stated that ' You are going to be a Barack supporter , ' at which time she states he sat on her chest , pinning both her hands down with his knees , and scratched into her face a backward letter ' B ' on the right side of her face using what she believed to be a very dull knife . "
Bryant described Todd as " very cordial , polite , cooperating , " and said the woman was surprised by all the media attention .
Asked whether the false report was politically motivated , Bryant replied , " It 's difficult to say . "
" She is stating that she was in her vehicle driving around , and she came up with this idea , " she said .
" She said she has prior mental problems and does n't know how the backward letter ' B ' got on her face . "
However , Todd was the only one in the vehicle , and " when she saw the ' B ' she thought she must have been the one who did it , " Bryant said .
" We 're talking with the district attorney 's office and conferring on just how we 're going to handle it , " she said .
" It 's been different stories through the night and this morning . "
She said there was no indication that anyone else was involved .
Richard said the woman had described her alleged attacker as an African - American , 6 feet 4 inches tall with a medium build and short dark hair , wearing dark clothing and shiny shoes .
Before the revelation that the report was false , McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said that McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin " spoke to the victim and her family after learning about the incident . "
The Obama campaign also had issued a statement wishing the woman a " speedy recovery . "
All About John McCain • Sarah Palin • Pittsburgh
Kingsley Amis wrote three short books on drink , which are collected for the first time here .
The first , On Drink , is a witty , belligerent and often profound defence of the kind of drinking habits that Kingsley acquired in the Old England of mixed drinks and beer .
Its recipes are based on spirits , the repeated recourse to which enabled Kingsley to suffer fools if not gladly , then at least with a recognition that their defects are largely human .
These recipes belong to a vanished world , in which you had to think hard as to how to get as much alcohol into the system for as little outlay as possible , and in which those noxious medicines Dubonnet , Martini , Advocaat and Noilly Prat stood on the sideboard , waiting to be enlivened with vodka or gin .
Wine occasionally gets a look in , but it is clear that Kingsley despised the stuff , as representing an alcohol - to - price ratio far below the horizon of a real drinker 's need .
At the start , Amis announces certain ' general principles ' to be followed in creating drinks , all of which can be derived , by natural drinkers ' logic , from the first of them , which holds that 'up to a point [ i.e. short of offering your guests one of those Balkan plonks marketed as wine , Cyprus sherry , poteen and the like ] , go for quantity rather than quality ' .
Spirits prevail over the stuff that might soften their impact , as illustrated by the Lucky Jim , which consists of 12 to 15 parts vodka to one part vermouth and two parts cucumber juice , and there is a drink for just about every ordeal that Kingsley 's ordeal - filled life could be expected to present .
Thus Paul Fussell 's Milk Punch ( one part brandy , one part bourbon , four parts milk , plus nutmeg and frozen milk cubes ) is ' to be drunk immediately on rising , in lieu of eating breakfast .
It is an excellent heartener and sustainer at the outset of a hard day : not only before an air trip or an interview , but when you have in prospect one of those gruelling nominal festivities like Christmas , the wedding of an old friend of your wife 's or taking the family over to Gran 's for Sunday dinner ' .
The books were written between 1971 and 1984 ; as a guide to prices , availability and so on , they are therefore entirely out of date .
But who cares ?
Each chapter is packed with observations that , in their utter disregard for political correctness , social inclusiveness and phoney compassion , are as punchy and uplifting as the vile cocktails they describe .
The famous hangover scene in Lucky Jim is complemented here by a philosophical chapter on the hangover that is one of the great English essays of our time .
Kingsley dismisses the run -of - the - mill cures that you can find in any newspaper , since they omit ' all that vast , vague , awful , shimmering metaphysical superstructure that makes a hangover a [ fortunately ] unique route to self - knowledge and self - realisation ' .
Other writers , he believes , have illuminated the metaphysical hangover while ostensibly writing of something else : parts of Dostoevsky and Poe can be read in this way , although the greatest attempt at capturing the experience , according to Amis , is Kafka 's ' The Metamorphosis ' , in which the hero wakes up to discover that he has been transformed into a man-sized cockroach .
Elsewhere , Amis laments the destruction wrought on the English pub .
His apprenticeship as a drinks - man began with quiet conversations among smoke - blackened trophies , with drink as but one component in a profoundly English routine of social consolation .
This consolation was arbitrarily destroyed during the Seventies by one - armed bandits , kitsch signs and the conversation - stopping noise of pop music .
Kingsley blames the brewery chains for this violence against the very heart of English society .
To the violence of the brewers , however , has been added that of the politicians , who have banned the activity - smoking - that brought people from their homes of an evening , and which both conserved and overcame their shyness .
Judging from the effect of the smoking ban on our village pub , this great English institution has now been consigned to history .
And if you are seeking a requiem for the pub culture and all that it meant , then this is the book for you .
It will not console you for the loss , but it will teach you how to be rude about it , with that inimitable rudeness that Kingsley perfected and which was the breast - plate across a warm , vulnerable and thoroughly decent heart .

Over the past four months , we ’ve seen an unprecedented decline in the price of gasoline .
Â
After hitting its record high of $ 4.12 on July 14 , the national average price of gas has fallen over 40 % , and now stands at $ 2.40 per gallon .
The last time gas prices were this low was back in March of 2007 – or roughly 20 months ago !
With these being pretty tough economic times , this recent decline in prices is certainly welcomed by many Americans .
Â
That being said , I think I speak for many of us when I say that I certainly would n’t mind gas prices dropping a little bit further .
This of course begs the question , where are gas prices going from here ?
Â
Are we going to end up with sub - $ 2 gas for the first time in four years , or have prices finally bottomed out at the current levels ?
According to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy
Tip , nearly half of Americans believe we ’ll end up paying less than $ 2 for a gallon of gas by the time this “ correction ” is all said and done .
Here ’s how nearly 300 people responded when asked , “ How far will the national average gas price fall ? ” :
48 % said prices would end up at or below $ 2.00 per gallon
said prices would end up 29 % said prices would end up between $ 2.01 and $ 2.25 per gallon
said prices would end up 23 % said prices would end up between $ 2.26 and $ 2.50 per gallon
Obviously , this would have been a silly question to ask even just three months ago , but thanks to the air coming out of the commodity bubble , the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression , and the fact that Americans are finally driving less , gas prices have been in a bit of a free fall .
( Some will also attribute this to manipulation by Big Oil in an attempt to help the Republican Party in this election .
Â
I do n’t buy it , but I ’ve certainly been wrong before . )
Personally , I do n’t believe the national average gas price will drop below the $ 2 mark .
Â
While I do believe their is still some downside remaining in prices , I do n’t think it ’s another roughly 15 % below today ’s current price .
Â
Not to mention the fact that if gas does hit the $ 2 mark , it will have fallen over 50 % from this summer ’s record highs .
Do n’t get me wrong , I would certainly love for that to happen , but I just do n’t see OPEC or Big Oil allowing it to get to that point .
You wo n't have to wait until next Wednesday to find out what 's going to happen on the next episode of South Park ; thanks to our super - secret Hollywood connections , Something Awful has secured the first three pages of what will surely be another award - winning adventure in social commentary .
Matt Stone and Trey Parker - you masters of American satire - we salute you !
A list of the most common , and successful , propaganda techniques currently in use .
If you spend any time at all consuming mass media , you will find these techniques familiar .
# 1 . Guilt By Association :
This is used to damage someone 's reputation by associating them with an unattractive person or organization .
It does n't matter if there is an actual association or not .
Example : Kristen said that too many people were moving into the South without the input of Americans already living there .
" This land is for my grandchildren , not world wide social experiments .
She lives a couple states away from where David Duke has his national office , and some think many in the region feel the way she does .
# 2 . Backstroke : Systematically belittling the goals of the subject of the article as the goals are being listed .
For every step forward for the subject , the propagandist pulls the reader back .
Example :
This year the political party 's stated goal is to give the rally a warm atmosphere .
We walked into the cave - like coliseum as the preparations for the rally were taking place .
" We 're trying to create a family atmosphere " said one representative of the party as he squinted into the harsh lights .
" There are the children 's rides " he said happily pointing to where union workmen smashed open wooden crates with iron crowbars .
# 3 . Misinformation :
This is a subtle technique , it involves reporting information in such a way that the final message of the story is not true , it 's what the propagandist wants you to believe .
Example : Recently a well known conservative tried to run advertisements in university newspapers addressing slave reparations for black Americans .
The writer listed several facts which he felt demonstrated why reparations are not necessary and not fair .
One of these facts was the fact that black Americans in the United States today earn , on average , around 20 times more than blacks living in Africa , and therefore , according to the author , descendents of slaves are actually far better off today than the people who remained behind .
A second author , writing about the advertisement , stated only that " the first author said that blacks were better off being slaves . " , but did n't explain the facts the first author had shared .
Imagine if you read the second author 's report and were n't familiar with the first author 's position .
You would think the first author was a monster for saying that people were lucky to be slaves !
But that 's not what the first author said , he said their descendants have a lot more money now than the people still living in the original countries have .
This is misinformation , you 're given a half truth about someone 's position , and it is presented in a misleading fashion .
# 4 . Over Humanization :
It is a perfectly valid technique to tell a story by focusing on the real people who the story impacts .
However , this is also an easy technique for manipulation when a propagandist tries to mask an issue by making anyone who has a valid disagreement look evil due to all the human suffering talked about in the story .
Example : Standing in the dusty desert was Juanita Lopez Camal Esquedo and her 15 hungry children .
Half of the children were blind , the other half were crippled .
As the smallest child , little Juanita , looked across the barbed wire fence into America , she begged her mommy for some food .
Since everyone in Mexico had died of starvation , and food would never grow there again , there was nowhere else for them to go .
And after all , this was the only family that wanted to come into America anyway .
Just one more family .
Over humanization can be used not only with illegal immigration , but also with any other potential tear - jerker topic .
# 5 . Name Calling :
This is officially the oldest trick in the book .
It is cheap and easy .
Often immigration reform activists are called anti-immigrant , people who are against state sponsored racism are called " racists " themselves .
Name calling clouds and confuses issues , and when repeated by enough people on one side of an issue , creates a weight of its own , which is n't really there , but must now be explained before the victim " may " have an opinion regarding the issue in question .
Example :
By saying that the population is growing too quickly , many people assumed she was a racist .
# 6 . He Said , She Said :
This is a technique whereby the author can say something they know is n't true , or is n't fair , but they want to say it anyway .
Example : Project USA is a group which claims to support reasonable levels of immigration .
They 've put up billboards with Department of Statistics information which states that the US population will double within 50 years .
The billboards have pictures of children of different races with the words " The population of the US will double within this child 's lifetime .
Stop it congress " .
Some people say this is hate speech .
Note : a statistic ( the fact that the US population will double at current levels of immigration ) cannot be hateful .
This is just a numerical fact , like saying water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit .
The author knows this is an unfair statement , but wants to say it anyway .
That 's why she says " some people say " , rather than " I say " .
# 7 . Unproven " Facts "
This is when a ( usually immature ) " writer " is frantically trying to " prove " a position and they begin to quote " studies " , " reports " , and " experts " as " proving " this or that , but they never mention the study 's name , location , where copies can be found , or the conditions specific to the experiments .
Example : Recent studies show that the media is right 99 % of the time .
Also , an expert from the University of Happiness was quoted as saying " People in the media work harder than anyone who thinks they have a real job " .
# 8 . Lying Sometimes complete lies are told .
Example :
An author in Arizona writes a report which states that the reason that a local mayor decided not to use the police to enforce immigration law was because protests by a certain ethnic group scared him away from it .
In actual fact , as stated by the mayor himself , the reason the police were n't used was because no training program had been set up between the police and the INS .
Any person who was a member of said ethnic group would gain from a report like this because , if people begin to hear that " that group is really aggressive and authorities do what they say " then the power of that group is enhanced , and everyone reading the " news " will begin thinking they should always let that group have what it wants .
The fact that our police need special permission to enforce some laws and not others is a topic for another discussion .
# 9 . Telling the Truth , For a While
To throw people off the track , biased news services will give good accurate reporting for a while , usually when it no longer matters , then they will stick it to you the next time your guard is down .
The best way to recognize this technique is to simply remember who the biggest transgressors are .
You must understand that if someone lies or tries to manipulate a story once , they will do so again .
They will never be non-biased .
They will , however , say something fair from time to time .
This is due to the fact that if they were biased every time they spoke , they would soon run out of credibility .
Do not trust them twice .
Would you buy a car from someone who cheated you on a previous purchase just because they say something you want to hear later ?
# 10 . Not Talking at all about Something
Of course the biggest recent example of this are the Moslem riots in France .
The fact that the rioters were still burning more than one hundred cars EACH NIGHT was suppressed and avoided , rather we were fed the line that the riots were over .
The media went days and days not reporting on the riots which were revealing the complete failure of French social , economic , and immigration policy .
However , France , being a socialist country , is favored by the socialist media , so the country 's failings were not reported .
When you 're aware of a major issue underway , but see no coverage on it , then you can be sure the media is against the ideas which discussing that topic would raise .
# 11 . Subtle Inaccuracies / Dismissive Tone Misstating a topic , often a serious one , and pretending any objecting or concerned view is silly , unrealistic , or just not necessary .
Illegal immigration is a major threat to the United States .
With the rapid importation of distinct , and not particularly grateful , ethnic groups who have no interest in anything American , we create division , conflict , and risk .
This is a risk that will grow to overwhelm our children .
One writer used a childlike , grandmotherly tone to try to belittle and dismiss this serious topic .
Her style was to write with pleasantries such as " oh , my you 've grown , look at the happy big new population " .
This is an intentional disservice to the readers and an attempt to manipulate them into not recognizing the risk they and their children face of being supplanted in their own home once and for all by foreigners , who , by the way , wo n't care about you once they outnumber you .
At best , this is a foolish policy .
At worst , it is self destruction .
In any case , it must be controlled responsibly if we are to remain masters of our own future .
This author 's method is just one way to use a dismissive tone to trick people into not recognizing the topic 's seriousness .
The next time you 're reading an article which seems to speak childishly of a serious issue , you should be aware that in all probability the author does n't fail to understand the seriousness of the issue , rather they may be trying to further an opposing agenda .
# 12 . A One One Punch pretending to represent two sides , but one side gets a couple of great lines , the other side gets a lame line .
Example :
Tax cuts are all the rage these days , but two senators disagree on how appropriate tax cuts would be right now .
Left Senator Jones says
" The rich are the ones getting a cut .
Who needs rich people with more money ? " .
Right Senator Smith does n't think that 's correct .
He thinks only certain individuals should benefit .
" The smallest number of people who enjoy this are the people with the most money " repeated Left Senator Jones .
" I think that money belongs to all the people , and the best way to give out money the government collects through friendly tax raises is for the government to do it !
It 's like all the people getting a raise ! " , said Left Senator Jones .
Right Senator Smith did n't agree .
He thought the money should reflect the people who had earned the most .
When asked why Right Senator Smith felt this way he said " People have to earn a living " .
Left Senator Jones said " It is precisely this attempt by Senator Smith to keep people from earning a living that I and my party oppose ! " .
# 13 . Volume
This is related to Coordination , it is merely a deluge of the same story line everywhere , until it becomes dominant , and the media 's view of it becomes the dominant view ( Elian Gonzalez , Florida Recount , Poor Election Night Coverage )
If you pick a topic with a strong liberal attraction , you will often find that all the " news " stories about a given current event seem to draw a similar conclusion about it .
When you notice this , just ask yourself if it 's probable that , in a nation of nearly 300 million , no one has a legitimate opposing opinion .
For example , does everyone think Republicans want to poison themselves and all the rest of us ?
Does everyone want unlimited , uncontrolled , illegal immigration to displace their children ?
Does everyone love working from January till May for free to pay the government taxes ?
No , they do n't .
# 14 . Coordination
This occurs when a number of like minded journalists all report the same angle at about the same time .
This really does n't require a conspiracy , there are so few " journalists " , and they can easily see what their buddies ' takes are on issues , then parrot the same line .
A couple years ago we saw an article in a Southeast paper that actually addressed the damage being inflicted by uncontrolled immigration .
We were shocked .
Unfortunately , there followed soon after a long rose - colored story about the wonderful immigrants saving our economy ( which was the magnet for their arrival in the first place ) at no expense to us , written by the previously honest author , plus 5 other additional co-authors ( read " thought police " ) .
It did have a tiny list of " challenges " , which was followed by an immediate rebuttal , and altogether comprised less than five percent of the article , which among journalists passes for equal time .
Magically , a very similar article appeared at the same time in a nearby regional paper written by three other authors with almost the same structure , a list of wondrous immigrants and everything was perfect about them .
Did the " Censoring 5 " and " The Three Amigos " just happen to telepathically think the same thing , write it , and publish it at the same time ?
We 'll let our readers decide the odds of Spontaneous Identical Publishing ( S.I.P. ) for themselves .
# 15 . Fogging an Issue / Total Nonsense Sometimes certain groups have an interest in making sure that as few people pay attention to an issue as possible .
A good propagandist can write a long , nonsensical article for the purpose of confusing the majority of readers , who themselves work hard all day .
It does n't take much for them to see a catchy headline , then begin to dig into a long rambling article , then throw their hands up and say " I do n't have the extra energy to decipher this ! " .
The reader is correct , the fault is with the propagandist .
Example : The Real Reason Why We Need Tax Cuts !
A lot of people want tax cuts these days .
Here 's the real reason they might not be such a good idea .
The social ramifications are themselves reason enough !
Given a perplexing view of the real inter-generational conflict in today 's " live and let live " society , most people make the more responsible choice .
This leads us to the logical question , with school budgets tight , can we afford to argue over social services ?
A close examination of IRS records plainly displays the fiduciary incentive for economic re-examination in a post - socialist sense .
( this article will then ramble on like this for 3 or 4 pages )
# 16 . 2,3,4 Technique Mentioning only one side of an issue 2 , 3 , or 4 times in an article , each time pretending you are about to present the opposing side , but you never do .
Then the article suddenly ends and the reader feels bombarded , outnumbered and alone .
In reality the opposing view is by definition held by many people , the author merely refused to present the side of the argument he or she disagrees with .
Example :
The decision to seal off an additional 4 million acres was a controversial one .
Barbara Oaks of Centerville says " There are great advantages to sealing the area off " .
Many in town feel the same way , less traffic means less pollution , less damage to the area , and less noise .
However , not everyone agrees with her .
The most common complaints do n't address the additional benefits of closing the forest , such as increased education opportunities for area children .
Not many opportunities like this afford themselves year round , and keeping the area closed will guarantee the educational hikes around the perimeter can continue .
Many longtime residents feel that closing all 4 million acres will be a burden .
But do n't tell that to Steve Longmont .
" I hope they close even more " Steve told our interviewers .
" There 's no good reason for heavy travel through the whole forest , and I 'd like to see the place prohibited " .
Several area polls show a large number of people in favor of closing the area .
Keeping the forest closed is what is best for the town .
# 17 . Preemptive Strike
This is when the writer " attacks " the reader viciously at the very outset of the article with the " acceptable " view of the topic .
The writer tries to " beat it into " the reader .
Example : Just a couple days ago the possible presidential run of a politician who is very pro-enforcement of immigration law was featured in an article by an East Coast paper .
The article began by saying the candidate does n't expect to win because of this or that , and in fact does n't think he 'll win at all , he just wants people to talk about immigration .
Nowhere in the article did the candidate say he did n't expect to win , or that he only wanted people to talk about immigration .
In fact , the article pointed out that he had already visited Iowa 4 times in 6 months , not at all like someone who does n't even want to win .
At the end of the article were instructions on how to defeat this candidate .
The opening attack on his seriousness as a candidate , and the closing advice on how to defeat him are classic examples of Preemptive Strike .
# 18 . Framing the Debate Setting an argument around two " alternatives " which you would prefer , rather than the true alternatives .
Example :
The debate over how much funding to give to the project continued .
Some are arguing for a reduced amount , while others want to see a much higher contribution level .
The needs for both a lower budget and a higher budget have been laid out and defended in the debate brochure , which all members of the decision making body have been reading over for the last three days .
( Note : the correct decision was to stop the project completely , it accomplishes nothing and the people running it are stealing the money , but you were n't offered the choice of stopping it . )
# 19 . Token Equal Time Sometimes a weak , tiny understatement is added to a propaganda piece , apparently so the writer can pretend they had been fair .
This technique is quite common , it consists of an article written with entirely one point of view , then at the end a meager statement from the opposing view is printed , it is immediately refuted , then the article either ends or continues on with the preferred point of view .
# 20 . " Interpreting " A Statement Have you ever seen a writer say that someone said something , then what the person said followed , but it did n't look anything like what the writer claimed was meant ?
Example :
The official said that they did n't hold anyone from the previous administration responsible for the loss .
" I think we should just focus on the future " said the official .
( note : he did n't say he did n't hold anyone from the previous administration responsible , he said we should focus on the future .
See the difference ? )
# 21 . Withholding Information
Is it the same as lying ?
Some in the media might not want to answer that question .
Recently a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles was portrayed as a " jubilant son of an immigrant " in an article .
What the article did n't mention was that he also once said " Prop 187 is the last gasp of white America in California " , he belongs to , or once belonged to , a racist separatist organization which plans to takeover the American south west for Mexico to rule , and at a recent ceremony honoring early black leaders he called one of the early union members a n***** in front of 400 black leaders .
100 people walked out of the meeting room , though it was reported as 25 % in order to diminish the effect .
None of this was included in the article about the " jubilant son of an immigrant "
More recently there is the example of multiple murders on private land in Wisconsin by a Hmong immigrant .
In actual fact , of the six people murdered all but one were unarmed , one was a woman , shell casings were found all around the area , meaning the murderer chased his unarmed victims all around to try and kill them .
The story as reported called all the victims " hunters " to conjure up the image of tough armed men in a fair fight , even though the victims were n't " hunting " at all but were warning the killer to stay off of their private land , hence he murdered them .
The upsetting details only came out long after the story was initially reported .
Are the authors of these articles lying to the public by not presenting all of the information about the stories , or are the authors so incompetent and clueless that they are n't even aware of these major points even though they are supposed to be writing about these important stories ?
The authors are either liars or morons .
# 22 . Distracting or Absurd Metrics
With this technique , the writer attempts to drag the reader into a debate about what the reader is even seeing .
This is usually used when the propagandist is falling behind and must hurry to destroy correct understanding of events .
Example : During the French riots many writers began arguing about the number of cars burned and whether the number still " indicated " riot levels .
In other words , let 's argue about what a riot is , and when you have enough destroyed cars , we 'll talk .
Meanwhile , you 're discussing burnt cars and not the ongoing riots .

Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence , a handful of deniers manage to keep arguing about the existence , causes , and likely outcomes of global warming .
Not to be outdone by this conventional irrationality , we have a few oddballs on the ‘ believing ’ side of the fence too .
Ramtha ’s School of Enlightenment , a new - age religious cult based out of Yelm , Washington , makes exaggerated , doomsday predictions about global warming to instill fear in its followers and convince them to build underground shelters to protect from the “ Days to Come . “ [ social_buttons ]
According to the prophesies made by the spiritual school , the human population at the end of 2012 will be two - thirds what it is now , and those who survive in the long term will do so by stocking up on food , water , and medical supplies and by having an underground shelter to protect them from the dangers of a rapidly changing earth .
Ramtha ’s School of Enlightenment , or RSE , was founded in 1987 , and its teachings date back a decade further .
The lessons are based around the concepts of tapping into the forgotten God within oneself , being able to create one ’s own reality , and using one ’s mind to perform superhuman abilities .
Supposedly the teacher is a 35,000 - year - old warrior from Lemuria who is being channeled by a 62 - year - old woman named JZ Knight .
Ramtha students were behind the pseudo - science documentary What the Bleep Do We Know !? , which purports to inform us about quantum physics and the subjective nature of reality , yet could not even accurately tell us what percentage of the human body is composed of water .
While so - called prophets have been making doomsday prophecies for centuries , Ramtha ’s predictions take on a unique form of sophistication .
Their claims are masked as science , which has attracted followers who are not only wealthy and credulous , but surprisingly intelligent , creating an aura of credibility .
They can not seem to keep the prophecies consistent even from one lecture to another , but the scare tactics are generally rooted in a combination of climate change exaggerations and economic collapse straight out of New World Order .
In Last Waltz of the Tyrants , their book of predictions for the ’90s , Ramtha told of the financial collapse we would see in the ’90s and explained how using cars has created a hole in the ozone layer , which is simply not true .
When none of the catastrophes came to fruition in the ’90s , they turned their scares toward 2012 and are using reports that recent hurricanes and floods have likely intensified due to climate change as evidence that the world as we know it has only a few more years .
Listen to some incoherent babbling here :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/DfGs-cA3E_M&hl=en&fs=1]
One might ask , “ So what ?
They have some controversial new age views , but at least they are concerned with the planet !
They ’re an ally ! ”
That could have been the case .
But these money - grubbers , who charge thousands per year for their students to retain their invitation to the doomsday party , have instead decided that convincing their followers to move to Yelm and build underground shelters is a far bigger priority than actually trying to stop climate change from occurring ( so much for them being able to “ create their own realities ” ) .
McKenna , the town neighboring Yelm , conveniently has a business run by Ramtha students called the Survival Center , which sells Ramtha books , emergency supplies , and will build you a fully stocked 5 - room underground shelter for the low price of $ 1.5 million !
The survival center claims to be independent of RSE , but it ’s anyone ’s guess where the profit from the store goes .
So the next time someone tells you that climate change is just a paranoid doomsday embellishment , you can show them the IPCC ’s accurate and frightening most recent findings and then tell them that if they ’re looking for crazy and exaggerated , you ’ve got just the group for them .
Oh , and if money is still burning in your pocket after purchasing that bargain of a bunker , you can always pay $ 30,000 to speak one - on - one for an hour with Ramtha him / herself .

The council created by retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub was the U.S. chapter of the World Anti-Communist League , an international organization linked to former Nazi collaborators and ultra- right - wing death squads in Central America … .
In the 1980s , McCain served on the advisory board to the U.S. chapter of an international group linked to ultra - right - wing death squads in Central America … .
McCain has said he resigned from the council in 1984 and asked in 1986 to have his name removed from the group ’s letterhead … .
A news article and two documents tie McCain to the council in 1985 , a year after he says he resigned .
The group ’s Internal Revenue Service filing in 1985 , covering the previous year , lists McCain as a member of the council ’s advisory board .
In October 1985 , a States News Service report placed McCain , Rep. Tom Loeffler , R - Texas , and an Arizona congressman at a Washington awards ceremony staged by the council .
Our planet is a neat place , full of weird and unusual people doing weird and unusual things .
One oddball thing I like to do is geocache .
What other activity is there that makes people travel hundreds of miles to climb a mountain , wade a river , and fight a Bigfoot , just to be the first person to sign a piece of paper rolled up in a 35 mm film canister stuffed in the knot hole of a tree ?
I can't think of any other sport that has such a great mix of technology and the wonderful outdoors .
A lot of geocaches are placed in a beautiful setting , or hidden in a challenging or unique way , or in a historical setting .
Geocaching allows the finder to share in some of the hiders favorite places , and along the way you get to meet some interesting characters , and occasionally learn something new .
While this blog is primarily a geocaching blog , I also use this place to post the occasional funny video or weird news story , or as a platform to rant or rave about something I really have to share .
But for the most part this website is about you , the weirdo walking around in circles , talking into your GPS unit like it's a phone , pretending your taking pictures of a phone booth to find find the tiniest micro-cache , or circling your car around and around a light pole in a parking lot trying to retrieve a cache without even getting out of your car .
Marc puts his finger on the real reason for the Obama surge .
It 's not , I think , simply punishing the GOP for the financial meltdown .
It 's also the public 's judgment of which candidate responded better to the events of the last two weeks .
McCain seemed unstable , bombastic , temperamental and at times , hysterical .
Obama seemed , well , presidential .
Here 's what I think matters more than ideology at this point .
The American people have lived through a nerve - wracking few years .
So many certainties have collapsed .
We had 9/11 and then Abu Ghraib .
We had the Iraq fiasco and the Katrina catastrophe .
Now we have the structure of capitalism on the brink .
Americans do not want a president adding to the drama .
They want calm and authority and reason .
And that 's why the attempt to paint Obama as a flaming radical is so ill - timed .
Obama just proved that he is a careful , calm guy in a crisis .
What the voters saw is at odds with what the GOP is now saying .
So in that context , it 's the GOP that 's damaged outside its core believers .
( Obama 's immensely difficult job if elected president will be to bring those deeply alienated people back into the national fold . )
In the end , temperament matters .
And in a country desperate for assurance and poise at the top , Obama is winning that debate .
It 's no surprise to those of us who 've followed him closely for a while .
But for most voters , this is a new and first impression of Obama 's character .
And it 's powerful .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
“ We do n’t really know what it is for , is it for the theater ? ” said Jan Heiremans , 38 , who was in town from Brussels for a business meeting .
“ But it has a much nicer view than from the ground . ”
He paused , and then asked , “ You have to write a whole article about this ? ”
Around the corner , long lines stretched from the TKTS ticket windows , which are built in the space beneath the stairs ’ peak and which replaced makeshift booths erected in 1999 .
There are more ticket windows than before and , to the delight of many of the customers , credit cards are now accepted for payment .
The changes did not please everyone .
“ It just adds more congestion and lines , ” said Scott Russell , 41 , who lives at Park Avenue and 64th Street and was planning to see a matinee performance of “ Gypsy ” with friends .
“ And TKTS should be congestion - free . ”
Yet Anthony Bugett , a security guard who has worked in Duffy Square for several years , said the crowds at the new booths were less restive than before .
The lines were more orderly and moved faster , he said , and the new electronic displays allayed confusion over what tickets were available .
“ Everyone is more relaxed , ” said Mr. Bugett , who is 23 and lives in Woodside , Queens .
Mr. Bugett had worked the previous evening , too , and he said every space on the stairs , which are lighted at night and glow , was filled .
“ I ’m just worried if it rains , ” he said .
“ Because the material is slippery when wet . ”
Even people unable to climb the steps seemed to adore them — like Norman Robbins , who is 86 , recovering from an automobile accident and , for the time being , walking with a cane .
Mr. Robbins and his wife , B. J. , who is 75 , spent part of Sunday afternoon sitting on a granite bench at the foot of the new red stairs .
They live on Long Island and were in town for a matinee performance of “ Equus . ”
Usually , they pass the time before matinees in a hotel lobby , but on Sunday they were delighted by the city ’s newest outdoor spot .
“ This is much nicer ; it makes you feel more a part of the city , ” Mrs. Robbins said .
She tilted her head toward the stairs .
“ Once he ’s recovered , ” she said , “ we ’ll be up there . ”
Debt Slavery is the Real Reason Behind the Bail - Out
I was just listening to Ron Paul on the latest Bail - Out of banks .
He disapproved of the Bail - Out because he claims that it will destroy the financial system as we know it by destroying the dollar 's value and creating hyper-inflation .
Ron Paul said " you can not just create trillions of dollars out of thin air without creating inflation " .
Paul 's conclusions are based upon the idea of demand pull inflation .
This means a situation where excess amounts of money are chasing a static or near static amount of goods and services .
This monetary theory was elaborated upon by Milton Friedman for which he was given the Nobel Prize in 1976 .
The idea is that when the Money Regulators increase the supply of money , the increase causes consumers to demand more goods and services causing inflation .
Suppliers recognize the demand and start producing more goods and services thereby creating jobs and prosperity .
This idea assumes that the increase in the money supply makes its way into the hands of the consumers who create the extra demand .
Freidman claimed that the Federal Reserve allowed or caused the monetary aggregates to decrease by 33 % during the 1930s , thereby creating and prolonging the Rosenvelt depression .
However , it is possible that the extra money created by the Regulators never makes its way to the consumers .
If it does not , then there is no extra demand for goods and services and no inflation and no extra production , no extra jobs and no prosperity .
So the question is whether the extra money supply from the Bail - Out will reach the consumer / taxpayer .
The sad answer is that very little will .
Almost the entire Bail - Out will go to the banks and insurance companies , where it is intended to go .
Its purpose is to secure holders of bank bonds , the holders of credit default swaps guaranteed by investment banks and insurance companies and secure past and future excessive executive compensation paid by those banks and insurance companies .
The banking and insurance " industries " made sure of that by making enormous campaign contributions to such notables as Senator Christopher Dodd , Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee ( $ 13 million since 1989 ) and to the lisping Representative Barney " My - o- My " Frank ( $ 2.5 million ) .
Although the " taxpayers " will get little benefit from the trillion dollar bail - outs , they will get the entire bill as the " taxpayers " will be given more debt to repay with interest .
Now to digress a bit .
Most middle class Americans have substantial home mortgages , large credit card balances and other future required payments of Federal Reserve notes for medical care , insurance , real estate taxes , car payments , gas expenses and schooling costs for their children .
Essentially , the middle class is up to its eyeballs in debt and as a result has a short position in dollars .
They are long on houses , cars and investments in the stock and bond markets .
For the past year , there has been a short squeeze on people who owe Federal Reserve Notes which has accelerated in the past months as people seek to pay bills and sell assets such as real estate and stocks .
At least the people received some value when they built their own debt and will get something of value in exchange for future payments if they can indeed make those payments .
Back to the Bail - Out
What the Bail - Out does is saddle the country and all its " taxpayers " with with new trillions of debt and makes it such that every " taxpayer " , regardless of how wise , cautious and frugal he may be , owes loads of Federal Reserve Notes ( money ) to the Federal Reserve Banking system .
What will the " taxpayers " receive for this new tax saddle ?
The answer is that they have received and will receive nothing .
Almost all of the Bail - Out money goes to the corporations whose errand boys like Greenspan , Paulson , Bernanke , Dimon , Mozilo and Fuld carried out the debt trap that was set 9 - 10 years ago .
This Bail - Out puts a further short squeeze of dollars into play .
Perhaps the 50 % drop in the price of oil , gold trading below 800 and the recent strong dollar portends more ugly things to come .
Contrary to Ron Paul 's forecast of hyper- inflation , which will only take place if the increased money supply goes to the hands of the consumers and does not create a corresponding amount of debt , there may be a severe demand for dollars and hyper - deflation , where the country and the people have no money to buy goods and services but only debts .
The bankers have discovered a way to force the people of America and the world into an intense form of debt slavery and that is the reason for their reckless past lending practices , credit cards for all and now this massive Wall Street Bankers Bail - Out .
In the past , only wars created that amount of national debt .
But now those debt creating war mongers have found the more friendly face of public bail - outs .

When Congress decided that interest on revolving credit would no longer be deductible , but interest on mortgage loans would , I realized they were trying to make a nation of serfs .
And , indeed , many of us went for the mortgage lines of credit and tossed our extravagances onto that bill , meaning , of course , that we owned a lot less of our home than we would have otherwise .
It worked at creating serfdom to a point , but apparently not well enough .
So they have engineered total serfdom through the bailout and its never - ending payback by the pseudo - serfs we have all become .
The definition of serfdom is a person who does n't own land and does n't own his or her own labor ; Ta da !
Where was the press during the runup to serfdom ?
We did have a period of indentured servitude in which , possibly , something might have been done .
It is chilling to know how very right you are .
Thank you .
I think .
" He was just full of energy , full of enthusiasm , really excited . …
He said he was really looking forward to the day when he could come play for the New York Rangers . "
" We are extremely saddened by the tragic passing of Alexei .
On behalf of the New York Rangers organization , I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his family .
Alexei was an intelligent , energetic young man , with tremendous talent and an extremely bright future . " -- Rangers GM Glen Sather

Florida has switched to its third ballot system in the past three election cycles , and glitches associated with the transition have caused confusion at early voting sites , election officials said .
The state went back to using scanned paper ballots this year after touch - screen machines in Sarasota County failed to record any choice for 18,000 voters in a fiercely contested House race in 2006 .
Voters in Colorado , Tennessee , Texas and West Virginia have reported using touch - screen machines that at least initially registered their choice for the wrong candidate or party .
“ I pushed the Democrat ticket , and it jumped to the Republican ticket for president of the United States , ” said Calvin Thomas , 81 , an Obama supporter who tried to vote early in Ripley , W.Va .
“ I ’m a registered Republican , and I ’ve voted in every presidential election since 1948 .
I do n’t like seeing my vote do something I did n’t tell it to do .
I take that real serious . ”
Mr. Thomas ’s daughter , Micki Clendenin , said the same thing had happened to her .
In both cases , poll workers at the site had them touch the screen a few more times , and the voting machine changed their ballot to their candidate choice .
State and local officials said these were isolated cases and that poll workers had fixed the problems .
“ It was corrected , ” Ms. Clendenin said , “ but it still made me wonder . ”
It was not supposed to be this way .
After the debacle of 2000 , Congress passed a federal law , the Help America Vote Act , to avoid similar mishaps .
It included money for new machines to modernize the voting process .
But in many ways , things have become even messier .
The first machines bought with the federal money were largely touch - screens and brought new problems , decreasing public confidence in the process and doubling the number of election - related lawsuits since 2000 .
In the past two years , the pendulum has swung away from electronic machines , but the change has come during one of the most dramatic presidential elections in modern history .
Holy Jesus Christ .
What the hell have you done to yourself , son ?
You ’re telling me this giant hole in your earlobe with the metal ring in it is on purpose ?
Not the result of an accident or birth defect ?
Mother of god .
Ok , here , let me clear a few things up for you , dreadlocks .
First , as far as I can tell by your fair skin and perfect English , you are not a member of an African tribe or a goddamn aborigine , so do n’t throw me any bullshit that you ’re connecting with some culture somewhere with this .
You ’re a hippie , and a deluded one , because your regimen of pain and disfigurement puts you in no closer touch to the earth than my cat – who got holes in his ears the old fashioned way : by fighting .
In fact , the only acceptable way I for you to get that hole was if I shot you with this .357 and intentionally maimed you .
Not a hippie ?
Ok , I get it , I see what you ’re going for : I rock hard in a hard rock band and I ’m committing to living the life .
Your extensive tattoos speak to that .
But you should realize that these holes say something about you , and it ’s not , “ I ’m hard core . ”
It ’s more like : “ I ’m a misguided white kid who smokes cheap weed and rants about music and who is maimed for life . ” Congratulations .
Listen , if you were in a place where people gain respect via the length of their lobes , you would n’t have the money for all that hair product and being “ alternative ” would mean , “ does n’t carry a machete . ”
Take it from me , there are only a couple of ways to acceptably get scars on your face , and that is through bare - knuckle fistfights with hardened criminals or staring into the sun stoically for 30 years .
Now give me the change for this album , I want to leave your record store .
Police Misconduct A Threat To Free Speech
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
MINNEAPOLIS - Amid charges of police misconduct during the Republican National Convention in Minnesota , the American Civil Liberties Union called for accountability for any unconstitutional actions there .
The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU :
" Conducting mass arrests and raiding meeting places of innocent Americans exercising their constitutional right to express political dissent are antithetical to the fundamental values of our democracy .
Free speech has to be safeguarded during the Republican National Convention , as the workings of our democracy in the streets are as important as those in convention halls .
Allegations of police misconduct must be investigated thoroughly and free speech must be safeguarded for the remainder of the convention . "
Teams of civil and criminal defense attorneys recruited and coordinated by the ACLU of Minnesota filed five lawsuits seeking to protect free speech and due process in the lead - up to the convention .
Attorneys assembled by the ACLU are currently in the jails offering limited representation to hundreds of people who were swept up in mass arrests in the Twin Cities .

Roger Hill reveals his fear of Barack Obama
GuardianFilms
Sometimes the most revealing insights strike at the most unexpected moments , jolting you out of the reality you thought you were in and transporting you somewhere else entirely .
For instance , when reporting a story on the political differences between Barack Obama and John McCain over ethanol as an alternative fuel , you do n't expect to be confronted with details of a plot by the devil to take over the White House .
I had hopped on to the Guardian Films bus as it made its way across the US .
We were joining forces to make a film about the ethanol issue , which has earned Obama the criticism of environmentalists because of his support for the controversial corn - based variety of the fuel that has helped to drive up world food prices .
We stopped at an ethanol plant in Craig , Missouri , where we were greeted by the general manager , Roger Hill , and shown around the plant .
He said something odd early on in our tour , responding to the news that I was British by commenting on how Muslims had become dominant in my country .
I only half heard his remark , and let it go ; we were here to talk about ethanol .
Later though , he brought up the subject again , when I suggested to him that as an ethanol manufacturer he must logically back Obama over McCain , who has openly criticised federal subsidies of the fuel .
That 's when he invoked Revelations , chapter 13 .
If you lack instant recall of the contents of Revelations 13 , as I have to admit I did , it 's the bit in the Bible where the beast rears his ugly head , or rather many heads , and reveals the mark on his right hand or forehead : 666 .
Yes , Hill was likening Obama to the devil , with Revelations 13 as the proof .
Which gave me pause .
I 've heard many , many people tell me that Obama is a Muslim , but I 'd never quite heard him compared to Satan .
Back at the hotel we looked into it , and were surprised to find that the Obama - as - devil conspiracy theory is rife on the internet .
Tap in Obama and Revelations 13 into Google and 904,000 entries come up .
This is insidious stuff .
And it jumps out at you when you least expect it .
Even in an ethanol plant in the Great Plains .
Analyst : GOP voter fraud scandal ' really serious ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 20 , 2008
Print This Email This
The Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday that dozens of voters have complained they were duped by a firm working for the GOP into switching their party registration to Republican while being told they were signing a petition for tougher penalties on child molesters .
The switches could impede Democratic get - out - the - vote efforts and could prevent those affected from voting in next year 's Democratic primaries .
Some of the voters were even switched to absentee status , meaning they could lose their vote entirely if they show up at the polls on Election Day without bringing an absentee ballot .
The story began last summer , when California Democrats noticed sudden , unexplained turnarounds in Republican registration in certain counties and obtained a list of the new registrations from the San Bernardino County registrar 's office .
They found that more than 75 % of the phone numbers given were invalid , and of those voters who could be reached , over 80 % said their registrations had been switched to Republican without their knowledge .
A single group turned out to be behind the " slamming " -- Young Political Majors , which was previously found to be using similar tactics in Florida in 2004 .
In that election , YPM was employed by another firm called JSM Inc. , which was working for conservative powerhouse Arno Political Associates .
Similar stories involving all three have surfaced in Arizona , Massachusetts , and Ohio .
MSNBC 's Contessa Brewer asked legal analyst Susan Filan on Monday about the case .
" This is really serious , " Filan responded .
" This is a very specific , deliberate intent to mislead . "
She contrasted it with the far more trivial accusations of voter fraud against the anti-poverty group ACORN , which has handed in occasional fake registrations under names such as " Mickey Mouse . "
Late on Saturday , the owner of Young Political Majors , Mark Jacoby , was arrested on charges of having fraudulently registered himself to vote at a California address where he lived as a child so that he would meet California 's legal requirement that signature gatherers be eligible to vote in that state .
Jacoby 's attorney called the charges " baseless " and part of a " long pattern of harassment , " saying that his client travels a lot and has continued to use his parents ' home as his legal address .
The California GOP issued a statement claiming that " California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has decided to once again show her partisan colors and charge an individual for questions surrounding his own , personal voter registration .
...
The charges we 've seen today suggests that this is politically motivated .
...
It is evident that Debra Bowen is using her office to play politics with the public 's perception . "
Filan 's comment on this claim was , " To say this is politically motivated is just nonsense .
To not prosecute something like this would be an extreme dereliction of a public official 's duty . "
However , she did not address the question of whether there was any impropriety in arresting Jacoby for his personal actions rather than because of the accusations of fraud against his firm .
Bradblog has been following the Jacoby case and is posting regular updates .

Microsoft Corp. is making a social networking play .
The Redmond , Wash. , software giant said Thursday that it was adding social networking features to its latest release of its Windows Live Web services .
An investor in popular social networking site Facebook Inc. , Microsoft has hundreds of millions of e-mail and instant - messaging users .
But , like Yahoo , it has yet to tap the underlying social networks that connect those users .
In coming weeks , Microsoft plans to offer its users new ways to engage and share with friends online .
They can assemble contact lists , set up networks of people and create news feeds that feature Twitter updates , Flickr photos , Yelp reviews and other popular online activities .

Brian Hall , general manager for Windows Live , says Microsoft is trying to create a central hub where people can interact easily , whether sharing photos or planning events .
That ’s an ambition that mirrors Yahoo Inc.'s , and it puts Microsoft in competition with Facebook and News Corp . 's MySpace .
Google Inc. is pursuing a similar strategy with its OpenSocial initiative .
Hall underscored that Microsoft was trying to simplify the Web experience by bringing together people and content scattered all over the Web and across personal computers , phones and other devices .
Having one central place to organize and manage information relieves some of the social networking fatigue people are experiencing , he said .
To that end , Microsoft formed partnerships with a number of companies including LinkedIn Corp. , Photobucket Inc. and Twitter .

DETROIT — Levi Stubbs , the gravelly - voiced , imploring lead singer of the Motown group the Four Tops , who stood out in 1960s pop classics like “ Reach Out , I ’ll Be There , ” and “ Bernadette , ” died on Friday at his home here .
He was 72 .
His death was confirmed by the office of the Wayne County Medical Examiner .
No cause was given .
Mr. Stubbs had had a series of illnesses , including a stroke and cancer , that forced him to stop performing in 2000 , although he briefly participated in the Four Tops ’ 50th - anniversary concert in 2004 , which was broadcast on public television .
Formed while its original members were in high school , the Four Tops were one of the most successful groups of the 20th century .
They had more than 40 hits on the Billboard pop charts , including their first No. 1 single , “ I Ca n’t Help Myself ( Sugar Pie , Honey Bunch ) ” in 1965 .
Hugely popular abroad as well as in the United States , the group became a linchpin of Motown Records , the Detroit label started by Berry Gordy Jr. , and was second only to the Temptations , with whom it was often compared , in popularity among its male artists .
In 1990 the Four Tops were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
The success of the Bush Regime ’s propaganda , lies , and deception with gullible and inattentive Americans since 9/11 has made it difficult for intelligent , aware people to be optimistic about the future of the United States .
For almost 8 years the US media has served as Ministry of Propaganda for a war criminal regime .
Americans incapable of thinking for themselves , reading between the lines , or accessing foreign media on the Internet have been brainwashed .
As the Nazi propagandist , Joseph Goebbels , said , it is easy to deceive a people .
You just tell them they have been attacked and wave the flag .
It certainly worked with Americans .
The gullibility and unconcern of the American people has had many victims .
There are 1.25 million dead Iraqis .
There are 4 million displaced Iraqis .
No one knows how many are maimed and orphaned .
Iraq is in ruins , its infrastructure destroyed by American bombs , missiles , and helicopter gunships .
We do not know the death toll in Afghanistan , but even the American puppet regime protests the repeated killings of women and children by US and NATO troops .
We do n’t know what the death toll would be in Iran if Darth Cheney and the neocons succeed in their plot with Israel to bomb Iran , perhaps with nuclear weapons .
What we do know is that all this murder and destruction has no justification and is evil .
It is the work of evil men who have no qualms about lying and deceiving in order to kill innocent people to achieve their undeclared agenda .
That such evil people have control over the United States government and media damns the American public for eternity .
America will never recover from the shame and dishonor heaped upon her by the neoconned Bush Regime .
The success of the neocon propaganda has been so great that the opposition party has not lifted a finger to rein in the Bush Regime ’s criminal actions .
Even Obama , who promises " change " is too intimidated by the neocon ’s success in brainwashing the American population to do what his supporters hoped he would do and lead us out of the shame in which the neoconned Bush Regime has imprisoned us .
This about sums up the pessimistic state in which I existed prior to the go - ahead given by the Bush Regime to its puppet in Georgia to ethnically cleanse South Ossetia of Russians in order to defuse the separatist movement .
The American media , aka , the Ministry of Lies and Deceit , again accommodated the criminal Bush Regime and proclaimed " Russian invasion " to cover up the ethnic cleansing of Russians in South Ossetia by the Georgian military assault .
Only this time , the rest of the world did n’t buy it .
The many years of lies  9/11 , Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , al Qaeda connections , yellowcake , anthrax attack , Iranian nukes , " the United States does n’t torture , " the bombings of weddings , funerals , and children ’s soccer games , Abu Ghraib , renditions , Guantanamo , various fabricated " terrorist plots , " the determined assault on civil liberties  have taken their toll on American credibility .
No one outside America any longer believes the US media or the US government .
The rest of the world reported the facts  an assault on Russian civilians by American - and Israeli - trained and - equipped Georgian troops .
The Bush Regime , overcome by hubris , expected Russia to accept this act of American hegemony .
But the Russians did not , and the Georgian military was sent fleeing for its life .
The neoconned Republican response to the Russian failure to follow the script and to be intimidated by the " unipower " was so imbecilic that it shattered the brainwashing to which Americans had succumbed .
McCain declared : " In the 21st century nations do n’t invade other nations . "
Imagine the laughs Jon Stewart will get out of this on the Daily Show .
In the early years of the 21st century the United States has already invaded two countries and has been beating the drums for attacking a third .
President Bush , the chief invader of the 21st century , echoed McCain ’s claim that nations do n’t invade other nations .
This dissonant claim shocked even brainwashed Americans , as readers ’ emails reveal .
If in the 21st century countries do n’t invade other countries , what is Bush doing in Iraq and Afghanistan , and what are the naval armadas and propaganda arrayed against Iran about ?
Have two of the worst warmongers of modern times  Bush and McCain  called off the US / Israeli attack on Iran ?
If McCain is elected president , is he going to pull US troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan as " nations do n’t invade other nations , " or is President Bush going to beat him to it ?
We all know the answer .
The two stooges are astonished that the Americans have taught hegemony to Russians , who were previously operating , naively perhaps , on the basis of good will .
Suddenly the Western Europeans have realized that being allied with the United States is like holding a tiger by the tail .
No European country wants to be hurled into war with Russia .
Germany , France , and Italy must be thanking God they blocked Georgia ’s membership in NATO .
The Ukraine , where a sick nationalism has taken hold funded by the neocon National Endowment for Democracy , will be the next conflict between American pretensions and Russia .
Russia is being taught by the neocons that freeing the constituent parts of its empire has not resulted in their independence but in their absorption into the American Empire .
Unless enough Americans can overcome their brainwashed state and the rigged Diebold voting machines , turn out the imbecilic Republicans and hold the neoconservatives accountable for their crimes against humanity , a crazed neocon US government will provoke nuclear war with Russia .
The neoconservatives represent the greatest danger ever faced by the United States and the world .
Humanity has no greater enemy .
9:52 PT : Hello from Cupertino !
This is Macworld Editorial Director Jason Snell , reporting to you from the small theater on the main Apple campus on Infinite Loop .
Members of the media , analysts , and Apple employees are filing in to this theater , which has been the location of numerous Apple product launches , including the original iPod launch .
I ’ll be providing your live update today , so I ’m warming up my typing fingers right now .
9:54 PT : How you know it ’s not an Apple music event :
The music playing is classical .
Classical is not my specialty , but it was a solo violin .
Now some more ... chamber music ?
“ Now I feel like I ’m at a wedding , ” says an Apple employee behind me .
Are you ready to rock ?
I hope not !
Are you ready to classical ?
9:59 PT : Lights are dimming .
We ’re about to get started
9:59 PT : Steve Jobs on stage .
“ Good morning ! ” Black mock turtleneck , blue jeans -- standard attire .
“ Everybody knows , today ’s about notebooks , and we ’ve got some exciting new notebooks and we want to tell you the story about how we created these things . ”
But first , “ we want to cover the state of the Mac . ” So Steve introduces chief operating officer Tim Cook to take us through the “ state of the Mac . ”
10:00 PT : Slide of current Mac line .
Cook : Last reported quarter , 2.5 million Macs , new company record .
“ This did n’t just start in the last quarter .
Several quarters in a row , we ’ve been growing 2 - 3 times the market growth .
Here ’s why we think this is the case . ”
First , “ better computers , far superior ” to what ’s out there .
He cites the iMac and the MacBook air .
10:01 PT : Next : Better Software .
“ Software like Leopard .
Virtually everyone agrees that Leopard is far ahead of Vista .
And software like iLife , the best digital lifestyle suite on the market , that lets you enjoy photos , and make movies , and make music , all in an integrated package .
10:02 PT : Number 3 , compatibility .
He cites Boot Camp on every Mac. Shows Windows XP running on iMac .
“ When I look at this , it sends shivers up my sign .
But it works as an insurance policy , whether you use it or not . ”
10:03 PT : Next up , “ something we did n’t do -- Vista . ”
Laughter in the audience .
“ I think it ’s fair to say that Vista has n’t lived up to everything that Microsoft hoped it would .
And consequently , it ’s opened doors for a lot of people to consider switching to the Mac .
And this has given us an opportunity and Apple has been the beneficiary of this . ”
10:04 PT : Great marketing .
“ The Mac - PC ad has struck a chord with so many switchers .
They tell a story , and people listen . ”
And he plays one of the ads - it ’s the “ you ’re banished ” ad with John Hodgman on a throne .
10:05 PT : “ Number six , retail stores .
We began our journey in the retail stores just about seven years ago .
And today we have 247 stores in 8 countries , and they greet 400,000 visitors each day .
And most importantly , still 50 percent of the Macintoshes they sell are to people that are new to the Mac , making the people underneath the Macintosh tent larger and larger . ”
Shows photos of the new Sydney store and the new Beijing store .
10:06 PT : “ And these are the six reasons we ’d attribute to the Mac ’s momentum .
But this just did n’t begin .
If you look at the history , what you would see that the Mac has outgrown the market for 14 of the last 15 quarters .
That ’s almost four years .
That ’s phenomenal . ”
10:07 PT : “ Obviously the unit share is growing .
In U.S. retail , we ’ve gone from a single - digit number to now , the Macintosh represents 17.6 percent of unit sales in U.S. retail .
And if you look at revenue share , because we focus on fully - featured systems and we do n’t compromise on quality , our revenue share is 31.3 percent .
That means one out of every three dollars spent on computers in U.S. retail is spent on the Macintosh .
What a difference a few years makes . ”
10:08 PT : “ In education , we ’ve surpassed Dell to become the top - selling provider of notebooks , 39 percent .
And at a major university , here ’s what ’s happened . ”
Shows a slide , starts at 2002 at 15 percent , up to 47 percent in 2008 .
10:09 PT : Tim puts up a photo of a lecture hall at a college , and it ’s almost entirely Mac laptops .
“ I challenge you to find a PC , ” he says .
The point is , college kids have a choice of laptops and they ’re choosing Macs .
10:09 PT : New slide : total Mac units sold .
Pointing out that in the first three quarters , Apple has already sold as many Macs as they did all last year .
“ And that ’s the state of the Mac , ” Cook says .
10:10 PT : Jobs is back !
“ With that done , let ’s talk about notebooks .
But before we get started , we want to talk about some technologies and discoveries we ’ve made that help us build notebooks . ”
10:11 PT : Jonathan
Ive on stage .
“ I ’d like to take a few moments to tell you about a real breakthrough we ’ve had in how to design our notebooks .
To show you the issues that preoccupy us when we ’re designing these products . ”
First , he ’s going to show how they build the current MacBook Pro .
“ When you ’re designing a product as thin and light as the MacBook Pro , is making it strong , robust , tortionally rigid .
I think you ’d be surprised to know that the aluminium enclosure you see makes a small contribution to the structure .
The structure is primarily derived from the internal frame .
It ’s made of multiple parts that are then assembled into the bottom case , which is a very thin Aluminium pressing .
It ’s this composite that starts to create a strong system . ”
10:13 PT : Showing a series of plates on the current model that are welded together to provide more support .
And finally , they add a plastic gasket .
“ That allows us to control the reveal of the junction between the palm rest and the bottom case .
We have been looking at a new way of solving these problems , and we ’ve been looking for a better way to build a notebook , and we think we ’ve found it .
We had a significant breakthrough that culminated in the design of the MacBook air .
There is no way that you could build a product that is as thin , light , and importantly as strong and robust as the MacBook air given the architecture that I just described .
10:14 PT : “ We discovered that if we started with a thick piece of aluminium and removed material to make physical features in the structure , we could make a much lighter but much stronger part .
So that ’s how we make the palm rest of the MacBook air . ”
He shows an image of an aluminum extrusion to show how the put it together .
They create the “ locating features , ” holes in the metal .
Then rough cutting , a “ noisy stage ” where they remove large amounts of material quickly .
Remove holes for key caps , and the trackpad .
Then they blast it and anodize it .
10:16 PT : “ At each of these distinct stages , we ’re continually collecting the material , and cleaning it , and recycling it .
So we started with a solid slab of aluminium that weighed over 2.5 pounds , and we end with this remarkably precise part that ways less than a quarter of a pound .
It ’s also very strong .
That one part forms the structure for the MacBook air .
It ’s the highly precise enclosure that makes the product possible .
So this new way of building a notebook that we pioneered here obviously has relevance beyond the MacBook air .
And we ’ve been working hard to build new unibody enclosures for new notebooks . ”
10:17 PT : Jobs is back .
“ We also have some new graphics for notebooks .
Nvidia came to us many months ago and talked to us about an amazing graphics part they wanted to build , that would combine the chipset and an extremely powerful embedded graphics processor , all in one part , for a desktop computer .
And we said , ‘ This is fantastic , but we ’d like to use it in a notebook .
Can we work together on this ? ’
And we ’ve worked with them and ... it ’s really great .
It ’s the Nvidia GeForce 9400 M .
It ’s an amazing chip .
It combines the Chipset and GPU on one die .
70 percent of the die area is the GPU .
There are 16 parallel graphics cores on it , and they deliver 54 gigaflops of graphics performance .
So this thing ’s a stunner in performance .
And in our tests we ’ve found it ’s up to five times faster than integrated graphics . ”
Slide showing performance : 2.8 x in World of Warcraft , up to 6.2X for Call of Duty .
10:19 PT : Showing 55 percent performance versus the 8600M GT in the current MacBook Pro , and for general performance it ’s up at 86 percent .
10:20 PT : “ We ’ve got a new trackpad for notebooks .
It ’s a gorgeous , large , multitouch glass trackpad for notebooks .
It ’s 39 percent larger tracking area than before , it ’s multi - touch for gestures , it ’s glass for silky - smooth travel .
And we ’ve optimized the coefficient of friction on the glass , so it ’s really beautiful .
And the entire trackpad is the button .
It gives you more area on the trackpad and keeps you from hunting for that button .
You can get multi-button support from software .
And we ’ve added some new four - finger gestures that are really nice . ”
10:21 PT : Steve is recapping the gestures from the prior models , one - fingure ones , two - finger spreads and pinches and rotations , and three - finger slides forward and back .
And now the new four - finger gesture , sliding four fingers up for Exposé activation , and sliding to the side to bring up the app switcher , then one finger to move between the apps in the app switcher .
10:22 PT : “ Today we ’re introducing our new MacBook Pro .
Our current MacBook Pro is the best in class in the industry , and today we ’re going to replace it with this .
And it ’s gorgeous .
Full glass , instant on LED displays , you can see how thin the display is .
All the connectors on [ the left ] side . ”
Black front like an iMac .
“ Precision aluminum unibody enclosure , LED display , next generation graphics , a multi - touch glass trackpad , a mini displauy port connector -- we ’re putting that on all our systems -- and environmentally responsible . ”
Also the usual stuff , like backlit keyboards , magnetic latch , motion sensor , speakers , iSight and microphone .
10:24 PT : “ The unibody saves us half the parts from the old model .
So we ’re really happy about this , and I ’d like you to see it . ”
He ’s going to pass around the unibody part .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In the waning days of the election season , as both parties campaign fervently for their candidates , one man has been notably absent -- President George W. Bush .
After announcing his endorsement of McCain , Bush has not appeared in public stumping for his party 's nominee .
Reporters began asking questions immediately after the White House schedule last week noted Bush had no public events Friday through Monday , and would spend most of his time at Camp David .
" The president is pretty focused on the activities that we have here , especially getting this economy back in order , " White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said Wednesday .
" We canceled a lot of our fundraisers , and he 's going to focus on being with Mrs. Bush and others this weekend at Camp David . "
But Perino could n't list any fundraisers that had been canceled recently .
Friday , Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto offered a more detailed explanation .
" The truth is we 're also trying to stay out of the public limelight during this period of the election season , " said Fratto .
" There are two individuals out there running to be president of the United States , and we do n't want to complicate that for them . "
Political experts acknowledge the reality that a lame - duck president with record low approval ratings -- 28 percent according to the latest CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll -- is a political liability for Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
" These are all politicians who are running for office .
They all read the polls .
They all have their finger wetted and up to see where the breeze is blowing , " said Stephen Hess , a veteran staffer of the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations and an adviser to Presidents Ford and Carter .
" You can be sure that if George W. Bush was more popular , he'd be out there . "
Watch why Bush has n't been a high - profile fundraiser »
The numbers tell the story .
Of the 46 fundraisers President Bush attended this year , only four were open to cameras -- and those were events raising money for the Republican Party .
The last time Bush appeared at a public fundraiser stumping for an individual candidate was August 27 , 2007 .
And the four fundraisers the president attended for Republican nominee John McCain have all been closed to the news media .
It 's a stark contrast to the farewell campaign tour of the last two - term GOP president , Ronald Reagan , who left office with one of the highest approval ratings ever at the end of a presidency -- 64 percent .
Reagan embarked on a marathon coast - to - coast campaign swing for George H.W. Bush , the current president 's father , during the final weekend of campaign ' 88 .
" We went to battleground states , not safe Republican states .
We went to Illinois .
We went to Ohio .
We went to Missouri .
We went to Pennsylvania , " said Ken Duberstein , who was Reagan 's chief of staff .
A young George W. Bush attended the November 5 Reagan campaign rally in Mesquite , Texas , the Saturday before Americans went to the polls that year .
" It was a celebration , " recalls Duberstein .
" It was n't simply a victory lap .
It was almost a thank - you tour . "
Duberstein , who is planning to vote for Barack Obama , said it must be difficult for the current President Bush to have seen that and know he 'll never get one of his own .
" Yes , there might be some sadness today or tomorrow because he is like a good political thoroughbred .
He wants to be out there running , " Duberstein observed .
" But sometimes you have to stay in the stable . "
Bush is expected to remain out of sight until after the election .
He and first lady Laura Bush have already voted by absentee ballot .
They 'll spend Tuesday evening at the White House with friends watching the results come in , said Perino .
All About George W. Bush • U.S. Presidential Election

He -- for there could be no doubt of his sex , though certain of his proclivities did something ( in the mind of the military wing of his family ) to complicate it -- was in the act of watching a slackliner on a slackline strung from opposing trees .
It was hard not to think of Man on Wire ( if you have n't seen it , go , go , go ) .
The branches above the slackline , heavy with leaves , which the slackliner walked in and out of and occasionally ripped out of his way , made the whole sight kind of circus -y .
Passersby stopped to watch .
The stoner watched the slackliner ( this guy ) and then watched the sky , on his back , next to a girl he'd just met ( bottle - orange hair , candy - striped top , also stoned ) .
The leaves and the sky .
A small airplane shot out of the leaves .
The stoner thought about all the people who'd given him a hard time about going to Hempfest : the friends going to Smoke Farm who blinked in disbelief when the stoner chose Hempfest ( close to home , by the water ) over the possibility of bad outdoor theater in a remote location ; the actress / singer / Joni Mitchell fan who , when the stoner intimated that he was going to Hempfest by texting that he was " was being a hippie " today , texted back " the first step is admitting u have a problem " ; Dan Savage , who declaimed over after - work drinks on Friday that every other weekend of the year is more ideal for getting stoned in Myrtle Edwards Park because there 's no one else there ; the stoner 's young friend from New Orleans , another stoner , who nonetheless texted , " Hempfest is just a celebration of everything that 's not fun about pot " ; and so on and so forth ) .
You get a lot of heat for going to Hempfest .
It 's easy to be intimidated by the disdain .
By the unfashionable - ness of it .
Dan Savage , of all people , is giving his friends a hard time for going to Hempfest ?
Whatever with those people .
Hempfest is fantastic .
It helps to show up in the afternoon , around 2 or 3 , and to go with friends , and to sit in the shade with a view the water and the sky and the barely clothed people in the ripeness of their youth walking by .
It 's true that you hear the stupidest shit from the people who are given microphones and access to a stage , but ( satisfyingly ) the people you are sitting with are n't falling for it either .
" We are here and now ! " an officially sanctioned Hempfest speaker was shouting into a microphone in the distance .
The girl with the bottle - orange hair smiled and said , " Man , that 's some motivational speaker .
No wonder we can't band together .
These are our motivational speakers . "
Nevertheless , from those very unmotivational stages , or at least from the northernmost one , comes the most amazing sort of rain when the clock strikes 4:20 pm : free joints .
Raining down .
Hundreds ( thousands ? ) of them .
Onto the crowd .
This year there was such a crush of people on the path in the minutes before 4:20 pm struck -- perhaps the joints - raining - down - from - the - sky thing has been too well publicized -- that the stoner and the slackliner and the girl with the bottle - orange hair could n't get to the northernmost stage ( does it happen at all the stages ? ) until about 4:22 pm , by which point the sea of bodies was already obscured in a haze , battlefield - like .
The stoner asked a random girl for a hit of hers and she reached in her bag and gave him a fresh one , adding , " They handed them out . "
This will happen again today , by the way .
If nothing else , the stoner thought , Hempfest is an answer to the dominant American culture -- the suburban , generic , corporate - controlled mainstream .
It 's the embodiment of an alternative .
That this alternative seems so drastic , that it causes so many of your friends to bristle , is only evidence of how well the conservative line has been sold to us .
This alternative is n't drastic .
It is not some lawless primal orgy .
Hempfest is crawling with police officers and security personnel , watching everything : 100,000 people smoking pot outdoors on a nice day , laughing , relaxing , reading , buying stuff , listening to music , eating noodles , eating ice cream , walking on slacklines between trees , sitting on the rocks , watching the trains groan by , etc. , etc .
The only hippie - riffic conversation the stoner got into occurred in one of the VIP areas , behind one of the stages , where a man in what looked like a utilikilt , except it was made out of black lace , sat down and smiled .
This man in lace and leggings and some serious facial hair was walking with the assistance of a light - wood cane topped with a brass knob .
The rest of the man 's ensemble was more than dubious , but it was a handsome cane .
The stoner complimented it .
The man in lace replied , " It used to be Jefferson Airplane 's manager's . "
The stoner replied with an expression that must have looked like awe .
" Yeah , Jefferson Airplane 's manager 's cane .
His son gave it to me . "
The stoner was trying to think of a Jefferson Airplane song .
He said , " What was one of their big songs ? "
The man in lace shook his head and said he had no idea .
Then he added , " If you ask me about psychedelic trance or something , I can probably tell you . "
Then there was a long silence .
The stoner went and got his bike and rode out to Elliott Avenue , and then up the west side of Queen Anne Hill to watch firemen march uphill into brush fire .
He took a photo of the fire engines with his cell phone .
Then he rode back down to Elliott Avenue and , hungry for ice cream , stopped into a Baskin Robbins .
For there one was .
He ate it outside on the sidewalk , next to his bike , staring into cars waiting at the light .
Bill Wilson
Bill Wilson did n’t plan on becoming the creator of one of the most influential organizations to have been established in America in the 20th Century .
In fact , when he had his first drink when he was a 22 year old , the last thing he was thinking was becoming an alcoholic and hitting bottom 17 years later , only to transform himself and countless others into sober individuals .
The Alcoholic Years
For 17 years after his first drink Bill Wilson suffered from alcoholism .
By 1933 his once promising career as a Wall Street investor was no more and he and his wife found themselves in poverty .
When through a friend he began to attend Frank Buchman ’s Oxford Group , the meetings gave him the strength to sober up .
A Moment of Inspiration
It was n’t until the end of the next five months of sobriety in a hotel lobby in Akron , Ohio that Wilson ’s “ religious experience ” and transformation occurred .
Bill Wilson stood in that hotel lobby in Akron , Ohio after a blown business deal wanting a drink , but instead his religious epiphany led him to help others and from small groups Alcoholics Anonymous was born .
Anonymity : The Key to Success
Bill Wilson achieved success through being the “ anonymous celebrity . ”
Early on in his transformation from lonely alcoholic to the humble leader , Wilson wrote and developed the 12 Traditions and 12 Steps , which ultimately developed as the core piece of thought behind Alcoholics Anonymous .
After some time he developed the “ Big Book , ” based on his teachings and understandings from his support groups and the 12 Steps .
Bill Wilson not only preached support groups based on anonymity , he lived by attending his own groups as Bill W. Wilson remained Bill W. until 1971 , the year he died .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Genetically engineered immune cells can spot the AIDS virus even when it tries to disguise itself , offering a potential new way to treat the incurable infection , researchers reported on Sunday .
The killer T - cells , dubbed “ assassin ” cells , were able to recognize other cells infected by HIV and slow the spread of the virus in lab dishes .
If the approach works in people , it might provide a new route of treating infection with the deadly human immunodeficiency virus , the researchers in the United States and Britain said .
“ Billions of these anti-HIV warriors can be generated in two weeks , ” said Angel Varela - Rohena of the University of Pennsylvania , who helped lead the study .
In a second , unrelated report , researchers testing Dutch biotechnology firm Crucell NV ’s experimental AIDS vaccine said it prevented infection in six monkeys .
The animals were infected with a monkey version of HIV called SIV , and the vaccine used a virus that is dangerous to use in humans , so it is not ready for human tests .
But , writing in the journal Nature , Dr. Dan Barouch of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston and colleagues said it shows there is still hope for developing a vaccine against AIDS .
The AIDS virus , which infects 33 million people globally , is especially hard to fight .
Like all viruses , it hijacks cells in its victims , forcing them to become little viral factories and make more virus .
ESCAPE AND EVADE
HIV is even more insidious , attacking immune system cells called CD4 T cells , which help mount a defense .
It can also disguise itself to escape CD8 killer cells , also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CTLs .
“ CTLs are crucial for the control of HIV infection .
Unfortunately , HIV has an arsenal of mutational and nonmutational strategies that aid it in escaping from the CTL response mounted against it by its host , ” the researchers wrote in their report , published in the journal Nature Medicine .
One good defense allows HIV to hide a protein called HLA - I - associated antigen .
Varela - Rohena and colleagues took T - cells from an HIV patient and created a genetically engineered version that recognizes this deception .
“ It is possible to improve on nature when it comes to preventing HIV CTL escape , ” they wrote .
Not only could the engineered T - cells see HIV strains that had escaped detection by natural T - cells , “ but the engineered T cells responded in a much more vigorous fashion so that far fewer T - cells were required to control infection , ” Penn ’s James Riley , who also worked on the study , said in a statement .
“ In the face of our engineered assassin cells , the virus will either die or be forced to change its disguises again , weakening itself along the way , ” added Andy Sewell of Britain ’s Cardiff University .
Perhaps having to mutate will weaken the virus , the researchers said .
They plan to test the T - cell treatment in HIV patients next year .
“ We have managed to engineer a receptor that is able to detect HIV ’s key fingerprints and is able to clear HIV infection in the laboratory , ” said Bent Jakobsen , chief scientific officer at Adaptimmune Ltd , a British company launched in July that owns the rights to the technology .
“ If we can translate those results in the clinic , we could at last have a very powerful therapy on our hands . ”
Mr. Obama wanted domestic issues to come last ; advisers said that they believed even before the start of the financial crisis that the election was most likely to turn on the state of the economy and that he wanted the final televised exchange to focus on those concerns .
He has argued that Mr. McCain would continue the economic policies of President Bush .
Mr. McCain also wanted foreign policy topics to come first in the debates , his aides said , in the hope of capitalizing on his positive reputation on national security issues across party lines .
He wanted limits on the original format for the first and third debates , which had been nine topics with nine minutes of free - flowing debate on each one .
Mr. Obama went along , though his aides did insist that at least several minutes of open - ended debate occur in each block of questioning , because they believe he does well in that format .
Now the candidates will be asked a question , each will give an answer of two minutes or less , and then they will mix it up for five additional minutes before moving on to the next question in the same format .
Obama aides also agreed to use lecterns at the first event , which Mr. McCain preferred ; at the third debate , the two men will be seated at a round table , in the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions , with the moderator at 6 o’clock .
McCain aides said that they were conscious of the fact that Mr. McCain has a prominent scar on one side of his face , and that they could not predict how prominent it would appear with the camera angles , lighting and make - up .

The debate formats were negotiated by Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , representing the McCain campaign , and Representative Rahm Emanuel , Democrat of Illinois , for the Obama camp .
A handful of aides from both camps were also involved , hammering out issues between themselves and then holding conference calls with members of the commission to reach final agreements , people involved in the process said .
" Our friends back home , when they saw the pics , at first did n't believe it was real or , if they did , that we made it , " Newton said .
" It was n't until we showed them some pics of us actually carving the pumpkin that they believed us ....
Once we convinced them that the pumpkin was actually ours , I think they were pretty damn impressed . "
Read that headline twice .
It might just be the dumbest statement made on television since Bush took office .
After accusing Obama of voting to deny armor for the troops , Dick Morris tries to argue that Obama displayed poor judgment during the Georgian / Russian conflict because he pointed out that we would be in a stronger position to condemn Russia if we had n't squandered our credibility by invading Iraq .
After Colmes reminds him that Obama is right , Morris proceeds to make himself look even dumber by claiming we invaded Iraq at the invitation of Saddam Hussein .
Huh ?

Morris :
You saw by these , these ill prepared reactions on Georgia .
And you saw what he said today ?
Obama said that he understood that countries should not invade other countries and we would be in a better position to say that if we had not gone into Iraq .
Colmes :
Where is he wrong ?
Morris :
Where he 's wrong is that we went into Iraq at the invitation of the government .
Not as an invasion .
Colmes :
We went to Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein . [....]
Morris :
We 're in Iraq now at the invitation of the government .
Colmes :
They 've asked us to leave .
They said there 's a timeline to get us out .
Morris :
We 're in Iraq as a result of a democracy asking for us to come in there .
It 's not an invasion .
It 's not a takeover .
We 're not trying to annex Iraq .
Colmes :
We went in there by our own ... of our own .
We went into Iraq originally .
Not at the invitation of Saddam Hussein 's government .
To recap : Obama does n't want to protect the troops ( he does ) ; we invaded Iraq at the request of Saddam Hussein ( we did n't ) ; we 're staying in Iraq because the Iraqis want us there ( they do n't ) ; and America has the requisite credibility to scold other countries for doing exactly what we do ( we do n't ) .
How much does FOX pay this clown ?
Full transcript below :
Morris says :
The choice of Biden reminds me very much of Bush 's choice of Cheney .
The idea of going for an older , wiser , more experienced figure .
Over the last eight years the Bush administration has sacrificed American lives , resources , and influence at every turn .
President George W. Bush , with the avid support of Sen. John McCain and most of the Republican Party , took the US into an unnecessary war in Iraq , increased the number of America ’s enemies and the threat of terrorism , strengthened the Iranian regime , and sacrificed US clout with friends and foes alike .
Yet polls indicate that more Americans trust Sen. McCain than Sen. Barack Obama as military commander - in - chief .
It ’s a bizarre conclusion .
Sen. McCain is temperamental , sanctimonious , and moralistic ; surprisingly ignorant about the nuances of international affairs , he believes that he knows far more about foreign policy than he actually does .
It would be a combustible combination even if he had n’t variously advocated war against the Bosnian Serbs , Serbia , Iraq , and North Korea , as well as promoted confrontation with Russia , a nuclear - armed power .
He could prove to be the most dangerous occupant ever of the White House .
Nevertheless , the Republican sales pitch so far has fallen short .
The public cares more about the economy than foreign policy .
While Sen . Obama ’s economic nostrums are no more believable than those of Sen. McCain , the Republican Party has lost any credibility it once had on economic issues .
Sen .
Obama might not have the answer , but at least he belongs to a different party than the one which spent the last eight years engaging in wild spending and orchestrating trillions of dollars in special interest bailouts .
The GOP has responded by scare - mongering , attempting to convince the American people that foreign policy remains paramount .
Never mind the economy .
The world is about to end unless a steady Republican hand remains upon the tiller .
Republicans warn of potential terrorist strikes at home and unpredictable dangers abroad .
Neoconservatives talk about the US being engaged in World War III or World War IV against Islamic terrorists .
Rep . John Shadegg recently took the argument to ludicrous extremes when he wrote his supporters denouncing any cut in military spending  currently higher , even after adjusting for inflation , than at any point during the Cold War , Korean War , or Vietnam War .
Complained Shadegg : " Our nation is facing the threat of Radical Islam , the gravest threat to our national security in history . "
Eh ?
On September 11 al - Qaeda orchestrated three murderous attacks that killed about 3000 people .
Evil , awful , and ugly .
But in no way threatening the stability of the US government , let alone the destruction of American society .
Other countries have faced great and often greater challenges from terrorism : the Irish Republican Army versus the British government , the Basque ETA versus the Spanish government , the Tamil Tigers versus the Sri Lankan government , the Red Brigades versus the Italian government .
Terrorists have struck in Greece , Germany , Japan , Uruguay , India , and even imperial Russia .
Islamic radicals have murdered widely , including in Britain , Spain , Indonesia , Jordan , and Iraq .
Only in Iraq could one argue that regime if not national survival was at stake , and that is only because terrorism joined a far more serious insurgency in the aftermath of a foreign invasion .
It is true that many of America ’s wars were not animated by security threats , but instead involved frivolous or even immoral ends .
The Mexican - American War was basically a land grab for Texas and California .
The Spanish - American
War used the protection of human rights in Cuba as an excuse to seize the Philippines as a colony in Asia .
World War I was an idiotic imperial slugfest in which America had nothing significant at stake .
Vietnam was more tragic than stupid , an unnecessary attempt to preserve the remnants of colonialism in Southeast Asia against a potent combination of nationalism and communism ; three decades later communism is giving way to capitalism with Americans and their money welcomed back .
Contrast that to the Revolutionary War , from which the American colonies barely emerged independent .
For years British forces ravaged the countryside and occupied major cities , including the nascent nation ’s capital .
During the War of 1812 Britain eliminated American ocean commerce , occupied swaths of US territory , and burned Washington , D.C. America was saved by its lack of centralization and development .
Having just suffered through years of war to end Napoleon ’s brutal depredations , the British public had no enthusiasm for escalating the battle with the former colonies .
The Civil War tore the country apart .
That was an internal conflict , to be sure , but for a short time the national government risked war with Britain over the illegal seizure of the Trent , a mail and passenger vessel , and in the first year or two the potential of intervention by Britain and France in support of the Confederacy loomed large .
For the North to have battled the Southern states allied with two foreign adversaries would have made America ’s bloodiest war far more costly .
World War II found the US confronting Nazi Germany and militaristic Japan .
These were real countries animated by real ideologies deploying real militaries .
Washington created a 13 - million man military for combat spanning the globe .
Although the US never came close to defeat , World War II was America ’s first , and so far only , taste of the sort of total war which has consumed other nations .
During the Cold War , with some very hot spots , the US faced a nuclear - armed hegemonic power animated by a hostile ideology .
There was nearly a direct nuclear confrontation over Cuba , wars between the US and local communist regimes  North Korea , backed by China , and North Vietnam , supplied by China and the Soviet Union  and proxy wars throughout the Third World .
Although the two great powers and their respective alliances avoided the many tripwires for a new global war , few people took peace for granted : indeed , for a time American schoolchildren practiced taking cover in response to a possible nuclear war .
However , apparently Rep. Shadegg believes these conflicts to be minor compared to the threat of terrorism .
The Soviet Union was capable of launching a nuclear attack that could annihilate the United States .
Imperial Japan ranged throughout the Pacific seizing US possessions and attacking American territory in Hawaii and the Aleutians .
Nazi Germany battled the US Navy in the Atlantic , the US Air Force over Europe , and the US Army in North Africa and Europe .
But no matter .
It is a few jihadist terrorists who pose " the gravest threat to our national security in history , " in the words of Rep. Shadegg .
Which means not a single dollar can be cut from the defense budget .
To the contrary , the only way to fight the terrorists is to create the biggest , most expansive , most expensive , most advanced military , deploy it to every corner of the globe , and meddle in numerous tragic but irrelevant conflicts .
The US must spend as much as the rest of the world combined on the military .
And spend as much , adjusted for inflation , as the US spent at any point during the Cold War , Korean War , or Vietnam War .
Indeed , presumably Washington is n’t spending enough to fight jihadists because military outlays still lag behind expenditures during World War II .
What is Congress thinking ?
If Osama bin Laden is more dangerous than Adolf Hitler , Hideki Tojo , Joseph Stalin , and Mao Zedong , why are n’t we spending even more on defense !
The upcoming election has focused on economic issues , but the present administration ’s irresponsible foreign policy has wasted hundreds of billions of dollars while creating trillions of dollars in future liabilities .
More important , Americans have been made less secure as politicians like Rep .
Shadegg have misled the public about the kind of enemy the US faces and the best means of defending the country .
Terrorism is ugly .
But it does not constitute the most serious threat ever faced by America , akin to another world war .
We will be safer not with additional expensive carrier groups and air wings to back a belligerent stance against countries like Russia over irrelevant geopolitical struggles in the Caucasus , but with a noninterventionist foreign policy which steadfastly avoids unnecessary conflicts .
The world is filled with tragedy , but that does n’t mean the US has to join in at every opportunity .
Republicans as well as Democrats once believed that the federal government ’s job was to defend America , not wander the globe , mixing war - mongering with social engineering .
Over the last eight years , however , the national government has become a tool of neoconservative activists who see war as the ultimate solution to most foreign problems .
The economy is an important issue .
But so is foreign policy .
We cannot afford another four or eight years of misguided militarism and perpetual war .
UNFAITHFUL women beware .
Chances are your male partner is on your case .
In fact , he is likely to suspect infidelities even when you have kept to the straight and narrow .
The flip side is that to counter this constant vigilance , women may be better than men at concealing illicit liaisons .
Paul Andrews at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and colleagues gave 203 young heterosexual couples confidential questionnaires asking them whether they had ever strayed , and whether they suspected or knew their partner had strayed .
In this , 29 per cent of men said they had cheated , compared with 18.5 per cent …
City Council Speaker Christine Quinn just had a press conference and only said that the Council has discussed the issue -- she did n't have any further statement -- according to NY1 .
Legislation was introduced today , and it'll be " referred to a committee , followed by a public hearing , and then a possible vote . "
City Councilman Bill de Blasio said of Council support , " I think it 's very , very evenly split , literally .
Some very strong ' no ' voices , some very strong ' yes ' voices , some real undecided folks .
I think people were honest about the mixed feelings they 're having . "
We 'll have more of a roundup on the latest term limits news later .

A chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf off the north coast of Ellesmere Island in Canada 's far north on Sunday July 27 , 2008 .
The sheet is the biggest piece shed by one of Canada 's six ice shelves since the Ayles shelf broke loose in 2005 from the coast of Ellesmere , about 500 miles from the North Pole .
The Arctic has become more stormy in the past 50 years due to the warming climate , which in turn has quickened the pace of drifting sea ice , a new NASA study finds .
Based on model results , climate scientists had long predicted that a warming climate would increase the frequency and intensity of Arctic storms as ocean waters became progressively warmer .
Now , a team of climate scientists has analyzed 56 years on data of the paths that storms took , as well as annual data on general storm activity , which confirmed an accelerating trend in Arctic storm activity 1950 to 2006 .
They also looked at data on ice drift in the Arctic collected during the same 56 - year period and found that the pace of sea ice movement along the Arctic Ocean 's Transpolar Drift Stream from Siberia to the Atlantic Ocean also accelerated .
Because wind at the ocean surface is known to be the driving force behind the movement of sea ice , the researchers concluded that the increase in Arctic storminess and the sea ice drift speeds are linked .
The finding , detailed in the Oct. 3 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters , could reinforce the critical role that changes in the Arctic Ocean play in global ocean circulation and climate change .
" Gradually warming waters have driven storm tracks — the ocean paths in the Atlantic and Pacific along which most cyclones travel — northward .
We speculate that sea ice serves as the ' middleman ' in a scenario where increased storm activity yields increased stirring winds that will speed up the Arctic 's transition into a body of turbulently mixing warm and cool layers with greater potential for deep convection that will alter climate further , " said study team member Sirpa Hakkinen of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
Progressively stronger storms over the Transpolar Drift Stream forced sea ice to drift increasingly faster in a matter of hours after the onset of storms , Hakkinen and her colleagues found .
They saw an increase over 56 years in maximum summer sea ice speeds from about 8 inches per second ( 20 centimeters per second ) to more than 24 inches per second ( 60 centimeters per second ) , and wintertime speeds from about 6 inches per second ( 15 centimeters per second ) to about 20 inches per second ( 50 centimeters per second ) .
The moving sea ice forces the ocean to move , which then sets off significantly more mixing of the upper layers of the ocean than would occur without the " push " from the ice .
The increased mixing of the ocean layer forces increased ocean convection , which could create a counteracting force to climate warming , as it could help the ocean absorb more of the carbon dioxide accumulating in Earth 's atmosphere .
" Although it remains to be seen how this may ultimately play out in the future , the likelihood this increasing trend and link between storminess and ice drift could expand the Arctic 's role as a sink for extracting fossil fuel - generated carbon dioxide from the air is simply fascinating , " Hakkinen said .
" If it unfolds in the way we suppose , this scenario could , of course , affect the whole climate system and its evolution . "

" Raw capitalism is dead . " — Henry Paulson , U.S. Treasury secretary
" Ca n’t we just all go out and say things are OK ? " — President Bush , to congressional leaders during bailout negotiations
I ’m not much of an Army Times reader , but after reading that a brigade was shipping from Iraq in October to serve as " an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks " in the homeland right before the election , my antennae perked up .
Same as they did when I read that an electoral college doomsday scenario exists in which Dick Cheney casts the deciding vote that gives McCain - Palin the White House .
That is , if Cheney and Bush do n’t take it for themselves .
That may sound like fantasy , but do n’t kill the messenger .
They are all strands of the Gordian knot the Bush administration has tied around the neck of the American people for the last two presidential terms , best represented today by the failed bailout of banks , brokers and other complicit parties that have since jacked the American people out of trillions .
And while the Army Times revelation or election doomsday may turn out to be paranoia rather than prescience , the evidence just is n’t there .
Like I said : antennae .
They ’ve come in handy as bullshit detectors since Bush stole the election from a flat - footed Al Gore and set about engineering the greatest transfer of public wealth into private hands in American history .
If you factor in Monday ’s failed takeover , as well as the $ 5 trillion the American people now owe thanks to the " bailout " of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , not to mention the continuing hyper - expensive occupation of Iraq and so on , our citizenry is now so far in the hole that it ’s pointless griping about numbers .
If you want one , use the figure put forth by Dennis Kucinich : half a quadrillion dollars .
We have evolved past the point of economic or geopolitical reality and entered a phase of pure concept .
And all vectors of that phase point toward the conclusion that the proverbial shit has totally hit the fan — head on , and all over again .

The Rise of the Fourth Reich
For the first time Jim Marrs has gathered compelling evidence that an effort has been underway for the past sixty years to bring a form of National Socialism to modern America , creating in essence a modern empire — or " Fourth Reich " !

US military attempts to develop " programmable neuromorphic " electronic artificial mouse - and cat - bonce brain podules have now moved into gear , with IBM scooping a $ 5 m contract award .
One need hardly specify that the Pentagon office overseeing the Tom 'n ' Jerryputer push is DARPA , that reassuring rock of madness in an often tediously mundane techno world .
The bonkers bad - boy battle boffins of DARPA eat breakfast every day at the Unfeasible Diner , frequently lunch at the Quite Possibly Unnecessary Hotel , occasionally take their aperitifs at the Unforeseen Consequences Saloon - and now and then get thrown out of the Step Too Far Club late at night .
They 've certainly pushed the boat out with the Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics ( SyNAPSE ) programme , in which they would like someone to build " autonomous , learning neural systems " which can replicate the capabilities of " biological neural systems ( eg brains ) " .
The idea is to achieve the same kind of computing feats that animal brains can , with machines of similar size , weight and power requirements .
A cat , for instance , can jump up onto a fence using only binocular vision ; a computer able to take stereoscopic vid and accomplish the same feat with four robotic legs would be so heavy as to crush the fence .
Likewise , a human can drive a car in traffic - and so can a computer , perhaps .
But that computer currently weighs more than 200 tons and requires power levels typical of a warship , not a car .
Hence DARPA 's interest in artificial - brain controller machines .
For a first step they 'd like the SyNAPSE brainputers to perform " at ' mouse ' level " , then " ' cat ' level " ; but that 's just the beginning .
SyNAPSE should ultimately " scale over the entire range of mammalian intelligence " .
That would of course include Einstein , Alexander the Great , Robert Oppenheimer etc .
Against that kind of requirement , the award last week of a mere $ 4,879,333 to Big Blue appears positively stingy .
However , multiple contracts are normal in DARPA efforts of this type .
Bigger money should be forthcoming in later stages of the SyNAPSE programme , assuming it gets that far . ®
“ See , in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in , to kind of catapult the propaganda offshore . "

LOS ANGELES  Walt Disney is in .
This week the studio will break new ground by starting a campaign that boldly offers its “ Wall - E ” as a contender for the best picture Oscar , an honor never yet won by an animated film .
Warner Brothers is in , too .
That studio recently telegraphed plans for a multifront Oscar campaign for its Batman blockbuster “ The Dark Knight ” by sending awards voters a query about their preferred format for promotional DVDs .
Not to be outdone , Paramount may join the party .
Along with Marvel Enterprises , it is weighing an Oscar push for “ Iron Man ” and its lead actor , Robert Downey Jr. , even while promoting Mr. Downey as best supporting actor for his role in the DreamWorks comedy hit “ Tropic Thunder . ”
Welcome to the pop Oscars .
After years of giving plenty of running room to independent film companies or studio art house divisions that set the pace with critic - friendly but limited - audience films like last year ’s “ No Country for Old Men ” and “ There Will Be Blood , ” this year the major studios are pushing some of their biggest crowd - pleasers into the thick of the awards race .

Television networks needed a hit , and Barack Obama gave them one .
An infomercial on behalf of Mr. Obama was a smashing ratings success on Wednesday night , proving to be more popular than even the final game of the World Series  and last season ’s finale of “ American Idol . ”
The audience for Mr. Obama ’s program far exceeded the expectations of television executives  and many political pundits who questioned whether Mr. Obama was engaging in overkill in buying a half hour on so many networks .
Mr. Obama ’s 30 - minute commercial , which played on seven networks , broadcast and cable , was seen by 33.55 million viewers , according to figures released by Nielsen Media Research .
On the three broadcast networks that carried the special , the audience totaled more than 25 million , easily surpassing the number for the last World Series game on Fox , which averaged 19.8 million viewers .
The special was also available on Univision , and three cable networks , MSNBC , BET and TV One .
“ I was shocked by the number Obama was able to draw , ” said Leslie Moonves , the chairman of CBS .
“ It ’s just a stunning number . ”
On CBS , the infomercial was seen by about 8.6 million viewers , a number that topped the show CBS usually runs on Wednesday night at 8 , “ Old Christine , ” which averages about 7.2 million .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s environment chief suggested using some of the cash generated by the EU ’s landmark emissions trading scheme to tackle the loss of forests , home to half the world ’s known species and a third of its land area .
Speaking at a news conference on Friday , EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said he wanted to reduce gross tropical deforestation by at least 50 percent by 2020 and halt global forest cover loss by 2030 at the latest .
“ We are not going to have effective tackling of global warming if we do not take care of this type of activity , ” he said .
“ Without stopping deforestation , the biodiversity loss will continue ... in 10 square kilometers ’ of tropical rainforest , there are more species than in the entire EU . ”
Deforestation is responsible for almost 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and has become a key issue in the international negotiations currently under way on a new U.N. climate change agreement for the post - 2012 period .
Forests are currently disappearing at a rate of about 13 million hectares per year , about the size of Greece .
At the U.N. negotiations , Dimas said , the European Commission wanted to work toward setting up a Global Forest Carbon Mechanism ( GFCM ) , where developing countries would be rewarded for their emissions cuts achieved by actions taken to reduce deforestation .
But that would need a serious amount of funding , which could come from the proceeds of auctioning carbon permits to businesses participating in the EU ’s emissions trading scheme .
If 5 percent of this revenue were made available to the GFCM , this could raise up to 2.5 billion euros in 2020 , he said .
The Commission also wants to test whether “ deforestation credits , ” meaning carbon offsets generated from avoiding deforestation , could be used to help governments reach their post - 2012 emission reduction targets .
But this would be done under a pilot phase , and such offsets would not be available for sale to businesses involved in the EU emissions trading scheme before 2020 .
Friday ’s proposals also encouraged the use of labeling schemes to help curb the import into Europe of illegally harvested timber .
Green groups said those plans lacked teeth .
“ The Commission ’s proposal for this law will not help European consumers know if the flat - pack wardrobe they bought last Saturday is the result of forest crime , ” said Sebastien Risso , Greenpeace EU forest policy director .
Often when I think about the topic of Video Game movies , the theme song from the classic Disney film “ Beauty and the Beast ” comes to mind
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Video Game movies suck
Ok , I may have taken some liberties with the rhyming aspect of the song , but you get the point .
It has become an inevitability , a sure thing , a guarantee … if a video game based movie comes to a theater near you , it will suck .
There is n’t a lot of wiggle room here and not much compromise to be found .
In the league of making crapy movies , video game movies are currently batting 1000 .
And as I once said : : “ What is equally predictable , is that no matter how many times that proverb is proved correct , every time a new video game adaptation is announced , the lovers of that particular game pronouce “ THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT ! ” , but it never ever ever ever is .
The old chorus of “ All video game movies suck ” continues to be true . ”
With all of the excitement of Max Payne coming out soon , I thought we ’d take a short stroll down memory lane and remember just why we should never get our hopes up :
SUPER MARIO BROTHERS
Ahhh … often the first thing is a taste of what is to come .
The very first major picture based on a video game … and the stench is still lingering .
Even Dennis Hopper , John Leguizamo and Bob Hoskins could n’t save it
DOUBLE DRAGON
With the flood gates opened , Double Dragon was the next live action Video game movie on the scene just beating Street Fighter to theaters by like a month .
Only cool thing to say about this flick is that it ’s hard to believe Robert Patrick was in it just after his T - 2 days
STREET FIGHTER
I do n’t know whose brilliant idea it was to make this movie in the first place let alone make the lead character in it Guile instead of Ryu or Ken… and THEN to make Jean Claude Van Damme the American solider .
I ca n’t prove it , but I think the term “ epic fail ” may have been created just for this movie .
MORTAL KOMBAT
I do n’t which was stranger .
Casting Christopher Lambert ( who I love ) as Rayden or Bridgette Wilson as Soyna Blade .
Confession time … I LOVE this movie .
But even I ca n’t deny its complete awfulness .
Dear heavens they even made sequels .
MORTAL KOMBAT : ANNIHILATION
So let ’s take the really bad first movie , scrape together the few decent elements … throw them out the window and make a sequel !
Yay !
POKEMON : THE FIRST MOVIE
Pokemon is more a card game , but they said they based it on the video game , so we ’ll include it here .
This whole movie was like some deranged acid trip that you just could n’t come down from .
Nasty terrible movie .
WING COMMANDER
This was the first Video Game movie that pissed me off because I actually thought this one had a chance at being decent .
Instead we were served with 3 servings of ass awful with a plate of boring on the side .
And to think ..
Freddie Prinze
Jr was a hot commodity .
TOMB RAIDER
All my friends called this one “ Boob Raider ” for obvious reasons .
The first “ blockbuster ” attempt at a video game movie and to this day still probably the one that came closest to actually being ok .
It did n’t quite get there , but almost .
FINAL FANTASY : THE SPIRITS WITHIN
At the time the single most stunning and beautiful example of 3D animation ever created .
Unfortunately also one of the most incoherent and pathetic movies ever made .
It almost felt like they took 18 vodka shots and then just made the movie up as they went along .
RESIDENT EVIL
Putting hot chicks in tight and skimpy clothes armed with big guns and blades going around killing zombies sounds like a hard formula to screw up … and yet they found a way .
TOMB RAIDER : THE CRADLE OF LIFE
The first one was ALMOST an ok movie .
Add Gerard Butler and Djimon Hounsou and you ’d think that would push it into decent territory right ?
Ug. Wrong .
The franchise turned south and never recovered .
HOUSE OF THE DEAD
All hail Uwe Boll !!!
You ’d think a movie about showing up on an Island for a party only to find it infested with Zombies would jsut be a fun little easy flick right ?
HAHAHA !!
Guess not .
RESIDENT EVIL : APOCALYPSE
Studio Head : “ Hey we really screwed up the first on and we still made money !
Dress her hup in even less clothes this time , put in half the effort , make it even worse and let ’s see if we can still make profit ” .
Turns out he could .
ALONE IN THE DARK
Another entry into the Uwe Boll files .
But really … did you even have to see the name Uwe Boll to know this was going to be horrible ?
For heavens sake the name Tara Reid appears on the poster .
What more did you need to know ?
DOOM
Karl Urban and The Rock were solid cast decisions … and boy did the fan boys swear up and down that THIS was the video game movie that would rule and change the tide .
Turns out it was one of the worst ever .
Do you remember that ridiculous first person shooter view scene ?
Yikes .
BLOODRAYNE
You know , this one had some potential .
Not a bad mythology behind the main character , a cast lead by Oscar winner Ben Kingsley , and a drunk Michael Madsen running around set swinging a sword haphazardly .
However , it blew and becomes the third Uwe Boll film on this list .
SILENT HILL
Horror video game movies seem to be all the rage .
This is another one that had some potential and even started off ok , but then quickly spiraled downwards and ended up just completely nonsensical .
For a “ horror ” movie it was dreadfully non-frightening or even eerie .
DOA : DEAD OR ALIVE
This one had people talking about while it was still in production .
The hyper sexy images and clips being released turned the atmosphere of the project into one of soft - core porn instead of an action video game movie .
Nothing wrong with tits and ass and hot babes kicking copious amounts of it ( except for the tits part ) , but it would be nice if it did n’t suck .
RESIDENT EVIL : EXTINCTION
Trailers are funny things .
Even though the first two Resident Evil films sucked , the trailer for this one convinced me there may be a chance it would be ok .
Oh those evil deceptive trailers .
HITMAN
Another video game movie where the fans of the game swore up and down that THIS movie would be awesome .
Certainly cast a good lead and as many others it certainly had potential … but it failed miserably .
The one good thing I can say is that it introduced us to a very naked Olga Kurylenko , possibly one of the hottest women alive and the new James Bond girl .
IN THE NAME OF THE KING : A DUNGEON SIEGE TALE
It certainly had a decent amount of names in the cast .
Jason Statham , Ron Perlman , John Rhys - Davies , Claire Forlani , Ray Liotta , Matthew Lillard ( who was actually pretty funny in it ) , Burt Reynolds ( yes , THE Burt Reynolds ) .
You know what , it came close .
A few key changes here and there and it might have been a passable fantasy flick .
Did a few things right , but too many things wrong .
WHY DO VIDEO GAME MOVIES SUCK ?
Many game fans will often put forth ideas and theories about why all the video game movies up till this point have been poor .
The theories usually revolve around the writers or the studios … but when you have a pattern like this ( video game movies sucking ) you have to look for the common denominator .
In this case … they ’re all video game movies .
With that simple logic , I propose ( as I have many times in the past , but never in its own dedicated post ) that there in an inherent weakness with the genre itself that almost condemns these projects to certain death the moment they ’re born in a studio office .
So why do Video Game movies suck ?
Well …
# 1 – Video Games are made for gameplay , not narrative story telling
When a game developer is putting their game together , their first priority ( or at least it should be ) is gameplay .
How well does this play , how enjoyable , creative and easy is this game to operate and what will the user experience be like .
Their first priority is not to tell a 90 minute narrative story .
Yes , story plays a part of any good game , but it ’s only a side element to the over all game experience .
And really , when you break it all down there is about 10 minutes of narrative story in any given game .
People will often mistake a great “ premise ” with a great “ story ” .
They ’re two different things .
The premise of Bioshock is fantastic , but the actual amount of narrative in the game is completely minimal .
It ’s not like adapting a comic or a novel that already have massive amounts of narrative laid out that can be adapted .
Making a video game movie is basically starting from scratch with nothing but an idea for a story rather than a story itself .
# 2 – Gamers imaginations fill in the gaps
Because video games are so sparse when it comes to narrative ( and there ’s nothing wrong with that since they ’re designed for gameplay in the first place ) each fan of the game has a different notion in their minds about what would fill in the narrative gaps .
It ’s fine to make a Halo game and say Master Chief has a meeting with some Captain who has vital information … but there is no reference for that meeting , what is said in it , how it impacts the rest of the narrative or anything else for that matter .
To the game player that ’s not an issue and their own imaginations can fill in those gaps … the problem is what a movie actually DOES flesh those elements out , there is a 99 % if wo n’t match what was in the game player ’s imagination .
Now I ’m talking in generalities here , but the principle is that because the game lacks pre-existing narrative , what the fan ’s CONCEPT of what the narrative may look like is probably not what is going to manifest , thus leaving the audience wanting .
# 3 – Everyone has a different idea of what “ respect the source material ” means
This one is a common lamentation I hear from game fans when their favorite games turn out to be horrible movies .
“ They did n’t respect the source material ” .
The problem with that assertion is that … what do they mean by “ source material ” ?
This goes back again to the first point about lack of real narrative .
Since the game does n’t have it , each person will have a different idea about which elements constitute “ source material ” to them .
So what do they mean ?
Do they mean the atmosphere of the game ?
Do they mean the characters present in the game ?
Do they mean the premise of the game ?
Again , each person will have a different idea simply because the game itself does n’t provide it .
So there you have it .
Does all the preceding mean that there will never be a good video game movie ?
Not at all .
The law of averages dictates that eventually lighting will strike a monkey in the forest that no one will here fall ( or am I mixing metaphors ? ) .
At some point one has to come along to break the streak … and then maybe that movie will provide a new paradigm for the entire genre that others can then follow to continued success .
But until that day folks … assume the worst of video game movies .
Keep your expectations low and caution high .
Those that forget the past are doomed to repeat it ( in the care of Resident Evil , repeat it twice ) .
AT&T has told the Federal Communications Commission that it 's going to conduct a little experiment ( PDF ) out west .
Starting in this month , some of its customers in Reno , Nevada will be informed that their broadband will be " subject to a certain monthly usage tier for the total amount of data they may send and receive , as well as a per gigabyte charge in the event they exceed the usage tier . "
How will these lucky test consumers know when they have reached this threshold ?
Two AT&T representatives outlined the plan in a meeting held on October 30 with a legal adviser to FCC Chair Kevin Martin .
Customers will be equipped with an " online usage metering tool that displays a running total of the amount of data the customer has transmitted during a given month , " the reps explained .
If they reach 80 percent of their quota , Reno 's broadband borderliners will get a notice from AT&T about the usage tier and the charges incurred if they exceed it .
AT&T is apparently taking a page from Comcast 's book .
At the beginning of October , the US ' largest ISP instituted a 250 GB monthly bandwidth limit for its customers .
Why is AT&T experimenting with usage limits ?
" A small minority of our broadband Internet access customers consume a disproportionately large amount of the total bandwidth available to all of the customers on our network , " AT&T explained .
So something has to be done " to equitably provide affordable broadband services to all of our customers . "
An AT&T spokesperson told Ars that as few as five percent of all customers account for almost half of the total bandwidth consumed .
Being the nice company that AT&T is , however , the first time that a Reno resident goes over the line , they wo n't get dinged , financially speaking .
" Only after the second time the customer exceeds the applicable monthly usage tier will the customer be subject to additional per-gigabyte charges , " the telco explained to the FCC .
And in the spirit of choice , the ISP giant is making the usage tier experience optional , if you call having to quit the service an option .
" In the event a new or existing customer does not want to participate in the trial , we will permit the customer to cancel their broadband Internet access service without an early termination penalty . "
Most AT&T customers are on month - to - month plans without early termination fees anyway , the filing says .
This provision would mostly apply to customers on term plans who decide that they do n't want to be a member of the brave new usage tier vanguard .
If they recently signed a new contract , they 've got 30 days to get out .
Slowly but surely AT&T is making it clear to its broadband customers that they now live in an Age of Limits .
In early September , the company informed the FCC that U - Verse buyers would soon receive new Terms of Service indicating that , in pursuit of optimal video performance , their high speed Internet throughput rates " may be temporarily reduced when a customer is using other U - verse services in a manner that requires high bandwidth . "
This might take place with " higher speed Internet access products , " the new language will disclose .
Thus :
" It may be necessary , for some AT&T High Speed Internet users , for AT&T to set a maximum downstream speed on a customer line to enhance the reliability and consistency of performance . "
Capacity speed , however , will never drop below the tier level that the customer has purchased .
O.K. , the debate ’s over , so the debates will begin .
The first big topic on the Web seems a holdover from the foreign policy debate , Pakistan :
Here ’s Lisa Schiffren at the Corner :
“ Obama ’s explication is sound , but he did call for invading an ally , which was pretty offensive .
McCain was right , too .
Pakistan is so complicated and difficult that a lot of explaining is necessary , and there really is n’t a clear way to fix the problem .
Obama is wrong to blame Pakistan ’s contempt for us on our support for Musharaff .
Pakistan has come to despise us over 25 years , regardless of whether we supported the dictator or the opposition at any moment , or whether we gave them money and arms or embargoed it all .
Their politics toward us stem from their domestic politics , and the encroachment of fundamentalist Islam in their fragmented , impovershed culture .
While I agree 1000 % with McCain that we should not have abandoned Afghanistan in 1989 , that nation is so fragmented and torn that it is not at all clear it can be put back together again .
Morass .
Swamp .
Eater of Western armies .
Yet we have learned that we ca n’t afford to let it become a vacuum , as these failed states do , which serves as a breeding ground for terror .
So , we only have bad choices there , and steadiness and dealing from strength seem key . ”
Her colleague Kathryn Jean Lopez , however , thinks Obama stumbled on that topic :
“ When Obama says Pock - i - stahn I have an uncontrollable urge to read the New Yorker and find some Chardonnay .
Fortunately I have an old copy of NR and a Coors Light to snap me back to reality .
Seriously though — no one in flyover country says Pock - i - stahn .
It ’s annoying . ”
And here ’s Mark Murray at NBC ’s First Read :
“ McCain said : ‘ Sen . Obama likes to talk loudly .
In fact , he wants to announce that he ’s going to attack Pakistan — remarkable . ’
But this is what Obama said originally on August 1 , 2007 : ‘ There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans .
They are plotting to strike again .
It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership meeting in 2005 .
If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf will not act , we will . ’
It ’s worth noting that Palin — on at least two occasions — seemed to back Obama on this issue . ”
And Noam Scheiber at the New Republic thinks Obama controlled the issue : “ Devastating .
The ‘ bomb - bomb - bomb Iran ’ / ’ annihilation of North Korea ’ / ’ next stop Baghdad ’ 1 - 2 - 3 punch was an absolute body blow .
What is McCain thinking by trying to make this ‘ talk softly ’ case ?
On top of which , Obama gave off a subconscious ‘ strength ’ vibe by straight - arming McCain when he tried to interrupt . ”
O.K. , but what about issues that voters , um , really care about ?
Dana Goldstein at Tapped looks at the big picture :
During the first half hour of this debate , I thought we were finally going to see the truth at the heart of the conventional wisdom : John McCain did seem better at the town hall style than Barack Obama .
McCain used the old five - paragraph essay trick : restating the question at the beginning of his answers , which made him seem engaged with the interlocutor .
McCain more often addressed the question - askers by name , and his silly “ my friends ” tic seemed more natural in this setting .
Obama did seem , yes , professorial .
Yet Obama found his sea legs after the first half hour .
When he spoke about civilian national service and expanding the peace corps , “ so military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden , ” he articulated his own “ country first ” ideology .
On energy , Obama actually said straight out that Americans would have to change their lifestyles to fight global warming , from driving fuel efficient cars to weatherizing their homes .
( It would have been even better if he had actually uttered the words “ drive less . ” )
The clearest win of the night was for Obama on health care ; while McCain told Tom Brokaw that health insurance is a “ responsibility , ” Obama said matter - of - factly that health care is “ a right , ” and that it is shameful that in the United States , cancer patients are forced to fight their insurance companies for coverage .
This is an issue on which American simply agree with Obama and disagree with McCain , who was unable to clearly explain the tax mechanics of his own health plan .
This debate was a tedious , awkward rehashing of what was covered in the last match - up between these two .
But in the face of this economic crisis , the attacks and theatrics are simply fading from view .
Issues profoundly matter , and they ’re breaking for Obama .
James Fallows at the Atlantic is on the same page .
From a horse - race perspective , John McCain came in behind and losing ground , in the middle of a financial / economic panic that works against him , and therefore needing a big win .
This meant either damaging and flummoxing Obama , or so outshining him in audience rapport , mastery of policy , and empathetic connection through the camera , that the debate could be presented as a turning point .
None of that happened .
( McCain ’s best performance was at the end , rejecting a “ Yes / No ” question on whether Russia is an “ evil empire . ” )
At this stage in the race , a tie goes to leader , and this was not a tie .
And so is Taegan Goddard :
Tonight ’s debate was n’t even close .
Sen . Barack Obama ran away with it — particularly when speaking about the economy and health care .
Talking about his mother ’s death from cancer was very powerful .
On nearly every issue , Obama was more substantive , showed more compassion and was more presidential .
In contrast , Sen. John McCain was extremely erratic .
Sometimes he was too aggressive ( referring to Obama as “ that one . ” )
Other times , he just could n’t answer the question ( on how he would ask Americans to sacrifice . )
And his random attempts at jokes ( hair transplants ? ) were just bad .
Tom Brokaw was terrible as moderator .
His fixation with the rules — particularly when the candidates were not complaining — was distracting and a disservice to everyone .
The format did n’t work very well , but Brokaw made it worse .
And Andrew Sullivan piles on :
This was , I think , a mauling : a devastating and possibly electorally fatal debate for McCain .
Even on Russia , he sounded a little out of it .
I ’ve watched a lot of debates and participated in many .
I love debate and was trained as a boy in the British system to be a debater .
I debated dozens of times at Oxofrd .
All I can say is that , simply on terms of substance , clarity , empathy , style and authority , this has not just been an Obama victory .
It has been a wipe - out .
It has been about as big a wipe - out as I can remember in a presidential debate .
It reminds me of the 1992 Clinton - Perot - Bush debate .
I do n’t really see how the McCain campaign survives this .
What about conservative partisans ?
Michael Graham at the Corner wo n’t say McCain won , only that we all lost :
It was n’t a debate — there was no “ debating . ”
It was n’t a town hall — the people did n’t speak .
It was n’t an interview — there were virtually no follow - ups .
It was n’t a contest of ideas .
The two “ contestants ” shared most of the same ideas .
This was a lost 90 minutes out of my life , and a huge , irreplaceable , lost opportunity for the McCain campaign .
Why is it that a maverick like McCain allowed himself to be led by the nose like this ?
And his Corner colleague Bill Whittle finds fault in the format .
Nothing tonight on abortion , on corruption , on “ associates . ”
I agree with Ramesh that selection bias is no excuse for McCain performing poorly , but he performed better on foreign policy .
The things that will ( should have said “ would ” ) have hit Obama in the polls were subjects that were not raised tonight and I see no reason to think they will be raised next time .
The news wo n’t cover these issues .
It has to come out in the debates .
And I do n’t see much chance that we will see that next time .
This was not a great night for our team .
It ’s up to the 527 ’s now I think .
I do n’t know how else to get the negatives about Obama out there .
Well , I guess we have that to look forward to .
The Opinionator bids you a good night .
Sentence by sentence , Kate Underwood dissected a letter between Cicero and Atticus of ancient Rome .
With each word , the 12th - grader translated Latin into English .
It was the latest assignment for her advanced Latin class this week at St. Thomas Academy in Mendota Heights .
“ People do n’t understand why you would take Latin , because it is a dead language , ” said Underwood , 18 , who attends Convent of the Visitation School and takes Latin at St. Thomas .
Her response : Latin literature is classic .
Students across the country are resurrecting the so - called dying language as a way to improve their vocabulary , grades and standardized test scores .
Long favored by exclusive East Coast schools , Latin has become a popular addition at schools nationwide .
The ancient language is being taught as early as third grade in public , charter and private metro- area schools , and enrollment is growing .
Enrollment in Minnesota Latin classes rose 65 percent between the 2000 - 01 and 2006 - 07 school years , according to a state Department of Education survey .
It was one of the fastest - growing languages to study in the state .
“ I ’m intrigued by the modern resurgence of Latin , ” said Brian Bloomfield , director of curriculum and instruction at Nova Classical Academy , a St. Paul charter school .
The K - 12 public school with 406 students begins Latin classes in third grade .
School officials believe Latin is one reason the school has a 300 - student waiting list .
“ Everyone is really excited about it , ” Bloomfield said .
Third - graders start by learning Latin verb tenses , which they pick up in chants and songs .
They also find similarities in Latin and English nouns , such as manus , which means hand .
Teachers explain how manus led to English words like manual .
“ ( Students ) get a kick out of it , ” Bloomfield said .
St. Paul ’s Central High School also offers two Latin classes , beginning and advanced , with an average of 25 students in each , Latin teacher Craig Wolke said .
St. Thomas Academy , a private all - boys Catholic high school , experienced a 47 percent increase in Latin enrollment three years ago , said teacher Mitch Taraschi .
At that time , class numbers jumped from 67 students in the 2004 - 05 school year to 99 the following year .
Since then , enrollment has remained steady at 87 pupils for about six Latin classes .
Students often choose Latin as a foreign language because their parents encourage it , because Latin can help them in careers like medicine or law or because college admissions processes tend to favor it , Taraschi said .
Knowledge of the language can give medical and law students an edge , because both professions deal in Latin terms .
Most remember it as a bland , academically snooty subject , but Latin class has changed since the 1960s .
Teachers and students speak Latin in class more than before .
And teachers now incorporate tales of Roman civilization and history into their lessons , said Marty Abbott , director of education for the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages , based in Alexandria , Va .
On Monday , Taraschi started an eighth - grade beginners ’ class by chanting the “ Lord ’s Prayer ” prayer in Latin — required learning by the end of the semester .
The prayer is a favorite for grandparents at family dinners , Taraschi said .
The students then took turns translating the story of the Trojan Horse , from the Latin poet Virgil ’s epic , “ The Aeneid . ”
Eighth - grader Joseph Weichert , 13 , said learning the language has helped him with English vocabulary .
He hopes Latin also will help with standardized tests .
An estimated 60 percent of English vocabulary derives from Latin , Abbott said .
Latin students tend to have better analytical and grammar skills .
They also find it easier to learn other romance languages such as Spanish and French .
That ’s another reason Underwood was attracted to the language .
“ It ’s a basis of so many other languages I want to go into , ” said Underwood , who plans to major in French and Italian in college .
“ They cross a lot . ”

25 - foot maze in a 24 - foot house : how I solved the world 's longest picture maze in 6 months
New to this website ?
If you enjoy playing brain games online , do n't forget to check our huge selection of free puzzles .
I have always been a puzzle person since I was a little boy .
There was just something about watching a picture develop out of chaos that was really intriguing to me .
I also always liked the idea of “ progress ” in doing some crazy - big 5,000 piece puzzle : only 3,000 more pieces to go , only 1,000 more , 100 pieces , done !
So , it was a no - brainer when I saw the Mount Everest of mazes with The 25 - Foot - Long Picture Maze .
This had everything that I wanted .
It was huge , a real monster , I could watch the picture emerge from this just like a picture puzzle , and most importantly to me now as a busy person , I could work on it in small 10 minute a day sessions .
I started the maze in early January of 2008 .
I had roughly ten minutes each evening right after dinner that allowed me to whittle it down .
I have to admit , the first few feet were a bit intimidating , the remaining uncompleted maze just stared blankly back at me .
Every couple of feet I would show my wife the recent addition to the picture , and then I would move on to the next scene .
I slowly started getting more and more feet of the maze behind me and less in front .
In early July , 2008 I finished the puzzle !
I wore out three pens
It was at that point that I realized I had not seen the entire puzzle at one time , after all 25 feet is quite long .
So I decided to lay it out in the living room and dining room , which was no small feat , since the house is only 24 feet at its longest .
So I snapped some pictures of the maze as well .
No one shot can do it justice , so I simply shot the pictures to gain the best visual effect of the length of the maze .
I am sure that some people would have used pencil , then re-traced in ink to finalize the maze .
I really did not want to do it twice , so I was very careful to follow each and every blind alley with my finger before inking the next segment .
Most of the blind alleys were mercifully short , although there were some real doozies too .
There were a few nights where I only filled in one segment because I spent my entire ten minutes following some painfully long blind alley .
I wore out three pens filling in the maze as well .
The time , the pens , the crossed - eyes from following blind alleys , were all worth it when it was done .
Now , I need somebody to create a 50 foot maze !

More than 400,000 people are poisoned by snakebites every year , based on a review of reports from around the world , Reuters reports .
The death toll could be as high as 94,000 , however , since the bites are n't always reported .
Snake venom is a complex thing .
Scientists recently found that it varies more than expected by location and the age of the snake .
So antivenoms , the drugs created to combat snake bites in humans , may not always work as expected .
A study in 2006 found human immune cells responsible for runny noses and itchy eyes could help protect us against the venom of certain snakes .

The majority of adults who describe themselves as unaffiliated — about 12 % of the adult population overall — is made up of people who simply describe their religion as “ nothing in particular . ”
About half of these people ( 6.3 % of the overall adult population ) say that religion is not too important or not at all important in their lives .
Thus , they can be thought of as being mostly secular in their orientation .
But the other half of this group ( 5.8 % of adults ) says that religion is somewhat important or very important in their lives , despite their lack of affiliation with any particular religious group .
Thus , this group can be thought of as the “ religious unaffiliated . ”

I work for a major health care reform advocacy organization that has spent the much of the last two years planning for the next 200 days .
The fight for comprehensive reform has been long and hard , to little positive result .
But we felt really , really good about it all summer long , especially ( though we were n’t not allowed to say it publicly ) in the case of an Obama win .
The financial crisis changed everything , obviously .
In our weekly meetings to plan for the transition , the immediate reaction from our more well - connected consultants was that comprehensive reform was off the table entirely , and the new president and Congress would be forced to opt for a piecemeal approach over the first six to ten months of the administration would start with an emergency increase in FMAP , the federal matching program for Medicaid , since state budgets have mostly evaporated .
An SCHIP expansion would follow soon after , and potential courses of action then branched out into Part D- tweaking , health IT , and possibly incremental increases to Medicaid .
A couple things have changed since then , however .
Baucus ’ bill is a step in the right direction , Obama has seemed to signal that he is n’t afraid to spend aggressively in a recession if it helps the economy .
( In a series of strategy sessions we had this week , we discussed the challenge of convincing the public that additional spending is justified when they see a trillion dollar deficit on the evening news .
Democrats and prgoressives should hammer home that meme as much as possible : spending is necessary in a recession , even in deficit ; it helps jumpstart the economy .
It ’s going to come down to a whip count in the Senate .
If Baucus ’ bill has legs , they should move on it quickly , before the honeymoon is over and Senate Republicans have the balls to use a filibuster .

Emergency rescue plan passed after six - hour debate by 74 to 25 and will now go back to House of Representatives
The US Senate voted comfortably in favour of the Bush administration 's contentious $ 700 bn bail - out of the banking industry early this morning , bringing the package back to life after a bitter week of political wrangling and wild gyrations in financial markets .
After a six - hour debate , the emergency rescue plan was passed by 74 to 25 .
The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , said : " I 'm very , very happy .
This is a good vote . "
The bill is expected to go back to the House of Representatives tomorrow , where Republican and Democratic leaders hope to reverse Monday 's shock vote against its progress .
The upper chamber 's approval will come as a relief to George Bush whose authority has been severely tested by Congress 's rebellion .
Global financial markets have been volatile throughout the week and financial institutions have been struggling to stay afloat on both sides of the Atlantic .
The two candidates vying for the US presidency , Barack Obama and John McCain , both broke off the campaign trail to cast their first votes in the chamber for months .
" This plan is not perfect .
Democrats and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it , " Obama told his fellow senators .
" But it 's clear from my perspective that this is what we have to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe . "
Since it was rejected by the House earlier in the week , the plan has been sweetened with measures to appease doubters .
The core proposal still authorises the treasury to spend billions of dollars cleaning up the balance sheets of struggling banks by buying up moribund mortgage - related securities .
But it has grown from its original three pages to 451 pages .
In its new form , the plan will increase protection for US bank customers by raising the limit of a federal guarantee on deposit accounts from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
Another amendment extends energy - related tax breaks for businesses - a measure intended to win over Republican free - market critics but which has rankled some on the left who see it as a nod to commerce rather than to struggling homeowners .
There are still staunch hold - outs in both parties .
Bill Nelson , a Democratic senator from Florida , argued that it hardly does anything to help those facing foreclosure on predatory sub - prime mortgages .
" This bill sends a message to Wall Street that if you play fast and loose in the name of short - term profits , the government will make up your losses , " said Nelson .
But Lindsay Graham , a Republican , argued that the alternative was to allow credit to become so expensive that " Americans are not going to be able to borrow a dime " .
He said : " If you think this costs a lot now , just do nothing and then see what it costs . "
Many Congressional figures say they have detected a change in the mood of constituents towards grudging acceptance of the bailout , partly prompted by this week 's plunge in Wall Street stock prices .
A long - time critic of the plan , Republican senator Joe Barton of Texas , said the balance of calls to his office from voters had shifted from 60 - 40 opposed to the package to 70 - 30 in favour of it .
A glut of dismal economic statistics has given fresh impetus for action .
New data yesterday showed a slump in manufacturing activity , a dive in car sales and soaring job losses .
The world 's richest man , Warren Buffett , has likened the situation to an " economic Pearl Harbour " .
Some 14 high - street banks in the US have already gone bust this year and investment houses Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns have fallen victim to the crisis .
But on the streets outside Congress , noisy protesters demonstrated against the bailout .
Jobs With Justice , a workers ' rights group , held rallies outside Washington branches of Bank of America and Citibank .
Sarcastically dubbing themselves " billionaires for the bailout " , they chanted : " We broke it , you fix it . "

In a little - noticed comment over the weekend , MSNBC commentator Joe Scarborough said Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) had two things to fear -- complacency by supporters given his wide lead in the polls , and a " ghost in the machine . "
" Polls are getting hard to read at this point , " MSNBC 's Mika Brzezinski remarked on Sunday 's edition of Morning Joe .
" Well , they are because they 're all , almost all in Barack Obama 's corner at this point so if you are the Barack Obama campaign you really only have two things to worry about , " Scarborough replied .
" One , complacency on part of your supporters which can be very , very damaging impact on the campaign or number two , that there 's a ghost in the machine .
That somehow these polls are going to be incorrect like the polls that assured Barack Obama was going to lock up the Democratic nomination after New Hampshire .
" Of course we know that did n't happen , " Scarborough added .
" So ... "
Voting rights advocates worry that electronic voting remains highly insecure .
Last Friday , RAW STORY published a diagram of computer schematics used by Ohio's Republican Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell , that routed county - level voting results through the Tennessee company that would later handle the infamous " GWB43.com " email accounts -- the same accounts the Bush Administration used to send political correspondence beneath the radar .
As many as five million of the emails were " lost , " according to the Republican National Committee .
The domain was discovered as part of an investigation into the firing of eight US Attorneys .
Added Scarborough : " Outside of that though , the landscape looks awfully blue for Tuesday .
It looks like possible a Barack Obama landslide , again , unless those polls are off three , four , five points . "

A number of public officials and the founders of Google assembled at Grand Central Terminal on Tuesday to announce the start of New York ’s version of Google Transit , an online feature that they said would transform the experience of navigating New York City ’s transit system , the nation ’s busiest .
“ It is a very complicated transit system , and it just got less complicated today with the advent of Google Maps for transit , ” Gov. David A. Paterson said , noting that the subway system opened with 9.1 miles of lines in 1904 , and that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority now serves a territory of 5,000 square miles .
The array of public officials present reflected Google ’s economic might , particularly at a time when Wall Street ’s convulsions have left the city and state economy reeling .
Not only did the governor and leaders of the transportation authority attend the Grand Central news conference , but so , too , did Deputy Mayor Edward Skyler , representing the Bloomberg administration , and officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and of New Jersey Transit .
“ It just gives me great personal pleasure to be able to help even in a tiny way this fantastic public transportation system , ” Sergey Brin , one of Google ’s founders , said at the news conference .
The company ’s other founder , Larry Page , said he even hoped the tool would “ help congestion , help the economy over all . ”
Word is that Dell 's Mini 9 is a modder 's paradise , rife with precious little alcoves in which to squeeze teeny - tiny new stuff .
The confirmation : MyDellMini forum user Tom Beauchamp bought a USB GPS receiver ( not much larger than a quarter ) and snugly fit it inside his Mini 's case .
He 's provided images and instructions so you , too , can illegally navigate with your notebook computer in the passenger 's seat of your car .
We can't recommend that sort of irresponsibility , but if you want to mod it just because you can , hit the read link for the instructions and images .
Beware , of course , that a minimum amount of technical savvy is required to avoid breaking a perfectly good little laptop .
Like that was ever going to stop you .
In this post on Graceless Failures , John Kalucki points out that Scala 's RichString and Java 's String are completely uncomparable .
Neither the == operator nor the equals method return correct equality when comparing RichInt with Integer either .
Kalucki's conclusion is to avoid RichStrings when possible , and coerce any back to String as soon as possible .
I 've bumped into this sort of thing a bit too often when writing Scala , and find it frustrating .
The extensions to basic classes done in Scala work against the powerful typing system in my opinion , and the result is impedence rather than clarity .
At the time of this writing the only reply is from Martin Odersky , stating that this problem is going to be solved in version 2.8.0 .
I find it interesting that he views this as a language level problem .
To a degree , it obviously is .
If the language did something that made Java primitive boxing classes and Scala Rich primitives directly comparable , the problem would be solved .
This neglects the correct tool for the job , something that Scala design tends to do because of its focus on language level solutions .
To me , the reliance on Java types implies a lack of appropriate Scala libraries and Scala library wrappers .
One of the advantages of Scala is living in the Java ecosystem , but since Scala has its own idiomatic styles , we 're generally better off wrapping Java libraries in Scala code so that they appear to the user as Scala styled libraries .
This might seem like a waste of time and effort , but the upshot is worth it .
The client code becomes cleaner , more Scala - like and easier to read since it does n't expend noise on working around Java / Scala integration issues .
However , as Martin Odersky 's comment implies , the Scala research team intends to continue playing whack - a- mole with language design to make Java and Scala completely interoperable ( or something ) .
This is natural , solving these problems at a language level is much more interesting than writing libraries and wrapper APIs .
But that does n't mean it 's more useful .
And while the Rich primitives are one example of such a problem , it 's far from the only one .
The Scala collections library is horrendously incompatible with the Java collections , and with good reason .
I would never want an implicit conversion to change the semantics of my underlying types !
RichStrings and Strings may be semantically alike , but a Scala immutable Set and a Java Set are not .
( Yes , I could make the Java Set immutable , but I 've yet to encounter the Java library that returns immutable collections . )
If Scala is to gain more mainstream adoption , development on libraries and frameworks needs to be the next big push , not further language improvements .
This is , I guess , the disadvantage of a research institution driving development .
We can rely on the EPFL continuing to work on and maintain Scala , but unlike a business value oriented company like Sun , we can't rely on them taking on tasks without research value .
This is n't a completely bleak situation though , since this is open sourced software , the Scala community can take action and make the necessary push .
Scala needs its own ecosystem .
In the long run we just can't rely on the Java ecosystem , because there 's too much cognitive dissonance going on .
If you are like billions of other world citizens , you might be concerned about the economy of your particular country .
Never fear , the Fed is here !
The Federal Reserve announced today that they will be setting up a Relief Operation for poorly run businesses .
Not just any poorly run business , but those businesses that are poorly run and who have sucked some of the members of the Federal Reserve in with them .
You see , the Federal Reserve is bailing out only the biggest institutions , because that is where the Federal Reserve has their 401k plan .
You may be struggling to understand the current bailout , I shall clear that up forthwith .
Recently , I had a problem .
I was about to be overdrawn in one of my checking accounts .
I needed $ 500 immediately and it was 5 days until payday .
In another out of state account , I had exactly .12 cents .
So I , using the logic of the Federal Reserve , bailed me out .
I wrote a check from the out of state bank that had .12 cents in it .
The check I wrote was for $ 500 .
Why would I write a check for $ 500 when I only had .12 cents in the account you might ask ?
Very simple .
I needed the money .
Now I deposited this check into the soon to be overdrawn account and my bank immediately gave me a positive balance of $ 500 .
Real money , backed up by my personal check , wink wink .
Then I overnighted a personal check from the newly replenished account to my account that was soon to be overdrawn by almost $ 500 .
My .12 cent account soon showed a balance of $ 500.12 .
Neither check was good and both were fine .
Why ?
Because the bank gave me credit for the checks and it would take 3 - 4 business days for the funds to clear and by that time , my paycheck would arrive to cover the transactions .
Why did I tell you this ?
Because this is the bailout in simple terms .
The Federal Reserve has agreed to loan money that they just printed , ( similar to my hot check for $ 500 ) anyway , they agreed loan to the businesses who had a bunch of worthless loans , ( similar to my account that was about to be overdrawn ) all the money that said businesses needed to appear solid as a rock again .
In return , the Federal Reserve got to claim any one of several very important assests as collateral .
Assets used as Collateral in the Bailouts
Defaulted Loans – Listed as assets , but worth less than the stated value because they are listed at the loaned price rather than the market value , ie housing market .
These include real estate foreclosures , business assets like staplers and paperclips and of course receivables , ( the customers who could n't pay on time )
With foreign banks – The Federal Reserve traded U.S. Dollars that they had just printed in return for that country 's currency ( that they had just printed ) as collateral .
So the asset guaranteeing those loans is the currency of each of the countries where the loan was made .
We can rest assured that the currency that the Federal Reserve now holds from foreign banks is solid as a rock , because they are guaranteed by U.S. Dollars owned by those foreign banks .
So as you can tell , the Federal Reserve is taking care of business .
The problem is that eventually , one of their paychecks is n't going to come in to cover the shell game they have been playing .
My financial advice to you ?
Always have at least two checking accounts !
That way you can write hot checks from one to the other until your paycheck shows up .
And if you are ever questioned about your shady banking practices , do n't hire a lawyer , just take a newspaper to court with you .
Preferrably the financial section .

i Phone users jumped for joy Thursday night , when , for a brief time , they were able to download a tethering application made by Nullriver called Netshare for $ 9.99 that allowed them to marry their iPhone ’s 3G Net access to their computer .
However , the application was removed from the iTunes App Store within hours of its debut , and as of this writing there is no sign of Netshare on the App Store .
When Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 3G at WWDC in June , he proudly showed how 3G speeds were approaching those of Wi-Fi , but AT&T quickly said it would n’t allow the iPhone 3G to be tethered .
Why AT&T kiboshed the idea of the iPhone as a tethered handset is unclear as the company does allow other handsets to be used for tethering .
Furthermore , how did Apple let this app get online at all since all applications in the App store must be vetted and pre-approved by Apple before getting into the store ?
Did Apple simply just let one slip pass the goalie ?
Nullriver , the company that created the application , posted a note on the Macrumors forum , stating that it is not sure why Apple removed the application .
According to Nullriver , Netshare did not violate any of Apple ’s developer or App Store agreements .
So far Apple has not responded to Nullriver ’s inquiries as to why the application was removed .
Update from Macworld.com : On Friday afternoon , after we posted this PC World blog entry , NetShare reappeared on the App Store .
Two Macworld.com staffers were able to download the $ 10 application .

The New Zealand Government has followed Australia in guaranteeing all bank deposits for the next two years .
Prime Minister Helen Clark says she wants to assure New Zealanders their bank deposits are safe .
All mainstream banks , credit unions , building societies and finance companies which accept deposits are covered by the scheme .
It is free for financial institutions with deposits up to $ 5 billion .
Justin Kerr from New Zealand 's Financial Services Federation says it is good news .
" I think the move , together with Australia , is a good thing as far as our two countries are concerned to be seen to be acting together in the same way at the same time , " he said .
With less than four weeks until the election , Ms Clark has outlined a detailed spending plan designed to stimulate the economy .
It includes building projects and spending on infrastructure .

The California suburbs around Los Angeles are filled with foreclosed houses - and in each one , entrepreneur Ramon Mercado sees opportunity .
Mercado is the owner of Miss Junk , a 20 - person trash - hauling company .
Launched late last year , Miss Junk began as a general junk - removal service , but it quickly settled into a niche assisting banks and realtors with foreclosure cleanups .
" We 've seen our company grow exponentially because of this demand , " Mercado says .
A former real estate broker , Mercado is generating monthly revenue of around $ 150,000 right now from Miss Junk , ten times the company 's initial monthly sales .
" Foreclosures are the biggest , most profitable jobs we do . "
" There has been a definite increase in activity in this area , " says Cary Eckert , president of Realty World , a real - estate brokerage in Granada Hills , Calif. , who has contracted Miss Junk for a number of jobs .
This month is Realty World 's busiest yet ; with only nine employees , Eckert is currently juggling six foreclosure assignments .
Dustin Owens OMAC
Hauling , which serves southwestern Ohio , has also seen a business boom .
" We have seen a flood of foreclosures in the last two years , and are not seeing an end in sight , " says Owens , who started his company in 1992 .
He estimates that 80 % of his current assignments are foreclosure cleanups - and it 's paying off .
His revenue is up 12 % from last year 's $ 1 million .
Picking through the rubble of abandoned homes is daunting both physically and psychologically .
" Sometimes it feels disrespectful going in and getting rid of people 's personal things .
Some of my guys have a real hard time with it , but someone has to do it , and we are learning how to handle it , " says Miss Junk 's Mercado .
His crews often arrive to find tableaus of interrupted living : meals still on tables , shoes and socks scattered around .
" It 's like they were just there , and now they 're gone , " he says .
Owens of OMAC Hauling agrees .
" The thing that amazes me most is that more often than not , the people seem to leave with only the shirts on their backs , " he says .
" They leave their baby and family pictures , their furniture , appliances , the baby 's toys , even their vehicles - everything . "
Part of real - estate broker Eckert 's job is assessing the value of items left behind .
If the items are collectively worth more than $ 300 , owners are given a few days or weeks to return and collect them , but they never do , in Eckert 's experience .
" People either take everything or leave everything , " he says .
" If they left them there in the first place , they wo n't be back to claim them later . "
The cleanup specialists have turned up some treasures in their excavations .
Eckert recently found a 20 - foot - long , 8 - foot tall shrine to the Dalai Lama in one house , while Owens ' discoveries include an Italian painting from 1860 appraised at $ 11,000 , old coin collections , a set of Colt revolvers from 1929 , stamp collections , more than 1,000 Hot Wheels cars , and 200 Pez dispensers .
He 's even found diamond wedding rings : " I think homeowners go through a divorce along with the foreclosure and toss the rings . "
Miss Junk and OMAC
Hauling donate any valuable items they find to charity , but other junk companies have turned scavenging into a supplemental revenue stream .
Zzazz Industries , a family - run junk removal business based in Fontana , Calif. , holds garage sales to sell leftover items found in foreclosed homes , and recycles any metal and plastic items left behind .
" People leave the stuff they can do without , so just by recycling old lamps or chairs we find , we can bring in around $ 1,200 per year from this alone - and anything helps , " says Frank Gallardo , who started Zzazz Industries in October 2007 .
Ironically , Gallardo was himself evicted from his home : Right around the time he started Zzazz , he was booted from a rental home the landlord had n't told him was in foreclosure .
" I can relate to what people are going through , " he says .

If you ever wanted to home brew your own wine but thought it seemed too complicated here is a great way to get a first batch going with very little fuss and very little cost .
You wo n’t have to order anything special and in no time at all you will have about four bottles of wine that you made yourself .
First let ’s take a trip to the supermarket .
Does this cheap , easy and fast recipe really work ?
It sure does .
I got an email from somebody who tried it .
Here is a quote of what he had to say about this process : " Will ,
After reading your page I was inspired to try making mead .
It looked so simple .
Besides the store bought mead that we can buy around Minneapolis does n't even taste like mead .
I just have to say that I used your suggested method of making mead and was shocked .
I made sure I bought only things available in my local Cub super market and I created 3 one gallon batches , one with vanilla , one with mint and one with pomegranate juice .
I substituted apple juice for some of the water also .
The result after 6 months was 3 batches of clear mead that tasted great .
I did add a few tablespoons of honey into each bottle at the end to give it a little raw sweetness .
The taste is very similar to the mead sold at a local fair for $ 5 a 6 ounce glass , where my mead only cost me about 50 cents for the same glass full .
My friends that are " Mead Masters " are amazed that I got the results I did without any boiling , chemicals , carboys , airlocks or expensive yeasts .
In fact one friend was so impressed that he gave me a five gallon carboy and airlock so I can use the recipe on a larger scale .

Here is a picture of everything you need .
This pic was submitted by Andy who is now officially a Mead Maker .
Thanks Andy !
Ingredients List to purchase from the Supermarket : 1 Gallon of Spring Water ( room temperature , do not get refrigerated )
3 pounds of honey – pure unprocessed
1 bag of balloons big enough to stretch over the mouth of the spring water jug
1 package of Fleishmann ’s Yeast
1 box of raisins
1 Orange
Here are some suggestions for variations in this recipe
If you can't get Fleishmann 's Yeast here are some perfectly suitable alternates : Narbonne Yeast ( Lalvin 71B - 1122 ) , Lalvin D - 47 , or Montpelier Lalvin ( K1V - 1116 )
If you would like to add a bit of spice to this recipe you could add 1 or 2 cloves .
But be careful , they are very strong so do n't put more than 2 .
How to make the Mead Pour about half of the water into a clean container then slice up your orange into eighth ’s and put the slices , honey , twenty - five raisins , and the yeast into the jug .
Pour some water back into the jug so the level is a couple of inches from the top then put the cap on it and shake it up well .
If you can , you should shake it for a good five minutes .
This will aerate the mixture .
The yeast really needs lots of oxygen to grow vigorously .
Now poke a pinhole in the top of the balloon , remove the cap from your jug and put the balloon right over the mouth of the jug .
Stretch the open end of the balloon right over the jug so that as the gases form inside the jug they will inflate the balloon .
Put a rubber band or tape around the neck to keep it firmly in place - if it feels like it might come off .
Leave it out on a counter for the first day so you can monitor it .
( Note :
The balloon can age and oxidize over time so you should inspect it regularly to make sure it does n't break down and develop cracks .
If it seems like it is breaking down replace it with a new balloon ! -
My thanks to Tim for submitting this tip )
What will happen next ?
Somewhere between an hour and twenty - four hours later the balloon will start to inflate .
This is a great sign and it means that your yeast is transforming the contents of the jug into wine .
Gases are forming inside the jug and are escaping through the pinhole .
This setup insures gases escape but no contaminants get into your brew .
If the balloon is getting big you may need to poke another hole or two in it .
You do n’t want it to burst .
It would leave your mead open to contamination .
Once you are satisfied that the gases are escaping and the balloon is not under unusual stress you can set the jug in a cool dry place like a kitchen cabinet or closet shelf .
Check on it every day if you can just to make sure it is ok and the balloon has n’t popped off .
After two to three weeks the major portion of the ferment will be done and the balloon will be limp .
At this point you can taste a little bit to see how it is coming along but it is n’t really a tasty wine at this point .
It will need another couple of months to start to get delicious .
Over time , as you check on it you will notice that the cloudiness disappears and it slowly clarifies and transforms into wine .
The Orange and the raisins can stay in the mixture for the whole duration but if you want to make the mead a little milder and help it clarify faster you can transfer the liquid into another gallon jug and place the balloon on that one .
This would be after the two to three week ferment period has completed .
This process is called racking and it will move your mead along nicely .
Here is a picture of the completed batch .
Now it is time to just sit back and watch the yeast do its thing !
Pic submitted by Andy .
Some Tips
You can make the honey easier to pour by letting it stand in a sink or bowl of warm water .
And you can experiment with the flavor a bit by adding a cinnamon stick or a pinch of nutmeg to the batch when you add the orange .
Do n’t leave out the raisins .
They are not there for taste .
They are a necessary food for the yeast because honey is a bit low in the nutrients that yeast like .
If the honey is a bit expensive you can cut this down to two pounds .
Any quantity between two and three and a half pounds will work well and the more honey you put the sweeter the mead will be .
But , the more honey you put the longer it will take to mature .
Finally
Be patient and taste your mead every few weeks .
It should be really clear and delicious after a few months .
It will continue to age and improve over a long period of time so the longer you wait the better it will get .
If you are struggling with this then you should probably make another batch !
Try to wait six months if you can !
Addendum to this tutorial on mead making : The importance of Sanitation One of the most important aspects of mead making is sanitization .
It is very important that you sanitize everything when you are making mead .
Let me explain why !
When mixing up your honey , water and other things you are making a food environment .
It is a place loaded with nutrients for yeast and that means it can be easy for other types of unwanted yeast or bacteria to quickly grow !
It 's almost like a little incubator :)
What you want is to make sure no outside yeast or cells develop other than the yeast you pitch .
This means you should sanitize everything that comes in contact with your new batch of mead including the jug , spoons and measuring cups .
Doing this sanitizing will add a litte extra work but it is well worth it .
It greatly improves your chances of making a wonderful tasting mead .
The Nuts and Bolts of Sanitizing Mead : I have a video you can watch that will help you understand sanitation here : Sanitization of Mead I use store bought wine making chemical for sanitizing and you can easily get around this by using Chlorine Bleach and here is an article that will help you : Using Bleach for sanitizing food equipment
In summary : " about one tablespoon ( 1/2 fluid ounce , 15
ml ) of typical chlorine bleach per gallon of water is the maximum
that should be used for sanitizing food contact surfaces , according
to federal regulation " .
Want to see some videos of how to make mead ?
I have a youtube channel playlist that currently has 30 Mead making videos here I found a whole bunch of wonderful drinking goblets on amazon .
I have a page with them right here .
Just a couple of years ago you could n't get a goblet , or mead !
It is great to see both are becoming very popular .

With camera in hand , Momoko Sudo headed from her Schenley Park home to the Biltmore Hotel gym for her morning workout .
It was June 10 , and the sun was bursting through the clouds after an early - morning shower .
The demure 39 - year - old Japanese artist paid particular attention to the raindrops on the leaves .
She planned to photograph them .
Drawn by the picturesque entry into Coral Gables via Coral Way , she crossed Red Road and strolled along a sidewalk until she spotted a police officer sitting on his motorcycle talking on a cell phone .
Thinking it a good image , she snapped a photo and continued walking .
" Come here ! " Ofcr. Nelson Rodriguez barked .
Then he demanded her camera .
Soon he deleted more than 150 photos .
He ripped out the memory card and slammed it on the sidewalk .
Info police target photographers
" I was very upset , " says Sudo , who stands five feet two inches talls and considers herself a passive person .
" But I did n't want to say anything because he was very big and angry . "
The incident is one of at least four that have occurred in Miami - Dade County over the past year in which photographers have ended up arrested , handcuffed , threatened , intimidated , or accused of being a terrorist .
( I spent 16 hours in jail as a result of one of them . )
Taken together , they raise the question of whether the First Amendment means anything anymore .
" Officers do not have the right to seize cameras , look at the images , or delete the images , " says Oregon attorney Bert Krages , who wrote The Legal Handbook for Photographers : The Rights and Liabilities of Making Images .
Since the terrorist attacks in 2001 , authorities across the United States have been cracking down on photographers — even though none of the 9/11 terrorists or others in recent cases is known to have snapped pictures .
The past year has seen a particular increase .
Among the cases :
In May , Russian photographer Stanislav Arkhipov was jailed four nights for trespassing after he shot pictures of a natural gas tank in Lynn , Massachusetts .
A judge dropped all charges against Arkhipov , who said he simply enjoys taking photos of industrial sites .
Last month , a paparazzo was arrested for stalking after he photographed a pregnant Jamie Lynn Spears at a gas station in Louisiana .
Edwin Merino was standing more than 200 feet from Britney 's sister .
The name of the town was Liberty .
His case is still pending .
In November 2006 , Bogdan Mohora was collared after he snapped photos of cops making an arrest in Seattle .
He was standing across the street .
Police , who kept him in a jail cell for an hour , eventually agreed to pay an $ 8,000 settlement and passed a new policy on dealing with photographers .
And in the nation 's capital , Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton ( D - D.C. ) recently announced she would hold hearings to discuss police harassment of tourists at the city 's main train station .
" No one [ should be ] forbidden from taking photos of the beautiful and historic Union Station , " she stated in a letter to her constituents .
Unfortunately in Miami , no such advocate for photographers has stepped up .
And it 's much needed here .
Consider the case of visual artist David Rohn , an eccentric 57 - year - old gay man with a penchant for dressing up as females in the name of art .
On June 15 , Rohn ended up handcuffed for two hours after Miami Police saw him shooting pictures of himself dressed as a Muslim woman in a parking lot near Biscayne Boulevard and NE 79th Street .
After placing his camera on a tripod , Rohm took five photos .
Then a female police officer pulled up and drew her gun .
She ordered him to place his hands against his truck .
Within minutes , several more cop cars appeared .
They tried to decipher whether Rohn was a terrorist plotting his next attack .
" They did n't tell me why they had handcuffed me , " he says .
" But they told me they had to wait for a special operations officer to come .
When he arrived , I showed him pictures of me in different costumes and he realized I was just an artist . "
Although police released Rohn , they warned him not to return .
" They told me I needed a permit because I was doing commercial photography , " he says .
" But it was n't commercial ; it 's artistic , and there 's a difference . "
Regardless , he does n't believe he should have been handcuffed for two hours for a simple permit violation .
And then there is the case of St. Thomas University adjunct English professor Lamont Missick , a soft - spoken man who was confronted by a Miami - Dade Police officer last year in the university parking lot as he was photographing a dent on his car .
Ofcr. James Hanna approached and said he was on Homeland Security detail ( which his boss , Sgt. Jose Lugo , later acknowledged was false ) .
After Hanna reviewed Missick 's license , he peppered him with questions and accusations and suggested he was a member of Al - Qaeda .
" It was a very tense situation , " Missick says .
" He was somewhat imposing and very aggressive . "
The professor demanded Hanna 's name and badge number , which were covered by a patrol jacket , but the officer refused to divulge the information .
So Missick snapped his picture .
After the confrontation , he took his camera to a local precinct , where another officer identified the photo of Hanna .
The same day , Missick complained to police , but internal affairs investigated and did n't sustain the allegations .
The professor appealed to the Miami - Dade Independent Review Panel , which confirmed Hanna refused to identify himself .
The panel recommended that cops display their badges .
No disciplinary action was taken against Hanna .
ANY mention of redistribution of wealth in America would normally scupper a politician 's ambitions , but Barack Obama has managed to preserve his lead in the polls while also saying that he wants to “ spread the wealth around ” .
And there is a lot of spreading potential : income distribution in America is the widest of the 30 countries of the OECD .
The top 10 % ( or decile ) of earners have an average $ 87,257 of disposable income , while those in the bottom decile have $ 5,819 , among the very lowest of any country .
Britain , Canada and Luxembourg also see big differences between the richest and poorest .

We ’ve based our non-GMO standard on the mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed in our home state of Vermont .
Our dairy and egg suppliers still use conventional animal feeds that contain GMO grains .
We are actively seeking cost - effective options for farmers within our supply chain to convert to non-GMO animal feed .
We reached this non-GMO milestone in 2014 when we completed the transition of all plant - based ingredients in all * of our ice cream flavors to non-GMO .
The Details
As a part of our commitment to transparency , and for those folks who really like to know the details , below is an explanation of exactly what we mean by ' non-GMO . '
Our Definitions
When we refer to a " GMO " , we are using this term as most popularly used and widely understood in the US ( though there are varying definitions ) .
As such , a " GMO " ( or " genetically modified organism " ) is an organism that has been created using gene - splicing techniques , which allow DNA from one species to be injected into another species in a laboratory .
This creates combinations of plant , animal , bacteria , and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional cross- breeding methods .
" Non -GMO by Origin " refers to non-GMO according to the original seed source .
Either the crop is not commercially available as a GMO crop or , if the option is available , refers to the non-GMO version .
Traceability to the original non-GMO seed source is key .
This is the standard that Ben & Jerry 's adheres to when sourcing our ingredients .
" Non -GMO by IP " refers to non-GMO Identity Preserved crops .
Identity Preservation requires practices and processes for controlling contamination from at - risk GMO inputs and ingredients .
Traceability , segregation , risk assessment , sampling techniques , quality control management and analytical testing are emphasized .
Ben & Jerry 's does not require this from our suppliers , but many choose to supply ingredients that meet this standard .
This is a standard that is slightly more rigid than Non-GMO by Origin , and therefore anything considered Non-GMO IP is also considered Non-GMO by Origin .
" PCR Testing " refers to the Polymerase Chain Reaction test that can be used to detect genetic material ( DNA ) in a sample .
PCR (-) refers to an ingredient that was derived from a GMO source , but the genetic material is not detectable in the finished product , likely due to it being a highly refined or processed product .
PCR (-) alone is not an acceptable standard for Ben & Jerry 's ingredients , but will be used as a verification tool when appropriate .
Ben & Jerry 's " Non-GMO " standards :
Ben & Jerry 's adheres to sourcing " Non -GMO by Origin " ingredients for use in our products based on the following standards .
This means we rely primarily on traceability of ingredients through the supply chain back to a non-GMO seed , rather than relying on PCR testing .
Our suppliers use the following guidelines to ensure the ingredients they provide to us are " Non - GMO by Origin " :
All suppliers must use " Non -GMO by Origin " ingredients , ( including any sub-components or excepients ) in the manufacture of items they supply to Ben & Jerry's .
" Non -GMO by IP " is also acceptable .
For any plant - based raw material derived from sugar beets , corn , soy , canola , or other crop that is commercially available in GMO varieties , suppliers must source " Non - GMO by Origin " materials .
Suppliers to Ben & Jerry 's that also handle GMO raw materials or finished products in their production facilities must take appropriate measures to segregate GMO and Non-GMO materials at all times and ensure proper cleaning measures are employed .
There may be no comingling of ingredients or finished products at any point during storage or processing .
There is no tolerance for use of GMO ingredients in any product supplied to Ben & Jerry's .
Suppliers may use ingredients obtained from fermentation and processing aids or enzymes that are derived from GMOs in some circumstances , to be approved on a case - by - case basis by Ben & Jerry's .
Suppliers will be audited for " Non -GMO by Origin " traceability and segregation compliance as part of Ben & Jerry 's audit procedures .
Supportive documentation review , site visits , and PCR testing at any point in the supply chain , may be part of the audit protocol .
Suppliers must provide documentation and certification that materials are " Non - GMO by Origin " upon request .
Our Dairy :
We 've based our non-GMO standard on the mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed by our home state of Vermont .
This standard does not address animal feed .
To be clear , the fresh milk and cream we source from family farmers is conventionally sourced .
It is common practice for dairy cows ' feed to contain GMO ingredients such as corn and soy .
We aspire to build a sustainable dairy supply chain in the Northeast region that does not use GMO feeds .
We are working with numerous companies in the dairy industry and in the major commodity chains toward that goal through our participation in the Non-GMO Supply Working Group and Northeast Dairy Project .
Ruby ’s Popularity On The Up ; An Ideal Haven For The Recession ?
By Peter Cooper
A week ago , in a story published by eWeek.com , Darryl K. Taft asked " Can Ruby and Rails Make Developers Shine in a Downturn ? "
The general gist is that with a generally lower total cost of development , projects using Ruby and Rails will continue to increase , and even thrive in a recession , ensuring the success of Ruby and Rails developers .
An analyst with Forrester , John Rymer , however , countered :
I respectfully suggest that the type of application someone is working on is a more important factor than language usage .
In a downturn , companies tend to go back to basics .
Whatever the final outcome , Ruby 's popularity is still increasing .
Dean Cruse of Five Runs weighs in with his own opinion - namely that " Rails represents a low risk investment for the IT organization , " due to its open source nature .
Of 154 people polled in Dean 's post , currently 44 % see more opportunities for Rails developers heading into a recession , against only 15 % who see " major cutbacks " ahead .
Koders.com Sees 20 x Increase in Ruby Searches
Further , this week , Black Duck Software , the company behind the popular Koders.com search engine , has announced that it has seen a dramatic increase in the popularity of Ruby on its code search site with the number of Ruby - related searches having increased 20 times since 2004 .
They 've also announced that they 're crawling more Ruby sources than ever , now including all of RubyForge .
Tom Copeland , RubyForge 's sys - admin , is delighted :
Black Duck ’s search data confirms the tremendous growth that we are seeing within the community of Ruby developers .
It ’s great to see a leading code search site like Koders.com index RubyForge because it represents another way to make the projects in our community available to tens of thousands of developers worldwide .
4 million Rubyists by 2013 ?
IT research company Gartner , Inc. are also convinced that Ruby 's popularity is on the up , and the Ruby ecosystem will reach 4 million developers worldwide by 2013 .
Mark Driver , research VP at Gartner , Inc. says :
[..]
Ruby will enjoy a higher concentration among corporate IT developers than typical , dynamic ‘ scripting ’ languages , such as PHP .
I 'm not entirely buying this yet , but if it becomes true and Ruby leapfrogs PHP in the corporate environment , you could be looking at some pretty interesting years ahead as a Ruby developer !
But Python Might Be Moving Faster ..
On the other hand , Ruby is still hovering at # 10 in the TIOBE Programming Community Index , a position it 's held for over a year now .
While TIOBE 's index is n't incredibly accurate , it makes a good indicator , and even Delphi has resurged back ahead of Ruby in the last year , and Python appears to be moving up the charts a lot quicker than Ruby .

Weak health care systems mean universal testing is not realistic Universal testing for HIV , followed by immediate treatment could cut the number of people developing full - blown Aids by up to 95 % , a Lancet study says .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) also found that such a strategy could virtually eliminate HIV transmission .
The study used computer modelling to project what would happen if everyone over 15 was tested every year .
But the WHO said that weak health care systems meant that universal testing was not a realistic idea .
At its best , the strategy would prevent morbidity and mortality for the population
Dr Geoffrey Garnett
Imperial College London
At first sight , the results of the WHO study are a clear argument for universal HIV testing - it could become a run -of - the - mill medical check like those for high blood pressure or cholesterol .
Diagnosis and immediate treatment with anti-retroviral drugs could , researchers say , reduce cases of Aids in a generalised epidemic from 20 in 1,000 people to just one in 1,000 within 10 years .
Furthermore , the study continues , the strategy could virtually eliminate HIV transmission and new infection .
At the moment HIV testing and treatment are patchy , and while around three million people are receiving anti-retrovirals , a further 6.7 million need them .
But the WHO , while welcoming the study , warns that the feasibility of universal testing is challenged by weak health systems .
It adds that giving treatment to patients who are not yet sick may increase drug resistance , while the side effects of taking Aids treatment drugs for very long periods are as yet unknown but could be severe .
Writing in a commentary piece in The Lancet , Dr Geoffrey Garnett , from Imperial College London , said : " At its best , the strategy would prevent morbidity and mortality for the population , both through better treatment of the individual and reduced spread of HIV .
" At its worst , the strategy will involve over - testing , over - treatment , side effects , resistance , and potentially reduced autonomy of the individual in their choices of care . "

While Wall Street was melting down this week , a bunch of friends went on vacation to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus .
They enjoyed the sunshine , dined together and uploaded photos and videos , including one of themselves lip-syncing to Journey ’s “ Do n’t Stop Believing . ”
The group reportedly included several young Turks from the Web 2.0 crowd -- such as Brittany Bohnet of Google , Dave Morin and Aaron Sittig of Facebook and Sam Lessin of Drop.io -- as well as Lessin ’s girlfriend , Jessica Vascellaro , who covers Internet companies for the Wall Street Journal .
They stayed at a house built by Lessin ’s dad .
The lip - syncing video appeared on a website that described the trip this way : “ 20 world Internet citizens met in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in October of 2008 for a week of reflections on life , love , and the Internet . ”
( The video has since been set to private . )
The vacationers also chronicled their trip ( in few words ) on Twitter , collecting them on a feed called campcyprus and pointing to photos taken during the vacation .
For example , Vascellaro Twittered that she “ is living la vida camp cyprus , ” “ wo n’t stop believing ” and “ is looking forward to getting back to work . ”
( Her most recent tweet , posted a few hours ago , noted that she had “ posted a question to her group on WSJ about the impact of the market turmoil on Silicon Valley .

So far , Silicon Valley pundits have not been amused by the vacation or even jealous of it .
Mostly , they ’re annoyed .
The online record of the trip was discovered -- and spread widely -- during a week in which venture capitalists told their companies to tighten their belts and horde cash to help them get through the tough times looming , EBay said it would lay off 10 % of its employees and tech companies saw their stocks crater even more deeply than the broader market .
So when the video of the bathing - suited vacationers was discovered , it quickly became too perfect a symbol of Nero fiddling while Rome burns .
Or as VentureBeat put it , “ Silicon Valley lip - synchs while market burns . ”
“ The video gave me flashbacks to heedless - partying - until - the - bomb - fell attitude before the popping of the Web 1.0 bubble , ” wrote Kara Swisher at All Things Digital , which is owned by the Wall Street Journal .

“ This video will always be associated with the end of Web 2.0 , ” said Michael Arrington at TechCrunch .
Dan Frommer of Silicon Alley Insider said he was n’t sure whether the video was a great example of Web 2.0 tools at their best or a cry for help .
Of course , it ’s not fair to hold up a video of adults on a vacation they had planned long ago ( and presumably paid for themselves ) as an example of the end of the roaring bull market .
This is no AIG situation , in which the insurance giant ’s employees were taking a junket to Southern California ’s swanky St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach while the government was bailing out the company to the tune of $ 85 billion .
As L.A. Times columnist David Lazarus wrote about the American International Group trip , “ When the going gets tough , the tough get pedicures . ”

When it comes to the Web 2.0 crowd , the rest of us can wait for the tough to post evidence of their pedicures online .

With early voting under way in some states and with Election Day just over two weeks away , the 2008 race is playing out in court as well as at the ballot box .
In Ohio , election officials got a reprieve Friday from the U.S. Supreme Court , which spared them a tedious battle over 200,000 newly registered voters with verification problems .
In Michigan , lawyers are battling to ensure that qualified voters , including those who lost their homes to foreclosure , can still cast ballots .
In Colorado , tens of thousands of people reportedly have been purged from the voter rolls by officials who , in trying to verify eligibility , relied heavily on a federal database with known problems .
This is the new normal in American elections , experts say .
The specter of voter and election fraud is perhaps unavoidable in the era following the hotly disputed 2000 presidential race .
Democratic supporters routinely accuse Republicans of voter - suppression efforts .
GOP supporters say Democrats inflate voter rolls and ignore evidence of irregularities .
During the final presidential debate last week , John McCain raised the registration issue when he demanded a fuller accounting from Barack Obama of his campaign 's ties to ACORN , which has been conducting extensive voter - registration drives .
The organization advocates for the poor , who tend to support Democrats .
McCain accused ACORN of " maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . "
A day later , senior officials in the U.S. Justice Department confirmed an investigation of ACORN .
On Friday , the Obama campaign asked the Justice Department to have a special prosecutor examine the claims , which it said were reminiscent of unproven voter - fraud cases at the heart of the controversial firing of at least one federal prosecutor in late 2006 .
" It 's a war on the voters , " said Bob Bauer , Obama 's general counsel .
" I would say 2008 is typical of recent election experiences but on a much bigger scale , " said Doug Chapin , director of electionline.org , which tracks reforms for the Pew Center on the States .
He doubts there is widespread ballot fraud and said definitive proof is minuscule .
Complaints will persist
Still , in a nation closely divided along party lines , the complaints wo n't end anytime soon and likely will continue long after Election Day on Nov. 4 .
" Everything we see as indicators is more serious and earlier this time , " said Jonah Goldman , a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the National Campaign for Fair Elections , a nonpartisan organization .
Some estimates put the number of wrongly disenfranchised voters as high as 6 million , he said .
This is n't how it was supposed to be .
In 2002 , Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in response to problems with punch - card ballots in Florida in the 2000 election .
The law , passed with overwhelming bipartisan support , ushered in a minimum - level of election standards and greater use of electronic voting machines .
Critics say the law has encouraged states to adopt ID requirements that place a burden on the poor and has enabled election officials to aggressively remove voters from the rolls , even over minor input errors .
Both complaints have led to lawsuits across the country , and more are possible after this election .
In April , the Supreme Court upheld an ID law in Indiana , ruling 6 - 3 that the requirement was not too difficult and that there was little evidence of harm .
That ruling cleared the way for other states , including Arizona , to keep similar ID laws in place .
Lawsuits and lingering suspicions may be customary , but fraud is n't , said James Tierney , director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia University .
" These voter - fraud issues are way overemphasized .
I think people do the best they can to be fair , " said Tierney , who was counsel to Florida 's attorney general during the 2000 recount of the presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore .
" I 've been accused of being very , very naive on this , but that is my view . "
For months , both parties have waged aggressive campaigns at the local and state levels , accusing their opponents of underhanded tactics .
Last month , the Obama campaign filed a federal lawsuit in Michigan following a report that Republicans planned to challenge the voting eligibility of those who had lost their homes to foreclosure .
State GOP officials vehemently deny the claim and have sued for libel the Web site that made the claim .
Across the country in swing states , especially Ohio , the GOP has identified thousands of what it says are dubious registrations - many gathered by ACORN - that included fictitious names , as well as the names of celebrities , ostensibly seeking registration .
ACORN officials have said their offices have helped identify the relatively few improper registrations , but state election rules require submitting all registrations , even obviously bogus ones .
The Ohio secretary of state has battled the GOP in her state to prevent challenges to 200,000 disputed registrations .
Some include those with typographical errors in the information .
Such mistakes are not uncommon .
Joe Wurzelbacher , better known as " Joe the Plumber " from the last presidential debate has been registered in Ohio with his name misspelled , as has Debra Bartoshevich , a Wisconsin woman featured in a McCain campaign TV ad who said she had supported Hillary Clinton before backing the Arizona senator .
Rich Coolidge , a spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state , said a criminal case involving ACORN registrations four years ago led to a change in state law .
This year , Colorado has had no problems with ACORN , he said .
Ohio embroiled in issues
Ohio has had other voting troubles .
The state has been in court with the manufacturer of its electronic voting machines since officials discovered some incorrectly tallied votes in the March primary .
Republicans also complained that Jennifer Brunner , Democratic secretary of state , was being overly technical this summer when she refused to accept applications for absentee ballots from McCain supporters who had n't checked a box swearing they were truthful .
A spokesman for Brunner has said she was following the rules .
Goldman , the Georgetown professor , said the problems in Ohio , coming on the heels of widespread problems under a Republican secretary of state in 2004 , are especially troublesome .
" The Ohio Secretary of State 's Office seems to be the most hyper - partisan in the country , " he said .
" Nobody 's hands in this are clean . "
Several key states , including Colorado , have aggressively removed voters from the official rolls by relying heavily on sometimes - faulty Social Security databases , supposed to be used only as backup , the New York Times reported earlier this month .
The effect is that about two voters have been removed for every one who registers , the paper found .
Coolidge insisted last week that Colorado 's rolls are accurate and legal .
But in Michigan , a federal judge last week ordered 1,400 people restored to the state 's voter rolls because election officials were too quick to delete them .
The judge rejected as premature a more ambitious claim that might have immediately restored thousands more .
Voter " caging " is another problem playing out across the country , according to the nonpartisan National Campaign for Fair Elections , which frequently alleges Republican voter - suppression efforts .
Caging is an effort to remove voters from the rolls by aggressive tactics for partisan gain .
It dates to the 19th century .
Tierney , the former attorney general 's counsel in Florida , agrees that parties have long histories of putting up roadblocks to voting and that technology has made the practice easier .
One popular caging scheme , experts say , involves mass mailings sent to voters at their listed addresses .
If the mail is returned as undeliverable to an address , partisan operatives seek to have that voter removed from the rolls .
Such efforts have been documented in minority neighborhoods and often snag the poor , who move more frequently , and college students , whose addresses can change several times within years .
From 2004 to 2006 , operatives targeted more than 500,000 voters in caging campaigns in nine states , and at least 77,000 had their eligibility challenged , the National Campaign for Fair Elections found .
Goldman , the director , said challenges and other distractions can make voting more time - consuming .
Chapin , of electionline.org , said allegations of voter suppression and widespread voter fraud have something in common : " Neither side has much in the way of empirical evidence . "
" The level and volume you have on this issue is a direct result " of 2000 , he said .
" One of the things that 2000 did was wake people up to the reality that elections do n't end on Election Night . "

As computers get smarter machines could become more intelligent than humans within a few decades , leading to an event dubbed the Singularity .
Technologists are still debating the possibility but what if just enough people believed it is likely ?
Whether the singularity occurs or not , just the expectation of it could significantly change human behavior , says James Miller , associate professor of economics at Smith College .
“ Long before there is a singularity , people will come to expect it , ” Smith told attendees at the Singularity Summit in San Jose .
“ And it is very likely that could happen within 20 years . ”
The belief that a vastly different future is near could change how people make choices in life , education , investment and retirement , says Miller .
“ People will become very fearful of death , save less and invest differently , ” he says .
Most significant among their choices would be the emphasis on extending life , says Smith .
“ If you think there will be a machine - driven future then your top priority is to survive long enough to make it to the singularity , ” he says .
That means people force Governments to increase its defense spending in a bid to ensure the greatest chance of survival .
“ Believers will also want to spend more money to increase their chances of making it to the singularity with things such as safer cars and machines that make jobs such as construction safer , ” he says .
Another emerging field could be cryonics which allows for freezing of the body on the belief that it can be resuscitated in the future when the right technology is available .
As more people think that future could be a vastly different placed shaped by technological advances , they are more likely to spend what it takes to be a part of it , says Miller .
Interestingly , a quick poll among the 350 or so conference attendees on who ’s signed up for cryonics threw up nearly a dozen hands .
Compare that to the fact that only about 1300 people in the entire world have signed up for cryonics , according to Miller .
The belief that intelligent machines will dominate could also lead to lower spending on education , says Miller .
“ If you are thinking of being a surgeon , why would you spend the time to learn if you think computers will be vastly better than humans at operations , ” he says .
" People are then likely only to pay to learn where education is fun and truly rewarding . "
For an economist , some of Miller ’s views relating to how the expectation of singularity sound rather alarmist .
As more people believe in the singularity , they are likely to save less for retirement and change the way they invest leading to higher interest rates and different mortgage patterns among other things he says .
“ We save for days when we will be frail and ca n’t work , ” Miller told attendees .
“ But if you think there will be singularity by 2045 , you believe your body will live longer and that changes your behavior significantly . ”
Miller ’s talk was among the most controversial at the conference .
His financial advice especially had some of the attendees riled .
“ The framing of this discussion into believers and non-believers is ridiculous , ” says Eric Acher , an associate with the Sao Paulo , Brazil - based Monashees capital who claims he walked out of the talk towards the end .
" The discussion needs to be about the impact of technological progress on society . "
Other attendees such as Robert Bernstein , a nanotech engineer seemed more willing to buy into Miller ’s ideas .
“ What I took away from the talk was how personal behavior should change as a result of the probability of the singularity and how that would affect the economics of the world , ” says Bernstein .
What do you think of Miller 's views ?
Are you a believer ?
The Government 's plan to triple the first home owner grant from $ 7,000 to $ 21,000 for newly - built homes has been welcomed by the housing industry , which says it will provide a much - needed boost to the sector .
As part of a $ 10.4 billion package announced today designed to stimulate the Australian economy in the midst of the global downturn , the Government will also double the grant for existing homes to $ 14,000 .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says a good performance in the housing sector is critical for the economy 's overall performance .
Executive director of the Housing Industry Association ( HIA ) Queensland branch , Warwick Temby , says he expects the move to result in an extra 15,000 houses to be built around Australia over the next 12 months .
" We think it 's a tremendous fillip for the home - building industry and for home buyers , " he said .
" Home buyers have been doing it tough for the past few months and we think it 's a great initiative and it'll turn into some new housing activity very quickly . "
HIA spokesman Chris Lamont says the tripling of the grant will arrest the slide that has affected the housing industry in recent times .
" We think that this will provide the necessary assistance in a downturn in respect to new housing activity that will make it worthwhile for first home buyers to consider a new home of their own , " he said .
Peter Jones from the Master Builders Association says the boost to the first home buyers grant will lead to more new homes being built .
" Which is the area of most concern .
At the moment in Australia we 're under - building to the tune of 30,000 dwellings per annum so we welcome this initiative , " he said .
Inflationary fear
The Real Estate Institute ( REI ) fears a doubling of the grant for first - time buyers of existing properties might drive up prices .
Its South Australian president Robin Turner says established housing could become more costly .
" My big fear with the doubling of the first home owners ' grant is that it might actually be a bit inflationary on prices because it 's certainly going to feed demand , " he said .
Queensland 's Deputy Premier Paul Lucas has thrown his support behind the federal move .
" This is great , not only for the industry with a welcome shot in the arm to provide a welcome stimulus , but also for first home buyers , " he said .
" It 's also about housing affordability and getting young families and young couples into housing .
" It will provide an extra incentive for the building industry to get out and build new houses . "
The increase in the first home owner grant is expected to cost the Government $ 1.5 billion .
That was my impression too .
I was much more impressed with Obama 's performance than many other bloggers .
Here 's the CNN poll :
Thinking about the following characteristics and qualities , please say whether you think each one better described Barack Obama or John McCain during tonight 's debate :  Was more intelligent : Obama 55 % , McCain 30 %  Expressed his views more clearly : Obama 53 % , McCain 36 %  Spent more time attacking his opponent : McCain 60 % , Obama 23 %  Was more sincere and authentic : Obama 46 % , McCain 38 %  Seemed to be the stronger leader : Obama 49 % , McCain 43 %  Was more likeable : Obama 61 % , McCain 26 %  Was more in touch with the needs and problems of people like you : Obama 62 % , McCain 32 %
Since the economy has emerged as the biggest issue , these two findings on who did better on what topic are pretty important :
 The economy : Obama 58 % , McCain 37 %  The current financial crisis : Obama 54 % , McCain 36 %
And from CBS :
Thirty - nine percent of uncommitted voters who watched the debate tonight thought Barack Obama was the winner .
Twenty - four percent thought John McCain won .
Thirty - seven percent saw it as a draw .
Forty - six percent of uncommitted voters said their opinion of Obama got better tonight .
Thirty - two percent said their opinion of McCain got better .
Sixty - six percent of uncommitted voters think Obama would make the right decisions about the economy .
Forty - two percent think McCain would .

This week we welcome back our ninja Austin , coming at you from Jersey with this really siiick post on a machine that dispenses bikes for temporary use .
Say it with me now – My Ninja , Please !
Enjoy .
I come to you after a long break of not posting to bring to you ‘ The Bike Dispenser ‘ ( cue music ) .
Leave it to the Dutch ( crazy a $$ ninjas ) to come up with something so clever , so green , so cool .
Basically its like a giant ‘ Pez ’ dispenser , dishing out bikes on one end and refilling on the other .
Apparently it works like this ( I do n’t speak Dutch ) ; you pay a small fee ( around â‚¬ 2.75 ( $ 3.71 ) per 20 hours ) or , in some cities which have free bike programs its free , you get a bike to use at your leisure .
Stroll around as much as you want , return it when you wish to any of the neighborhood Bike Dispensers .
Do n’t feel like returning it , well you can leave it as is , the bikes are tagged with RFID ’s ; Bike Dispenser owners / operators can then find the free range bikes about the city and return them to their pens .
Its really ashame that America ’s infrastructure in the major metropolitan areas cannot support such fantasies .
The car is king and we all must succumb .
C’est la vie !
Only we as architects can do our part to promote better , healthier means of transportation whenever we have the opportunity .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday October 14 2008
We were wrong to say in the article below that about 10 million registered Jewish voters live in Florida .
Florida currently has about 10.7 million registered voters in total , of whom about 5 % are Jewish .
This has been corrected .
This year Kenny Furst came close to breaking the habit of a lifetime .
Brought up in a Jewish neighbourhood in the Bronx , New York , under Roosevelt 's New Deal , he is and always has been a Democrat .
But this year , for the first time , the 90 - year - old was veering towards voting Republican or not at all .
The problem was Barack Obama .
" He 's the first Democratic candidate I have n't been sure about .
As far as I was concerned he was connected with the Arabs , " Furst said , speaking in Tamarac , Florida , where he retired to 18 years ago .
For his wife Selma , 87 , as for many Jewish Americans , the ties to the Democratic party were also umbilical .
Yet she did not like the idea of an African American president , and was worried about rumours that Obama was a secret Muslim .
Then something happened .
Their grandson announced he was flying from Los Angeles , 2,500 miles away , to visit .
Mike Bender had learned of an internet - driven initiative to get young Jewish voters to make a " great schlep " to Florida to persuade their wavering grandparents to vote for Obama .
The viral movement was backed by a video message by the comedian Sarah Silverman , saying : " You know why your grandparents do n't like Obama , because his name sounds scary .
Yes Barack Hussein Obama is a super shitty name , but you 'd think somebody named Manishevitz Guberman would understand that . "
Bender watched the video , laughed , and decided to traverse the States to confront his grandparents .
He was not alone .
Over the weekend dozens of young Jewish Americans travelled to Florida with the ambition of swinging this ultimate swing state in favour of Obama .
Hundreds more have made the lesser schlep , or " mini schlep " - lobbying their grandparents by phone .
The thinking behind it starts with the assumption , widely held by political analysts , that if John McCain , is to have any chance he must win Florida .
Democrats have taken the state only three times in the past 12 presidential elections : Lyndon Johnson in 1964 ; Jimmy Carter in 1976 ; and Bill Clinton in 1996 .
But the contest has frequently been close , famously so in 2000 when George Bush squeezed into the White House with just 537 more votes in Florida than Al Gore .
That sense of opportunity explains why the Obama campaign has posted hundreds of staff in the state and is spending a record $ 39 m ( £ 23 m ) there , far more than McCain .
The investment has to some extent paid off , with polls showing a three - point lead , though that falls within the margin of error .
Which is where the Jewish vote comes in .
About half a million registered Jewish voters live in Florida , mainly older people in retirement condominiums along the so - called Gold Coast .
Most are lifelong Democrats originating from New York and the north - east , but this year there is estimated 13 % who , like the Fursts , are undecided .
That equates to up to 100,000 votes : enough to determine the outcome of Florida , and with it the fate of the nation .
" The number one way to influence the outcome of the election as Jewish people is to influence your grandparents in Florida , " said Ari Wallach , an instigator of the great schlep .
Those who embarked on that schlep found the going was sometimes tough .
University student Cobin Dopkeen , who flew from Boston , had no need to convert his grandparents who are already for Obama , so instead accosted other residents and visitors in their retirement complex in Miami .
Which is when he met Lenny , a 62 - year - old Floridian out for a walk with his 92 - year - old father .
" You have to be out of your fucking mind to support Obama , " was Lenny 's reply .
" Number one : he supports Hamas .
Number two : he sat with Reverend Wright for 20 years as he spieled out his antisemitic hatred . "
And Lenny does n't want a black president .
" I grew up in the sixties when blacks were called nigger .
OK , nowadays I say N - word , but I still think it . "
Republicans in south Florida predict a 10 % spike for McCain in the Jewish vote over the 24 % polled by Bush in 2004 .
Their campaign line is that if Obama wins he will be the first pro-Palestinian US president since the foundation of the state of Israel .
The Democrats hit back with leaflets showing Obama by Jerusalem 's Wailing Wall wearing a yarmulka .
From most schleppers ' experiences , the unbending hostility of Lenny was the exception .
Many reported a warm reception from most Jewish Americans in Florida who are already in the Obama camp .
Others notched up success stories , including Bender 's grandparents .
His visit moved and impressed .
It led to long conversations in which he sought to allay their fears .
Obama was a Christian , he said , a vocal supporter of Israel who has pledged to work for all Americans .
The final hurdle was convincing his grandmother that Obama was not a Muslim .
" I said to her that if there are any people who can understand the wickedness of lies said about them , it is the Jews .
That hit home . "
Within a day of their grandson 's arrival , the Fursts had declared for Obama and had begun proselytising with the zeal of the newly converted .
Kenny Furst has been posting Obama flyers at the bagel shop where he still works , and his wife is holding discussion groups with other Jewish women from the retirement home .
" I 'm so proud of my grandparents , that they were open - minded enough to listen , " said Bender .
" I 've got a couple of years to go , so this vote is n't for me , " said his grandfather .
" All I 'm interested in now is that my grandchildren should be safe .
This one is for them . "
Treasury officials are negotiating terms of the recapitalisation with the banks Major UK banks have been told they need to seek up to £ 50 bn to boost their balance sheets , the BBC has learned .
Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , HBOS and Lloyds TSB are to sell shares , the majority of which the government is expected to buy .
If the government ends up owning more than half of RBS and HBOS , it will be an effective nationalisation .
Barclays has announced that it will seek to raise £ 6.5 bn without calling on government funding .
Under pressure BBC business editor Robert Peston says RBS is likely to get in the region of £ 20bn and Lloyds TSB about £ 5 bn .
Barclays was under pressure from the Treasury , Bank of England and Financial Services Authority to raise up to £ 8bn , while HBOS had been told it needed as much as £ 12bn .
The investment is part of the £ 500bn plan to rescue Britain 's banks which was announced last week .
The government is not expected to insist on having its own appointees on the boards of the banks , although other strings are likely to be attached .
What a sorry end to Britain 's longest ever period of unbroken economic growth
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog
These could involve curbing executive pay and resuming normal lending to individuals and small businesses .
The government has said that it will negotiate terms individually with each bank that participates in the scheme .
The cash will be sought by the banks in the form of shares which could be bought by private investors .
In the case of RBS and HBOS , the government is expected to be the major purchaser - giving it majority control of the banks .
Barclays had been under pressure from the Treasury , Bank of England and Financial Services Authority to raise up to £ 8bn - though the BBC has learned it will not be asking for government cash .
Instead it has announced that it will seek to raise an extra £ 6.5 bn without calling on government funding .
" What we 're doing now is talking with all of the banks about how we implement the programme , " Yvette Cooper , chief secretary to the Treasury , told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show .
" We 'll set out the sort of strings that will be attached on a case - by - case basis , " she added .
" What we 're doing over the weekend is looking at specifics , " Alistair Darling , chancellor of the exchequer , told the BBC in Washington after talks with President Bush and other G7 finance ministers on Saturday .
What the banks need RBS - £ 20 bn Lloyds TSB - £ 5 bn Barclays - £ 8bn HBOS - £ 12bn
The chief executive of RBS , Sir Fred Goodwin , is expected to resign to be replaced by Stephen Hester , the former finance director of Abbey who is currently chief executive of British Land .
Earlier in the year , RBS raised £ 12bn from its shareholders , which is now more than the bank is worth on the stock exchange .
Meanwhile , Lloyds TSB is renegotiating the terms of its HBOS takeover to secure the buyout for a smaller fee .
A £ 12.2 bn deal was agreed last month but the value of HBOS shares has since plunged and the extent of the recapitalisation highlights its weakness .
Both companies insisted on Sunday evening the deal is " still on " but HBOS shareholders are expected to do less well .
Hefty falls
The deal with Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , HBOS , Lloyds TSB will leave the government holding a mixture of normal and preference shares .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It seems Mr Brown and Co. have no choice in this matter and these takeovers are necessary , but its very wrong that it is the tax payer that should have to do this Anthony Halpin , Aberdeen
The difference is that normal shares carry voting rights while preference shares do not , but preference shareholders , as the name suggests , get access to any money that a company makes before the normal shareholders .
The deals come following huge falls on stock markets last week .
The FTSE 100 in London fell 21.1 % during the week , its worst weekly fall since the crash of 1987 .
The Dow Jones in New York fell 18 % in the week while the Dax in Frankfurt fell 21.6 % .

Led by Michael Schredl and Boris Stuck – who have shown , respectively , that women are not awakened by the smell of rotten eggs , and that snores do not correlate with nightmares – a team of German researchers tested the effect of odor on the dreams of 15 young adult women , the demographic scientifically shown to have the most sensitive olfactories .
Once deep in REM sleep , they were exposed to ten - second aromatic flushes of phenyl ethyl alcohol , roughly analogous to roses , or hydrogen sulfide , typically found in rotten eggs and a standby of odor - and - dream science .
( In a methodological aside , the test apparatuses are formally known as " Sniffin ' Sticks . " )
An odorless chemical was used as a control .
Having sniffed , the women were roused and asked to report .
The tone of their dreams consistently tracked with the tenor of the smells – but unlike dreamers who incorporate external sounds , such as an alarm clock radio , the women did not recall having smelled roses or rotten eggs .
Instead they experienced a shift in the emotional content of their dreams .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLna-XxRGXoThis suggests that " olfactory stimuli are processed differently than other sensory modalities on higher brain levels , " a fancy way of saying that brains handle smells differently than sound or touch .
Several dreams did involve smell - associated activities – cleaning a toilet , eating a kiwi or parsley - stuffed potatoes , being stuck in a stuffy room – but in only one case did a test subject report smelling something : " a grinning Chinese woman [ who ] also looked disgusted because they ( dreamer and Chinese woman ) smelled something rotten . "
This dream , however , was prompted by the odorless control substance .
The study , announced at the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery annual conference , has not yet been published or replicated .
With the help of time - release room fresheners , I intended to try and replicate it myself this weekend ; but unless the smell of new Ikea curtains counts as a stimuli , I forgot .
If it does count , I can report that they had no effect whatsoever , and may function as a stylish yet affordable alternative to odorless Sniffin ' Sticks .
Then again , given the near - apocalypse of the U.S. economy , it 's possible that the curtains had an ameliorative effect , comparable to roses ; the researchers may wish to test this in future studies of " whether positively toned olfactory stimuli yield a significant shift in the emotional tone of nightmares . "
Information processing during sleep : the effect of olfactory stimuli on dream content and dream emotions [ unpublished ]
Videos : Dream sequences from The Science of Sleep , Tarkovsky 's Nostalgia and a Chuck E. Cheese commercial .
Note : A colleague provided an anecdote redolent of the researchers ' results .
" My mom once had a dream that she was taking care of a baby , and it started to smell , " she recalled .
" So she changed the diaper , but the baby was still smelly .
She kept washing and washing and washing the baby , but it still smelled .
Finally she woke up and realized my dad was farting up the place . "

DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Sarah Palin has emerged as the new darling of social conservatives , and this political capital could make her an influential vice president -- or propel her as a candidate for the prime spot in 2012 -- if John McCain loses to Democrat Barack Obama on Tuesday .
Republican vice presidential nominee Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin autographs a sign for a supporter after a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , September 18 , 2008 .

But even within Republican circles the moose - hunting Alaska governor is a polarizing figure who highlights her party ’s divisions between fiscal conservatives and conservative Christians united by their strident opposition to abortion and gay rights .
“ If they do in fact lose on Tuesday she becomes one of the central figures for 2012 , ” said Matthew Wilson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
“ Clearly , Palin is a star with the social conservatives but many of the country - club Republicans just find her completely unpalatable , ” he said .
The 44 - year - old mother of five has become the northern light that has electrified the Republican Party ’s conservative evangelical base -- its most reliable voting bloc .
She has won conservative hearts and minds on many fronts : she is a devout evangelical ; she chose to have a child even when she knew through prenatal tests he would have Down syndrome ; she is a populist ; and she knows how to use a gun .
Polls show the McCain / Palin ticket currently losing ground with many demographic groups but still retaining the support of around two out of three white evangelical Protestants .
McCain , who has broken with this wing of the party on many key issues including his support for stem cell research and his failure to back a federal amendment to ban gay marriage , could not garner this level of evangelical support without Palin , analysts say .
A Pew Research Center poll conducted from October 23 to 26 found 93 percent of registered voters that categorize themselves as conservative Republicans backed McCain .

A number of influential conservative Christians including Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention have pegged Palin as the rising star of the Republican Party ’s social conservative wing .
If McCain loses on Tuesday , this puts her near or at the front of the Republican pack for 2012 .
“ I think that she will be a major contender ... and she will certainly be in the running , ” said Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , an influential conservative lobby group with strong evangelical ties .
POLARIZING
But the same qualities that endear her to this wing of the Republican Party repel some moderates within its ranks .
Concerns about the Palin pick have been mentioned by high profile Republicans who defected to Obama , such as Kenneth Adelman , a hawkish aide to former President Ronald Reagan , and retired U.S. Gen Colin Powell , a former secretary of state under President George W. Bush .
There are also jitters about Palin ’s lack of economic experience in the midst of a financial and banking crisis .
“ The gap of sensibility between the social right and the economic right is severe .
...
An earthquake has taken place and the party can’t straddle the fissures , ” said Todd Gitlin , a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University .
Still , if McCain wins he will owe Palin and this wing of the party a huge debt which could give her a lot of clout .
She would clearly be viewed as their White House insider .
“ I would certainly expect that Sarah Palin would have great influence in a McCain administration .
Without her on the ticket I do n’t know that he would even be viable , ” said Perkins .
If McCain loses the exit polls will be scoured but many pundits seem likely to blame it on centrist concerns about Palin during a financial crisis .
“ It ’s really clear that there are some people out there who would like to make her a scapegoat if things do n’t go their way on Tuesday , ” said Charmaine Yoest , president of Americans United for Life Action , which opposes abortion rights .
“ But she ’s has very clearly connected with the base of the party and the life and family voters and I think that is going to give her a really strong base going forward whatever happens , ” she said .
There ’s no doubt that comic book movies have included some of the hottest actresses around .
It only makes sense .
If you were creating a comic book story , would n’t you draw the hottest women you could think of ?
So , obviously , when it comes to turning these scribbles into real people for Movieland , you really have to find the cream .
And , for the most part , the studios get it right .
So much so , that crunching them down into just 26 was one of the hardest tasks we have ever done .
But it was worth every minute .
Enjoy .
26 . Maria Bello
Notable comic book movie appearance : A History Of Violence ( 2005 )
Some of you may or may not know that A History Of Violence is a comic book movie .
Probably because it does n’t involve anyone with in tights with superpowers .
However , Maria Bello comes close to a superwoman .
25 . Natalie Portman
Notable comic book appearance : V for Vendetta ( 2005 )
Another pants film , but Natalie Portman is always worth watching .
Terrible accent though .
24 . Tanya Roberts
Notable comic book appearance : Sheena ( 1984 )
Possibly the worst movie ever made , but Tanya Roberts does a topless bathing scene .
Unfortunately , it has been taken down .
If anyone can find it , please send it to us .

Notable comic book movie appearance : Swamp Thing ( 1982 )
Her jiggle was the movie ’s most memorable special effect .
20 . Leonor Varela
Notable comic book movie appearance : Blade 2
A bit of a favourite among the hecklerspray crew .
Mind you , with a name that sounds like fabric conditioner it ’s only natural she ’d clean up .
19 . Eva Mendes
Notable comic book movie appearance : Ghost Rider ( 2007 )
Eva Mendes really needs a new agent .
She stars in the worst films ever .
Ghost Rider certainly falls into that category , but Eva certainly made it slightly watchable .
18 . Liv Tyler
Notable comic book movie appearance : The Incredible Hulk ( 2008 )
Is it wrong to prefer with pointy ears ?
17 . Kelly Hu
Notable comic book movie appearance : X - Men 2 ( 2000 )

Hu kicked ass in X Men 2 .
Although you would n’t want her to rake her claws down your back .

More girl next door than hot babe , but it ’s always the quiet ones .
15 . Kirsten Dunst

Not everyone ’s cup of tea , but certainly sexy enough to deserve a place on here .
14 . Jennifer Garner
Notable comic book appearances : Daredevil ( 2003 ) and Elektra ( 2005 )
Again , both Daredevil and Elecktra were pants , but Jennifer Garner dressed up in that outfit helped ease the pain .
13 . Halle Berry
Notable comic book appearances : X - Men trilogy ( 2000 - 2006 ) and Catwoman ( 2004 )
Catwoman sucked big time , but her outfit almost made it worth watching .
Almost …
12 . Jennifer Connelly
Notable comic book appearance : Hulk ( 2003 ) , Rocketeer ( 1991 )
Maybe there is something wrong with us , but Hulk was so bad we kept hoping it would end like Requiem For A Dream .
That would have woke a few people up .
= 10 . Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino
Notable comic book movie appearance : Watchmen ( 2009 )
OK , we know this is cheating as the movie is not out yet , but , come on , just look at them .
Problem is the office is divided over who is better , so we bottled it and slung them together .
9. Rebecca Romijn
Notable comic book appearances : X - Men trilogy ( 2000 - 2006 )
She may not have looked at her best in X - Men – unless you are turned on by scaly , blue things – but there is no doubt behind the make - up Rebecca is a real class act .
8. Michelle Pfeiffer
Notable comic book movie appearance : Batman Returns ( 1992 )
Batman Returns was a poor follow - up to Batman , but Michelle Pfeiffer certainly livened things up in that suit .
OK , we avoided the obvious pussy jokes .
8. Jane Fonda
Notable comic book movie appearance : Barbarella ( 1968 )
Some of you maybe scratching your heads right now , but Barbarella is indeed based on a comic book .
A French one by Jean - Claude Forest to be exact .
Of course , it is just another excuse to stick a picture of Jane
Fonda in loose - fitting clothing on our site .
7. Lena Headey
Notable comic book movie appearance : 300 ( 2006 )

Oh , bollocks , wrong movies .
Thing is , being turned into dust particles does n’t work as well , does it ?
4. Milla Jovovich
Notable comic book movie appearance : Ultraviolet ( 2006 )
OK , the movie sucked , but Milla is always worth watching .
3. Emmanuelle Vaugier
Notable comic book movie appearance : Painkiller Jane
The Saw actress even outshines Kristanna Loken in the TV movie of Painkiller Jane .
Not an easy task .
2. Jessica Biel
Notable comic book movie appearance : Blade : Trinity
It was difficult separating Jessica Biel and Jessica Alba for the top spot , but we ’d love to give it a try .
1. Jessica Alba
Notable comic book movie appearances : Sin City , Fantastic Four
Take your pick which role you prefer out of the sexy stripper from Sin City or the angelic Susan Storm in the Fantastic Four , there is no doubt Jessica Alba is one of the hottest women in Hollywood right now .
A slowdown in global economic growth combined with continued problems in credit markets and housing will haunt the economy , Roubini said .
Watch the interview at left .
In addition , he sees hundreds of hedge funds getting wiped out , combining with earningsto provide another weight on stocks .
" I believe that the worst is still ahead of us .
I think that the next few weeks and months are going to be negative surprises on the economy , " he said .
" I think that overall the earnings are going to surprise to the downside . "
An expected short recession will be replaced by a reality of a longer and more drawn - out slowdown , Roubini said .
For investors
" The risk is that it 's not going to be a ' V . '
Frankly , ( the notion that ) there is going to be a short and shallow recession , six to eight months , is out of the window , " he said .
" Right now we are in a ' U ' shaped recession .
It 's going to last at least two years . "
The only good news is that systemic risk in the financial sector , or the idea that damage wo n't be isolated to specific companies but rather will spread through the industry , has been reduced by government intervention , he said .
" But we 're going to have a severe recession .
If this is going to be a two - year recession , that 's not priced by the market .
And there are significant downside risks for the stock market and credit markets in my view , " he said .
" Yes , we 're going to avoid the Great Depression , we 're going to avoid a 10 - year stagnation .
That 's not going to be the case . "

I 'm a 25 - year - old in the middle of my fourth year at a Canadian medical school , blogging about the funny , action - packed , and dramatic moments through the journey of my medical education .
( CNN ) -- Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins spoke with " American Morning " anchor John Roberts on Monday on the status of the presidential campaigns and the weekend 's events leading up to the November 4 vote .
GOP strategist Ed Rollins says Gov. Sarah Palin needs to " gain substance " before she could be elected president .
John Roberts :
It 's eight days here , a final stretch .
Where does [ Sen. John McCain ] find himself ?
Ed Rollins :
It 's a very steep hill .
If he had the money that [ Sen. Barack ]
Obama has and the resources , maybe he could close it .
The problem is , he 's being outspent 5 , 6 to 1 .
[ Democrats have ] a better get - out - the - vote effort .
A lot of their voters have already voted .
And when you put 100,000 people in a place like they did yesterday in Denver , you know there 's an enthusiasm for that campaign .
Roberts :
You know , David Frum , former speechwriter for President Bush , ... wrote in the The Washington Post yesterday that McCain / Palin has alienated the middle of the country .
...
Frum says that they should adopt a different strategy here on the Republican side of things -- to publicly say , listen , we 've lost the White House -- even if they do n't believe it .
Take all the money available , put it into the Senate races and try to prevent the Democrats from getting filibuster - proof majority of the Senate .
Good idea ?
Bad idea ?
Watch what strategy Obama plans »
Rollins :
It 's a good idea if you do n't change your message .
Your message has to be consistent .
And that is basically that Barack and the Democrats are going to raise your taxes , have big spending programs again .
Cut defense by 25 percent , as [ Rep . ]
Barney Frank warned .
...
That 's got to be the message .
The critical thing about the McCain team is how do you want to end up your campaign ?
How do you want to end up your public career ?
Do you want to go out on a happy note ?
Do you want to go out basically saying what you really believe ?
And that 's what I would argue that they should do .
Roberts :
This idea [ that Democrats ] control both houses of Congress and the White House from one party would be a bad thing -- is that an argument that can gain traction in this country ?
Can you , with eight days left , instill the idea in people 's minds it is not a good thing ?
Rollins :
It 's awful hard at this point in time .
I think to a certain extent , people are willing to take a change .
And if the change is moving in one direction , they 're not so convinced that Barack and his team can't do a better job than the Republicans have done over the last eight years .
Watch how McCain makes a final push for the presidency »
Roberts :
Of course , the other big story over the weekend was apparently a split between the McCain camp and the [ Sarah ] Palin camp .
Some grumblings from inside she 's not listening to them .
One aide told CNN , quote , " She 's a diva .
She takes no advice from anyone .
She 's playing for her own future and sees herself as the next leader of the party . "
What do you hear ?
Rollins :
Well , I hear the same things .
The key thing is , you 've got to stop that .
You 've got to basically say , " All right governor , how do you want to end your last week here ?
We want you on our team .
Here 's what Sen. McCain 's going to say .
Here 's what we would like you to say and where you 'd like to go .
Let 's cut out all the bickering . "
Roberts :
Is she is wrong for doing that ?
Was she mishandled ?
Rollins : Sure , she was mishandled .
There 's no question she was mishandled the first few weeks of this campaign , and I think to a certain extent she 's become a target of a lot of ridicule .
This is a very popular , very effective person .
So --
Roberts :
What 's your sense ?
Could she be the future of this party ?
Rollins :
She definitely is going to be the most popular Republican in this country when this thing is over .
She 'll basically spend the next three of four years , running around doing Lincoln Day dinners and raising money for people .
She 's got to gain a lot of substance before she 's a viable candidate for president .
Roberts :
So , you 're thinking a shot at 2012 ?
Rollins : I do n't doubt that she has that ability .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • Election Campaigns
Back in August , the Transportation Safety Administration relaxed its rules for getting your laptop through the security checkpoint .
Essentially , the rules say that a laptop can stay in its bag , as long as the X - Ray machine has a clear and unobstructed view of the computer .
There can be no pockets , zippers or items blocking its view of what is inside the laptop .
Several manufacturers immediately announced that they would have their own TSA friendly bags on shelves within a few months .
The first of them to actually deliver on that promise , is Tom Bihn with the new Checkpoint Flyer .
Tom Bihn is not your average luggage company .
For starters , they still make their bags in the United States , Tom Bihn himself is in charge of designing them , and they are hand made in their Seattle factory .
The end result is something unlike any bag I ’ve ever seen .
The Checkpoint Flyer comes in three color combinations and three sizes ;
Black / Crimson
Black / Steel
Black / Black .
The different sizes are designed based on the Apple Macbook dimensions of 13 , 15 and 17 inches .
Fear not though , because these sizes mean the bag will fit virtually any laptop on the market , and I had no problem fitting a “ normal ” 15 ″ Dell inside it .
The bag has 2 pockets on the front , 2 on the back , a cavernous storage pouch ( with 2 internal pockets ) and of course , the special laptop portion .
The rear pocket zips open on the bottom for sliding it over the handles of a rolling suitcase .
To open the bag for inspection , you simply unclip to latches on the bottom , and flip the entire laptop bag out .
Tom Bihn really found the perfect and most efficient way to do this , because in the few attempts I made , I was able to open the bag in a matter of seconds .
The laptop portion of the bag stays secure when you carry it , because its handle slips through a slot in the top of the bag , becoming the second handle on the top .
Yes , the description sounds complicated , but I can assure you it is something you can do without needing a manual .
Tom Bihn have made a short video clip on their site outlining the steps for opening the bag .
As I mentioned earlier , the quality of the bag is simply amazing .
I always considered myself a bit of a laptop bag “ snob ” , and have regularly purchased expensive bags to protect my goodies , but none of them are as well designed and well made as the Checkpoint Flyer .
All the zippers on the top are splashproof thanks to special YKK zippers .
The material feels bulletproof and I absolutely adore the color combination ( I have the crimson / black version ) .
Of course , the real test happens at the airport , and I am happy to report that things actually went smooth ; on a flight from Chicago to Amsterdam the bag unfolded and went through the X - Ray machine without any TSA agents yelling and screaming .
And to be honest , it was n’t the bag I was fearing , it was lack of training of the TSA agents .
Thankfully most of them seem to have received the memo , and the bag was able to pass security without running the risk of losing a laptop .
Unfortunately , the airport sterile zone is not the kind of place where you can pull out your camera and photograph what is happening , so you ’ll have to settle for some photos made on my patio .
Of course , the new regulations are not just for our enjoyment , a recent report claims that passengers at US airports lose almost 12,000 laptops every single week , and while I personally doubt those claims a little , laptops DO get left behind at the X - Ray machine more often than in the past when they could just stay in their bag .
The Tom Bihn Checkpoint Flyer costs $ 220 .
When you purchase the bag , you ’ll want to add some accessories .
The bags are currently on pre-order , but these orders are shipping out fairly quickly .
The bag does not come with a shoulder strap , so be prepared to add an additional $ 20 or $ 30 to the purchase price depending on the version of strap you order .
On the bag I reviewed , I tested the “ Absolute Shoulder Strap “ .
This simple looking strap has a stretchy shoulder pad , which acts as a shock absorber , greatly reducing the load on your shoulder .
Other accessories to consider are the Tom Bihn “ Horizontal Freudian Slip ” ( $ 35 ) .
This insert increases the number of pockets in the bag including space for pens , folders and electronic gadgets .
When you arrive at your destination , or simply need access to some of your items at the airport , you can pull the entire slip out of the bag .
Finally , Tom Bihn also has 2 different packing cubes ( $ 18 each or $ 30 for the pair ) .
While these may also be of the same excellent quality of the rest of the items , I ’m not sure the price can be justified unless you are going for an “ all Tom Bihn ” look for your bag .
The cubes are quite handy though , and they hold a large amount of stuff which is especially handy for bundling your cords or other loose items .
My conclusion is simple ; this is a fantastic bag .
It holds all the stuff I carry , and I do n’t have to keep a constant eye on a $ 2500 laptop leaving my sight in a plastic tub .
I ’m absolutely in love with the style and the attention to detail Tom Bihn has put into designing it .
There is no denying that $ 220 ( plus some more for the accessories ) is more than many people are willing to spend on a laptop bag , but if you are a frequent traveler , you ’ll want to seriously consider investing in a bag that can speed things up at the checkpoint , and make you look cool at the same time .

Big differences in candidates ' education plans
Here 's the biggest difference between the education plans of presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama : $ 18 billion .
That 's how much more Democrat Obama says he 'd spend than Republican McCain to transform schools , from quadrupling the number of kids eligible for public preschool programs to strengthening long - neglected science education .
Obama claims he can implement his long list of reforms without raising the federal deficit .
McCain 's package would add less than $ 1 billion to the education budget .
His message is about doing more with the nearly $ 70 billion in federal education funding already flowing to California and the other states : giving principals more say over funds while redirecting cash to online schools , home schools and tuition vouchers .
" McCain is really distinctive - his program is minimalist , featuring choice and efficiency , " said Mike Kirst , professor emeritus of education at Stanford University and former president of the California Board of Education .
" Obama 's is more robust , with significant investments focusing on disadvantaged , low - achieving children . "
McCain proposes to freeze education spending as part of his plan to suspend and scrutinize all non-military discretionary spending for one year , while Obama has said he would cut costs elsewhere in the federal budget - such as auctioning off surplus federal property and reforming federal contracting procedures - to finance his plan .
The stark differences between the candidates ' education plans can best be seen in their vision for the nation 's youngest children .
While Obama would sink the bulk of his added funding into " a preschool agenda that begins at birth , " McCain wants to improve efforts already under way .
" There is no shortage of federal programs targeted at early child care and preschool , " says McCain 's Web site , which advocates developing the best of what 's out there .
Obama to boost Head Start
For example , if a Head Start program succeeds at preparing children for kindergarten , it might be dubbed a " Center for Excellence . "
It could become eligible for at least $ 200,000 per year to expand and show other Head Starts how to do business .
Obama 's
Web site offers more details - and more dollars .
Obama would plow $ 10 billion into programs for children from birth to age 5 .
Among the proposals are tax credits for child care , more training for Head Start employees , funding for states that adopt universal preschool and quadrupling enrollment in " Early Head Start " for children under 4 .
Asked why Obama would steer most of his education package toward children who have yet to set foot in school , campaign spokeswoman Nayyera Haq said that half of poor children start school two years behind their peers and rarely catch up .
The idea , she said , is to try and close the gap before it begins .
" It 's never too early , " Haq said .
No Child Left Behind
Meanwhile , neither candidate discloses specific changes for the centerpiece of federal education policy : No Child Left Behind .
The bipartisan act says all students must score " proficient " in English and math by 2014 .
Schools failing to make " adequate yearly progress " toward that goal risk such penalties as closure or take - over by an outside agency .
Obama seeks substantive changes : defining school success as steady annual improvement ( rather than requiring schools to reach a certain proficiency level each year ) ; letting schools go beyond multiple - choice tests to evaluate students ; and adding science to the mix of subjects on which schools are judged .
Flaws and benefits
He also joins critics of the federal law who say it is an unfunded mandate .
But he does n't say how much money he 'd direct toward helping schools meet the goals .
Obama voted in 2005 to boost its funding by $ 5 billion ; McCain opposed the increase , and the measure died .
Both campaigns praise the law 's intent , which is to hold schools accountable for academic success .
But while Obama points to its flaws , McCain highlights its benefits .
" No Child Left Behind has revealed enormous information about the performance of schools , down to the individual student , " said Doug Holtz - Eakin , McCain 's senior policy adviser .
The law " has focused our attention on the realities of how students perform against a common standard , " the campaign says .
Split on vouchers
McCain also touts private school choice , and would expand a $ 13 million tuition voucher program in Washington , D.C. , by $ 7 million .
That 's in keeping with his austere approach :
While praising the program and noting that 7,000 families have applied for it , McCain acknowledges that fewer than 1,000 additional families would benefit under his plan .
Obama opposes tuition vouchers as a drain on public resources , says his campaign .
Vouchers have repeatedly failed to win over voters in California and across the nation .
And Congress has not approved vouchers , an early cornerstone of President Bush 's education plan .
Support for teachers
McCain endorses other forms of choice , such as online tutoring and Internet courses in math and science .
He proposes competitive grants and other federal funding to help states develop those approaches .
Both candidates support attracting more qualified teachers with financial perks .
McCain would steer 60 percent of federal Title II money ( for teacher training and recruitment ) toward bonuses for teachers who work in high - need settings or have exceeded performance goals .
Among the teacher initiatives Obama lays out is a $ 1 billion grant program for experienced teachers who mentor novices .
Cato's Letter No. 25
Considerations on the destructive Spirit of arbitrary Power .
With the Blessings of Liberty , and our own Constitution
Thomas Gordon ( Saturday , April 15 , 1721 )
It is the hard fate of the world , that there should be any difference in the views and interests of the governors and governed ; and yet it is so in most countries .
Men who have a trust frankly bestowed upon them by the people , too frequently betray that trust , become conspirators against their benefactors , and turn the sword upon those who gave it ; insomuch that in the greatest part of the earth , people are happy if they can defend themselves against their defenders .
Let us look round this great world , and behold what an immense majority of the whole race of men crouch under the yoke of a few tyrants , naturally as low as the meanest of themselves , and , by being tyrants , worse than the worst ; who , as Mr. Sidney observes , use their subjects like asses and mastiff dogs , to work and to fight , to be oppressed and killed for them .
Even the good qualities and courage of such subjects are their misfortune , by strengthening the wicked hands of their brutal masters , and strengthening their own chains .
Tyrants consider their people as their cattle , and use them worse , as they fear them more .
Thus the most of mankind are become the wretched slaves of those , who are or should be their own creatures ; they maintain their haughty masters like gods , and their haughty masters often use them like dogs :
A fine specimen of gratitude and duty !
Yet this cruel spirit in tyrants is not always owing naturally to the men , since they are naturally like other men ; but it is owing to the nature of the dominion which they exercise .
Good laws make a good prince , if he has a good understanding ; but the best men grow mischievous when they are set above laws .
Claudius was a very harmless man , while he was a private man ; but when he came to be a tyrant , he proved a bloody one , almost as bloody as his nephew and predecessor Caligula ; who had also been a very good subject , but when he came to be the Roman emperor , grew the professed executioner of mankind .
There is something so wanton and monstrous in lawless power , that there scarce ever was a human spirit that could bear it ; and the mind of man , which is weak and limited , ought never to be trusted with a power that is boundless .
The state of tyranny is a state of war ; and where it prevails , instead of an intercourse of confidence and affection , as between a lawful prince and his subjects , nothing is to be seen but jealousy , mistrust , fear , and hatred :
An arbitrary prince and his slaves often destroy one another , to be safe :
They are continually plotting against his life ; he is continually shedding their blood , and plundering them of their property .
Cuncta ferit , dum cuncta timet .
I think it was Justinian , the Emperor , who said , " Though we are above the law , yet we live according to the law . "
But , by his Majesty 's favour , there was more turn than truth in the saying ; for princes that think themselves above law , act almost constantly against all law ; of which truth Justinian himself is a known instance .
Good princes never think themselves above it .
It is an affecting observation , that the power given for the protection of the world , should , in so many places , be turned to the destruction of it .
" As if the law was in force for their destruction , and not for their preservation ; that it should have power to kill , but not to protect , them : A thing no less horrid , than if the sun should burn us without lighting us , or the earth serve only to bury , and not feed and nourish us , "
says Mr. Waller in a speech of his in Parliament .
Despotick power has defaced the Creation , and laid the world waste .
In the finest countries in Asia , formerly full of people , you are now forced to travel by the compass :
There are no roads , houses , nor inhabitants .
The sun is left to scorch up the grass and fruits , which it had raised ; or the rain to rot them :
The gifts of God are left to perish ; there being none of his creatures , neither man nor beast , left to use and consume them .
The Grand Seignior , who ( if we may believe some sanctified mouths , not addicted to lying ) is the vicegerent of heaven , frustrates the bounty of heaven ; and , being the father of his people , has almost butchered them all .
Those few ( comparatively very few ) who have yet survived the miserable fate of their brethren , and are reserved for sacrifices to his cruelty , as occasion offers , and his lust prompts him , live the starving and wretched property of ravenous and bloody bashaws ; whose duty to their master , as well as their own avarice , obliges them to keep the people , over whom they preside , poor and miserable .
But neither bashaws , nor armies , could keep that people in such abject slavery , if their priests and doctors had not made passive obedience a principle of their religion .
The holy name of God is profaned , and his authority belied , to bind down wretchedness upon his creatures , and to secure the tyrant that does it .
The most consummate of all wickedness , and the highest of all evils , are sanctified by the teachers of religion , and made by them a part of it .
Yes , Turkish slavery is confirmed , and Turkish tyranny defended , by religion !
Sir Paul Ricaut tells us , that the Turks maintain , " That the Grand Seignior can never be deposed , or made accountable for his crimes , whilst he destroys carelessly of his subjects under a hundred a day " : ' Tis made martyrdom to die submissively by the hand of the tyrant ; and some of his highest slaves have declared that they wanted only that honour to complete their felicity .
They hold , that it is their duty to submit , though their tyrant " command a whole army of them to precipitate themselves from a rock , or to build a bridge with piles of their bodies for him to pass a river , or to kill one another to afford him pastime and pleasure . "
Merciful God !
Is this government !
And do such governors govern by authority from thee !
It is scarce credible what Monsieur de L'Estoille tells us :
He says he travelled in the Indies for above twenty days together , through lanes of people hanged upon trees , by command of the King ; who had ordered above a hundred thousand of them to be thus murdered and gibbeted , only because two or three robberies had been committed amongst them .

It is one of the great evils of servitude , that let the tyranny be ever so severe , 'tis always flattered ; and the more severe ' tis , the more 'tis flattered .
The oppressors of mankind are flattered beyond all others ; because fear and servitude naturally produce , as well as have recourse to , flattery , as the best means of self - preservation ; whereas liberty , having no occasion for it , scorns it .
Sir Paul Ricaut ascribes the decay of the Ottoman Empire to the force of flattery , and calls the Turkish court , a prison and banniard of slaves .
Old Muley , the Lord 's anointed of Morocco , who it seems is still alive , is thought to have butchered forty thousand of his subjects with his own hands .
Such a father is he of his people !
And yet his right to shed human blood being a genuine characteristick of the church of Morocco , as by law established , people are greedy to die by his hand ; which , they are taught to imagine , dispatches them forthwith to paradise : Insomuch that , though , as I am told , every time he mounts his horse , he slices off the head of the slave that holds his stirrup , to shew that he is as good an executioner as he is a horseman , yet there is a constant contention among his slaves , who shall be the happy martyr on that occasion ; so that several of them crowding to his stirrup at once , for the gracious favour , his Majesty has sometimes the honour to cut off two heads , and to make two saints , with one blow .
The exercise of despotick power is the unrelenting war of an armed tyrant upon his unarmed subjects : it is a war of one side , and in it there is neither peace nor truce .
Tacitus describes it , Saeva jussa , continuas accusationes , fallaces amicitias , perniciem innocentium : " Cruel and bloody orders , continual accusations , faithless friendships , and the destruction of innocents . "
In another place he says , that
" Italy was one continual shambles , and most of its fair cities were defaced or overthrown ;
Rome itself was in many places laid in ashes , with the greatest part of its magnificent buildings : virtue was despised , and barefaced debauchery prevailed .
The solitary islands were filled with illustrious exiles , and the very rocks were stained with slaughters : but , in the city itself , cruelty raged still more ; it was dangerous to be noble , it was a crime to be rich , it was capital to have borne honours , and high treason to have refused them ; and for virtue and merit , they brought sure and sudden destruction . "
These were some of the ravages of absolute dominion !
And as to the common people , the same author says , " They were debauched and dispirited , and given up to idleness and seeing shews . "

Oh ! abject state of such as tamely groan
Under a blind dependency on one !
This is a sort of government , which is too great and heavy a curse for any one to wish , even upon those who are foolish enough , or wicked enough , to contend for its lawfulness ; or , which is the same thing , for submission to it :
But surely , if ever any man deserved to feel the merciless gripesof tyranny , it is he who is an advocate for it .
Phalaris acted justly , when he hanselled his brazen bull with the wretch who invented it .
As arbitrary power in a single person has made greater havock in human nature , and thinned mankind more , than all the beasts of prey and all the plagues and earthquakes that ever were ; let those men consider what they have to answer for , who would countenance such a monstrous evil in the world , or would oppose those that would oppose it .
A bear , a lion , or a tiger , may now and then pick up single men in a wood , or a desert ; an earthquake sometimes may bury a thousand or two inhabitants in the ruins of a town ; and the pestilence may once in many years carry off a much greater number :
But a tyrant shall , out of a wanton personal passion , carry fire and sword through a whole continent , and deliver up a hundred thousand of his fellow creatures to the slaughter in one day , without any remorse or further notice , than that they died for his glory .
I say nothing of the moral effect of tyranny ; though ' tis certain that ignorance , vice , poverty , and vileness , always attend it .
He who compares the world now with what it was formerly , how populous once , how thin now ; and considers the cause of this doleful alteration , will find just reason to fear , that spiritual and temporal tyranny , if they go on much longer , will utterly extinguish the human race .
Of Turkey I have spoken already :
The great continent of America is almost unpeopled , the Spaniards having destroyed , tis thought , about forty millions of its natives ; and for some kingdoms in Europe , especially towards the north , I do not believe that they have now half the inhabitants that they had so lately as a hundred years ago .
Blessed be God , there are still some free countries in Europe , that abound with people and with plenty , and England is the foremost .
This demonstrates the inestimable blessing of liberty .
Can we ever over - rate it , or be too jealous of a treasure which includes in it almost all human felicities ?
Or can we encourage too much those that contend for it , and those that promote it ?
It is the parent of virtue , pleasure , plenty , and security ; and 'tis innocent , as well as lovely .
In all contentions between liberty and power , the latter has almost constantly been the aggressor .
Liberty , if ever it produce any evils , does also cure them :
Its worst effect , licentiousness , never does , and never can , continue long .
Anarchy cannot be of much duration : and where 'tis so , it is the child and companion of tyranny ; which is not government , but a dissolution of it , as tyrants are the enemies of mankind .
Power is like fire ; it warms , scorches , or destroys , according as it is watched , provoked , or increased .
It is as dangerous as useful .
Its only rule is the good of the people ; but because it is apt to break its bounds , in all good governments nothing , or as little as may be , ought to be left to chance , or the humours of men in authority :
All should proceed by fixed and stated rules , and upon any emergency , new rules should be made .
This is the constitution , and this the happiness of Englishmen ; as hath been formerly shewn at large in these letters .
We have a constitution that abhors absolute power ; we have a King that does not desire it ; and we are a people that will never suffer it :
No free people will ever submit to it , unless it steal upon them by treachery , or they be driven into it by violence .
But a state can never be too secure against this terrible , this last of all human evils ; which may be brought upon them by many causes , even by some that at first sight do not seem to threaten any such thing :
And of all those causes , none seems more boding than a general distress , which certainly produces general discontent , the parent of revolutions ; and in what such a circumstance of affairs may end , no man can ever foresee :
Few are brought about without armies ; a remedy almost always worse than the disease .
What is got by soldiers , must be maintained by soldiers ; and we have , in this paper , already seen the frightful image of a military government ; a government , which , at best , is violent and bloody , and eternally inconsistent with law and property .
It is therefore a dreadful wickedness to have any share in giving occasion for those discontents , which are so apt to burst into rage and confusion .
A state sometimes recovers out of a convulsion , and gains new vigour by it ; but it much oftener expires in it .
Heaven preserve me from ever beholding contending armies in England !
They are different things from what they once were .
Our armies formerly were only a number of the people armed occasionally ; and armies of the people are the only armies which are not formidable to the people .
Hence it is , that , in the many revolutions occasioned by the strife between the two royal houses of York and Lancaster , there never was any danger of slavery from an armed force :
A single battle decided the contention ; and next day these popular soldiers went home , and resumed their ordinary arms , the tools of husbandry .
But since that time armies have not been so easily parted with ; but after the danger was over for which they were raised , have often been obstinately kept up , and by that means created dangers still as great .
Some quacks in politicks may perhaps venture publick disturbances , out of an opinion that they shall be able to prevent them by art , or suppress them by force .
But this shews their capacity , as well as their wickedness :
For , not to mention the malignity of their hearts , in risking publick ruin , to gratify a private appetite ; how can any event be certainly foreseen , when the measure of the cause cannot be certainly known ?
They can never ascertain the degree of opposition ; they cannot foreknow what circumstances may happen , nor into whose hands things may fall .
Cicero did not dream , when he employed Octavius for the commonwealth , that his young champion for liberty would ever be the tyrant of his country .
Who could foresee that Cromwell would enslave those whom he was employed to defend ?
But there is no trusting of liberty in the hands of men , who are obeyed by great armies .
From hence may be seen what a fatal and crying crime it would be , in any free country , to break the confidence between the prince and his people .
When loyalty is once turned into indifference , indifference will soon be turned into hatred ; hatred will be returned with hatred ; resentment may produce tyranny , and rage may produce rebellion .
There is no mischief which this mutual mistrust and aversion may not bring forth .
They must therefore be the blackest traitors , who are the first authors of so terrible an evil , as are they who would endeavour to protect them .
Henry III of Castile said , that he feared the curse of his people more than he did the arms of his enemies :
In which saying he shewed as much wisdom as humanity ; since , while he was beloved at home , he had nothing to fear from abroad , and the curses of his subjects were the likeliest means to bring upon him the arms of his enemies .
