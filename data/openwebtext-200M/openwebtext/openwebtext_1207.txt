Issue # 120 • November / December , 2009
A year or more ago in these pages , I made the suggestion that sometimes less is more , and usually shooters with less powerful guns with which they are more skilled , will shoot better than if they had a bigger , more powerful firearm that kicked the heck out of them every time it went off .
I have n’t changed my opinion in the intervening months , and I ’d like to focus on the shotgun side of that .
The most popular shotgun in the United States , in the memory of any living American , has been the 12 - gauge .
It throws seven - eighths of an ounce to an ounce or more of lead , whether that heavy metal is distributed in tiny birdshot pellets , or big buckshot pellets , or the single humongous projectile that is known in the trade as a slug .
And , if you ’ve ever shot one with a full - power shell in the chamber , you know that a 12 - gauge kicks like heck .
Guns which recoil that hard will , in turn , beat the heck out of the shooter and make them hesitant to pull the trigger .
This leads to the phenomena firearms instructors refer to as “ flinching ” and “ jerking , ” convulsive body movements done in anticipation of pain and impact , which move the gun at the instant of firing and cause the shot to miss the target !
Now , I ’m not a professor of logic or anything , but I have studied that discipline , and it ’s part and parcel of what I have in fact taught for most of my life , which has been the use of things such as firearms in high stress situations .
Math was never my best subject , but even I can figure out that a smaller charge of lead that hits will get a lot more accomplished on the business end than a larger serving of lead that misses the intended recipient .
Left , 20 - gauge shells ; right , 12 - gauge .
Author prefers larger bores for waterfowl with steel shot , and for slug use in bear country , feels milder - kicking 20 is adequate for most other needs .
The formulae I ’ve been shown by the ammo companies I have dealt with for decades as one or another kind of gun editor for gun magazines show that the average 20 - gauge shotgun load ( five - eighths of an ounce of lead ) will deliver to the shooter ’s body via his or her shoulder only 55 % of the recoil as a one - ounce charge of lead from a 20 - gauge .
Yet the lead delivered on target at the same velocity from a 20 - gauge is 62.5 % of the payload brought to impact by the one - ounce charge from a 12 - gauge .
Did I mention math was my worst subject ?
OK … but even I can figure out that 55 % of the debit in return for 62.5 % of the credit is a 7.5 % better deal .
Now , I ’m not going to ask you to trade your 12 - gauge for a 20 - gauge for a 7.5 % better return when you ’re shooting .
I ’m not an investment counselor either , but if my financial advisor offered me a new plan that gave me 7.5 % better return than what I was previously using I would run , not walk , to his office to sign up for the new deal .
Now , let me expand on that same analogy .
Suppose that better investment plan also transferred to my spouse and my children , but the older investment plan only covered me .
Would that change where I put my money ?
You bet , and I ’m sure it ’s the same for you .
I ’m an average size adult male .
I grew up shooting 12 - gauge shotguns since I was a little kid , and that was the only type of shotgun available to me in 35 years in law enforcement , because the 12 had been the standard chambering for police shotguns since long before I was even born , and remains such .
I ’m comfortable with the 12 - gauge .
I ’ve taken meat home with it .
I ’ve taken trophies home from matches with it .
I ’ve taken felons at gunpoint with it .
But I ’m also the prototypical adult male human that the 12 - gauge shotgun was designed for , and I might not be the only one using the gun .
My little girls grew up discovering that they could shoot the 20 - gauge a lot better than they could shoot the 12 .
My current consort is a petite female who loves to shoot her 20 - gauge semiautomatic shotgun and hates to shoot any of my 12 - gauges .
Whether we ’re going to the hunting field together or defending a household together , which would be the best choice for them to have available ?
Duh …let me think .
Versatility factor
Back in the 1950s , shotgun guru Francis E. Sell was the champion of the 20 - gauge and led a renaissance of its popularity in the hunting fields .
Yes , the lighter recoil was a factor , but more important to him seemed to be the fact that guns made for smaller cartridges were smaller and lighter themselves , and thus handled better .
A light 20 swung faster on a flying bird than a heavier 12 of the same style , and even of the same make and model .
Sell did much to popularize the 3 ″ Magnum 20 - gauge load .
This came very close to a 12 - gauge in pellet payload , and in power …and , unfortunately , in recoil .
But there was still the smaller , lighter gun to swing on the fast - flying target and , therefore , better hit potential .
Author thinks the 20 - gauge semiautomatic is a compellingly practical shotgun .
Left , the reasonably priced Remington Model 1100 Special Field with short “ youth stock ; ” right , the more elegant and commensurately more expensive Benelli Ultra Light .
Francis E. Sell did a lot of “ pass shooting ” long range shots at high - flying ducks and geese and he proved to the satisfaction of many that properly sized lead birdshot out of a 20 - gauge Magnum would drop big waterfowl at reasonably long range as well as the universal standard 12 - gauge .
It ’s an interesting historical artifact , but what changed everything was the long - ago switch away from lead that was legally
mandated for waterfowl hunting .
Lead shot that missed the birds was said to be collecting at the bottom of the swamps and the rivers and the lakes , and killing other birds who ingested it .
As soon as steel and other replacement shot came in not dense enough to penetrate deeply through the feathers and relatively tough flesh of ducks and geese , the way lead shot did it became a game of using enough big pellets to cleanly kill the birds with the new metallurgy of choice .
Thus came the return of the ancient 10 - gauge Magnum , which in effect threw as many pellets with one pull of the trigger as a standard 12 - gauge did with two .
Thus came also the creation of the 3 ½ ” 12 - gauge Magnum shell , which pretty much duplicated the payload of the giant 10 - gauge .
The much smaller 20 - gauge , at that time , became pretty close to obsolete for use on ducks and geese .
So , let ’s accept as a given for purposes of this article , that if waterfowl are on the family menu and thus one of the job descriptions of the family shotgun , the 20 - gauge may not be the ideal choice .
However , there are still upland birds such as pheasant and partridge .
There is still small game such as rabbit and squirrel .
With rifled slug loads , there is deer harvesting .
And of course , there is home defense .
And for all of that , the easy - carrying , easy - handling , light - kicking 20 - gauge seems to do just fine .
Rochester , Indiana .
A petite young woman who grew up in the country aims carefully , presses the trigger of her shotgun , and sends a 20 - gauge rifled slug through the chest of a large whitetail buck .
The deer drops virtually in his tracks .
There will be venison hanging to cure in the family barn tonight .
Bow , New Hampshire .
The pheasant rises from the cornfield in a startling explosion of beating wings .
A 20 - gauge shotgun swings on the bird , and the proverbial shot rings out .
Feathers puff away from the bird , which drops in a slow arc into the field .
He will be the centerpiece of a New England family ’s supper tonight .
Dade County , Florida .
A bipedal predator strikes … and a law - abiding armed citizen decides not to be a victim .
The victim presses the trigger of a 20 - gauge shotgun , and the predator drops like the dead meat he has just become .
His heart and lungs and aorta have been shredded , and some of the lead has reached through to the backbone and cut the spinal cord .
Venison on the table .
Prime fowl on the table .
Someone alive to sit at the table to eat with their family and partake of Nature ’s bounty , when a monster might have kept that family from ever eating together again if his depredations had not been decisively stopped .
The 20 - gauge shotgun can deliver all of that .
Choices
In past issues of Backwoods Home we ’ve discussed the various types and mechanisms of guns , and the fact that you get what you pay for .
That ’s as true of the 20 - gauge as it is of any other size of shotgun .
Soft recoil of 20 - gauge gas - operated autoloader is evident here .
Spent shell from last shot is visible ( arrow ) near top of photo , but Remington is almost back on target already from kneeling position .
Load was full power 5 /8 - ounce rifled slug , .62 caliber .
There are single shot shotguns , capable of firing only one time before they must be manually reloaded .
In centuries past , that was all there was , and they sufficed as best they could .
But if the first shot is a miss , and the second shot could be a hit , does it make any sense to eliminate the possibility of that next shot ?
This is why as soon as double barrel and , later , “ repeating ” shotguns became available , the single shot was deemed obsolete .
They have remained in production primarily because they are the cheapest to manufacture for the entry - level market .
There are double barrel shotguns , which can be fired twice before reloading .
In the game fields , many of us believe that if you ca n’t do it with two shots , you ca n’t do it at all , and hosing a flight of birds with shot pellets is more irresponsible than sportsmanlike .
However , if your first shot has only wounded the bird and you have no other , you cannot fulfill your responsibility to your quarry to kill it cleanly , or your responsibility to feed your family tonight .
Two months ago , on a clay target range in Orlando , Florida , I missed my first shot on the flying artificial “ bird . ”
I shattered it with the second , triggered instantly from a Beretta semiautomatic shotgun .
That ’s the difference .
There are slide action shotguns , which require you to use your forward hand to pump the action mechanism back and then forward again , hence the terminology “ pump gun . ”
They are rugged and low - maintenance and , in experienced hands , deadly fast .
They can also hold as many shells as the tubular magazine under the gun ’s barrel can be lengthened to hold , and they are cheaper than semiautomatics to manufacture .
This is why they have so long been a staple with the police , the military , and the sportsmen , as well as those who live off the land .
However , for rapid follow - up shots to be reflexive , the given shooter has to have a lot of experience operating that slide action .
Competitive shooters get that experience .
So do those of us who grew up running pump guns in the game fields .
So do cops who are drilled with these guns over and over in the Police Academy .
If you , or any member of your family who is likely to use the shotgun , have n’t had this movement pattern drilled into them , the pump gun may not be the best choice of the one shotgun to have available in the household .
Finally , there are semiautomatic shotguns , which use the force generated by the last shot ’s discharge to cycle the next shotgun shell into the firing chamber .
They can be fired as fast as the shooter can pull the trigger for each shot .
Semiautomatics in turn branch into two mechanism types , gas - operated and recoil - or inertia - operated designs .
Let ’s take a look at one for a moment …
One good example
I recently had the pleasure of spending several weeks with the new Benelli Ultra Light 20 - gauge semiautomatic shotgun .
If I was still the teenage kid I once was , who loved the upland game fields so much that after school I ’d drive to the cornfields to hunt pheasant , I would have ponied up the $ 1529 for this splendid piece of sporting equipment in a New York minute .
This sweet little scattergun weighs only 5.2 pounds , which means that when you pick it up it feels as if it ’s going to float out of your grasp .
It balances sweetly between the hands , and experienced shotgunners describe it as “ lively , ” a term that in that context means that it swings effortlessly and points where you look .
The trigger pull is clean and smooth .
It ’s also a simply gorgeous firearm .
The walnut stock is exquisitely burled , and covered with an invisible coating that Benelli calls Weather Coat™ , and insists will not get waterlogged and warmed in the most drenching rain .
The action runs as smooth as glass ( forgive the cliché , but it ’s true ) as you chamber a shell from the magazine .
It ’s not hard to disassemble , and it ’s downright easy to clean .
Benelli uses an action concept they call “ Inertia - Driven . ”
Unlike gas - operated semiautomatics , which have tubes that channel the expanding gases of the rapidly - burning gunpowder back to the mechanism to cycle it , this system leaves most of the dirt and debris of carbon and unburnt powder in the barrel where it ’s easy to swab out , instead of in the mechanism where it ’s really a chore to clean .
Steve Sager demonstrates controllability of Benelli Ultra Light .
Spent casing from full power shell is airborne , but muzzle is still on target , and gun has already recycled for next shot .
This is not to say that the Ultra Light is the perfect shotgun .
Lacking both a gas mechanism to cushion the recoil and weight mass to soak up the “ kick , ” it comes back on the shooter with a bit of a snap .
In the excitement of dropping the bird that will be the centerpiece of tonight ’s dinner table , this probably wo n’t bother you .
Firing hundreds of rounds at a clay bird match or a shotgun training course may be a different story .
The blue finish is lovely , the walnut “ furniture ” fore and aft is beautiful , but I noticed that the stock did n’t quite mate with the receiver ( frame ) in perfect harmony .
I could have lived with all that if I still hunted pheasants and partridges .
But , I have n’t for decades .
Each user ’s needs determine the equipment he or she will choose .
The one thing that kept me from buying this nice little Benelli was that to keep its weight as light as it is , the designers included a very short magazine tube and fore - end .
This means it holds only three shells , two in the magazine and a third in the chamber , and my local gunsmith does n’t see any way to extend that magazine .
That would be fine with me if I was looking for a pure sporting shotgun .
For an all - around gun , whose total job description might include home defense , three shots is a bit on the short side .
No police department ever trained its field troops better with shotguns than the LAPD , and on the street with their slide - action Ithaca Model 37s , that department ’s cops amassed an impressive hit ratio of 58 % .
That is , roughly six out of ten of their shotgun blasts hit the violent , dangerous criminals those well - trained cops were aiming at .
Now , presume that you ’re not as well - trained or as stress - inoculated as the average LAPD officer , and perhaps you ’re facing three home invaders .
In the county where I live , there has been a string of nine recent home invasions , all involving at least three perpetrators , probably from the same outlaw crew .
Let ’s see … three deadly targets that must be instantly neutralized … only one shot available for each … 58 % hit potential …carry the one …
Simple calculation tells me I want more firepower on hand if I have to point a shotgun at the door to “ repel boarders ” who represent an immediate threat of death or great bodily harm to me and mine .
Selecting the shotgun
If your only need for a shotgun is trap or skeet or sporting clays shooting , you can go in one direction .
If your only need is home defense , you ’ll probably end up going in a markedly different direction in your shotgun choice .
And , if you ’re not a “ gun person ” but just someone who loves the rural lifestyle and has decided that just one firearm is needed in the home , you might take a third tack .
Let ’s look at the latter situation .
For the person who wants only one all - around shotgun , I would respectfully suggest a gas - operated semiautomatic 20 - gauge .
Yes , you ’ll have to clean it more often , but if you live on a rural homestead , you ’re already accustomed to taking care of your equipment , and each time you disassemble the gun as per the clearly written factory manual , you ’ll become that much more familiar with it and , therefore , that much more comfortable with it .
The gas - operated semiautomatic is much softer kicking than any other shotgun type firing the same shell , for the simple reason that its gas - bleed mechanism that runs the firing cycle is diverting that much more impact away from the shooter ’s shoulder .
If you have n’t shot different types of shotguns of the same weight with the same shells , you really can’t appreciate how much “ kick ” the gas - operated semiautomatic soaks up with every shot fired .
The standard 2 ¾ ” 20 - gauge shell , not the more powerful 3 ″ Magnum 20 - gauge load that Francis Sell popularized , will send five - eighths of an ounce of lead out of the muzzle at 1400 to 1600 feet per second depending on the load and barrel length you ’ve chosen .
If you use a single rifled slug projectile , it will be about .62 caliber in diameter .
That translates , basically , to shooting the target twice with a . 44 Magnum in the exact same instant .
Unless you have to shoot tiny pellets of steel instead of lead at a bird flying half a football field away , that ’s the kind of firepower that gets the job done .
There are lots of good semiautomatic shotguns out there , chambered for the 20 - gauge .
My personal favorite is the gas - operated Remington , in the 1100 and 11/87 model series .
The standard models come with five - shell capacity , four in the magazine and one more in the firing chamber .
They also come with magazine plugs to bring the gun down to the same capacity you would have with that neat little Benelli , one in the launch tube and two more in the magazine .
But that ’s only required for waterfowl hunting , and as we ’ve noted , that ’s the one downside to choosing a 20 - gauge in the time of steel and bismuth shot pellets being required for hunting waterfowl .
Google “ Brownell ’s ” and you ’ll find lots of accessories , including extended magazines .
If you ’re buying a “ family shotgun , ” which might be fired by Dad or Mom , by young Sis or young Bro , I would most strongly urge you to order the shotgun with a “ youth stock , ” designed to fit people of shorter stature with shorter arms .
A shotgun with a long “ pull , ” which refers to the distance from gun butt to trigger , will be fine for a tall person with long arms … the sort of person that most guns seem to be built for .
With smaller folks , these dimensions require them to lean back to hold the overly - long firearm steady .
This takes them off balance for swinging on a moving target like a flying supper - bird , and most seriously it makes the gun muzzle jump skyward with the recoil of every shot .
This slows shot - to - shot time in delivering accurate hits .
That ’s the difference between a deer getting away or being consigned to the family larder today … and it can be the difference between stopping the second of two home invaders before he can murder the loved one who had to access the shotgun or not .
It is no trick for the larger person to shoot the shorter - stocked shotgun .
That person simply pulls it tight into the shoulder and brings their eye closer to the sights .
A short - stocked shotgun equals a gun the whole family can use very effectively .
A long - stocked shotgun equals a firearm that only the taller , longer - armed members of the household can use with maximum efficiency , especially in an emergency .
It ’s that simple .
With one finger , Mas demonstrates balance point of Benelli 20 - gauge .
Bottom line
The 20 - gauge shotgun , particularly in the gas - operated semiautomatic version , seems to be one of the best - kept secrets in the firearms world .
About the only thing it ’s not very good for anymore , since heavy lead shot was legally forbidden for waterfowl hunting , is the harvesting of high - flying ducks and geese .
In big bear country , I might also prefer the bigger slugs of a 12 - gauge .
The 20 - gauge will always “ kick ” less than the 12 , and it will handle better and faster on quick - moving upland birds .
With a buckshot load , the standard 20 - gauge shell will fire 20 pellets of # 3 buckshot ( approximately .25 caliber ) , which will penetrate to about the same depth at about the same pattern width as the standard 12 - gauge “ urban load ” of # 4 buckshot , which comprises 27 pellets ( about .23 caliber ) .
The wound paths will be about the same depth and width , and the only difference will be how finely the macerated tissue has been chopped by the projectile paths .
“ Only the Medical Examiner will know for sure , ” and then only when he counts the little lead balls recovered from the body , or the white dots on the X -ray of the corpse .
The 20 - gauge shotgun .
It is offered here for your consideration for the simple reason that it has compelling logic and a strong field history going for it .
Margaret Haywood was struck off as a nurse after she secretly filmed the neglect of elderly patients on an NHS ward .
Four years on , she 's finally been reinstated , and is about to start work
The leaf - strewn streets are empty in the afternoon , and a visitor to this modest terrace cannot be missed ; Margaret Haywood comes to the door and lets me in before I have a chance to knock .
She lives just round the corner from Anfield stadium in Liverpool , but even as she makes a cup of tea , before she sits down on the pale leather sofa , she makes it clear that is not where her loyalties lie .
Three walls in her living room are taken up with framed memorabilia from Goodison Park – a picture of legendary Everton centre - forward Dixie Dean , along with a copy of his birth certificate , a signed team photo and a ticket to a first - team training session .
Light flickers in the fireplace , and the front window is filled with a fresh bouquet of flowers – orange - red roses and lilies .
She is just back from an awards ceremony in London .
" Oh , it was absolutely fabulous , " she says , still enjoying the afterglow .
" Very glitzy and glamorous black - tie event . "
What did she wear ?
" Oh , a long black dress from Monsoon .
Cost me a fortune .
And I had all the bling on as well .
Oh , it was lovely – free - flowing champagne , and a lovely meal .
And then I realised I had to get up on the stage and go and collect my award , and my knees were knocking ! "
The Nursing Standard Patient 's Choice award is just that – an award for the British nurse that patients believe must be recognised for the work she or he has done for them .
The vote is public , and thus unambiguous approval for Haywood , who was , earlier this year , struck off the nursing register for placing her loyalty to patients above her loyalty to colleagues by filming undercover on a failing NHS ward while she worked there between November 2004 and May 2005 .
The resulting Panorama documentary , Undercover Nurses , aired in July 2005 , showed one elderly cancer patient screaming in pain because medication had n't been administered for hours ; incontinent patients left lying in their own urine ; a woman with cancer who did not eat because there was no one to help her ( she died alone , unnoticed ) ;
Ivy , a dehydrated and deaf 96 - year - old who wanted nothing more than to be allowed to go .
Where ?
Haywood asked her .
" To heaven . "
More than 4 million people watched it and more than 2,000 viewers phoned in , questions were asked in the Commons , the Royal College of Nursing began urgent research into issues of patient dignity and a whistleblowers ' hotline was established .
Haywood did not go to work until after she married and had three children ( she has seven grandchildren as well now , ranging in age from 20 months to 19 years ) .
But since she married young , at 19 , that meant she began at 25 in the kitchens of " what used to be called a hospital for mentally handicapped kids – learning disabilities , now " .
Her manager was a psychiatric nurse , and when she told him she had always wanted to be a nurse too , he encouraged her to try .
Her father , a taxi driver , encouraged her too , and when the hospital across the road offered her a training place he was thrilled .
But then he was diagnosed with lung cancer , " probably because of all the smoking the Woodbines he 'd done for years .
And the way it worked out my dad got buried on the Friday and I started my training on the Monday .
And the very first ward I was allocated on was the ward where my dad had died . "
She had a serious wobble .
" I started thinking , ' Can I do this , after all that ? '
And I thought , ' Well , he was happy that I 'd got in , so yes – I 'll do it for him . ' "
She qualified in two years , and worked with the elderly and in orthopaedics before moving to A&E .
Her career since seems to have consisted of a series of happy side - trackings .
She became a registered nurse specialising in intensive care , which she loved .
This was followed by a job managing the occupational health unit at Cammell Lairds shipyard in Birkenhead , then another with a private health company , which sent her all over the country screening Ministry of Defence staff for cardiovascular disease .
After Panorama aired she went to work in a care home in Sheffield , where she became a manager , and then training manager , which she liked so much she has now got herself a teaching qualification .
Along the way she picked up coping strategies – gratefulness for the camaraderie of colleagues , the ability to balance the need to care with the need to stay a step away from complete emotional involvement , and a tendency to chat to patients , tell them jokes , even if they were on life support and could n't hear or reply .
Even " when somebody 's died , you 're encouraged to talk to them as though they 're still here .
I think that helps you deal with it .
So when you 're washing them you say , ' I 'm just going to wash your hands and face now . ' "
Methods of training have changed a great deal since she qualified , and she is ambivalent about the results .
She was pitched straight on to the wards , and taught theory in tandem , to consolidate what she 'd seen and heard ; these days , she says , nurses can receive up to 18 months of theory , which can change their relationship with their duties .
" I 've heard the statement , ' too posh to wash ' .
I 've certainly come across that .
They expect the healthcare assistants to give the bedpans out and to help wash the patients .
That 's part of holistic care , but some of the newly qualified nurses do n't see it like that . "
What does she think of the government 's announcement , this week , that as of 2013 all nurses will be required to attain degree - level education ?
" To be honest I think all you need as a nurse is common sense , and I think sometimes people with a degree can be a bit lacking in common sense .
The basic requirement is that you need to be a caring person , and to have a bit of empathy .
I do think the vetting system could be better , at interview level .
To try and establish what kind of person they actually are in the first place .
[ As for theory ] you can learn as you go along .
All you need at the moment is five GCSEs .
And that is really all you need . "
She sees the new rules as a cost - cutting exercise .
" They 're training health assistants up to do more practical work in the same way that they 're training nurses up to be like junior doctors . "
There are worries about the debt young nurses will incur , that this will make it even harder to recruit .
One of the problems on the ward Haywood filmed was understaffing – nurses were so overworked that a couple were signed off with stress , and " one or two just sort of ducked and let it all happen – their coping strategy was ' I do n't care anymore , let it go over my head , let it go on until somebody else does something . ' "
Her first contact with the BBC was as a consultant on a TV programme about care homes , which prompted thousands of letters and emails pointing out similar problems in the NHS .
The BBC wondered if she was interested in helping them investigate , and when she said yes , they put her on contract .
She became a bank nurse – like supply teachers , bank nurses fill in when wards are short - staffed – and applied for jobs in seven or eight failing hospitals across the country .
She had worked in five or six by the time she came to the Peel and Stewart wards in the Royal Sussex county hospital in Brighton .
" As soon as I walked on that ward I knew there were problems .
It was the smell of urine and faeces .
Blood on the curtains in between the patients .
A certain lack of staff .
No real managerial support most of the time .
None of the patients had a care plan , so none of the patients had continuity of care .
Some of the patients were n't getting appropriate nutrition , or any drinks .
One lady was blind and she just got her meals on a tray in front of her and then somebody came along half an hour later and said , ' Oh , are n't you hungry ? '
They were n't even aware that this lady was blind .
So I went back to the BBC and we decided I needed to get the evidence .
Because what was going on there was abuse and neglect . "
The lens of the camera they gave her was disguised in an ink spot on the front of her uniform .
The controls were in her pockets , and " I did n't film anything intimate .
I could turn the camera off and on when I wanted to .
I always made it clear to the BBC , right from the very start , that my professional responsibilities and accountabilities always came first – the filming was a secondary issue . "
She had to learn to stand 6ft away to get people in shot , and , because batteries and film only lasted an hour or so , colleagues thought she had a urinary infection , she said .
One of the arguments against her , once the programme had been aired , was that she should have informed a manager .
" I informed the manager .
When I could find her . "
But should n't she then have gone up the ranks , looking for someone internal who might listen ?
" Yeah , but again , what I was afraid of was that it would have been brushed under the carpet , that they would have just got rid of me and carried on . "
It was a legitimate fear .
A May 2009 poll by the Royal College of Nursing ( RCN ) found that while 63 % of nurses said they had reported concerns about patient safety or neglect , only 29 % said their employer took immediate action .
" Worryingly , " noted the RCN , " more than a third ( 35 % ) said no action was ever taken . "
Three - quarters of those polled said they feared victimisation or reprisals , while more than a fifth had been actively discouraged from reporting concerns .
Just this month the Independent on Sunday reported that some NHS trusts were spending millions of pounds gagging whistleblowers ; according to the independent whistleblowing authority , Public Concern at Work , two - thirds of health workers are accepting non-disclosure clauses in severance agreements , to avoid years of financial and emotional distress .
" The legal protection for whistleblowers does not work , " Peter Gooderham , lecturer in law and bioethics at the University of Manchester told the paper .
" The NHS is littered with whistleblowers whose lives have been destroyed . "
How about the issue of confidentiality – the reason she was struck off by the Nursing and Midwifery Council ?
Haywood had been expecting official censure for the last four years , so there is a vociferousness to her answer that is n't necessarily prompted by my question .
" Part of my professional code of conduct is to maintain the confidentiality of the patient , and I 've always maintained the code of practice , and I 've always maintained confidentiality , but for this it could n't be like that , because confidentiality is a secondary issue if we 're talking about neglect .
The neglect and the abuse has to take priority . "
Did she not feel she was betraying her colleagues , hanging their collective dirty linen out in public ?
" Um – I did , yeah .
I did feel like a double agent and that 's exactly what I was .
But I had to keep in mind that there was a good reason why I was doing this .
I was convinced it was the right thing to do .
I 'm still convinced it was the right thing to do . "
So convinced you were happy to risk your job ?
" Absolutely .
Absolutely .
I had to have the courage of my convictions . "
Realistically , however , she thought the most she would get was a year 's caution , so when she was finally struck off , in April , she was shocked .
" Nursing 's been a big part of my life for 25 years .
I worked hard , and always acted in the patients ' best interests .
It was devastating . "
She wells up as she remembers going home , in a daze , and looking up who else the council had struck off .
" People who'd had inappropriate sexual relationships with patients .
Nurses who had administered the wrong drugs .
One was even charged with manslaughter .
To put me in the same bracket as them !
It really upset me . "
The first days afterwards were " awful , and without the support of family and friends I would have been ill " .
People wrote to her from all over the country .
The BBC put her on a temporary four - month contract to tide her over until her appeal was heard .
The RCN set up a petition to gauge public support , and nearly 40,000 people signed it .
Ben Bradshaw , then health minister , described the penalty as " unduly harsh " .
What would she have done if her appeal had been rebuffed ?
" I tried not to think of the worst case scenario because I think that would have tipped me over the edge . "
But when she heard last month that the appeal had been successful ( a negotiated agreement , eventually , which sees her receiving a one - year caution that expires next year ) , she cried .
" I was just so relieved .
I thought , ' Now I can get my life back in order . ' "
On Monday she begins a new job , training nurses and carers for a private company in Birmingham .
Would she ever go back to ward nursing ?
" It 's difficult .
It depends in what capacity .
I enjoy the training as well as the nursing , and with this job I can do both . "
And the NHS ?
A pause .
" I do n't know if they 'd have me in the NHS now .
And I suppose that 's understandable . "
A miniature donkey was stolen from a Sunnyvale couple when thieves made off with their pickup truck and trailer in a Mesquite parking lot Tuesday .
Ed and Angela Preston said Red Sunset , or Sunny , as he likes to be called , was stolen from the Town East Mall while they were eating .
" The 18 - wheeler had a flat , so we were waiting a little , and we said , ' Why do n't we run into Chick - Fil - A and get a bite to eat ? ' "
Angela Preston said .
" We got a bite , came back out , ( and ) truck and trailer were gone . "
The couple had been waiting in the parking lot for a breeder to pick up Sunny .
The Prestons , who have been the proud parents of dozens of miniature donkeys for 11 years , said it feels as if part of their family is missing .
" He 's just a little baby , and he can't fend for himself , " Angela Preston said .
In an e-mail , the Prestons said the 6 - month - old donkey needs a special diet and shelter .
" Time is really of the essence at this time , " Preston said .
" He 's been gone three days now , and he 's a baby . "
People have called the couple , saying they 've spotted the truck , the trailer and even Sunny around the Metroplex .
" About 10:30 this morning we got another call from a lady that said she saw some kids playing with a donkey off of Kiest Boulevard , " Preston said .
But Sunny remains missing .
The family said they suspect the trailer and Sunny were dumped in favor of stripping the truck down for parts .
Preston said she and her husband do n't care about the truck or the trailer ;
Sunny is all that matters .
" You know some people say , ' Oh , it 's a donkey , ' " she said .
" No , it 's like our kids . "
The Prestons are offering a reward for the safe return of Sunny , no questions asked .
Their white Ford F - 350 has a personalized license plate that reads DNKEY .
The gold and tan trailer has Texas license plate DDXX20 and a bumper sticker that reads " Got Donkey . "
Anyone with information should call Mesquite police or e-mail the Prestons at info@hillcountryminiatures.com .
Thailand 's ultra-new and modern hospitals are less than a decade old and feel more like luxury hotels catering to tourists , than places to treat the infirm
The Royal Thai Government 's strategy in 2004 for Thailand to become Asia 's medical hub is becoming a reality as Thailand continues to see an increase in medical tourism .
With an annual growth rate of 14 % for the sector , ahead of the county 's GDP , the Tourism Authority of Thailand ( TAT ) and the Department of Export Promotion ( DEP ) expects to see two million visitors wanting to take advantage of lower medical treatments by 2010 .
In 2008 Research and Markets reported that , although Thailand is faced with tough competition from India and Malaysia , Thailand has treated the highest number of international tourists in Asia .
High health care costs , overloaded medical facilities and the fact that Thailand provides the most advanced treatments by internationally trained medical staff are reasons why medical tourists are choosing Thailand .
" Thailand 's ultra -new and modern hospitals are less than a decade old and feel more like luxury hotels catering to tourists , than places to treat the infirm " ( Tourism Authority of Thailand ) .
The cost for health care in Thailand is about one fifth of what you would pay in the United States or Europe , making it more significant that in 2008 , foreign patients generated an estimated $ 6 billion USD for Thailand .
According to one international medical travel journal , the Royal Thai Government has put together a five - year plan that aims to double this revenue by 2014 .
Deloitte Consulting estimated 750,000 Americans traveled abroad for health care services in 2007 , a figure that was expected to double last year , with a forecasted global market expansion of more than 20 % annually going forward to 2012 .
Thailand is ready to meet the growing industry by continuously making sure international standards are met and offering a level of hospitality not found in any other medical center around the world at affordable prices .
People are traveling to Thailand for routine maintenance like dental to cosmetic surgery , gastric bypass surgery and heart surgery .
Medical tourists can undergo and recover from many non-invasive procedures during a normal two - week holiday in Thailand .
A new guidebook Patients Beyond Borders : Thailand Edition released on Monday by Josef Woodman , CEO of Healthy Travel Media , offers an in - depth overview of Thailand 's international hospitals , selected health travel agents , nearby recovery and guest accommodations , spas , and area travel information so that travelers know where to go in Thailand to get their world - class medical treatment .
Thailand 's rapid growth into becoming Asia 's medical hub is also creating great opportunities in related fields .
The medical device sector is continuing to see healthy growth to meet the demands of health care facilities for new upgraded medical machinery and devices .
Research and development for tropical diseases like malaria and dengue fever are areas also open for further investment .
As Thailand 's medical tourism industry continues to grow , its health care industry will flourish as well .
About the Tourism Authority of Thailand
The Tourism Authority of Thailand ( TAT ) was established in 1960 by the Royal Thai Government to be specifically responsible for tourism promotion .
In 1965 , TAT opened its first overseas office in New York .
Since then , TAT has established 21 offices in different parts of the world including the Los Angeles office .
TAT aims to provide the best Thailand traveling information to the public and media members as well as work closely with our travel partners to develop new deals and packages .

The nature / nurture debate that posits a competition between biological and social / cultural influences on human behavior is alive and well in the mass media .
But scholars largely agree that culture and biology interact ; biological realities shape our social world , but our social world also shapes our biologies .
One strain of research demonstrating this has shown that men ’s testosterone levels ( associated with feelings of well - being ) rise and drop in response to social ( and socially constructed ) cues .
For example , the testosterone levels of the winner of a tennis match will rise after his win , while his opponent will see his levels go down .
Similarly , measuring men ’s testosterone levels wo n’t tell you which men walking down the sidewalk will enter a strip club , but the men leaving the strip club will have higher testosterone levels than the men who passed it by .
Matt C. alerted me to a test of this phenomenon using the Presidential election .
There was a slight drop in testosterone levels for men who voted for Obama ( normal because men ’s testosterone levels tend to drop at night ) , but a dramatic drop for men who voted for McCain or the Libertarian candidate , Barr .
So , there you have it , biological responses to social cues .

CANNABIS CULTURE – A Canadian care home resident with full body paralysis was confined to his bed against his will after his wheelchair was seized by caregivers – all because he smokes medical marijuana to relieve his Multiple Sclerosis .
CHBC news reported yesterday that Nyle Nagy , a Kelowna , British Columbia man who lives at the Brookhaven care home , was forcefully removed from his wheelchair and put in bed for a week after manager Adrien Vaughan objected to his legal use of medical marijuana .
“ She sent two men over here to take my wheelchair and tell me that I ’ve got to stay in this chair for seven days , as a punishment ” , Nagy told the TV crew .
“ To get rid of my pain and my spasms , that ’s the only two reasons I smoke it ” said Nagy , who has a license from the Canadian government to smoke marijuana .
The news comes in the wake of a similar abuse case in Vancouver where a diabetic , double - amputee woman died after being evicted for legally smoking medical marijuana .

Friday , November 20 , was the 20th anniversary of the year that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) was entered into force by the General Assembly .
This groundbreaking , comprehensive , organic — some even say spiritual — document , with 193 out of 195 possible government ratifications , has become the world ’s most widely - ratified human rights treaty .
Only two governments , both of which have signed , remain outside the loop : Somalia , a country whose government is not recognized by the United Nations , and the United States , which , by its own admission , is the world ’s most zealous champion of human rights worldwide and proprietor of the world ’s most progressive laws protecting the rights of children .
More than 10 years in the drafting , the CRC would not have happened without the support of the United States , including the significant contributions to its language under the presidency of Ronald Reagan .
The kibosh on all international treaties imposed by Senator Jesse Helms ( then powerful chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee ) and twelve years of Bushes swept the treaty into an unused broom closet .
Up for ratification once again , it has been strongly supported by Hillary Clinton and President Obama , who noted embarrassment “ to find ourselves in the company of Somalia , a lawless land ” , and promised to conduct a serious legal review of this treaty and others to ensure the United States resume its global leadership in human rights .
Ratification should be a no - brainer .
The CRC is a unique and precious document , visionary and practical .
It is the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights — civil , political , cultural , social and economic , including the unique rights to childhood : the right to play , to survival and development , to protection from exploitation and abuse , the right of participation , and the right to develop from children to adults .
The CRC has been called a legal document with a soul .
In fact , the Holy See was the fourth government to ratify the Convention in 1990 , and today as US ratification is poised to appear on the radar , every major denominational group has publicly given it support .
According to Matthew and other disciples , Jesus loved children beyond all others .
And two faith - based colleagues agreed that He might even be a staunch advocate for ratification .
But one person ’s no-brainer is another ’s “ No way . ”
On line behind a number of treaties ranging from the relatively innocuous “ Law of the Sea ” to the more controversial CEDAW , the CRC is by no means guaranteed ratification .
Parental Authority Undermined
First , but maybe not foremost , is the overt opposition from the Christian right , which declares with great certainty that the Convention would abrogate the God - given authority of parents .
It would forbid all ‘ normal everyday spanking ’ ( Articles 3 , 19 , and 37 ) , control curriculum , and prohibit home schooling ( Articles 24 and 25 ) .
The rights to privacy and freedom of expression encourage children to sue and beat their parents , join gangs ( 12 and 13 ) , and have abortions .
Not to mention article 31 , which would allow children to play all day long and refuse to go to school .
This is not something that any good American family would want .
Michael Ferris , Chancellor of Patrick Henry College ( for Christian home schoolers ) , leader of the parental rights movement , and founder of the Home Schooling Defense League , warns of the “ Nannies in Blue Berets , ” coming to occupy America and impose a world order on all American families .
Ferris is also author of the Parental Rights amendment to the Constitution that will , he told Mike Huckabee in an interview on Fox , “ put a permanent stake in the vampire of international law ” .
Despite 80 sponsors in the House of Representatives and one Senator ) , the amendment is not likely to gain much traction .
But it can ( like the town hall meetings to ‘ take back our Constitution ’ and other right - wing mini-movements ) make a lot of noise , produce clear and simple talking points with little relationship to the truth , and create a sense of organization well beyond their numbers .
It is always a challenge to spend time disputing absurdities when we should be promoting the strengths of the CRC , its relevance to the US , and its nuanced understanding of children ’s issues .
But it is hard to resist calling attention to a small irony hidden in the arguments of the right : unlike any international treaty , the Convention mentions the role of the family more times than any other right : to guide , protect and take responsibility for the raising and developing the values of their children .
In fact , it actually suggests the right of parents to sue / criticize the government for its failures to protect , educate , and care for children — the very objective sought by the PRA .
The only time a child has the right to charge his or her parents is when they have violated or abused the child — a right that already exists in most state laws .
So which is it , folks ?
US sovereignty or protection from US government interference ?
The Religion of American Exceptionalism
Beyond the social agenda of the religious right comes a significant threat from another religious community to squash ratification : “ American Exceptionalism ” ; based on the dogma that America is the greatest nation on Earth , the designated leader of the world , more democratic , dynamic and prosperous than any other nation , as well as technologically superior .
( See Barbara Ehrenreich ’s Bright Sided ) .
Questioning can result in serious charges including globalism , socialism , fascism and worst of all unamericanism .
How this belief system threatens ratification of CRC is evidenced in the four following dogmas :
1. Entering into international treaties leads to becoming part of the international community and renouncing leadership ;
2 . The CRC may override state and federal law and the US constitution ;
3 . The groundbreaking inclusion of social , economic , and cultural ( as well as civil and political ) rights as human rights are not in the US rulebook ; and finally
4. US laws already cover most of the Convention guidelines , which other countries continue to violate or flaunt , thus canceling out any need for ratification .
Answers to these arguments are easy :
1. Ratification actually will allow the United States to regain its global leadership and moral authority on human rights worldwide .
Already the US government uses its power to combat sex trafficking , child labor , and child marriage ( in other countries ) ; what an expression of its commitment to children .
2. Despite the fact that it is legally binding , the CRC is not self - executing ; that means the U.S. must decide through legislation to enforce it .
3 . If , as ‘ pro- life ’ proponents proclaim , the life of an unborn child has human rights , can we not extend those rights to a child after it is born ?
4. Despite ( some of ) the best laws in the world to support , protect , and honor its own children , the United States is still a long way from implementing its own laws and policies .
The U.S. rate of infant mortality is 24th out of the 25 wealthiest countries , and 3.5 million are at risk of longterm physical and cognitive impairment from malnutrition ; 30 % of 8th - grade students do n’t read at grade level , and the U.S. ranks 24th in mathematical literacy of 15 - year - olds .
By age 18 , one in four girls and one in six boys will have been victimized by sexual assault , and the U.S. rate of death from child abuse is again 24th .
By anyone ’s count , along with Barbara Boxer , John Kerry , and Bernie Sanders , there are probably at least 40 or so committed Senators , but to pull together 67 votes in 2010 or 2011 will still be a daunting challenge .
Even CEDAW , ahead of the CRC in line for ratification , may well be a struggle .
But its chances are good that the powerful lobby and millions of votes ( women ) behind it may well swing the tide .
As for the CRC , it just may turn out , not that the Senate opposes it , but with such a crowded and urgent agenda , there are just more important issues to deal with first .
After all , children ca n’t vote .

On Saturday , my boss ( or ex-boss as it is , now that he 's auditioning as a big - shot beatwriter ) James Mirtle emailed me to ask if I knew anything about former NHLPA boss Paul Kelly 's new venture designed to promote college hockey that will be announced today .
While I did n't know any specifics , I did say there were a number of reasons why I thought something like that would be a good idea for college hockey .
Among my reasons was this : " There 's a lot of myths about how great things are up north that never seem to go away because there 's really only one side doing all the talking " .
The news on Monday that Jack Campbell was backing out of his commitment to Michigan to play for the Windsor Spitfires serves as an emphatic puncutation to my point -- except that Windsor is techinically south of Detroit , I guess .
Campbell released a statement to Michigan 's Rivals.com site , explaining his decision .
His reasoning : " My goal is to be playing in the National Hockey League within a year or two , and I did not want to put Michigan 's hockey program in a bad position where I left after one season .
By going to the Ontario Hockey League , I feel it will accelerate my development so I will be able to more quickly achieve my goal of being an NHL goaltender . "
By all accounts , Campbell should be a first round draft pick .
So just how quickly does the OHL , and CHL in general get their goalies drafted in the first round into the National Hockey League ?
Is it at all realistic that Campbell could be playing in the NHL a year after he was drafted ?
I 'll break down the CHL goalies taken in the first round of the draft - by - year to find out .
The data gets kind of long , so I 'll put it after the jump , but in case you do n't care to read through , I 'll post the spoilers now .
Over 10 drafts -- 1999 - 2008 -- there has been a grand total of one goalie from the CHL ( Dan Blackburn , if you 're curious ) drafted in the first round that was n't still eligible for the Calder Trophy ( no more than 25 NHL games played , or 6 in two seperate seasons ) at the end of the timeframe with which Campbell suggests he 'll be in the NHL .
I guess you have to give props to Windsor for being able to sell this kid on what is essentially a lie .
Maybe Campbell will be good enough to do what all of those other goalies who were once in his position -- or in some cases , a much better position , since I have n't seen many people ranking Campbell in the top 10 for the draft -- were n't able to do .
But this idea that the CHL is going to give him the leg up he needs to be in the NHL after a year or two is patently ridiculous .
2008
Chet Pickard - 18th overall - Has n't played in the NHL yet .
Thomas McCollum - 30th overall - Yeah right .
2007
No goalies in the first round of the draft .
This draft did include Josh Unice who bailed on Bowling Green at the last second in order to take " the faster route to the pros " .
Now it looks like he 'll be done with competitive hockey by the age of 21 next year .
2006
Jonathan Bernier - 11th overall - He got 4 games in the NHL in his second season after the draft .
Whenver he makes the NHL full - time , if he does , he 'll still be considered a rookie .
Leland Irving - 26th overall - Has n't played in the NHL yet .
2005
Carey Price - 5th overall - He became an NHL regular in his third year after being drafted .
That would be the equivalent of a college goalie leaving after his sophomore season .
2004
Devan Dubnyk - 14th overall - Has yet to play in the NHL .
Marek Schwarz - 17th overall - Czech born , but moved to the WHL after being drafted .
He got 2 NHL games in the second year after being drafted , but has never played more than two games in a season .
2003
Marc - Andre Fleury - 1st overall - He played 22 games the year after he was drafted , but did n't play a full season until the third season after he was drafted .
2002
Cam Ward - 25th overall - It was n't until his fourth season after being drafted that he broke into the NHL .
2001
Pascal Leclaire - 8th overall - He got 2 NHL games in his third season after being drafted .
He did n't get significant playing time until 2005 - 2006 .
Dan Blackburn - 10th overall - Actually made the NHL and played significantly the year after he was drafted .
Jason Bacashihua - 26th overall - It was n't unitl his 5th season after being drafted that he saw the NHL .
Adam Munro - 29th overall - Saw a handful of games in his third year after juniors .
2000
Brent Krahn - 9th overall - He got his first and only NHL start last year .
1999
Brian Finley - 6th overall - 4 total NHL games
Maxime Ouellet - 22nd overall - Just a handful of NHL games

WASHINGTON , Oct 15 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation to punish foreign oil companies that export gasoline to Iran , marking the first time both chambers of Congress have cleared the same bill imposing economic sanctions on Iran to protest its nuclear program .
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the same measure earlier this month to ban companies that sell Iran gasoline from also delivering crude oil to the U.S. emergency petroleum stockpile .
The bill now goes to President Barack Obama , who is expected to sign it into law .
The sanctions on Iran 's fuel suppliers were included in an energy and water programs spending bill .
The measure would block the U.S. Energy Department from awarding contracts to companies to deliver oil to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve if the companies sell or ship gasoline to Iran .
The provision was sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl and Susan Collins .
" Time is running out for Iran to give up its illegal nuclear weapons program , " the senators previously said about their proposed sanctions .
Congress and the Obama administration fear Iran 's uranium enrichment program will be used to develop weapons , while Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes to generate electricity .
Congress hopes cutting off Iran 's gasoline supplies will put pressure on Tehran to give up its nuclear program .
While Iran holds some of the world 's biggest oil reserves , it must import 40 percent of its gasoline to meet domestic demand .
However , the sanctions would limited impact as a deterrent as the the U.S. petroleum reserve is just 2 million barrels short of its 727 - million - barrel capacity , which will be reached by January .
The emergency reserve was created by Congress in the mid-1970s after the Arab oil embargo .
It holds crude in underground storage caverns at four sites in Texas and Louisiana .
Meanwhile the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said on Thursday his panel will vote Oct. 28 on separate legislation to expand a 1996 Iran sanctions law to effectively bar foreign companies that sell gasoline to Iran from doing business in the United States .
The legislation includes companies that provide ships or shipping services to transport the fuel , underwrite the shipments and finance or broker the gasoline cargoes .
Rep . Howard Berman said his committee " will take the first key step to ensure that President Obama is empowered with the full range of tools he needs to address the looming nuclear threat from Iran even as he pursues diplomacy and , if necessary , the multilateral sanctions track . "

A Jaguar convertible sits in the driveway of Latasha Jackson 's million - dollar mansion in Menomonee Falls .
Built on a hill with a sprawling back deck overlooking a pond , the 7,600 - square - foot home features an indoor swimming pool and indoor basketball court .
Jackson is not an Olympic swimmer , a professional basketball player or a celebrity of any sort .
She is a day care provider in the city of Milwaukee .
She built her fortune with taxpayer funding from the Wisconsin Shares program .
And although documents show regulators had many reasons to believe the 32 - year - old mother of three was billing the state for kids not in her care , providing false information and otherwise defrauding the system for more than a decade , they continued to pay her .
That ended Thursday , but only after the state learned the Journal Sentinel was preparing to publish a story on the case .
And only when Jackson turned herself in - a day after the newspaper confronted her .
Despite recent records that indicate Jackson was running what police and regulators refer to as a " child - care ring " - adding mothers with many kids to her payroll for the main purpose of enrolling their children in her center - the state continued to deposit thousands of dollars in her account each month .
This month alone Jackson collected more than $ 90,000 from Wisconsin Shares .
All told , Jackson has received nearly $ 3 million in taxpayer - financed child - care funding since she got in the day care business in 1999 .
The Wisconsin Shares program is meant to help hardworking , low - income parents get and keep jobs .
An ongoing Journal Sentinel investigation has identified people swindling millions from the system .
The Jackson case shows how licensers , caseworkers and even fraud investigators have n't stopped it .
The newspaper compiled a paper trail on Jackson tallying more than 1,800 pages , including public records as well as those obtained from sources that state and county regulators refused to release .
The documents detail how regulators repeatedly failed to take action or cut off payments despite Jackson 's extensive violations , her history of lying and even regulators ' own outright proof of fraud .
In an hourlong interview at her new center on Milwaukee 's northwest side , Jackson denied she ever cheated the program .
She insisted the records must be mistaken , that she had never had any program violations , never had a problem with attendance records .
" That 's not me .
I do n't do nothing dirty .
I do n't do nothing fraudulent .
I do what I have to do to take care of my stuff , " she said .
" Everything I have I have worked for , and I work very hard . "
Suspicions date to 1997
As early as 1997 , before Jackson even got into the day care business , regulators suspected she was scamming the system .
Jackson was a young mother seeking child - care assistance for her 1 - year old daughter .
Records show she lied about her income to qualify for the program .
Milwaukee County caseworkers referred her case to the fraud unit that year and again in 1998 .
Records do n't indicate what became of those investigations .
She was never criminally charged .
And Jackson continued to collect Wisconsin Shares funds - tapping the pot , at times , as a mother reportedly in need , and on and off as a day care provider .
Even as new signs of fraud surfaced .
In 1999 , Jackson was 22 with a 3 - year - old daughter in tote when she launched her day care business .
Child care offered a perfect way to make a living .
She could stay at home on the northwest side near N. 74th St. and W. Hampton Ave. , watch a few children and collect a steady check from the state .
It was a couple years after the inception of the state 's welfare - to - work program , and demand for day care providers was great .
So it did n't take long for Jackson to build her business .
By 2004 , she was receiving more than $ 350,000 a year from the Wisconsin Shares program , with state approval to care for 67 kids in a new center near N. 24th St. and W. Capitol Drive .
She moved to a nice home in Waukesha County , a few miles from where she would later build her mansion .
By 2006 , her business had more than doubled to $ 830,000 a year in public child - care funds and more than 100 children reportedly enrolled .
There is no way to know how much of that money was earned legitimately .
Throughout the years , regulators received complaints from people accusing Jackson of falsifying documents and billing for kids not actually in her care .
And , inspectors cited her repeatedly for not keeping accurate attendance records .
Inspectors also found workers at the center did n't know the names of the kids or the number of children under their watch .
Regulators also investigated allegations that workers were using drugs , watching pornography and that Jackson left the children in the care of a young teenage boy .
In all , from 2001 to 2007 inspectors cited Jackson for more than 150 violations .
On at least five visits , inspectors found Jackson 's attendance records were inaccurate , at times listing children present who were not in her care .
Yet they continued to pay her .
For years , oversight of Jackson 's center was the responsibility of state licensing specialist Jane Abshire .
Abshire , a former day care center director , repeatedly cited Jackson for the attendance violations but took no enforcement action .
She took no enforcement action when she found other troubles at Jackson 's center either .
In 2002 , for example , Abshire wrote up Jackson for sleeping while children were in her care .
Jackson was not penalized .
In 2004 , Abshire cited Jackson for punishing children with " time - outs " lasting as long as 30 minutes , six times longer than state rules allow .
Again , Abshire took no enforcement action .
And in 2005 , when a probation officer called to report that Jackson had admitted to running a day - care ring , Abshire wrote in her report that she passed the complaint to Milwaukee County because " my only authority was over attendance records . "
Records do n't indicate why Jackson was talking with a parole officer .
She was not on parole or probation , according to court records .
It was n't until 2006 , when a 2 - year - old boy at her center was left outside alone for about 10 minutes that the state took enforcement action .
Regulators fined Jackson $ 300 for the incident .
In 2007 , records show , another parole agent contacted state regulators alerting them that a person on probation for carrying a concealed weapon had reported working for Jackson 's day care center .
The 22 - year - old man had also been convicted of disorderly conduct and as a juvenile was arrested for sexual assault of a child and felony battery .
The probation agent questioned whether it was appropriate for the man to be working in a child - care setting , according to an e-mail among state workers .
" I explained ( to the parole agent ) about the caregiver background check process , " state worker Anne Carmody wrote to her colleagues in the e-mail .
" The crime for which ( the man ) was convicted is not listed as a barred crime . "
In fact , there are no crimes that forever prohibit a person from working in a day care .
Rules allow anyone - even those convicted of homicide - to qualify , as long as they win approval from a rehabilitation panel .
None of those violations , or dozens of others , kept Jackson from collecting from the Wisconsin Shares program .
State rules in many cases give inspectors - such as Abshire - discretion about when to take enforcement action .
Officials would not permit the Journal Sentinel to interview Abshire or other licensers .
License revoked after beating
Then , in March 2007 , Jackson beat her nephew with a belt .
This time the state stepped in .
Jackson 's 12 - year - old nephew had reportedly stolen some shoes from a relative .
Jackson figured six or seven lashings would teach him to behave , according to state documents .
The next month , the state revoked her license .
But it would n't be for long .
And it would n't end her access to public child - care subsidies .
Despite the $ 1.6 million she received from the Wisconsin Shares program the previous two years , Jackson claimed that without the continued day care center income , she now needed state aid from programs designed for the poor - food and child - care assistance .
By this time , she had two children and was pregnant again .
The $ 8.50 per hour she claimed to earn working at a friend 's day care center would n't support her , she said .
Jackson was n't even allowed to work in a day care center given Milwaukee County 's finding of substantiated abuse of her nephew .
Because of the way the system is designed , Waukesha County workers had no way to know that .
They granted her $ 315 per month in food assistance in May of that year .
The amount would soon double .
Then in July , a Waukesha County caseworker approved Jackson 's request for child - care assistance , according to documents .
State and county officials wo n't disclose the identity of the person , citing security reasons .
The worker was identified only as caseworker XWK479 .
Live - in boyfriend brings scrutiny
Within a few months , regulators got another tip : Jackson had not reported that her boyfriend , the father of her third child , was living in the house .
If employed , his income would be a factor in whether the family qualified for subsidized care .
If he was not employed , he would be responsible for watching the children while Jackson worked and they would not be eligible for the program .
This time fraud investigators ordered surveillance on her house .
They nailed her .
Her boyfriend , Greg Wilder , was living with her and he was making $ 88,000 a year driving a van for another day care center , investigators learned .
When they combed through Jackson 's checking account records , they found tens of thousands of dollars of undeclared deposits that Jackson refused to explain .
Jackson had intentionally misrepresented and withheld facts , they concluded in March 2008 , and had essentially stolen $ 27,000 from the public food and child - care programs .
But instead of pursuing criminal charges , Waukesha County fraud investigator Sue Rhode cut off Jackson 's food and child - care benefits and required her to repay the money .
She banned Jackson from the food - subsidy program for one year and gave her an official warning on the child - care program .
Rhode said she had n't made a referral to the district attorney 's office in at least two years .
Compiling the materials needed to build a case is time - consuming , and often prosecutors reject cases when the money is n't big .
Rhode said she is the only person with the Waukesha County Department of Health and Human Services fishing for fraud by mothers seeking child - care help .
She is overloaded , she said , and instead focuses on stopping the funding .
" It takes a huge amount of time , " she said of making a criminal referral .
" It 's overwhelming . "
District attorneys statewide seldom file criminal charges against parents and child - care providers who cheat the system , despite evidence that millions of dollars wind up in the hands of scammers every year .
More often the cases are treated as mistakes .
The state attempts to recover the money , and the parents and providers continue to collect public funds .
In an interview , Jackson maintained she did n't defraud the system .
She said Wilder , the father of her soon - to - be - born baby , was not living with her at the time she sought assistance .
The basement to his house had flooded , and he was temporarily staying with her , she said .
The two have since married .
Applies for new license
Waukesha County 's punishment did n't deter Jackson for long .
Before the end of the year she was again tapping into the Wisconsin Shares program .
She reapplied for a child - care provider license , a license she had lost after beating her nephew .
Now all she had to do was convince a three - member panel of state and county workers she had been rehabilitated from her abusive tendencies - prove to them she would not be inclined to punish children physically .
If they cleared her , she could seek a new license .
She first went before the panel in November 2007 .
She told them she had taken a 12 - week anger management course and had learned that physical punishment was not appropriate .
With her attorney at her side , she answered a few basic questions about her history and her plans for the future , according to the transcript from the hearing .
Panel members seemed impressed .
But they were concerned that not enough time had passed - about eight months - since the beating .
They told her to come back in six months .
She did , and on June 11 , 2008 , the state notified Jackson she had been approved .
Since the first hearing , she had undergone a psychological evaluation and taken 10 hours of continuing education on managing aggression and child abuse and neglect .
Despite their knowledge Jackson had pilfered the system earlier that year as a mother seeking help , panelists ruled she was fit to resume her role as a child - care provider - and once again draw from public coffers .
" The Rehabilitation Review Panel finds that you have demonstrated sufficient evidence to support rehabilitation approval , " wrote Bruce Ratzmann , of the Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare , the lead panel member .
The approval was no anomaly .
In 2008 , panelists determined that 26 of the 30 applicants who had their licenses revoked or had been denied a license were rehabilitated and eligible for child - care licensure .
In an interview , Ratzmann said the panel has a limited focus : to examine applicants ' personal growth and determine if they 're fit to care for children - not whether they would be likely to scam the system .
" That 's not our issue , " he said .
Once Jackson was deemed rehabilitated , she reapplied to the state for a new child - care provider license .
This time a bureaucrat in Waukesha County botched the paperwork .
In October 2008 , the state sent a request for information about Jackson to Waukesha County , specifically asking " Does your agency have information on the character , behavior or background of this applicant ? "
Waukesha County worker Carolyn
Howe checked the " No " box , disregarding the county 's recent determination Jackson had defrauded the food and child - care programs .
The same state worker who licensed her at least once before , Charlene Langsdorf , signed off on the deal , allowing Jackson to care for up to 110 children .
Jackson reopened her business in December 2008 under the name Kiddie Springs Child Development Center , which she relocated in June to a former warehouse on W. Lancaster Ave. near N. 38th St. in Milwaukee .
State regulators said last week if Howe had done her job properly and alerted the state to the fraud , Jackson would never have been relicensed .
" It absolutely would have caught our attention , and that would have been grounds for denial , " said Jill Chase , director of the Bureau of Early Care Regulation for the state Department of Children and Families .
Chase gave no reason why the state did n't shut Jackson down or take enforcement action on the repeated attendance - record violations and other troubling rule infractions .
New laws would prevent funds
A Journal Sentinel examination of Jackson 's recent business arrangements shows much of her subsidy money would be denied under laws passed since the newspaper began reporting in January how parents and providers easily con the system - if those changes were to be enforced .
Nearly two - thirds of the children enrolled belonged to employees of Jackson 's center , according to documents obtained by the newspaper .
Such an arrangement is a red flag for regulators because it is designed with the sole purpose of tapping into child - care funds .
Parents do n't actually have to report to work .
They can stay home and take care of their children and still get paid .
Rules that went into effect in June require that no more than 40 % of children enrolled in a center belong to a parent who is employed at the center .
Records show Jackson also almost always hired parents who have at least four or five children , making the set - up more lucrative .
Each child is typically worth close to $ 200 a week in subsidies , depending on the age and number of hours of care authorized .
On one recent afternoon , more than a dozen women and men from Somalia reported to work with their children on their hips .
Jackson estimated that at least 50 of the children enrolled in the center belong to them .
Workers came from shut down day care
Records show many of the workers came to her center from Ark of Safety , a day care business that was shut down in April amid allegations of rampant fraud .
Jackson said the workers have no trouble caring for the English - speaking children at the center because they all speak English .
However , records show , some of the workers used translators when applying for their own child - care benefits .
In April , county regulators pulled some records from Jackson 's new operation suspecting they might be fraudulent .
On Thursday , knowing the Journal Sentinel was working on this story , they said they had just completed the investigation and determined the government had improperly paid Jackson a significant amount of money .
They would not disclose the amount .
In her interview , Jackson told the Journal Sentinel she 's not worried about any investigations .
She said her paperwork is all in order .
" I do n't see how they could be looking at me for fraud , " she said .
The next day , however , Jackson told the state about her fraud involving the child - care and food assistance in Waukesha County .
On Thursday , state regulators shut her down for that reason and admitted they had botched her case , too .
They said Waukesha County had notified them in July 2008 about Jackson 's fraud , months before the Waukesha County worker checked the wrong box .
The state overlooked the paperwork .
Jackson said her child - care business has required so much work she 's rarely been able to enjoy her four bedroom , six - bathroom mansion .
She 's only been in the pool maybe five times since she moved in last year .
She put the house on the market in February .
Asking price : $ 1,499,900 .
Catherine Rampell at Economix has updated this miserable chart , showing job losses in this recession compared to recent ones ( expressed as a percentage of peak employment ) .
The dark blue line that just keeps heading down represents current recession .
Since the official start of the recession in December 2007 , the economy has had a net loss of about 5.2 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs .
The horizontal axis measures the number of months since the recession started .
The vertical axis measures the share of pre-recession jobs that still exist .
As you can see , the current downturn started out similar to the 2001 - 05 and 1990 - 3 recessions , with job losses far less violent than those of the eighties and seventies .
But around nine months in , things got ugly and kept getting uglier .
Bannock has been a staple food of wilderness explorers , prospectors , soldiers , and trappers for centuries .
Portable , nutritious , tasty and easy to make while surviving in the outdoors , bannocks legendary reputation continues as one of the best survival foods you can bring into the wilderness .
Bannock is high in carbohydrates and complements the proteins of pemmican , jerky , the arctic survival ration , and other meats .
It can be used as a hearty stand - alone food or combined with foraged wild edibles such as berries , fruits , and meats .
What is Bannock ?
Bannock is a bread that you can cook using little more than a fire and a stick though it can also be baked or fried .
Names for bannock include bushbread , trail bread , grease bread and galette .
Bannocks origins are lost in the mists of time , but some believe bannock was first made by the Scotts from the same oat flour that gave their horses great strength and endurance .
With stomachs fed with hearty oat bannock those who became explorers and mountain men in the new world introduced the bannock recipe to the Native Americans and other outdoorsmen who lived in the wilderness .
The most simple bannock recipe consists of just flour of nearly any kind and water .
Kneaded into a dough and wrapped around a green stick , this most basic bannock cooks into a fine tasting bread that can be eaten alone or used as a basis for a full course meal .
There are a great many other bannock recipies that will make your mouth water and give you the impetus to try your hand at making your own .
In the pictures you can see me cooking one of my favorite bannock recipes over an open fire in the forest :
Survival Topics Bannock on a Green Stick
This is my favorite way to make bannock as it brings forth the image of mountain men from a bygone era cooking over an open fire .
The following recipe provides enough bannock for one day .
Stored in a waterproof bag , it is easy to carry a week or ten day supply .
1 - cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons milk powder
Mix all the ingredients well , making sure the butter is evenly distributed throughout .
Sometimes I will melt the butter before adding it to the mixture .
Then slowly add water while mixing until a dough ball is formed .
Make the bannock dough into a cigar shape and wrap it around a green stick .
Try to keep the thickness of the dough about ½ inch .
Slowly roast the bannock over a hot fire , rotating occasionally until it turns a golden brown .
You will hear the butter sizzling and your stomach rumble as the bannock cooks .
Multi-flour Bannock Recipe
This combination of flours , spices , and dried fruit makes the bannock a delicious meal of itself and makes me hungry just thinking about it .
It can be cooked over an open fire on a green stick or formed into a loaf and baked and makes a 3 - day supply :
1 Cup Barley flour \
1 Cup Wheat flour
1/2 Cup Rolled Oats
1 Cup White Sugar
1/2 to 1 Cup Raisins or other dried fruit
1 1/2 Cup Buttermilk
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tbsp .
Coarse Ground Salt
1 tbsp .
Cinnamon
1 tbsp .
Cloves
1 tbsp .
Nutmeg
Fried Bannock
If you like fried foods then you need to try fried Bannock .
4 cups flour
2 tbsp baking powder
2 tbsp sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup margarine / butter
2 eggs
1/4 tbsp salt
Mix all the ingredients so a dough ball is formed .
Break off pieces and flatten into rounds about ½ inch thick .
Fry to a golden brown in the oil of your choice .
Try Making Bannock
Bannock is a fulfilling meal that can be used to supplement natural foods foraged from your surroundings .
When hiking in the wilderness I like to have enough pre-mixed bannock recipe for at least one meal each day .
Try out various combinations of bannock mixed with fruits , nuts and seeds , cheeses , meats , fish and a variety of spices .
Wilderness meals containing bannock can satisfy even the most discriminating palate .
Bannock is easy to cook and is an excellent comfort food that will elevate your mood and fill your stomach .
There is nothing quite like the sight and smell of fresh bannock cooking over an open fire at the end of a hard day surviving in the wilderness .

However , it was actually only a misinterpretation of the statistics gathered from Papua New Guinea .
However , there have been a number of documented cases of coconuts killing people .
Falling coconuts can cause fatal injuries to the head , neck , shoulders , and back .

A Lord of the Rings actor would rather hike up a whole mountain than ride a helicopter .
One of the things that makes Lord of the Rings lore so rich is the immersive environment of the story ’s settings .
While shooting the films , the cast had to fly to remote locations via helicopter .
Sean Bean , who plays Boromir ( and Ned Stark in Game of Thrones ) was afraid of flight , and would only do it if he had no choice .
During the shootings for the Fellowship crossing snowy mountains , he ’d climb for two hours every morning to get to the set .
He would make the climb already dressed as Boromir .
Norway ’s reality TV is very different .
Although reality TV in the U.S. is saturated with Kardashian - brand drama , it ’s very different for Norway .
Norway ’s first significant “ reality ” TV show was a broadcast showing the Bergen Line .

So , in 2007 , Oklahoma declared the watermelon as their state vegetable .
Their state fruit ?
Strawberries .
Lachanophobia is the fear of vegetables .
The word originates from Greek lachno ( vegetables ) and phobos ( fear or aversion ) .

As a result , most of the 30 contestants went bankrupt .
Since then , Nik Russian has not been convicted ( since he did not take money from anyone ) and nobody has been able to track his whereabouts .

Scientists have taught rats to drive .
According to an experiment , rats can learn how to drive .
Scientists made tiny cars with an aluminum floor and a “ steering wheel ” made out of three copper bars .
When the rat stood on the car ’s aluminum floor and touched the copper bars , they would start an electrical charge that moves the car .
By the end of the experiment , they had taught the rats to steer the car in different directions by touching different copper bars .
Their secret ?
Froot Loops .
The scientists conditioned the rats to maneuver different ways by rewarding them with cereal pieces .

The US government is preparing to order bailed - out banks and car companies to slash the cash salaries of their top executives by an average of 90 % in an effort to quell outrage over multimillion - dollar boardroom excess .
Kenneth Feinberg , the US treasury 's so - called pay tsar charged with vetting remuneration , intends to tell seven struggling firms still dependant on taxpayer dollars that their 25 highest - paid executives must accept severe year - on - year cuts .
The biggest drops will be in salaries .
But after taking into account bonuses , stock options and other elements , total pay packages are set to fall by an average of about 50 % .
Feinberg 's power only extends to companies that are yet to repay government aid .
The firms concerned include the struggling banks Citigroup and Bank of America , plus the insurer AIG .
Also on the list are the Detroit car manufacturers General Motors and Chrysler , and the car companies ' financing arms , Chrysler Financial and GMAC .
A mediation specialist formerly responsible for settling compensation claims for victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks , Feinberg has spent the last two months scrutinising pay proposals submitted by bailed - out businesses .
His findings , due to be formally released within the next week , were leaked to US media yesterday .
Several individuals have already acquiesced to Feinberg 's will .
Bank of America 's soon to retire chief executive , Ken Lewis , last week announced that he will forgo his $ 1.5 m ( £ 900,000 ) salary this year , under pressure from Feinberg .
Other ordinances will require any " frills " worth more than $ 25,000 , such as country club membership , limousines or private aircraft , to be subject to government approval .
And Feinberg is likely to insist on a division between the roles of chairman and chief executive .
Speaking at a conference on Tuesday , Feinberg suggested that he faced an almost impossible task in pleasing everybody : " The incredible gap , the chasm , between Wall Street perceptions and main street perceptions , is a formidable chasm that I 'm not sure can be bridged , although the law requires me to bridge that chasm . "
Most of Wall Street 's top earning institutions , including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan , will escape the crackdown as they have repaid government aid .
But AIG has been ordered to make good on its promise to cut back $ 198 m of bonuses paid to staff at its financial products division , which sparked Congressional fury and death threats to certain executives involved .
The cuts , however , may not be as uniformly deep as they sound .
Some top individuals have already given up virtually all of their pay , skewing the average reduction .
For example , Citigroup 's chief executive , Vikram Pandit , has committed himself to working for a salary of $ 1 until the bank returns to health .
And in an effort to head off controversy , Citigroup is selling an energy trading arm , Phibro , where British - born star trader Andrew Hall is in line for a bonus of nearly $ 100m .
Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader in the US senate , said government intervention was inevitable , given the amount of money committed to bailout efforts :
" If the federal government is a partner , in effect , in these companies , then it ought to have some say on compensation . "
But Wall Street , banks and Republicans have vigorously opposed any moves by the Obama administration to go further by enforcing pay restrictions at banks operating without government aid .
Feinberg 's move against top corporate pay came as Obama 's former " car tsar " attacked the " stunningly poor management " he encountered at Detroit 's carmakers as he worked to avert a collapse of the biggest US auto firms this year .
Steve Rattner , a former private equity executive , was the treasury secretary Timothy Geithner 's top adviser on the car industry between February and July – when the US government acted to rescue both General Motors and Chrysler .
In an article for Fortune magazine , Rattner offered a savage verdict on the leadership culture at the industrial giants , singling out GM 's former boss Rick Wagoner for his " friendly arrogance " , and top executives ' reluctance to mix with workers .
" Everyone knew Detroit 's reputation for insular , slow - moving cultures , " he said .
" Even by that low standard , I was shocked by the stunningly poor management we found , particularly at GM , where we encountered , among other things , perhaps the weakest finance operation any of us had ever seen in a major company . "
Rattner attacked GM 's top executives for sequestering themselves on the top floor of the Renaissance Centre skyscraper in Detroit , with exclusive lifts , to avoid mixing with lower - ranking " drones " .
In March , the White House forced Wagoner to step down as a condition for more funding to keep GM afloat .
Rattner accused him of blaming everyone else for the company 's difficulties .
" Rick set a tone of ' friendly arrogance ' that seemed to permeate the organisation , " he said .
WASHINGTON -- Democrats are poised Tuesday to push health - overhaul legislation through the influential Senate Finance Committee , but they face new hurdles from insurers ratcheting up concerns about the sweeping bill .
A report released Monday by America 's Health Insurance Plans , an industry trade group , said the Finance Committee bill would impose stiff costs on consumers .
Among other things , the report said a family health - insurance policy that costs $ 12,300 today would increase to $ 25,900 on average by 2019 under the bill , ...
Home Almanac Nuclear Testing
Nuclear Testing
Since the first nuclear test explosion on July 16 , 1945 , at least eight nations have detonated 2,056 nuclear test explosions at dozens of test sites , including Lop Nor in China , the atolls of the Pacific , Nevada , Algeria where France conducted its first nuclear device , western Australia where the U.K. exploded nuclear weapons , the South Atlantic , Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan , across Russia , and elsewhere .
Capturing and storing some of the carbon that would be released in the processing of Canada ’s tar sands may not clean the industry up .
To turn the vast but dirty resource into useable oil , Canada will have to spew vast amounts of greenhouse gases .
That ’s the conclusion of a new study on the potential of so - called carbon capture and storage technology to reduce carbon emissions from tar sands operations .
The Athabasca tar sands of north - eastern Alberta , Canada , hold more than 170 billion barrels of recoverable oil , second only to Saudi Arabia ’s reserves .
However , the oil is in the form of tarry bitumen that requires a great deal of energy to extract and turn into usable oil – some three to five times as much as conventional crude .
The greenhouse gases released during the processing of tar sands make it an environmentally disastrous proposition .
No wonder , then , that the government of Alberta is putting much emphasis , and billions of research and development dollars , into carbon - capture technologies that aim to remove carbon dioxide released by the tar sands industry and store it safely underground .
Advertisement
But a new analysis ( PDF ) published this week by a UK consumer cooperative and the UK branch of environmental group WWF suggests that carbon capture will be too little , too late .
Using the oil industry ’s own best - case estimate – that 30 per cent of carbon emissions could be captured by 2030 and 50 per cent by 2050 – the analysts note that this falls far short of the reduction needed to make tar sands oil compare favourably with conventional crude .
But carbon - capture technology is still experimental , retorts Jerry Bellikka , a spokesman for the Alberta government ’s energy department .
“ To do a paper analysis and suggest that it ca n’t work is a great hypothetical exercise , ” he says .
“ We ’re trying to do the practical application and [ get ] results . ”
Is this haunting picture proof that chimps really DO grieve ?
Advertisement
United in what appears to be deep and profound grief , a phalanx of more than a dozen chimpanzees stood in silence watching from behind the wire of their enclosure as the body of one of their own was wheeled past .
This extraordinary scene took place recently at the Sanaga - Yong Chimpanzee Rescue Center in Cameroon , West Africa .
When a chimp called Dorothy , who was in her late 40s , died of heart failure , her fellow apes seemed to be stricken by sorrow .
As they wrapped their arms around each other in a gesture of solidarity , Dorothy 's female keeper gently settled her into the wheelbarrow which carried her to her final resting place - not before giving this much - loved inhabitant of the centre a final affectionate stroke on the forehead .
Chimpanzees appear to console one another as Dorothy is carried to her final resting place in a wheelbarrow
Locals from the village serve as ' care - givers ' to the chimps - something hugely needed by the animals who are all orphans as their mothers were killed for the illegal bushmeat trade .
Hunters captured them as young babies , often still clinging to their mother 's bodies , to sell as pets .
Until recently , describing scenes like this in terms of human emotions such as ' grief ' would have been dismissed by scientists as naive anthropomorphising .
On sale now : National Geographic
But a growing body of evidence suggests that ' higher ' emotions - such as grieving for a loved one after death , and even a deep understanding of what death is - may not just be the preserve of our species .
Chimpanzees - as you can see in the November issue of National Geographic magazine , on sale now - and the closely related Bonobos maintain hugely complex social networks , largely held together by sex and grooming .
They have often been observed apparently grieving for lost family and tribe members by entering a period of quiet mourning after a death , showing subdued emotions and behaviour .
And such complex emotions are not the preserve of primates or even mammals .
Just this month , for instance , Dr Marc Bekoff , an ethologist at the University of Colorado , reported evidence that magpies not only appear to grieve for their dead but carry out something akin to a funeral ritual .
In one instance , a group of four magpies took it in turns to approach the corpse of their dead comrade .
Two of the birds then flew off to return with a piece of grass , which they laid down by the corpse .
The birds then stood vigil .
In fact , there is a large body of anecdotal evidence that corvids - the group of super - bright birds that include crows , magpies and rooks - engage in many sophisticated social rituals .
But the most famous nonhuman death rituals are those of elephants , who will often spend days guarding a dead body , gently prodding the remains with their trunks and giving the impression of being lost in grief .
Elephants are highly social , long - lived and intelligent animals , whose excellent memory is no myth .
It is perhaps unsurprising that the loss of a member of the clan produces an emotional reaction .
The evolution of human death rituals is lost in the mists of time .
There is some evidence that now - extinct hominid species such as the Neanderthals appreciated the significance of mortality , burying their dead and even scattering the graves with flowers .
Seeing a group of chimpanzees , our closest relatives , apparently paying a sad and heart - rending tribute to their much - loved lost sister gives us , perhaps , a window on how this deepest and most fundamental emotion evolved in our own ancestors .
Lately , I ’ve been getting a lot of questions about giving good criticism .
Giving good , constructive criticism is hard .
There are countless ways to give criticism , and some of them are effective .
Finding something to criticize is easy ; there are always different ways to do things .
Being constructive as you tear apart someone else ’s writing is much more difficult .
Online , it ’s often difficult to tell how well a new ( to me ) writer will react when I offer my criticism .
Most beginning writers are looking to improve their confidence … they think what they ’ve written is good , so they ’re looking for confirmation of that .
Most experienced writers want useful feedback–figuring out what they can change to improve their story .
When I ’m criticizing an author ’s work for the first time , I usually fall back on a tried and true technique : “ sandwiching . ”
This offers a bit from both perspectives : building confidence and giving useful feedback .
1. Praise for overall work .
( The top bun )
Writing anything long enough to tell a story or inform someone about some topic is worthy of praise –the writer had to put a certain amount of time into it .
If nothing else , you can always say , “ I can see that you ’ve put a lot of work into this .
I have a few suggestions for you to help you think about your style . ”
If you do n’t feel comfortable with this generic praise , then you may want to pick one or two specific items that you like instead .
There ’s always something that you can pull out that you liked ( assuming the work is longer than a sentence ) .
For example , “ I liked how your character smiled as he spoke ; that shows a bit of the character ’s personality . ”
After you ’ve given some praise , then you move on to the tougher piece … giving some constructive criticism .
2. Mention the two or three things that need the most attention .
( The stuff that makes the sandwich–meat , tomatoes , lettuce , cheese , etc )
Unless the author has requested a full , no holds barred edit , focus just on two or three things that need the most attention .
Avoid spelling and grammar comments in your first few rounds –if the author is rewriting sections , spending time on grammar or spelling is likely to result in wasted time .
Spelling and grammar should be among the last things to be corrected .
Instead , focus on things like inconsistencies within the text .
For example , “ You said in your second paragraph that monkeys never come out of trees , and then you have a picture of a monkey on the ground after paragraph seven . ”
Another appropriate focus area might be missing information or believability of certain sections .
For example , “ I do n’t understand why Jane would take that action … is there something about her character that you might be assuming , but not saying ?
Can you give hints to the reader as to why she made that decision ( either before or after ) ? ”
3 . Praise on specific piece that was done well .
( The bottom bun )
I sometimes switch 1 and 3 around–after all the sandwich is still a sandwich either way .
Regardless of what is written , it is always possible to find at least one , specific piece that you liked .
Point it out at this time .
This leaves the writer with a positive impression of your criticism , and also helps them recognize the good pieces in their writing , as well as what needs to improve .
If you are truly unable to find anything you like , you can still find something that was better than the rest of the work .
Also , you can always rely on the generic statement used in 1 , restated a different way here .
4. Words of encouragement
After receiving criticism on any piece of writing , a writer may feel like you have been attacking them .
Most writers feel like their work is an extension of themselves , so criticizing the work feels like a criticism of the writer .
Recognize the human portion of the writing by giving some words of encouragement .
Remind the writer that you recognize the writer is separate from the work .
You can be as elaborate as you like , but I ’ve found that something brief is usually enough , such as :
“ Looking forward to your next draft ! ”
“ I hope this helps !
Let me know if you have any questions . ”
“ Keep working at this , with the ideas I ’ve mentioned above .
I think with a little more polish , this good work could be great ! ”
New writers tend to respond well to the sandwich method , because it helps them know what they ’ve done well and what should improve .
Later , as you develop more of a relationship with the writer ( and / or the writer gains experience ) , you can expand into more blunt criticism .
This method allows you to establish a rapport with the writer , so that they understand in future dealings that you truly do care about their improvement .
Experienced writers also tend to respond well to this technique , because it offers them the benefits of praise ( praise always feels good ) as well as a few things to work on .
Experienced writers may also recognize the pattern and quickly realize that you are an experienced editor who is a valuable resource .

That ’s why it ’s especially important to pay close attention to your doctor ’s actions .
Make sure that you do n’t minimize your injuries when you explain them to your doctor .
Make sure he or she writes everything down correctly in your chart .
If necessary , bring a friend or family member with you to make sure that this is done .
And — if your doctor is n’t getting it right — do n’t be afraid to see someone else .
The man who drew the longest prison sentence in U.S. history for eco-sabotage walked out of prison this morning .
After years of appeals , Jeffrey M. Luers , known to Eugene ’s anarchist clan as “ Free , ” was just that .
But just as quickly , he was sent back to prison .
The Oregon Department of Corrections acknowledged today that it mistakenly allowed Luers to take advantage of a new law , House Bill 3508 , which grants reduced sentences for certain classes of inmates .
Luers ’ sentence for arson made him ineligible for early release , said prisons spokeswoman Jennifer Black , in Salem .
“ It ’s a mistake we wish had n’t happened , ” she said .
“ We ’re reviewing processes and hoping that it just does not happen again . ”
Luers was released from Columbia River Correctional Institution in Northeast Portland this morning and given 24 hours to check in with his parole officer in Lane County .
He checked in this afternoon , where he learned of the error .
Authorities took the 30 - year - old radical environmentalist back to prison , a rude reversal for those who worked years to get Luers out .
The day began with Luers ’ supporters writing on the Friends of Jeff Luers Web site : “ We are still pinching ourselves . ”
Luers ’ appellate lawyer in Salem , Shawn Wiley , weighed in with an e-mail comment to The Oregonian : “ This day is long overdue .
Jeff is a kind , thoughtful , intelligent young man , and our community benefits much more from his presence in it rather than behind bars . "
But their joy was short lived .
Luers ' saga began in 2001 , when Lane County Circuit Judge Lyle Velure sentenced him to 22 years , 8 months in prison after finding him guilty of two crimes in Eugene -- attempting to set fire to a gasoline tanker owned by a petroleum distributor , then firebombing three pickup trucks at a Chevy dealership .
The sentence drew gasps because it was by far the stiffest punishment handed to an eco-saboteur in the United States .
Across the nation , environmental activists and civil libertarians expressed outrage .
At that time , Luers ’ crimes were paltry compared to those committed by better known eco-saboteurs .
Rod Coronado , for instance , who waged a multi-state arson campaign against the fur industry , was sentenced to less than five years in federal prison .
After Luers was sent to prison , arsons by underground groups such as the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front ceased in Oregon , once a hotbed of environmentally motivated firebombings and vandalism .
Law enforcement authorities said Luers ’ long sentence served as a deterrent to those who might consider setting fire to SUVs , mink ranches or Forest Service installations .
In a phone interview from prison in September 2001 , Luers told The Oregonian that the gravity of his sentence did not strike him until he lay in a prison bunk one day realizing his parents might die before he is freed .
Luers told the newspaper that he set fire to the pickups to protest gas - guzzling vehicles and the disproportionate amount of pollution they belch into the air .
He described the arson at Eugene ’s Romania Chevrolet as a final , desperate act of an environmental crusade that began benignly with letters to politicians , door - to - door work with the Sierra Club and tree sits to prevent logging .
“ It was an escalation to a level I ’d never gone before and I could never live down , ” Luers told The Oregonian .
“ At that point , for me , I could no longer say I was an activist .
In my mind , I ’d taken it to the next level . ”
The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in February 2007 that Lane County must re-sentence Luers because Velure erred by convicting him of two counts of arson and imposing consecutive prison terms under Oregon ’s mandatory - minimum sentencing law .
Lawyers negotiated an agreement that re-sentenced Luers to 10 years in prison , which would have brought him home this Christmas .
Passage of House Bill 3508 this year gave Luers even more good news .
He was one of the roughly 2,000 Oregon prisoners to get notice recently that they were eligible for a fractional reduction of their sentence , Black said .
For Luers , this meant freedom a few months early .
But today ’s foul - up nixed his freedom .
Luers is scheduled for release on Dec. 16 .

Last week bookseller Barnes and Noble unveiled the Nook , its long - awaited eReading device .
Although ill - named , the Nook is a worthy competitor to the Kindle , offering a number of features not found on the Amazon device , including LendMe , a feature that allows for controlled sharing of ebooks .
While the sharing feature comes with a number of limitations , it would appear to be a small but important step towards making DRM - restricted content slightly more flexible for consumers .
There ’s just one problem — publishers want no part of the Nook ’s LendMe feature .
Publishers Lunch reported last week ( registration required ) that many large publishing houses have indicated that they wo n’t participate in the LendMe program .
To be clear , the LendMe feature is extremely limited .
Books are lent for a maximum of 14 days .
And unlike the library , there are no extensions .
When a book is lent , the lender loses access , and once the book is returned to the lender it can never be lent again .
So , why are publishers opposed to the Nook ’s crippled ebook sharing scheme ?
As one Unnamed Publishing Executive told Publishers Lunch :
“ if publishers agree to lending then every ebook offer now and in the future will come with this consumer feature .
Over time , I ’m concerned that lending wo n’t grow the market and in fact could hurt it . ”
What Unnamed Publishing Executive seems to fear most is a sense of consumer entitlement .
If consumers have the right to share ebooks now , they ’ll expect to have that right until the end of time .
Never mind the fact that consumers share print books all the time .
Since the sharing of books is apparently a bad thing , we can only assume that the ease with which consumers share printed books is a flaw inherent in the print format .
Fortunately publishers can correct that flaw in the digital realm through the liberal use of oppressive DRM .
I suppose this worldview should n’t come as a surprise .
If the history of digital media has taught us one thing it ’s that media companies see the digital future as an opportunity to exert extreme control over how consumers use and interact with content .
Contrary to the concerns of Unnamed Publishing Executive , it ’s easy to see how the Nook ’s LendMe feature might increase ebook sales .
Given the plethora of media options facing consumers today , a 14 day ebook loan is n’t very long at all .
Many of those loans will likely lead to unfinished reads .
What happens when a reader is halfway through a loaned novel and the Nookbook expires ?
If it ’s a good book that reader just might buy a copy .
Books are viral by nature , and the loaning of books is one of the main ways that the book virus spreads .
We ’ve all had friends push a favorite book on us .
Sometimes it ’s annoying , sometimes it ’s a life changing .
Frequently we end up buying other books by the same author as a result of the initial loan .
In that respect , loaned books are like a gateway drug .
It ’s in the publishing industry ’s best interest to ensure that the loaning of books continues in the digital era .
The Publisher ’s Dilemma : Consumer Perception of Value
There ’s a battle raging over ebook pricing .
Publishers believe that ebooks should be priced similarly to print books .
Consumers , meanwhile , have an entirely different perception of the value of an ebook .
eBooks as we know them ca n’t be loaned or resold , and are only readable on a limited range of devices .
Consumers who switch platforms are likely to find themselves with a library of unreadable ebooks .
Why pay full price for a product that comes with so many restrictions ?
The LendMe feature restores a small part of the value that ’s lost when consumers buy DRM - restricted ebooks .
The LendMe feature enhances the value of an ebook at a time when publishers are concerned that consumers expect ebooks to be cheap .
Will Publishers Succeed in Crippling the Nook ?
There ’s some indication that publishers already have succeeded in crippling the Nook .
When B&N announced the LendMe feature it was claimed that Nook books could be loaned an unlimited number of times ( though not simultaneously ) .
According to the same Publishers Lunch article quoted above , B&N added the single loan restriction when it became apparent that publishers would n’t tolerate anything less restrictive .
Now that publishers are balking at even a single loan , it ’s starting to look like LendMe will be B&N ’s equivalent of Kindle Text To Speech ( TTS ) .
Earlier this year Amazon introduced a feature that allowed the Kindle device to read any book aloud .
That feature was eventually reigned in when the Authors Guild complained that it infringed on digital audio rights .
As a result , Amazon turned control of the feature over to publishers — most of whom promptly disabled TTS on their Kindle ebook titles .
There is some small hope , however .
It ’s likely that small and independent publishers will see the value of LendMe .
Even if the feature is only embraced on a small - scale it could set the very precedent that Unnamed Publishing Executive is so worried about .
Once
Nook owners become aware that ebook sharing is possible , it ’s conceivable that they ’ll come to choose books that have LendMe enabled .
They ’ll certainly consider them more valuable , and may even be willing to pay a bit extra for those books — or maybe they ’ll expect books without LendMe to be priced a few dollars less .
One way or another , consumers will work out ebook sharing .
Either through a supported feature like LendMe , or by cracking DRM and sharing the unrestricted books with their friends and family .
In the digital era consumer always get what they want .
In this case what consumers want is also good for the publishing industry .
Once , while visiting Brooklyn , I got a call from a fellow Bronxite , back on the mainland .
When I revealed my location , he said , “ Brooklyn ?!
What time is it there ? ”
Despite the interborough bafflement , Brooklyn has been a genuine part of the land of the free since day one , that is , July 4 , 1776 .
So when Lena Horne was born there in 1917 , she automatically became a U.S. citizen .
About 25 years later Horne was asked to give two concerts at Camp Robinson in Alabama , one to white servicemen , the second to black GIs .
But she refused to do the second one when she saw that black Americans were sent to the back of the theater .
Who got the good seats up front ?
German prisoners of war .
Journalist Nat Brandt ’s book Harlem at War : The Black Experience during World War II quotes Horne as summing up the situation thusly : “ Screw this . ”
Today , of course , the commander in chief of the U.S. military is black , and President Barack Obama gets the best seats in the house .
A black president , however , causes great cognitive dissonance in some .
But members of the “ birther ” movement have found a clever solution : Obama is n’t really president !
Because he was n’t really born in the USA !
Of course , he was , in Hawaii .
( What time is it there ? )
So how could millions of people — a recent Daily Kos / Research 2000 poll found that 58 percent of Republicans , mostly concentrated in the South , either do n’t believe or are n’t sure Obama is a citizen — be persuaded that the president is foreign ?
And how could high - ranking officers treat white enemies better than black patriots ?
A part of the answer may lie in what ’s called implicit social cognition , which involves the deep - rooted assumptions we all carry around and even act on without realizing it .
Harvard University psychologist Mahzarin Banaji is a leader in implicit social cognition research .
She excavates the hidden beliefs people hold by measuring how fast they make value judgments when shown a rapid - fire succession of stimuli , such as photographs of faces .
At a talk she gave in October 2008 to a group of science journalists , Banaji discussed research she did with Thierry Devos , now at San Diego State University , that examined bias against Asians .
They found that volunteers linked white Americans more strongly than Asian - Americans with , well , America .
Banaji and Devos then decided to do what even they thought was a “ bizarre ” study : they had people gauge the “ American - ness ” of famous Asian - Americans , such as Connie Chung and tennis player Michael Chang , versus European whites , such as Hugh Grant .
The study found that white Europeans are more “ American ” than are nonwhite Americans in most minds .
( Which brings to my mind former vice president Dan Quayle , who mangled the United Negro College Fund slogan into “ What a waste it is to lose one ’s mind , or not to have a mind is being very wasteful . ” )
That result helps to explain how MSNBC ’s Web site in 1998 could have run the remarkable headline “ American Beats Out Kwan ” with a story on how Tara Lipinski defeated fellow American Michelle Kwan in a figure skating competition .
A Seattle Times article quoted the then director of the Japanese American Citizens League , reaching for a silver lining : “ Maybe there ’s a little progress in that they do n’t see Lipinski as a foreign name anymore . ”
Little surprise , then , that in a study done during the 2008 election campaign , Devos found that John Mc­Cain ( who , ironically , was born in Panama , albeit at a U.S. naval base ) was seen as more ” American ” than Obama .
But even British ex–prime minister Tony Blair was seen as more “ American ” than Obama , a finding that nearly made me spit out me bangers ‘ n ’ mash .
To borrow terminology from Obama ’s health care proposals , the birthers thus appear to suffer from a preexisting condition .
A possible treat­ment is a recording by Aretha Franklin , who had no reason not to perform at Obama ’s inauguration .
The song is entitled “ Think . ”
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stroller maker Maclaren announced a recall on Monday that affects about 1 million umbrella strollers that can reportedly amputate or lacerate children 's fingertips .
So far , the company said there have been 12 amputations across the country .
This happens when children get their fingers stuck in between the stroller 's side hinges while it is being opened or closed .
The South Norwalk , Conn. - based company announced the voluntary recall in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and advises customers to stop using the products manufactured in China sold since 1999 at stores including Babies R Us and Target .
Consumers can contact Maclaren at 877-688-2326 or visit www.maclaren.us/recall to receive a free repair kit .
Maclaren said the kit includes hinge covers designed to fit all Maclaren strollers .
The recall affects the following models , which range in price from $ 100 to $ 400 : Volo , Triumph , Quest Sport , Quest Mod , Techno XT , TechnoXLR , Twin Triumph , Twin Techno , and Easy Traveller .
Sprint Nextel Corp. said Thursday it will sell its first phone running Google Inc. 's Android software in October , giving the Internet company a larger foothold in the mobile world .
Consumers have been slow to embrace the mobile platform , which has been available only through T - Mobile USA .
Sprint offers Google a larger subscriber base .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Almost half the financial sector workers in London and New York say they would take sensitive company information with them if they were fired , according to a new transatlantic survey .
The poll of 600 office workers in Canary Wharf in London and Wall Street in New York by management specialists Cyber - Ark revealed that 41 percent of respondents had taken sensitive data with them to their new position
A third also said they would pass on company information if it proved useful in getting friends or family a job .
Nearly 50 percent said that if they were fired tomorrow they would take company information with them , and 39 percent would download company / competitive information if they got wind that their job was at risk .
And a quarter of workers said that the recession has meant that they feel less loyal toward their employer .
“ While we are seeing glimmers of hope in the UK and US economy , clearly employee confidence has been rocked , ” UK Director of Cyber - Ark Mark Fullbrook said in a statement .
“ This survey shows that many workers are willing to do practically anything to ensure job security or make themselves more marketable - including committing a crime . ”
Top of the hit list for data thieves was customer and contact details at 29 percent , followed by plans and proposals at 18 percent and product information at 11 percent .
Thirteen percent who said they would pilfer data would also take password codes to continue getting into the network after they ’ve left the company .
More than 30 percent said they would take a peek at the redundancy list to find out if their name was on it , choosing to bribe a mate in the HR department first .
The survey also showed that 85 percent of respondents admitted they knew it is illegal to download corporate information from their employer .
More than half said it has become a lot easier to take sensitive information from under their bosses noses this year , up from 29 percent last year .
The survey also highlighted differences between British and U.S. workers in the recession .
Just over a quarter of British employees said they were prepared to work 80 hours a week to keep their jobs , while only 12 percent of U.S. workers suggested they would work that much harder to keep their jobs .
The poll also showed that only 20 percent of British respondents were prepared to take a salary cut to keep their jobs compared to 50 percent of U.S. workers .

RIYADH , Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia ’s king waived a flogging sentence given to a female journalist charged for involvement in a risque TV show , the second such pardoning of such a high - profile case by the monarch in recent years .
King Abdullah ’s decision to waive 22 - year - old journalist Rozanna al - Yami ’s sentence of 60 lashes imposed by a judge in Jiddah follows intense international media attention .
The journalist was charged with helping coordinate a talk show on a Lebanese channel that featured a Saudi man describing what appeared to be his active sex life .
Though the charges against her were dropped , the judge ordered the flogging as a “ deterrent , ’’ Yami said .
In November 2007 , the king waived a flogging sentence of 90 lashes against a rape victim for being alone in a car with an unrelated man shortly before the two were attacked .
That case also evoked international outrage over the Saudi judiciary .
Yesterday , Information Ministry spokesman Abdul - Rahman al - Hazza said the king waived the sentence and ordered that Yami ’s case and that of another journalist - a pregnant woman also accused of involvement in the program - be referred to a committee in the ministry .
Hazza said the king made his decision after he was briefed by the information minister .
Yami worked as a coordinator for the program but has denied involvement in the sex - related episode .

Tom Fitzgerald at the Inquirer has a story today on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not backing down from a demand for a public health insurance option .
Pelosi joined Philly - area lawmakers in Philadelphia today .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during a visit to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital today that a government - run insurance program must be in the final version of health - care reform , even as other Democratic leaders have suggested it could pass without the provision .
" No bill can pass the House of Representatives without a public option in it , " Pelosi said , after touring the hospital emergency room .
Understanding dark energy is the number one issue in explaining the universe , according to Salman Habib , of the Laboratory 's Nuclear and Particle Physics , Astrophysics and Cosmology group .
" Because the universe is expanding and at the same time accelerating , either there is a huge gap in our understanding of physics , or there is a strange new form of matter that dominates the universe -- ' dark energy ' -- making up about 70 percent of it , " said Habib .
" In addition , there is five times more of an unknown ' dark matter ' than there is ordinary matter in the universe , and we know it 's there from many different observations , most spectacularly , we 've seen it bend light in pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope , but its origin is also not understood . "
Even though it 's looking at only a small segment of the " accessible " universe , Habib's " Roadrunner Universe " model requires a petascale computer because , like the universe , it 's mind - bendingly large .
The model 's basic unit is a particle with a mass of approximately one billion suns ( in order to sample galaxies with masses of about a trillion suns ) , and it includes 64 billion and more of those particles .
The model is one of the largest simulations of the distribution of matter in the universe , and aims to look at galaxy - scale mass concentrations above and beyond quantities seen in state - of - the - art sky surveys .
" We are trying to really understand how to more completely and more accurately describe the observable universe , so we can help in the design of future experiments and interpret observations from ongoing observations like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - III .
We are particularly interested in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ( LSST ) in Chile , in which LANL is an institutional member , and DOE and NASA 's Joint Dark Energy Mission ( JDEM ) , " said Habib .
" To do the science in any sort of reasonable amount of time requires a petascale machine at the least . "
The Roadrunner Universe model relies on a hierarchical grid / particle algorithm that best matches the physical aspects of the simulation to the hybrid architecture of Roadrunner .
Habib and his team wrote an entirely new computer code that aggressively exploits Roadrunner 's hybrid architecture and makes full use of the PowerXCell 8i computational accelerators .
They also created a dedicated analysis and visualization software framework to handle the huge simulation database .
" Our effort is aimed at pushing the current state of the art by three orders of magnitude in terms of computational and scientific throughput , " said Habib .
I 'm confident the final database created by Roadrunner will be an essential component of dark universe science for years to come . "
About Roadrunner , the world 's fastest supercomputer , first to break the petaflop barrier
On Memorial Day , May 26 , 2008 , the " Roadrunner " supercomputer exceeded a sustained speed of 1 petaflop / s , or 1 million billion calculations per second .
" Petaflop / s " is computer jargon -- peta signifying the number 1 followed by 15 zeros ( sometimes called a quadrillion ) and flop / s meaning " floating point operation per second . "
Shortly after that it was named the world 's fastest supercomputer by the TOP500 organization at the June 2008 International Supercomputing Conference in Dresden Germany .
The Roadrunner supercomputer , developed by IBM in partnership with the Laboratory and the National Nuclear Security Administration , will be used to perform advanced physics and predictive simulations in a classified mode to assure the safety , security , and reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent .
The system will be used by scientists at the NNSA 's Los Alamos , Sandia , and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories .
The secret to its record - breaking performance is a unique hybrid design .
Each compute node in this cluster consists of two AMD Opteron™ dual - core processors plus four PowerXCell 8i™ processors used as computational accelerators .
The accelerators used in Roadrunner are a special IBM - developed variant of the Cell processor used in the Sony PlayStation 3 ® .
The node - attached Cell accelerators are what make Roadrunner different than typical clusters .
Roadrunner is still currently the world 's fastest with a speed of 1.105 petaflop / s per second , according to the TOP500 announcement at the November 2008 Supercomputing Conference in Austin Texas , and it again retained the # 1 position at the June ISC09 conference .
Michael Moore 's new film is " Capitalism : A Love Story . "
Michael Moore 's new film , " Capitalism : A Love Story , " is representative of his mockumentary style , and for some audiences , it may seem less annoying than previous films ( " Bowling for Columbine , " " Fahrenheit 9/11 , " " Sicko " ) .
Still others , whose views it challenges , may resist long , hard and loud .
For some , it may be considered his best work yet .
( The film opens nationwide Oct. 2 . )
The trailer does a fair job of conveying the essence of the film , but what may not be apparent is how much Moore 's Catholicism influences the film -- along with a sharp , honest critique of Christianity that even Bill Maher failed to accomplish in his lazy 2008 lampoon " Religulous . "
Moore 's film is a reaction / response to the Oct. 3 , 2008 bailout of the U.S. financial system , The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act , and its impact on the regular people .
According to Moore these people are us , 95 percent of the U.S. population .
He takes solid aim at the top 1 percent who make more money than the rest of us put together .
He wraps crime tape around a bank on Wall Street ; he tries to arrest the CEOs of banks and financial companies .
He offers up major , and verifiable , examples of greed , profit , and capitalism run amuck .
As for Moore 's faith , he speaks about going to a sisters ' school and wanting to be a priest growing up , wanting to make a difference .
I missed the filmmaker 's comment that he was influenced by Jesuit Fr. Daniel Berrigan , but L.A. Times critic Kenneth Turan caught it ( See Turan 's review now posted on Moore 's Web site .
Moore evokes strong opinions about capitalism from two priests and briefly , Detroit 's Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton ( retired ) : capitalism is evil .
He then captures several minutes of a Chicago priest celebrating Mass for the workers of Republic Windows and Doors during their 2008 sit-in when they held out for their wages as the company filed for bankruptcy .
The priest tells them about growing up in Chicago when the steel mills were closing down and its harsh impact on his family .
The juxtaposition of the Eucharist and the bishops ' words as a sign of solidarity , are deeply moving .
But Moore caps all this with his own brand of irony , knowing that context is everything .
He uses a few scenes from Zeffirelli's 1977 miniseries " Jesus of Nazareth " to demonstrate how false , how hypocritical Christianity sounds by having Jesus utter the words of insurance companies when , for example , they deny care .
When the cripple asks to be healed , Jesus refuses , saying the man has a pre-existing condition .
Citizenship is not adverse to discipleship , the clips imply .
Each requires the other -- or how can we possibly be living who we say we are ?
Moore clearly distinguishes between capitalism as an economic system and democracy as a political system and then shows that the United States is actually a political economy and real people are suffering .
What is the cure ?
Democracy .
There is a guide available for Capitalism : A Love Story in the themes of Catholic social teaching .
The longer version is Benedict XVI 's Caritas in Veritate .
A catechist I know always says , " Everything in the Bible is true and some of it actually happened . "
I recommend this approach to Moore 's films , as well .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) went after the Associated Press on Sunday , accusing them of engaging in " opposition research " in fact - checking her forthcoming book .
Palin blasted the AP 's fact check of her new book , " Going Rogue , " which says the former governor had gone rogue with some of the facts .
" Amazingly , but not surprisingly , the AP somehow nabbed a copy of the book before it was released , " Palin wrote on her Facebook page .
" They 're now erroneously reporting on the book 's contents and are repeating many of the same things they spewed during the campaign and afterwards . "
ADVERTISEMENT
" We 've heard 11 writers are engaged in this opposition research , er , ' fact checking ' research ! " Palin continued .
" Imagine that – 11 AP reporters dedicating time and resources to tearing up the book , instead of using the time and resources to " fact check " what 's going on with Sheik Mohammed 's trial , Pelosi 's health care takeover costs , Hassan 's associations , etc .
" The AP fact check said , among other things , that Palin 's book at times misrepresents her record as a governor and GOP vice presidential candidate .
Among the elements of the fact check , released Friday , were reports that Palin was not exactly frugal as a traveler while governor , that she did not raise money from small donors as she 'd written , and that she had opposed the government bailouts for the financial industry during the height of the campaign .
Palin has long made a habit of blasting the media for what she claims have been unfair or erroneous reports .
She directed readers to what she said was a more accurate portrayal of her book at a website run by her conservative supporters .
" As always , they did a great job holding some of the media accountable for spreading more misinformation and for making things up , " she said .
The Associated Press employs roughly 4,100 journalists around the globe .
Editor 's note : Jonathan Safran Foer is the author of the critically acclaimed novels " Everything is Illuminated " and " Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close . "
His latest book , the nonfiction " Eating Animals , " ( Little , Brown and Co. ) will be published November 2 .
New York ( CNN ) --
Like most people , I 'd given some thought to what meat actually is , but until I became a father and faced the prospect of having to make food choices on someone else 's behalf , there was no urgency to get to the bottom of things .
I 'm a novelist and never had it in mind to write nonfiction .
Frankly , I doubt I 'll ever do it again .
But the subject of animal agriculture , at this moment , is something no one should ignore .
As a writer , putting words on the page is how I pay attention .
If the way we raise animals for food is n't the most important problem in the world right now , it 's arguably the No. 1 cause of global warming :
The United Nations reports the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined .
It 's the No. 1 cause of animal suffering , a decisive factor in the creation of zoonotic diseases like bird and swine flu , and the list goes on .
It is the problem with the most deafening silence surrounding it .
Even the most political people , the most thoughtful and engaged , tend not to " go there . "
And for good reason .
Going there can be extremely uncomfortable .
Food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up ; it is culture and identity .
Reason plays some role in our decisions about food , but it 's rarely driving the car .
We need a better way to talk about eating animals , a way that does n't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits , cravings , family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation .
The more they are allowed in , the more able we will be to follow our best instincts .
And although there are many respectable ways to think about meat , there is not a person on Earth whose best instincts would lead him or her to factory farming .
My book , " Eating Animals , " addresses factory farming from numerous perspectives : animal welfare , the environment , the price paid by rural communities , the economic costs .
In two essays , I will share some of what I 've learned about how the way we raise animals for food affects human health .
What we eat and what we are
Why are n't more people aware of , and angry about , the rates of avoidable food - borne illness ?
Perhaps it does n't seem obvious that something is amiss simply because anything that happens all the time -- like meat , especially poultry , becoming infected by pathogens -- tends to fade into the background .
Whatever the case , if you know what to look for , the pathogen problem comes into terrifying focus .
For example , the next time a friend has a sudden " flu " -- what folks sometimes misdescribe as " the stomach flu " -- ask a few questions .
Was your friend 's illness one of those " 24 - hour flus " that come and go quickly : retch or crap , then relief ?
The diagnosis is n't quite so simple , but if the answer to this question is yes , your friend probably did n't have the flu at all .
He or she was probably suffering from one of the 76 million cases of food - borne illness the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated happen in America each year .
Your friend did n't " catch a bug " so much as eat a bug .
And in all likelihood , that bug was created by factory farming .
Beyond the sheer number of illnesses linked to factory farming , we know that factory farms are contributing to the growth of antimicrobial - resistant pathogens simply because these farms consume so many antimicrobials .
We have to go to a doctor to obtain antibiotics and other antimicrobials as a public - health measure to limit the number of such drugs being taken by humans .
We accept this inconvenience because of its medical importance .
Microbes eventually adapt to antimicrobials , and we want to make sure it is the truly sick who benefit from the finite number of uses any antimicrobial will have before the microbes learn how to survive it .
On a typical factory farm , drugs are fed to animals with every meal .
In poultry factory farms , they almost have to be .
It 's a perfect storm :
The animals have been bred to such extremes that sickness is inevitable , and the living conditions promote illness .
Industry saw this problem from the beginning , but rather than accept less - productive animals , it compensated for the animals ' compromised immunity with drugs .
As a result , farmed animals are fed antibiotics nontherapeutically : that is , before they get sick .
In the United States , about 3 million pounds of antibiotics are given to humans each year , but a whopping 17.8 million pounds are fed to livestock -- at least , that is what the industry claims .
The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the industry underreported its antibiotic use by at least 40 percent .
The group calculated that 24.6 million pounds of antibiotics were fed to chickens , pigs and other farmed animals , counting only nontherapeutic uses .
And that was in 2001 .
In other words , for every dose of antibiotics taken by a sick human , eight doses are given to a " healthy " animal .
The implications for creating drug - resistant pathogens are quite straightforward .
Study after study has shown that antimicrobial resistance follows quickly on the heels of the introduction of new drugs on factory farms .
For example , in 1995 , when the Food and Drug Administration approved fluoroquinolones -- such as Cipro -- for use in chickens against the protest of the Centers for Disease Control , the percentage of bacteria resistant to this powerful new class of antibiotics rose from almost zero to 18 percent by 2002 .
A broader study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed an eightfold increase in antimicrobial resistance from 1992 to 1997 and linked this increase to the use of antimicrobials in farmed chickens .
As far back as the late 1960s , scientists have warned against the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farmed - animal feed .
Today , institutions as diverse as the American Medical Association ; the Centers for Disease Control ; the Institute of Medicine , a division of the National Academy of Sciences ; and the World Health Organization have linked nontherapeutic antibiotic use on factory farms with increased antimicrobial resistance and called for a ban .
Still , the factory farm industry has effectively opposed such a ban in the United States .
And , unsurprisingly , the limited bans in other countries are only a limited solution .
There is a glaring reason that the necessary total ban on nontherapeutic use of antibiotics has n't happened :
The factory farm industry , allied with the pharmaceutical industry , has more power than public - health professionals .
What is the source of the industry 's immense power ?
We give it to them .
We have chosen , unwittingly , to fund this industry on a massive scale by eating factory - farmed animal products .
And we do so daily .
The same conditions that lead at least 76 million Americans to become ill from their food annually and that promote antimicrobial resistance also contribute to the risk of a pandemic .
At a remarkable 2004 conference , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) put their tremendous resources together to evaluate the available information on " emerging zoonotic diseases " or those spread by humans - to - animals and animals - to - humans .
At the time of the conference , H5N1 and SARS topped the list of feared emerging zoonotic diseases .
Today , the H1N1 swine flu would be the pathogen enemy No. 1 .
The scientists distinguished between " primary risk factors " for zoonotic diseases and mere " amplification risk factors , " which affect only the rate at which a disease spreads .
Their examples of primary risk factors were " change to an agricultural production system or consumption patterns . "
What particular agricultural and consumer changes did they have in mind ?
First in a list of four main risk factors was " increasing demand for animal protein , " which is a way of saying that demand for meat , eggs , and dairy is a " primary factor " influencing emerging zoonotic diseases .
This demand for animal products , the report continues , leads to " changes in farming practices . "
Lest we have any confusion about the " changes " that are relevant , poultry factory farms are singled out .
Similar conclusions were reached by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology , which brought together industry experts and experts from the WHO , OIE and USDA .
Their 2005 report argued that a major impact of factory farming is " the rapid selection and amplification of pathogens that arise from a virulent ancestor ( frequently by subtle mutation ) , thus there is increasing risk for disease entrance and / or dissemination . "
Breeding genetically uniform and sickness - prone birds in the overcrowded , stressful , feces - infested and artificially lit conditions of factory farms promotes the growth and mutation of pathogens .
The " cost of increased efficiency , " the report concludes , is increased global risk for diseases .
Our choice is simple : cheap chicken or our health .
Today , the factory farm - pandemic link could n't be more lucid .
The primary ancestor of the recent H1N1 swine flu outbreak originated at a hog factory farm in America 's most hog - factory - rich state , North Carolina , and then quickly spread throughout the Americas .
It was in these factory farms that scientists saw , for the first time , viruses that combined genetic material from bird , pig and human viruses .
Scientists at Columbia and Princeton Universities have actually been able to trace six of the eight genetic segments of the most feared virus in the world directly to U.S. factory farms .
Perhaps in the back of our minds we already understand , without all the science , that something terribly wrong is happening .
We know that it cannot possibly be healthy to raise such grotesque animals in such grossly unnatural conditions .
We know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced , it will be a horror film .
We perhaps know more than we care to admit , keeping it down in the dark places of our memory -- disavowed .
When we eat factory - farmed meat , we live on tortured flesh .
Increasingly , those sick animals are making us sick .

For Karl Marx , it would be a moment to savour – or to mourn .
Last October , world financial leaders huddled like chastened schoolchildren in an International Monetary Fund meeting hall as the world crashed around their ears .
The man lecturing them on the error of unrestrained capitalism 's ways – and its remedies , including a newspeak nationalization of banks – was IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn , leading French socialist and onetime member of the Union of Communist Students .
" I was at these meetings 10 years ago , " he recalled with a wry smile .
" And I must say , this was different . "
How different was written on the faces of the financial giants who were , since the fall of communism , the undisputed masters of the universe .
A decade earlier , a scolding from an acknowledged socialist would have made them scoff .
Now , they hung on every potentially world - saving word from a man who had cut his teeth on Marx .
But for those who feared that the crisis would rejuvenate communism and grind them under the heels of Marx and Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin , the other shoe never dropped .
" When the worldwide financial crisis came to a head in the second half of 2008 , " says respected communism scholar Archie Brown , " it did at least lead to an increase in sales of ( Marx 's ) Das Kapital in Germany , but neither there nor anywhere else in Europe did it lead to a revival of Marxist - Leninist parties . "
Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , Brown says , communism is as dead as the waxen figure in Lenin 's tomb .
So dead that a 70 per cent plunge in the Moscow stock market last fall left Russia 's über - communists almost speechless , meekly whispering that any criticism of Vladimir Putin 's government " would only harm the market . "
The death of communism is largely unmourned , though it once sat astride almost one - third of the world , sweeping countries from Cambodia to Cuba .
Brown , whose encyclopedic survey , The Rise and Fall of Communism , distils 45 years of research , interviews and archival documents , has written the epitaph of an ideology that , at its passionate height , became a religion .
And , he believes , anyone seeking a way out of the current confusion by walking a hard line back to Marx and Lenin has splashed too much vodka into their Kool - Aid .
The ideals of communism could never come to pass in an imperfect world , and the very drivers of the system quickly fell off the train for utopia .
Communism , Brown argues , is a philosophy that catastrophically lost its way , and only massive bloodshed and brutality kept it from an early demise .
But the paradox of communism remains :
Why was the system that dominated so much of the world snuffed out so swiftly , with the fall of the Berlin Wall – and why did it linger so long ?
It 's not that Marx died without a legacy .
His clarion call for the workers to overthrow the greedy owners of the means of production was ultimately unsuccessful .
But his ideals of social justice have penetrated the wealthiest countries , including the United States , which fought toe - to - toe with communism for decades .
In the 21st century , the West has adopted Marx 's core belief that social progress is driven by material well - being , and social democracy has flourished .
Progressive income taxes help to redistribute wealth .
The right to inherited money , in many countries , is eroded by taxation .
Child labour has been banned , education is free , constitutions enshrine equality , and health and employment benefits are widespread .
It was in the U.S. , too , that Marx 's philosophy of materialism soared to its outer limits , as a pioneering philosophy of " toil and sweat " turned to rampant consumerism that broke all class barriers .
And as globalization flooded markets with more and cheaper goods , the West embraced materialism with a zeal that put materially challenged communism to shame .
But while social democracy was accepted in the West , the hardline communism of the Soviet Union attracted relatively few converts .
That , says Brown , is hardly surprising .
" The idea of building communism , a society in which the state would have withered away , turned out to be a dangerous illusion , " he writes .
" What was built instead was ... an oppressive party - state which was authoritarian at best and ruthlessly totalitarian at worst . "
In Russia , where communism first took root and spread , the nice guys of social reform finished last .
What remained was a " machine for staying in power , " as the Communist Party was known by disillusioned Soviet citizens .
The party 's monopoly of power was crucial to communism , says Brown .
So was a centrally controlled economy and the single - minded pursuit of a global communist utopia .
Backed by a huge nuclear - armed military , it extended its tentacles well beyond Russia 's borders , and after World War II became an unwieldy , inefficient and self - reinforcing system .
But paradoxically , the sticky mixture of cynicism , cronyism and corruption that held the Communist Party , and the Soviet Union , together was also responsible for its downfall .
" People learned the rules , " said Brown in a phone interview from Oxford .
" Self - censorship worked .
If they stepped out of line they could be punished with prison or psychiatric hospitals .
And the shortages ( of food and consumer items ) fed the communist system , because people who were in favour with the party could go to elite stores where they did n't have to join the daily queues . "

Oddly , Brown says , the most murderous period of communism , Joseph Stalin's " terror " of the 1930s , also saw a flowering of idealism , although more than 10 million lives were destroyed during that bloody period .
" There was more idealism in Stalin 's time than post - Stalin .
Lots of communists were ignorant of the horrors that Stalin imposed , and many joined the party thinking they would build a just , classless society . "
But that hope died with Nikita Khrushchev 's 1956 speech exposing Stalin 's large - scale murder of dedicated communists .
" It undermined the idea that the party was infallible , " Brown says .
" Many quit the party . "
For communism , it was the beginning of a long , slow decline .
Khrushchev's revelations touched off a quiet explosion of cynicism , and a growing realization that the " workers ' democracy " promised by Marx was not on the horizon .
When Khrushchev built large numbers of cheaply constructed apartments to free people from their cramped communal flats , he also freed them from fear of spying by their fellow tenants .
In spite of a KGB network of informers , anti-communist sentiments took root in the newly acquired private spaces , and the cracks in the party 's edifice widened .
Underground satire and dissident literature flourished .
In a popular joke from the threadbare 1980s , a young girl sobbed helplessly as her teacher regaled the class on the splendours of the Soviet Union , where everyone was comfortable , well fed and free to enjoy life .
" Why are you crying ? " the teacher demanded .
And the weeping girl replied , " I want to go to the Soviet Union . "
" After the 1960s , fewer and fewer people believed in communism , but we were stuck with it , " reflected a Moscow academic .
" The motto was , ` They pretend to pay us , we pretend to work . ' "
With the economy delivering declining rewards , and the Communist system increasingly discredited and dysfunctional , the seeds of destruction were sown .
But Mikhail Gorbachev , a Communist insider and born - again reformer , reaped the whirlwind .
As the Iron Curtain frayed in Poland , Hungary and East Germany , Gorbachev refused to hold it together by force .
With the Berlin Wall dismantled , and thousands of trapped East Germans pouring into the West to seek a better life , communism could not be far behind .
" In those days my grandmother was the most important part of our household , " says Tanya Popova , a Moscow accountant .
" If she did n't line up for food for hours a day while my mother was working , we did n't eat . "
In the long run , says Brown , such a system would have disappeared .
" It was n't competing well economically , and still less well on political liberties .
But without Gorbachev , the long run could have gone on much longer . "
The demise of Russian communism left a gaping hole at the heart of the ideology .
Europe had abandoned it .
China worked its way to " state capitalism " under Deng Xiaoping .
Vietnam was becoming a market economy , and only isolated North Korea and Cuba kept the faith .
Does any positive legacy remain ?
" There 's a high level of education in communist countries , but many others have achieved good results without it , " says Brown .
" There was an advanced space program , but the same was true of the U.S.
Other countries have proved that you can have a high standard of living without labour camps and one - party rule . "

On the issue that has been perhaps the most pronounced flash point in the national debate , 57 percent of all Americans now favor a public insurance option , while 40 percent oppose it .
Support has risen since mid-August , when a bare majority , 52 percent , said they favored it .
( In a June Post - ABC poll , support was 62 percent . )
If a public plan were run by the states and available only to those who lack affordable private options , support for it jumps to 76 percent .
Under those circumstances , even a majority of Republicans , 56 percent , would be in favor of it , about double their level of support without such a limitation .
Fifty - six percent of those polled back a provision mandating that all Americans buy insurance , either through their employers or on their own or through Medicare or Medicaid .
That number rises to 71 percent if the government were to provide subsidies for many lower - income Americans to help them buy coverage .
With those qualifiers , a majority of Republicans say they support the mandate .
Faced with a basic choice that soon may confront the administration and Democratic congressional leaders , a slim majority of Americans , 51 percent , would prefer a plan that included some form of government insurance for people who cannot get affordable private coverage even if it had no GOP support in Congress .
Thirty - seven percent would rather have a bipartisan plan that did not feature a public option .
Republicans and Democrats are on opposite sides of this question , while independents prefer a bill that includes a public option but does not have Republican support , by 52 percent to 35 percent .
Americans reallywant to get fooled again .
According to a new Washington Post - ABC
News poll , out today , a " clear majority " of Americans still backs the public option -- this after millions of dollars spent in Astroturf theatrics , distorted advertising , lobbying , and bribes to corrupt members of Congress ( Republicans in general , most of the Blue Dogs and the worst of the sticky - palmed Senate Democrats . )
We 'll get back to the poll in a moment .
I just want to make sure that we all realize who the insurance industry and the Medical - Industrial Complex are targeting right now .
Normally we give you career - long totals .
The legalistic bribes listed below are only for the current election cycle .
First the Insurance Industry ( 7th biggest industry in " donations to Congress this year ) :
And those who have taken the most from The Medical - Industrial Complex , again , in theelection cycle only :
While the entire Republican caucus -- including Maine Senator Olympia Snowe -- and many of the worst of the corrupt Democrats oppose a public option , the public -- their constituents ( the ones who vote for them ) -- want to see health care reformeda public option .
According to today 's " sizable majorities back two key and controversial provisions : both the so - called public option and a new mandate that would require all Americans to carry health insurance .
Independents and senior citizens , two groups crucial to the debate , have warmed to the idea of a public option , and are particularly supportive if it would be administered by the states and limited to those without access to affordable private coverage .
" All the polling I 've seen shows that the public is very wary of politicians who oppose a public option and take big money from special interests .
Starting today , by the way , Blue America is running more Blanche Lincoln ads in Arkansas , to commemorate her two votes in the Finance Committee against the public option -- and against the working families of her own state , who both want and need some meaningful health care reform .
One national pollster , who examined every single Blue Dog district ( 52 of them ) says any Blue Dog who votes against health care could be in jeopardy of having to become a lobbyist after the 2010 election .
As Alan Grayson has been saying , few Americansif the final bill is " bipartisan " or whether Olympia Snowe votes for it or not .
What they care about is that its a bill within mind , not lobbyists and Insurance Industry CEOs .
Senate Finance Committee member Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) was on with Olbermann last night discussing the shape of a public option and whether or not it 's likely that one will be included in the final bill .
It 's an interesting piece and worth watching :

A reader sends in this morsel from Citi , offering to take ( and keep quiet about ) a 47 % loss on a Citi credit card account if only the user will pay before year 's end .
A few things occur to us on reading this letter :
If widespread , this would appear to be awfully desperate on Citi 's part .
Perhaps , combined with the massive spike in APR we 've seen elsewhere , things are beginning to slip ?
Of course , this is mere speculation based on a single anecdotal case but it does make us very curious .
This is collossolly stupid of Citi .
Once word gets out what exactly do they expect the rest of their credit card customers will consider doing ?
The specificity of the balance settlement ( 53 % ) sounds suspiciously like someone 's model gone viral at Citi .
Why this figure exactly ?

Update ( at bottom ) : Senior White House adviser says Fox News ‘ not really a news station ’
This week , the Obama administration quietly announced their intentions concerning a change in behavior towards Fox News , reports the NYT ’s David Carr .
No longer comfortable ignoring the animosity the news network directs at the president , “ We ’re going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent , ” Anita Dunn , the White House communications director , said in an interview with the Times .

Until a month ago , the conflict between Fox News and Barack Obama only went in one direction .
As soon as Obama was in office , promotion and coverage of tax day ‘ tea parties ’ was aimed at the new president .
More recently , the extreme right - wing statements of Glenn Beck drew attention to the infamous network .
The discovery of Van Jones ’ past activism and the coverage of the investigation contributed to the dislike between both parties .
Fox News Network ’s general offensive against president Obama has been paying off : according to Carr , ratings are up 20 % this year .
Obama has much more to lose than Fox News .
On the campaign trail , one of his hallmark traits was the ability to take the higher road and be above partisan squabbling .
“ I will listen to you , ” he declared after emerging as the victor , “ especially when we disagree . ”
But the disagreements that Fox News and Obama ’s administration have are just too big to overcome .
On September 20th , the president appeared on all the Sunday talk shows except Fox News ’ .
As a guest on CNN , Anita Dunn explained , “ What I think is fair to say about Fox — and certainly it ’s the way we view it — is that it really is more a wing of the Republican Party . ”
Additionally , the White House has told Fox News not to expect presidential access until at least 2010 .

Speaking with ABC News host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday , senior White House adviser David Alexrod explained that Fox News is “ not really a news station . ”
“ It ’s not just their commentators , it ’s a lot of their news programming , ” he said .
“ It ’s not news , it ’s pushing a point of view .
We ’re going to appear on their shows .
We ’re going to participate , but understanding that they represent a point of view . ”

White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel also took time on Sunday to criticize Fox News , saying they are “ not a news organization , so much as it has a perspective . ”
“ More importantly , ” he continued , “ is not have the CNN ’s and the others in the world basically be led and following Fox , as if what they ’re trying to do is a legitimate news organization . ”

Holy crap !!
That scene when the new British account person Guy MacKendrick gets his foot sliced was simply unbelievable .
I 've watched lots of violent shows and movies with exceedingly bloody scenes , but this had to rank near the top .
This was more shocking than anything on Fringe whose first intent is to be shocking .
Driving a lawn mower in an office was never a good idea , and I knew something bad might happen , but that ?
The blood and the screaming was so overwhelming I had to pause it , recollect myself , and rewatch the 10 seconds .
I would like to add an addendum to the episode title : Guy Walks Into An Advertising Agency and Gets His Foot Chopped Off .
The discussion of the incident after , priceless .
We got to see the consequence of Eugene 's death on Sally .
She shows an obvious dislike of baby Gene not wanting to touch him or even look at him .
Sally had this weird notion of reincarnation regarding the baby .
Same name , same look .
I guess it would be reasonable for Sally to be frightened of the aspect .
The most difficult parts of the episode to watch was when Betty tried to deal with Sally .
First , she shows Sally a present from " Gene , " and tries convincing Sally it 's really from Gene and not from her .
She 's so cold in the scene with her blatant lie and absolute lack of effort to connect on an emotional level .
Her words in the end sum it up perfectly " She 's a child , she 'll get over it . "
Sorry Betty , but I think it 's time for you to get over it .
Her insistence of calling the baby Gene even though it upsets Sally is childish .
Yes , it keeps the memory of Gene alive , constant reminders of name should do that , and that 's fine .
The problem is that because the name upsets Sally , she should talk to Sally and explain things to her .
That 's why Betty is a parent and Sally is the child .
Even so , she makes no effort to comfort Sally and in the end , Don is the savior .
Joan 's troubles finally come to a head as she prepares to leave the agency .
Her husband does n't get chief residency and will never become a surgeon unless he practices in Georgia , and no one wants to work there .
If they are to survive financially , Joan needs a job .
Unfortunately , there 's no way she could take back her job .
The shame involved would be too great for someone like Joan .
By the way Joan saved Guy , she 's probably not going anywhere , but I wonder how far her home life has to slide before she tucks her tail and comes back to Sterling - Cooper .
A large part of the episode dealt with the British executives taking a trip over the pond .
Cooper is speculating of what will happen and tells
Don they have been paying close attention to him and even suggests of a London job for Don .
The whole time , Don has a WTF look on his face , clearly not understanding what is going on .
It turns out that there is a restructuring headed by Guy MacKendrick .
As we know , his foot gets cut off , and his career is also cut off .
I guess someone else is getting a promotion .
Don perhaps ?
Six episodes in and lots of people including me have been talking about the pacing which has kind of been aimless .

A translation company is looking to recruit Glaswegian interpreters to help business clients who are baffled by the local dialect .
Today Translations placed an advert in The Herald newspaper on Tuesday seeking speakers of " Glaswegian English " .
Successful candidates , who could earn up to £ 140 a day , must understand " vocabulary , accent and nuances " .
The firm said that so far 30 people had applied for the positions - some of them in Glaswegian .
SOME GLASGOW PATTER Baltic ( very cold )
Boost ( head off ) Buckie ( tonic wine favoured by youngsters ) Cludgie ( toilet ) Eejit ( idiot ) Hampden roar ( score ) Hee haw ( nothing )
Hen ( term used to address a woman or girl ) Laldy ( enthusiastic participation ) Maw ( mother ) Midden ( rubbish tip ) Pure ( very ) Moroculous ( drunk ) Messages ( shopping ) Scooby ( clue , rhyming slang - Scooby Doo )
Shoot the craw ( leave in a hurry ) Stooky ( plaster cast ) Swatch ( look ) Toaty ( small ) Ya dancer ( fantastic ) Yersel ( yourself ) Today Translations spokesman Mick Thorburn said : " Over the last few months we 've had clients asking us for Glaswegian translators .
" After some consideration we 've decided this is a service we would like to offer .
" Usually , the role would involve translating documents but in this case it 's more likely to be assisting foreign visitors to the city whose ' business English ' is not good enough to understand the local dialect . "
Mr Thorburn said successful candidates may have to sit in on business meetings .
He added : " We 're not necessarily looking for people who are particularly skilled in linguistics , just candidates who can help out clients who may struggle with native Glaswegian . "
Today Translations said that depending on the volume of applications , it expected to contact the successful clients in the next few weeks .
Earlier this year a bus driver was recognised for teaching his Eastern European colleagues at First Glasgow bus company to understand Glaswegian slang .
James Lillis said : " When new employees come to Scotland and hear the Glasgow accent , it can be a problem .
Drivers have to learn to understand what is meant when a customer says , for example , ' Gie us an aw day tae the toon ' ( Give me an all day ticket to the town ) . "

I do n’t think healthcare is too expensive , I think other goods and services are priced too low .
If using the toilet cost as much as a physical , then people would remark on the reasonable cost of healthcare .
Therefore , we should create a system that vastly raises the price of going to the restroom .
Here is my plan :
Use Only the Best Toilets : Toilet prices range from modest to ultra-expensive .
The very best in home and commercial toilets is the Toto Neorest 600 .
Upon approach , the lid automatically opens and the air purifier activates .
The built - in washer and dryer make toilet paper optional .
Six seconds after leaving the commode ’s sensor zone , it flushes and lowers the seat and lid .
With the touch of a button , you can warm the seat , change the water temperature , and perform a “ Cyclone flush ” if needed .
At nearly $ 5,000 apiece , this is the highest - quality toilet available and thus , the one that ’s best suited for every American ’s rear end .
We pass various pieces of legislation that call for the gradual elimination of the substandard toilets and their replacement with the superior model .
Obviously , seniors and people below the poverty line would qualify for free toilets , all others must pay for their own or have their employers include it as part of their compensation package .
There are approximately 350 million private and public toilets in the United States .
That comes out to $ 1.75 trillion before installation , but I ’m optimistic that we ’d receive a discount on such a big order .
Either way , you ’re looking at the horizon of what will be a multi-trillion dollar recession - proof industry .
Investors anyone ?
TOTO MS990CGR - 12 Neore ... Check Amazon for Pricing .
Only the Best Toilet Makers and Technicians : Using the bathroom plays a pivotal role in the life of every American , therefore we ’d only want the best companies to fashion the toilets .
The makers of the Neorest 600 ca n’t fulfill such a large order , so they will need to license the manufacture of their design to qualified companies .
Each state legislature should make the qualifications so stringent and exacting that only the best companies could bid on the project .
Since these thrones use the latest in toilet tech , only highly trained technicians may install and repair your commode .
They must go through a few hundred hours of training at schools your state legislatures have deemed appropriate .
The number of schools and seats available must be kept at a minimum lest you flood the labor market and push wages down .
Combine high wages with the high cost of goods , and you ’ll have families reeling when they are beset with so much as a faulty flapper .
The elite toilet repairman class is too few in number to make house calls , so if your toilet is clogged you will need to make an appointment for the following morning and find a way to bring it to the shop .
The Outcome :
After a few years of this system , we will see a vast increase in the number of middle - class Americans who can no longer afford a decent bathroom .
Some families band together and buy a timeshare toilet , but others will have no choice but to go in the streets .
Imagine that !
America … the most industrialized nation in the world , and still there are people who do n’t have a comfortable place to eliminate bodily wastes .
With a world like that , do you think people will complain about the cost of healthcare ?
The Solution :
If my plan were implemented , it would undoubtedly become a hot - button issue in the next presidential election .
Government is in the right place and has the right resources to ensure that every American has a decent place to go to the bathroom , and for free .
Having a $ 5,000 toilet in the house is a right , not a privilege .
Voters will be looking for answers , so we must correctly place blame .
Under no circumstances can we let people know that the aforementioned policies artificially limited the supply of labor and goods , which precipitated the astronomical rise in prices .
We can easily place blame on the toilet manufactures , the toilet installers , or the training institutes even though their every move has been dictated by a complex code of laws that was supposed to keep everything under control in the first place .
Government can easily convince the public that it has the ability to bring prices down , even if it means nationalizing parts of the toilet and bathroom industry .
The government can even justify oversight on diapers since babies who do n’t use the toilet are indirectly affecting the industry .
Toilet paper too can be managed , perhaps rationed , with exceptions given to those with irritable bowel syndrome , who would be allowed to get a permit by visiting the Department of Toilets and standing in a very long line .
After blame has been sufficiently passed , then it is up to Congress to hammer out a 2,000 - page piece of legislation that further controls the toilet industry and ultimately makes it more expensive and inconvenient .
It will be penned in English , but the bill will not make sense .
Congress will raise taxes , borrow money , and pass strict laws , but amazingly prices will go up and availability will go down .
By then , people will all have forgotten about healthcare and will demand even more government involvement to control the spiraling costs of toilets .
Problem solved .

What is “ art ” ?
Over the years there have been many record albums or CDs released with what was deemed to be controversial or offensive cover artwork .
Censorship and attempts to define the limits of free speech is a subject worthy of debating , and of course “ offensive ” imagery is in the eye of the beholder .
As such , some of these might seem rather tame by today ’s standards , but nonetheless they originally elicited enough controversy , public outcry , or heavy - handed pressure from major retailers , to cause censoring actions .
It should be noted that none of these were banned by legal order ; these decisions were made purely for commercial reasons .
Criteria for this list is that the cover in question must have been actually printed up and released , and due to an outcry , was either altered or outright banned for later releases .
I ’m omitting sleeves that were simply covered up with opaque wrapping so as to hide the “ offending ” artwork , but otherwise are unchanged .
John & Yoko ’s Two Virgins is an example of this approach , and so does not make my list .
Some banned artwork has been resurrected for later re-issues , but as a record collector , it is the scarcity and hence collectable aspect of the original releases that intrigues me .
Here are ten of some of the most infamous examples of banned album covers ( some of which are highly prized today by collectors ) .
There are however many , many others , so please mention your favorites in the comments .
10 The Origin of the Feces Type O Negative ( 1992 )
What better way to kick off this list than with goth - metal band Type O Negative ’s album , the title of which plays on Darwin ’s “ On the Origin of Species ” .
Upon first release , the album featured quite a cheeky cover photo .
The derriere portrayed in this image is alleged to belong to the band ’s lead vocalist Peter Steele .
Apparently their label Roadrunner Records had second thoughts soon after release ( what a surprise ) , and later issues of the album were given the more tame “ green skeleton ” cover , rendering the original an immediate collectable .
9 Far Beyond Driven Pantera ( 1994 )
As long as we ’re delving into the anal theme here ( no pun intended ) , take a look at the cover of Pantera ’s “ Far Beyond Driven ” .
This album ’s original cover artistically depicts a large drill - bit , um … far beyond driven into a place where the sun do n’t shine .
I can hear the record company execs now : “ Well gee , apparently that crossed some sort of line , so let ’s just replace that picture with an image of the drill - bit impaling a skull instead , shall we ?
Problem solved . ”
8 Amorica The Black Crowes ( 1994 )
I guess the horror of exposing a few strands of pubic hair was enough to cause an uproar about The Black Crowes ’ original cover photo that was used on their album “ Amorica ” .
Urban legend at the time had it that this was actually a photo of a male model with some strategic “ tucking ” involved , but in reality the image was first used on the cover of a 1976 issue of Hustler magazine , which makes that seem unlikely to be true .
Right ?
Please say it aint so .
The cover photo was later replaced in some markets ( namely , the U.S. ; ironic given the album title and Stars - n - Stripes theme ) by a blacked - out version that just showed the flag triangle ( sans hair ) against a black background , as if to say : “ move along people , nothing to see here ” .
7 Appetite for Destruction Guns n Roses ( 1987 )
“ Appetite for Destruction ” is the title of a painting by popular “ lowbrow ” artist Robert Williams , and was the basis for the cover of G&R ’s debut album of the same name .
Unfortunately the geniuses in Geffen Records marketing department did n’t consider that a graphic depiction of rape might cause some problems with conservative retailers in the U.S. , who refused to stock the album until a change was made to the more widely recognized “ cross & skulls ” cover .
The Williams artwork was retained , though relegated to an inner sleeve insert .
Prices for sealed first pressings of this record with the original artwork on the cover can run you upwards of $ 100 or more .
6 Holy Wood In the Shadow … Marilyn Manson ( 2000 )
Full album title : Holy Wood
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
This album was Manson ’s first release following the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre , for which he had been unfairly crucified in the press as being an inspiration to the killers ( this was later determined to be totally unsubstantiated ) .
Consequently , this album explores such themes as parental roles and America ’s hypocrisy of conservative values and culture juxtaposed with its mainstream acceptance of violence and the fame attained by people whose publicly displayed deaths have been romanticized and martyred .
Various major retail chains in the U.S. refused to stock the record at all , and some only would with an alternative cover .
Manson ’s response : “ The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is , indeed , a violent image .
In fact , the picture itself is composed of a statue of Jesus taken from a place of worship .
My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship .
This does n’t piss me off as much as it pleases me , because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point . ”
5 Love it to Death Alice Cooper ( 1971 )
You gotta love Alice .
Original versions of this album cover are affectionately known as the “ thumb cover ” among fans and collectors , because that wacky Vincent Fernier ( aka Alice Cooper ) surreptitiously poked his thumb through an opening in the front of his cape during the photo shoot in such a way that it appears to be his penis on display .
Released under the Straight label ( owned by Frank Zappa ) , this clever sight gag was allowed to slide .
But when Warner Brothers acquired the label , the cover on later re-issues of the album had a version of the photo that was altered so that the offending digit was airbrushed out .
And so , the further moral corruption of humanity was thusly prevented .
4 Blind Faith Blind Faith ( 1969 )
Controversial Cover : Click here to view the controversial cover [ NSFW ]
This legendary supergroup ’s only album , the self - titled “ Blind Faith ” , featured a topless 11 year - old girl provocatively holding an aircraft type of object that some interpreted as a phallic symbol .
Nice , eh? Apparently not .
Well - known San Francisco rock and roll photographer Bob Seidemann , who was a personal friend of band member Eric Clapton , produced this artwork , which according to him was supposed to depict human creative achievement in technology ( represented by the aircraft ) , borne though innocence ( represented by the young child ) .
Whatever .
In the U.S. the record was issued with an alternate cover .
But I ’m telling you – if this blatant use of what pretty much amounts to child pornography to sell records was n’t appalling enough , you aint seen nuthin yet :
3 Virgin Killer The Scorpions ( 1976 )
Controversial Cover : Click here to view the controversial cover [ NSFW ]
How anyone in their right mind thought this cover photo was a good idea is beyond me .
The Scorps have several controversial covers in their discography , but this one of an erotically posed 10 - year - old girl takes the cake ( the shattered glass pattern obscuring her genitals is part of the image ) .
The inspiration came solely from label RCA Records ’ marketing personnel ; the band members had nothing to do with it , but early on they did stand behind it and tried to defend its use as being an artistically symbolic representation of the title track ’s lyrical theme : that time is the killer of virgin innocence .
Not surprisingly , it was soon replaced by a more acceptable alternative cover depicting the band ( in a rather ridiculous pose ) .
More recently , some band members , in particular former lead guitarist Uli Roth , have expressed regret over the cover and their original support of it .
In May 2008 , U.S. conservative media group WorldNetDaily reported Wikipedia ’s hosting of this image to the FBI , which led to an investigation but no resultant actions .
However on Dec 5 , 2008 the URL for Wiki ’s image page of this photo was added to the UK - based Internet Watch Foundation ’s blacklist , which resulted in the content being blocked by most of the UK ’s major internet service providers .
This unfortunately caused some undesirable problems , as subscribers temporarily could not edit or contribute to any Wiki pages .
The blacklisting was rescinded four days later by reasoning , in part , that the photo was already widely available in the public domain .
Wiki has a detailed article on this topic here .
2 Diamond Dogs David Bowie ( 1974 )
The sleeve of this album features a stylish painting by Belgian artist Guy Peelleart .
This striking piece is a somewhat freakish representation of Bowie as a half - man half - dog creature .
An anatomically correct creature by the way , to which RCA Records immediately took exception by withdrawing the records and ordering the artwork to be reproduced with the canine genitalia airbrushed out ( amusing in comparison to the previous entry , which would be deemed acceptable by RCA just two years later ) .
Inexplicably , a few unaltered versions survived and are quite valuable today , reportedly approaching close to $ 10,000 .
in value .
But buyer beware : 1990 Rykodisc re-issues with the restored original image are somewhat easy to come by and though they can be worth a couple hundred dollars in their own right , they are n’t the real deal .
1 Yesterday and Today The Beatles ( 1966 )
The Beatles ’ infamous “ Butcher Baby ” cover is perhaps the most well known banned cover of all time , and is likely the most valuable as well .
It has been featured on Listverse once before , on this list .
The original version of this album was n’t actually released for sale to the general public , but advance copies and promo material were sent to radio stations and a few retailers however , and the immediately ensuing outcry caused Capitol Record to quickly withdraw all inventory that was ready for distribution ( about 750,000 copies ) .
Rather than destroy all the sleeves , Capitol instead chose to slap a much more conservative photo of the lads posed around a steamer trunk over the original art and then re-issue the records to retailers .
It did n’t take long for fans to figure out how to peel the trunk photo off to reveal the Butcher photo underneath , which eventually lead to a cottage industry of professional peelers .
A collectors ’ jargon evolved to distinguish “ First State ” ( original uncovered version ) , “ Second State ” ( paste - over version ) and “ Third State ” ( peeled ) copies .
Over the years , so many paste - overs have been peeled ( or damaged / lost ) that these days Second State Butchers are becoming scarcer and are increasing in value .
If in good condition , they can easily fetch a couple thousand dollars , and thus are more desirable than even professionally peeled Third State copies .
Not surprisingly , First State originals are the most valuable ; factory sealed copies in particular are extremely rare and worth in the tens of thousands of dollars or more depending on condition .
By the mid 80 ’s , there were only two stereo and less than ten mono sealed First State Butcher copies known to exist .
In 1987 , a case of 24 sealed original Butchers ( 5 stereo and 19 mono ) turned up at a Beatles convention in the hands of Peter Livingston , who ’s father Alan was president of Capitol Records at the time of the recall .
These are known as the “ Livingston copies ” , and are the most valuable of all , given their pedigree .
To determine if your record is a paste - over , look for a faint v-shaped bleed - through of Ringo ’s black shirt in the white background area of the trunk photo midway down the right edge .
If you are lucky enough to discover a previously unbeknownst one in your collection , my advice to you is : do n’t even think about trying to peel it !
In all my years of record collecting , my Second State Butcher in VG + condition is the most prized item .
+ Country Life Roxy Music ( 1974 )
This is listed as a bonus entry because , quite frankly , I wanted it on the list but did n‘t want to take any of the others off .
This album cover is the sole reason I became a Roxy Music fan .
Story has it that Bryan Ferry met these two models , Constanze Karoli and Eveline Grunwald , in Portugal , and asked them to pose for the cover shoot .
Naturally , the photo was a bit much for some markets ( good ol ’ conservative USA , among them ) , and was re-issued in those areas with a plain foliage photo .
But as I said , this album cover made quite an impression on me when it was released and I was able to snag an import copy .
All right , before any of you LV ladies castigate me for shamelessly objectifying women , I ask that you cut me some slack because after all , I was only 14 at the time .
Today of course , I am older and wiser , and so I can offer a much more mature commentary on the artistry of this photo :
Did you see the racks on those babes ?!
[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : GPipe - 1.0.0 : A functional graphics API for programmable GPUs
I 'm proud to announce the first release of GPipe - 1.0.0 : A functional graphics API for programmable GPUs .
GPipe models the entire graphics pipeline in a purely functional , immutable and typesafe way .
It is built on top of the programmable pipeline ( i.e. non-fixed function ) of OpenGL 2.1 and uses features such as vertex buffer objects ( VBO's ) , texture objects and GLSL shader code synthetisation to create fast graphics programs .
Buffers , textures and shaders are cached internally to ensure fast framerate , and GPipe is also capable of managing multiple windows and contexts .
By creating your own instances of GPipes classes , it 's possible to use additional datatypes on the GPU .
You 'll need full OpenGL 2.1 support , including GLSL 1.20 to use GPipe .
Thanks to OpenGLRaw , you may still build GPipe programs on machines lacking this support .
The package , including full documentation , can be found at : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GPipe-1.0.0
Of course , you may also install it with : cabal install gpipe Cheers !

Burning trees for energy produces 1.5 times as much carbon as coal – study shows
By Stephen Leahy *
UXBRIDGE , Canada , Sep 24 ’09 ( Tierramérica )
Millions of trees , especially from the developing countries of the South , are being shipped to Europe and burned in giant furnaces to meet “ green energy ” requirements that are supposed to combat climate change .
In the last two months alone , energy companies in Britain have announced the construction of at least six new biomass power generation plants to produce 1,200 megawatts of energy , primarily from burning woodchips .
At least another 1,200 megawatts of wood - fired energy plants , including the world ’s largest , in Port Talbot , Wales , are already under construction .
Those energy plants will burn 20 to 30 million tonnes of wood annually , nearly all imported from other regions and equivalent to at least one million hectares of forest .
“ Europe is going to cook the world ’s tropical forests to fight climate change ; it ’s crazy , ” Simone Lovera , of the non-governmental Global Forest Coalition , which has a southern office in Asunción , Paraguay , told Tierramérica .
This independent environmental journalism depends on public support .
Click here learn more .
Europe has committed to reducing its carbon emissions 20 percent by 2020 in an effort to fight climate change .
Biofuels and biomass energy will have key roles in achieving those goals , experts say .
“ Biomass is a very promising sector for energy companies , ” says Jarret Adams , a spokesperson for Adage , a joint venture between French nuclear power giant Areva and the U.S. - based Duke Energy .
Adage is building a 50 - megawatt , wood - burning power plant in the southeastern U.S. state of Florida , the first of 12 such “ green energy ” plants to be built over the next six years , Adams told Tierramérica .
“ Burning wood for energy is considered carbon neutral by U.S. federal and state authorities , ” he said .
In other words , the process of generating electricity by burning wood emits an equal or lesser amount of carbon dioxide than the quantity absorbed by the trees through photosynthesis .
When Tierramérica questioned the assumption of carbon neutrality , Adams replied : “ It is , but who knows for certain ? ”
Brazil is gearing up to meet the European woodchip demand , not by cutting down forests , but rather by expanding tree plantations by 27 million hectares , mostly of exotic species like eucalyptus , Lovera says , based on a report the Coalition has obtained .
“ The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) is also pushing countries to expand tree plantations , ” she said .
A quick examination of international trading companies reveals a new and growing global industry in wood for energy .
MagForest , a Canadian company operating in the Republic of Congo , will soon ship 500,000 tonnes of wood chips annually to Europe .
IBIC Ghana Limited claims it can ship 100,000 tonnes of tropical hardwood and softwood a month from Ghana .
Sky Trading , a U.S. company , is offering to supply up to 600,000 tonnes of woodchips for biomass from the United States or Brazil .
Brazil ’s International CMO
Business Biomass says it is dedicated to reducing coal use and can obtain woodchips from Brazil , Chile , Uruguay and Argentina to supply the European energy market .
Tree plantations have had devastating effects on people and the environment all over South America , Lovera says .
No one seriously argues that these plantations have anything like the biodiversity or ecological function of natural forests , be they first or even second growth .
These plantations are “ green deserts ” because of the amount of water they consume , and because of the lack of native wildlife , according to the environmentalist .
And there are many instances of local people , often poor or indigenous , who are kicked off the land to make way for these huge monocultures , she says .
Because of the mounting evidence about the negative social and environmental impacts , an international coalition of non-governmental organisations has set Sept. 21 as International Day Against Tree Monocultures .
“ Burning wood is called carbon - neutral , but it ’s not , ” said Rachel Smolker , a research scientist who works with the Global Justice Ecology Project in the United States , told Tierramérica .
According to Smolker , research by the Massachusetts Environmental Energy Alliance , a U.S. environmental group , indicates that burning trees for energy produces 1.5 times as much carbon as coal and three to four times more than natural gas .
Chopping up a tree , shipping it hundreds or thousands of kilometres to burn it and then planting a tiny sapling to replace it is not carbon neutral , said Scott Quaranda in an interview .
He is part of the Dogwood Alliance , a coalition of citizen groups in the southern United States trying to prevent their remaining forests from being turned into tree plantations .
U.S. government policy has sparked proposals for some 102 biomass or biofuel energy facilities in the region , he said .
A single power plant could require millions of tonnes of biomass , mostly woodchips produced on fast - growing loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) plantations , which already blanket the southeastern states from the Carolinas to Arkansas .
Those trees were planted over the last two decades to feed the pulp and paper industry .
Nearly all plantations have been developed at the expense of natural forest , which has numerous consequences : herbicide and fertiliser runoff pollutes water sources , sediment and plant waste for logging operations clog streams , soils are degraded , and habitat for other species is lost .
One in five hectares in this huge region is now a green desert , and it will only expand , Quaranda fears .
“ We ’re on track to destroy all of the remaining forest and grassland ecosystems by converting them into bioenergy , ” said Smolker , citing the study “ Implications of Limiting CO2 Concentrations on Land Use and Energy ” , published in the May 29 issue of the journal Science .
The study maintains that with carbon taxes on fossil fuels making them more expensive , treating biomass energy as carbon neutral would drive the conversion of all of the planet ’s remaining grasslands and forests into bioenergy by 2065 , she said .

Biologists for the first time have documented a second breeding season during the annual cycle of five songbird species that spend summers in temperate North America and winters in tropical Central and South America .
It was known that these species , which migrate at night when there are fewer predators and the stars can guide their journey , breed during their stay in temperate regions of the United States and Canada .
But it turns out that they squeeze in a second breeding season during a stopover in western Mexico on their southward migration , said Sievert Rohwer a University of Washington professor emeritus of biology and curator emeritus of birds at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the UW .
" It 's pretty much unheard of to have a nocturnal migrant with a second breeding season .
It 's a pretty special observation , " Rohwer said .
" We saw these birds breeding and we were completely surprised . "
Migratory double - breeding has been observed in two Old World bird species on their northward migration , but this is the first documented observation of " migratory double breeders " in the New World , and the first anywhere for the southward migration , Rohwer said .
The scientists traveled to the lowland thorn forests of coastal western Mexico to survey and collect songbirds that had raised their young in the United States and Canada and then immediately migrated to Mexico to molt , or shed and replace their feathers .
But during July and August in three consecutive summers , 2005 - 2007 , the researchers found individuals from five species - yellow - billed cuckoos , orchard orioles , hooded orioles , yellow - breasted chats and Cassin 's vireos - that were breeding rather than molting .
They found evidence that the birds had , in fact , bred earlier that year .
Females of all five species examined in July had dry and featherless brood patches , indicating they had bred earlier that summer .
( To more efficiently transfer heat to eggs , the abdominal brood patch becomes featherless and thickened with fluid when females are incubating , but as the young mature it dries out and remains featherless . ) .
In the Mexican breeding ground , there was a complete absence of young birds , indicating the females had not bred in the area of the thorn forests .
Active nests were found for two species and males of all five species were singing and defending territories or guarding females , behaviors associated with breeding .
In addition , isotopic analysis of the birds ' tissues showed that many had recently arrived in west Mexico from temperate areas farther north .
Rohwer is lead author of a paper describing the findings , published the week of Oct. 26 in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Coauthors are Keith Hobson of Environment Canada , a national agency charged with preserving environmental quality , and Vanya Rohwer , a graduate student at Queen 's University in Kingston , Ontario .
He is Sievert Rohwer 's son and took part in the work while a UW undergraduate .
The research was funded by the Burke Museum Endowment for Ornithology , the Hugh and Jane Ferguson Foundation , the Nuttall Ornithological Club and Environment Canada .
The observation is much more than an oddity in bird behavior , Sievert Rohwer said .
He noted that orchard orioles might raise a first brood in the Midwestern and south - central U.S. and a second on Mexico 's western coast , yet both sets of offspring find the same wintering area in Central America .
The question is how both groups find the right place , since they must travel in different directions .
Then there is the yellow - billed cuckoo , once commonly seen throughout the western United States and as far north as the Seattle area but now seldom seen along the West Coast .
Disappearing habitat in the U.S. is usually cited as the reason .
But Rohwer believes the real problem could be the transformation of thorn forests of southern Sonora and Sinaloa , states in northwestern Mexico , into irrigated industrial farms .
That loss of habitat , he said , could mean not enough young are produced in the second breeding season to sustain the populations previously seen on the U.S. West Coast .
" It turns out that many of those migrants , both molt migrants and the newly discovered migratory double breeders , are dependent on the low - altitude thorn forests that become very productive during the monsoon , " Rohwer said .
The thorn forests lie in an arid and forbidding scrubland that springs to life with the monsoon lasting from June through August .
The monsoon brings virtually all of the area 's annual rainfall .
The small trees leaf out and insects become abundant , making an ideal stopover for migrating songbirds .
However , with plenty of biting insects , temperatures often at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity hovering near 100 percent , it is a difficult place for researchers to work , so there has been little previous documentation of life in the thorn forest .
The new findings could spur more work there .
" For western North America , the conservation implications are pretty serious , " Rohwer said .
" Biologists know theoretically that they should pay attention to these migration stopover sites , but they 've been largely ignored for their conservation implications . "

The emotional debate surrounding the use of torture has been reignited by last week ’s disclosure of Bush - era memos outlining the harsh interrogation practices utilized against high - profile terror detainees , and the legal opinions used to justify them .
Such approved techniques involved slapping , waterboarding , sleep deprivation , stress positions , cramped confinement , “ walling ” ( in which detainees were slammed into a flexible wall ) , forced nudity , and placing a suspect in a small box with insects .
President Obama believes that the tactics reflect America ’s loss of its “ moral bearings , ” which is why he discontinued their use and released the memos .
But a cadre of political commentators and former Bush administration officials refute that claim , insisting that the techniques should be permissible either because they do n’t actually constitute torture , or because they elicit valuable information  or both .
We went through the commentary of the past few days to see who falls into this camp .
“ One of the things that I find a little bit disturbing about this recent disclosure is they put out the legal memos , the memos that the CIA got from the Office of Legal Counsel , but they did n’t put out the memos that showed the success of the effort ….
I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country . ”
— Dick Cheney , speaking with Fox News ’ Sean Hannity
“ The techniques themselves were used selectively against only a small number of hard - core prisoners who successfully resisted other forms of interrogation , and then only with the explicit authorization of the director of the CIA ….
As already disclosed by Director Hayden , as late as 2006 , even with the growing success of other intelligence tools , fully half of the government ’s knowledge about the structure and activities of al Qaeda came from those interrogations . ”
— Former attorney general Michael Mukasey and former CIA director Michael Hayden , in The Wall Street Journal
“ It is , yes , good that the U.S.A. is not doing this anymore , but let ’s not get too sanctimonious about how awful it was that we indulged in these techniques after watching nearly 3,000 innocent Americans endure god-awful deaths at the hands of religious fanatics who would happily have detonated a nuclear bomb if they had gotten their mitts on one .
And let us move on .
There is pressing business .
( Are you listening , ACLU ? Hel - lo ? ) ” — Chris Buckley , on the Daily Beast
“ If somebody can go through water - boarding for 183 times , 6 times a day …. it means you ’re not afraid of it , it means it ’s not torture .
If you ’ve found a way to withstand it , it ca n’t possibly be torture . ” — Rush Limbaugh
“ I do n’t see it as a dark chapter in our history at all .
You look at some of these techniques — holding the head , a face slap , or deprivation of sleep .
If that is torture , the word has no meaning . ” — Charles Krauthammer , on Fox News ’ Special Report with Brit Hume
“ I think it ’s really pathetic for an American president to do that , and to disavow , in effect , the good faith efforts of a previous administration to protect us in ways that I think were entirely appropriate . ”
— Bill Kristol , on Fox News ’ Special Report with Brit Hume
“ I ’ve been in hotels with more bugs than these guys faced , and they ’re tortured ? ” — Mike Huckabee , on Fox & Friends
“ Ultimately though , apparently , according to the evidence , this stuff worked .
And some of these guys spilled some beans that saved some lives .
Next time we ’re in the same predicament , what ’s going to happen ? ” — Steve Doocy , host of Fox & Friends
“ Khalid Sheik Mohammed , I understand , was waterboarded 183 times .
Did anyone care about that ?
Does anyone in America walk around going , ‘ I ’m really upset that the mastermind of 9/11 was waterboarded 183 times . ’
That makes me feel better . ” — Brian Kilmeade , host of Fox & Friends
“ The idea that torture does n’t work — that ’s been put out from John McCain on down —
You know , for the longest time McCain said torture does n’t work then he admitted in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last summer that he was broken by North Vietnamese .
So what are we to think here ? ” — Rush Limbaugh
“ If you go beyond posing questions in an even voice , you ’re torturing , according to the Times ….
Most Americans understand , when life and death is there , you ’ve got to do something more than the Army Field Manual . ” — Bill O’Reilly
“ By reading this people will be reassured and they ’ll see the lunacy of the people on the left who say it ’s torture .
You know , you can only the use the back of your hand you have t splay your fingers when you slap them in the gut .
On the face , you have to sue your fingers splayed , and you have to do it between here and here , and close to here . ” — Karl Rove , on The O’Reilly Factor
“ Far from ‘ green lighting ’ torture — or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees — the memos detail the actual techniques used and the many measures taken to ensure that interrogations did not cause severe pain or degradation . ”
— David B. Rivkin and Lee A. Casey , Justice Department officials under George H.W. Bush , in The Wall Street Journal
“ This is a laughable proposition actually , what is now considered torture .
But if not letting terrorists sleep , and throwing cold water on them , and putting a caterpillar in a room with a terrorist is now considered torture , then I ’m afraid that we as a country do not have what it takes to protect our people . ”
— Joe Scarborough , on Morning Joe
“ Does the sadism of Dick Cheney know no bounds !
I think we know the answer to that .
As these memos are pored over in the hours and days ahead , we must be prepared to hear details about Operation Harmless Squishy
Thing that may rock the very moral foundations of our country . ”
— Abe Greenwald , Commentary
“ I just slapped myself .
I ’m torturing myself right now .
That ’s torture according to these people . ” — Rush Limbaugh
“ In releasing highly classified documents on the CIA interrogation program last week , President Obama declared that the techniques used to question captured terrorists ‘ did not make us safer . ’
This is patently false ….
[ The Obama administration knows ] that if the public could see the details of the techniques side by side with evidence that the program saved American lives , the vast majority would support continuing it . ”
— Marc Thiessen , former Bush speechwriter , in the Washington Post
“ Al Qaeda kidnaps Americans , tortures them , then decapitates them on TV .
We deprive captives of sleep , push them into walls and put harmless caterpillars that we say are poisonous in their cells .
Then we ’re the ones who are condemned as the worst human - rights violators on the planet . ”
— New York Post editorial
Some have suggested that I add more information on the story of Vivian 's work and such .
Here is what I know .
I acquired Vivian 's negatives while at a furniture and antique auction while researching a history book I was co-authoring on Chicago 's NW Side .
From what I know , the auction house acquired her belongings from her storage locker that was sold off due to delinquent payments .
I did n't know what ' street photography ' was when I purchased them .
It took me days to look through all of her work .
It inspired me to pick up photography myself .
Little by little , as I progressed as a photographer , I would revisit Vivian 's negatives and I would " see " more in her work .
I bought her same camera and took to the same streets soon to realize how difficult it was to make images of her caliber .
I discovered the eye she had for photography through my own practice .
Needless to say , I am attached to her work .
After some researching , I have only little information about Vivian .
Central Camera ( 110 yr old camera shop in Chicago ) has encountered Vivian from time to time when she would purchase film while out on the Chicago streets .
From what they knew of her , they say she was a very " keep your distance from me " type of person but was also outspoken .
She loved foreign films and did n't care much for American films .
Some of her photos have pictures of children and often times it was near a beach .
I later found out she was a nanny for a family on the North Side whose children these most likely were .
One of her obituaries states that she lived in Oak Park , a close Chicago suburb , but I later found that she lived in the Rogers Park neighborhood .
Out of the more than 100,000 negatives I have in the collection , about 20 - 30,000 negatives were still in rolls , undeveloped from the 1960 's - 1970's .
I have been successfully developing these rolls .
I must say , it 's very exciting for me .
Most of her negatives that were developed in sleeves have the date and location penciled in French ( she had poor penmanship ) .
I found her name written with pencil on a photo - lab envelope .
I decided to ' Google ' her about a year after I purchased these only to find her obituary placed the day before my search .
She passed only a couple of days before that inquiry on her .
I wanted to meet her in person well before I found her obituary but , the auction house had stated she was ill , so I did n't want to bother her .
So many questions would have been answered if I had .

主人公の健二が数学オリンピック代表候補であるという設定、最初に健二がShorのアルゴリズムに関する教科書を読んでいるのを見て、サイモン・シンが描き出した迫真のドキュメンタリー『フェルマーの最終定理
』*1ばりの展開が待っているのかと思いきや、まともな数学的要素は皆無で肩すかしを食らってしまった。
気を取り直して、本エントリでは『サマーウォーズ』における数少ない数学的要素を取り上げたい。なお、無粋なツッコミは無用だという人は読まない方が良いだろう。
誕生日の曜日の求め 方
さて、夏希先輩の誕生日、1992年7月19日は何曜日か。劇中で健二はモジュロ演算(mod)を用いて一瞬で日曜日だと回答していたが、その間にどのような演算がなされていたのか見てみよう。
曜日換算を実現するために、ツェラーの公式が知られている。求めたい日の年の千位と百位の連続の数字(例えば2310年ならば23 )
をJ、年の下2桁(年 mod 100 ) をK、月をm、日をq、曜日をhとする（ただし求めたい日の月が1月、2月の場合はそれぞれ前年の13月、14月とする）と、曜日は次で与えられる（x以下で最大の整数を で表す）。
modはモジュロ演算（剰余演算）であり、余りを求める演算子である。ここでは7で割った余りを求める事となるが、余りhが0なら土曜日、1なら日曜日、2なら月曜日、……、6なら金曜日となる。
夏希先輩の誕生日1992年7月19日を考える。J=19 , K=92 , m=7 , q=19を代入すると、
つまり夏希先輩の誕生日は日曜日だと言うことがわかる。演算量としては（筆者には当然できないが）暗算が可能な範囲だ。また、ツェラーの公式を知らなくても、特定の日の曜日を予め暗記しておけば、その日との差の日数を計算しmod 7を求めることで曜日を知ることもできる*2。実際、サヴァン症候群の患者であるキム・ピークは、生年月日を言えばそれが何曜日であるか即座に答えることができるという。そのため健二がこの程度の暗算能力を持っていてもおかしくはない。

If you encounter any discussion among the punderati regarding the political dynamics of healthcare reform in Washington these days , it would be difficult not to acknowledge an important fact .
The word " bipartisanship " may be tossed around , but in reality , when trying to get anything done , it is the dysfunction of our tri-party system that will be staring you right in the face – when not kicking you right in the gut .
There are actually three distinct entities in the US legislature .
There are Republicans , who believe less is more – and that doing nothing is the highest form of patriotism .
There are Democrats , who are still fighting to ensure that a robust public option is contained in the eventual healthcare legislation and have fought for everything from equal pay for women to legislation to combat global climate change .
And then there are Blue Dogs , a largely rural band of theoretical Democrats who only represent 3 % of the US population at best and can be counted on to consistently attack , apologise and otherwise run away from their purported party label while seeking the best deal possible for their corporate benefactors .
In a way , this behavior is almost understandable , as in no real sense are Blue Dogs Democrats .
They are largely southern , where the Republican party still has a 50 % approval rating ( contrast that with the northeast and midwest , where they sport 7 % and 13 % approval ratings , respectively , rendering them slightly less popular than scurvy ) .
And they are personal vacuums for contributions from the most noxious , consumer - screwing industries that exist .
They are not " moderates " , as they are often called by the clueless commentators on cable television , but ultra-conservatives on social , foreign and economic policy .
Now , let me walk back a step from indicting the entire group .
There are a few genuinely moderate and productive Blue Dog caucus members among their lot , such as Mike Arcuri of New York , Loretta Sanchez and Mike Thompson of California and Mike Michaud of Maine .
On key votes , such as Barack Obama 's economic stimulus plan , you can usually count on them to support progressive , good - government legislation .
There are also a half - dozen ( perhaps even a few more ) additional adherents of the 52 - member group , who are still relatively moderate and more often than not vote for the good for their constituents , party and country .
But most of the rest of these never - bite - the - hand - that - feeds - your - campaign - cash - stash Blue Dogs do nothing but embarrass progressives and moderates , kill the Democratic party 's brand and continually wreck any chance for it to become a lasting majority party .
For these reasons , good Democrats and all progressives should actively root – with their time and wallets – for the worst of them to lose in the 2010 midterm elections .
Even if it's to rightwing Republicans .
Now , thankfully , that is not always the only option .
First , there are some districts , such as those of sell - out John Barrow in Georgia and healthcare - reform - terminator Jim Cooper in Tennessee , where the aforementioned economic royalists / social - issue Attila the Huns are way to the right of their districts , and installing a progressive via a primary challenge is a promising possibility .
In addition , there are newly open districts , such as that of Republican Adam Putnam in Florida , where a rightwing Blue Dog , Lori Edwards , is taking on progressive , Doug Tudor .
Real Democrats should get in early behind Tudor , to replace a terrible Republican with a progressive , as opposed to an equally dreadful " Democrat " .
Yet , there just are certain locales where , quite frankly , the Democratic party and progressives would be better served without faux - Democratic representation , whatever the alternative .
Uber- reactionary Blue Dog Parker Griffith of Alabama not only has the worst voting record of any House Democrat , but has stated publicly , that if re-elected , he will vote against his own party 's leader , House speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Meanwhile , in the case of Mike Ross of Arkansas , we have a " Democrat " leading the fight against the public option , after magically having his Tennessee property bought for substantially more than its apparent value by a drug store chain .
Are the gods generous , or what ?
It is reactionary and corrupt Democrats such as these that make insane Republican legislation appear reasonable and " bipartisan " with their support , good Democratic legislation that is hugely popular seem " leftwing " with their gratuitous insults and opposition and the will and organisation of the Democratic party seem weak .
Their very existence hurts our party and the country .
If you think that a loss of 20 seats would be too severe , even though we 'd still hold a strong majority in the House , I have an answer for you .
Put progressives in Putnam 's seat , Barrow 's seat and Cooper 's seat , and lose the 22 next - most extreme Blue Dogs to Republicans , and you 'll have a more reliably progressive House than we do now .
In fact , a progressive PAC , Blue America , realises this and has already started an effort to accomplish this very goal .
In the end , I would hope we replace as many Blue Dogs as possible with real Democrats .
Yet , when it comes to the reactionary and venal in our midst , I know how I 'll handle their losses on election night , even to Republicans .
I 'll start a fire , roast some marshmallows and take a swig of champagne to toast their every defeat – by any electoral means necessary .
What kind of a public debate can we have on the most vital issues of the day in the United States ?
A lot depends on the media , which determines how these issues are framed for most people .
Take the war in Afghanistan , which has been subject to major debate here lately , as Barack Obama has to decide whether to take the advice of his commanding officer in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , and send tens of thousands more troops there , or heed public opinion , which actually favours an end to the war .
This month , one of America 's most important and most - watched TV news programmes , NBC's Meet the Press , took up the issue .
The lineup :
Retired General Barry McCaffrey , former army general and drug tsar ( under Bill Clinton ) turned defence industry lobbyist .
In a news article on McCaffrey titled " One man 's military - industrial - media complex " , the New York Times reported that McCaffrey had " earned at least $ 500,000 from his work for Veritas Capital , a private equity firm in New York that has grown into a defence industry powerhouse by buying contractors whose profits soared from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
McCaffrey has appeared on NBC more than 1000 times since 11 September 2001 .
Retired General Richard Myers , former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under George Bush ( 2002 -2005 ) .
He is currently on the board of directors of Northrop Grumman Corporation , one of the largest military contractors in the world , and also of United Technologies Corporation , another large military contractor .
Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican from South Carolina , a pro-war spokesperson that is one of the most regular guests on the Sunday talkshows .
Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , a Democrat , was apparently intended to represent the " other side " of the debate .
Here is what he said : " Clearly we should keep the number of forces that we have .
No one 's talking about removing forces . "
" No one " in the above sentence refers to the American people , whom Levin understandably sees as nobody in the eyes of the US media and political leaders .
According to the latest New York Times / CBS
News poll , 32 % of those polled wanted US troops out of Afghanistan within one year or right now .
That was the largest group .
Another 24 % wants the troops " removed within one to two years " .
For comparison , the leadership of the Taliban is willing to grant foreign troops 18 months to get out of their country .
In other words , a majority of 56 % of Americans wants US troops out of Afghanistan about as soon as is practically feasible or even sooner .
Yet Meet the Press – a mainstream network news talkshow since 1947 – does not see fit to find one person to represent that point of view .
The other major TV and radio talkshows that the right also labels " liberal " in the US make similar choices almost every day .
When asked whether the US should set a timeline for withdrawal , Levin answered " no " .
I know , if you have enough time you can still find an anti-war , public - interest viewpoint and the facts to support it – on the internet and even among some of the news stories in major media publications .
But most Americans have other full - time jobs .
If the media 's influence stopped there , the damage would be limited .
After all , Americans can often still overcome the tutelage of the media 's opinion leaders , as the above poll demonstrates .
But the media also defines the debate for politicians .
And that is where the life - and - death consequences really kick in .
If you want to know why Obama has not fought for a public option for healthcare reform , why he has caved to Wall Street on financial reform , why he has been Awol on the most important labour law reform legislation in 75 years ( despite his campaign promises ) , just look at the major media .
Think for a moment of how they would treat him if he did what his voters wanted him to do .
You can be sure that Obama has thought it through very carefully .
Obama 's whole political persona is based on media strategy , and on not taking any risk that the major media would turn against him .
That is how he got where he is today and how he hopes to be re-elected .
Many analysts confuse this with a strategy based on public opinion polling .
But as we can see , these are often two different things .
Seventy - five percent of Americans support a public option for healthcare reform .
( A majority would support expanding Medicare to cover everyone , but over the years the media , insurance and pharmaceutical companies made sure that this option did n't make it to the current debate . )
Obama has the bully pulpit .
He could say to the rightwing Democrats in the Senate : " Look , you can vote against my proposals , but if you do not allow your president to even have a vote on this reform , you are not a Democrat . "
In other words , you can't join the Republicans in blocking the vote procedurally .
He could probably force Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , to join him in enforcing this minimal party discipline that would come naturally to Republicans , which would allow the healthcare bill to pass the Senate even if conservative Democrats voted against it .
But to do that would risk losing some of Obama 's post - partisan , non-ideological aura that guarantees his media support .
Of course , the media is not the only influence that hobbles healthcare reform .
The insurance , pharmaceutical and other business lobbies obviously have more representation in Congress than does the majority of the electorate .
But Obama does not feel this direct corporate pressure nearly as much .
After all , he was the first president in recent decades to get 48 % of his campaign contributions from donations of less than $ 200 – a very significant change in American politics , made possible though internet organising .
There are other powerful elite groupings , such as the foreign policy establishment – which is more ideologically driven , like the medieval church , than a collection of lobbying interests – that thwart reform on issues of war and peace .
But the major media remain one of the biggest challenges to progressive reform in the 21st century .
A former police officer who killed a woman during a 100 mph " joyride " has been jailed for six and a half years .
Malcolm Searles , 24 , had left his police station to deliver an 18th birthday card to his sister when his car hit Sandra Simpson , 61 , on 23 August last year .
Southwark crown court , in London , heard that Searles was in a marked patrol car with blue lights flashing and sirens sounding as he repeatedly broke the speed limit .
An on - board computer recorded the vehicle travelling at 104mph in a 40 mph zone during a " prolonged course of dangerous driving lasting over an hour " .
Searles sped through " densely populated " housing estates where children were playing football on the pavements and double - sided parking limited the streets to single - file traffic , the court was told .
Sandra Simpson .

He was travelling at 56 mph in a 30 mph zone in Bromley , Kent , when he hit Simpson , who died of head and chest injuries .
Michael Mulkerris , prosecuting , told the court that had Searles been driving at the legal limit he " would have been able to stop " in time to avoid his victim .
The judge , Geoffrey Rivlin QC , said his driving had been " described as no more than a dangerous and indeed , if I may say so , a hair - raising joyride " .
" You used , or rather abused your privileged position of driving a police car with its emergency signals operating for no other reason other than to provide a cover for racing along the streets , " Rivlin said .
" Mrs Simpson 's daughter in her impact statement said she finds it unbearably difficult to live with the fact you were not answering an emergency .
She said , and I quote : ' It was like he was driving dangerously deliberately because he knew he could get away with it . '
I believe she has articulated what you were doing perfectly . "
The judge said Searles had indulged in a " prolonged , persistent and deliberate course of very bad driving .
You must have known for considerable stretches that at times you were placing members of the public , including the occupants of your own car , at serious risk of either being killed or injured . "
Rivlin said another aggravating feature of the case had been Searles ' attempts to justify his driving by claiming he had been following a speeding car he believed had been stolen .
Searles , from Swanley , Kent , pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to one count of causing death by dangerous driving , one count of dangerous driving , and two counts of speeding .
Outside court , Simpson 's son- in - law , Luke Brooks , said the family 's " world fell apart " when they were told details of the accident .
" As a family we are angry that Sandy was robbed of her golden years , " Brooks said .
" She was in the prime of her life , a fit , healthy and young 61 .
Whatever the sentence passed here today , we do not feel it would be adequate in comparison to our loss .
We hope that today 's conviction and sentencing will cause other police officers to question their behaviour while driving and the potential consequence for them and the general public . "
Officials say Jacques Monsieur planned to export parts for F - 5 fighter jets
An alleged Belgian arms dealer has pleaded guilty to conspiring to illegally export jet engines and parts from the US to Iran , officials say .
The suspect , Jacques Monsieur , now faces a maximum prison sentence of six years and a $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) fine .
Mr Monsieur , a resident of France , was arrested in August in New York .
Court documents say he is an experienced arms dealer who was actively seeking weapons for the government of Iran .
After his arrest Mr Monsieur was charged with violating the arms control act , smuggling , money - laundering and conspiracy .
Some of the charges can carry maximum sentences of 20 years in jail .
Officials said a sting operation revealed that he was trying to buy engines and other parts for F - 5 fighter jets .
They alleged the defendant had wired $ 110,000 ( £ 68,000 ) to a bank account in Alabama in July as payment for jet parts and had promised another $ 300,000 as down payment for two engines .
The parts could have been used as replacements in the aging military jets sold to Iran by the US before the 1979 Iranian revolution .
Under a trade embargo , the items cannot be exported to Iran without a license from the US government .
A co-defendant in the case , Iranian Dara Fotouhi , remains on the run .

Well , in LCpl Parker 's case , it was well known what has happening to him and why by every other Marine in the unit .
So we , the leadership , had the same concerns expressed by many who advocate continuing DADT today .
But our higher leadership also warned us that we had better make damn sure we allowed no such thing .
So the commander of the unit got all the Marines together , spoke openly about the whole matter , and told them that we were under orders to receive this Marine back into the unit , and would follow orders .
He also explicitly warned them that any Marine who hazed or assaulted the returning LCpl would be fully prosecuted under the UCMJ .

Science historian reacts to hacked climate e-mails
By Andrew Freedman
* Damp Thanksgiving week : Full Forecast | Cruising the Atlantic *
A scandal erupted in the world of climate science late last week after anonymous hackers posted years worth of selected private email correspondence between a handful of prominent climate scientists .
The emails were stolen from a server at the University of East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit in Britain .
Climate skeptics -- those who either doubt the mainstream consensus that Earth has warmed during the past century or who doubt human influence is the primary cause of any warming -- have seized upon the contents of the emails as evidence that mainstream climate scientists have been involved in a conspiracy to block those with alternative views from publishing papers in academic journals , in addition to other allegations .
Although the personal emails do not provide any scientific evidence that would counter the scientific consensus that human emissions are altering the climate system , they are likely to be politically damaging , because they raise the appearance of impropriety in the scientific process .
In one of the messages , Phil Jones , who heads up Britain 's government - run Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research , alluded to a " trick " that a colleague performed to analyze historical temperature data .
You can read up on the specifics of the scandal , and why that particular email may not be as shady as it sounds , here , here and here .
In order to shed some light on what this scandal may mean for the scientific community and for public perceptions of science , I have contacted several highly respected experts to seek their insight .
Keep reading for my first interview ( ironically , conducted via email ) , with Spencer Weart , a science historian with the American Institute of Physics .
Spencer Weart , science historian .
Photo copyright Christian Bibas .
Originally trained as a physicist , Weart is author of the book , " The Discovery of Global Warming , " among others .
I reached him while he was attending a science history conference , and he shared insights from his conversations with colleagues as well as his own observations .
Spencer Weart :
My most interesting conversations were with historians who have been studying the history of the tobacco companies that did their best , and quite successfully for many years , to cover up the fact that smoking kills people by the million .
Some interesting parallels , but ...
Andrew Freedman :
What effects do you think this will have on public perceptions of climate science and climate scientists ?
SW : I do n't expect this to have much impact on public perceptions of climate and climate scientists .
Opinions have become so fixed that it would take serious evidence to shift a significant number of people .
Since the late 1980s , just about every year and sometimes almost every month , a group of people ( mostly the same ones ) have exclaimed , " Now in these latest ( whatever ) we finally have proof that there is no need to worry about climate change ! "
There is a segment of the public that has believed every new claim .
The rest will continue to doubt such claims in the absence of truly solid proof .
AF : What do you think this story reveals about the conduct of climate science ?
SW : Back around 2000 leading climate scientists talked to each other mostly about their science -- debating one another 's data and analysis and negotiating travel , collaboration and other administration -- and a little bit about policy .
As time passed they have had to spend more and more of their time answering criticism of the scientific results already established , criticism mostly based on ignorance , fallacious reasoning , and even deliberately deceptive claims .
Still more recently they have had to spend far too much of their time defending their personal reputations against ignorant or slanderous attacks .
" ... we 've never before seen a set of people accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and other professional malfeasance .
Even the tobacco companies never tried to slander legitimate cancer researchers . "
The theft and use of the emails does reveal something interesting about the social context .
It 's a symptom of something entirely new in the history of science : Aside from crackpots who complain that a conspiracy is suppressing their personal discoveries , we 've never before seen a set of people accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and other professional malfeasance .
Even the tobacco companies never tried to slander legitimate cancer researchers .
In blogs , talk radio and other new media , we are told that the warnings about future global warming issued by the national science academies , scientific societies , and governments of all the leading nations are not only mistaken , but based on a hoax , indeed a conspiracy that must involve thousands of respected researchers .
Extraordinary and , frankly , weird .
Climate scientists are naturally upset , exasperated , and sometimes goaded into intemperate responses ... but that was already easy to see in their blogs and other writings .
AF : For a science historian such as yourself , how valuable are these emails ?
And what is your impression of them thus far ?
SW : There would be a lot to learn if the owner of these emails ( I suppose the University ) would release them for analysis ; for example , you could run up statistics on the types of interchanges and the structure of networks of discussion among researchers .
Of course no scholar can make use of stolen material , and in particular one cannot legally or ethically quote a private message without the explicit permission of the writer .
Historians do often work with collections of letters that have been donated to archives .
Typically we spend countless hours trying to understand the context ; scholarly reputations have been ruined by interpretations that turned out to be mistaken .
The risk of misinterpretation is far greater with emails , written so much more casually than letters .
Our society is having difficulty dealing with this new form of communication .
Look at last week 's verdict on the Bear Sterns hedge fund managers who were accused of misleading investors .
The prosecutrs based their case on a few seemingly incriminating sentences drawn from a mass of emails .
When the jury saw the whole set of emails , they quickly found that there was no crime , just ordinary business chatter .
From what I 've seen , I expect that will be the verdict on the climate scientists ' emails .
Check back here tomorrow for an interview with Thomas Crowley , a geochemist who has served as a reviewer for the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
For more reaction from climate scientists , check out this post from Judith Curry at Georgia Tech , and this from the folks at the blog RealClimate ( some of whom were the targets of the email hack ) .
The views expressed here are the author 's and interview subject 's alone and do not represent any position of the Washington Post , its news staff or the Capital Weather Gang .
Chief Executive Irene Firmat and her brewmaster husband James Emmerson converted their business , Full Sail Brewing in Hood River , Ore. , to a worker - owned company in 1999 .
Firmat said they wanted to avoid being bought by a larger company and " incentivize the [ 47 ] people already working there . "
Now , 55 of the 90 workers are partial owners , and she said this arrangement has helped the company find ways to save money and increase profits in the face of a recession .
Last year , when the brewery faced soaring commodity costs , she said that owners from different departments agreed to buy efficient new machines that saved on expensive raw materials .
This year , the owners agreed to accept smaller margins and make new hires even as job cutting became rampant nationwide .
" The decision to live out this time with smaller margins was supported by our investors -- our employees who were implementing this strategy and seeing results daily , " she said .
" I think it would have been far different if we had a more traditional ownership with disengaged investors just seeking shorter - term results . "

Like Chekhov 's gun , " net neutrality " gets dragged down from the mantel for every act of the broadband rollout .
It 's getting dragged down now for the rollout of wireless broadband .
Yet everything you need to know was contained in the first act , when AOL began bleating about " open access " when broadband first threatened its dial - up empire .
AOL 's business model depended on free riding on the infrastructure paid for by phone users .
AOL users were dialing up and keeping a line open for days or even weeks ...
' They have elected a ­Labour government , " a Savoy diner famously declared on the night of Britain 's election landslide in 1945 .
" The country will never stand for it . "
From the evidence so far coming out of Iran , something similar seems to be ­happening on the streets of Tehran – and in the western capitals just as desperate to see the back of Iranian president ­Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Of course the movement behind opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi spreads far beyond the capital 's elite , as did the supporters of Winston Churchill against Clement Attlee .
In Iran , it includes large sections of the middle class , students and the secular .
But a similar misreading of their own social circles for the country at large appears to have convinced the opposition 's supporters that it can only have lost last Friday 's election through fraud .
That is also reflected in the western media , whose cameras focus so lovingly on Tehran 's gilded youth and for whom Ahmadinejad is nothing but a Holocaust - denying fanatic .
The other Ahmadinejad , who is seen to stand up for the country 's independence , expose elite corruption on TV and use Iran 's oil wealth to boost the incomes of the poor majority , is largely invisible abroad .
While Mousavi promised market reforms and privatisation , more personal freedom and better relations with the west , the president increased pensions and public sector wages and handed out cheap loans .
So it 's hardly surprising that Ahmadinejad should have a solid base among the working class , the religious , small town and rural poor – or that he might have achieved a similar majority to that of his first election in 2005 .
That 's what one of the few genuinely independent polls ( the US - based Ballen - Doherty survey ) predicted last month , when the Times reported Ahmadinejad was " expected to win " .
But such details have got lost as the pressure has built in Tehran for a " green revolution " amid unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen .
The strongest evidence appears to be some surprising regional results and the speed of the official announcement , triggered by Mousavi 's declaration that he was the winner before the polls closed .
But most official figures do n't look so ­implausible – Mousavi won Tehran , for instance , by 2.2 m votes to 1.8 m – and it's hard to believe that rigging alone could account for the 11 million - vote gap between the main contenders .
If Ahmadinejad was in fact the winner , then there is an attempted coup going on in Tehran right now , and it is being led by Mousavi and his western - backed supporters .
But for the demonstrators facing repression in Tehran , the conviction that they have been cheated has created its own momentum in what is now a highly polarised society .
That is given more force by the fact that the protests are underpinned by a split in the theocratic regime , of which Mousavi and his allies are a powerful component .
Part of that is about a perceived threat to their own economic interests .
But the division also reflects differences within the establishment about how to respond to Barack Obama and the overtures from Washington .
All factions uphold Iran 's right to continue nuclear reprocessing , but Mousavi 's campaign was critical of the level of support given to Hezbollah and Hamas , while Ahmadinejad 's supporters argue that only toughness can win western acceptance of Iran 's status as a new regional power .
Iran is of course at the centre of an arc of crisis across the greater Middle East , from Palestine to Pakistan : the legacy of the Bush administration 's catastrophic failure in Iraq and the wider war on terror .
And as the US attempts to reconstitute its hegemony in the region on a new basis – for which Obama 's speech to the Muslim world in Cairo was supposed to set the tone – there 's reason to believe that the birth pangs of the new order may yet turn out to be as painful as the death throes of the old .
Last Friday , even before the polls had closed in Iran , the US president ­commented that people were ­" looking at new possibilities " in Iran , just as they had in Lebanon 's elections the previous weekend .
In fact , the unexpected defeat of Hezbollah 's opposition coalition ( which nevertheless won the largest number of votes ) seems to have had more to do with local Lebanese sectarian issues and large - scale vote buying than the Obama effect .
But the implications of his remarks were not lost in Iran , where the US is still spending hundreds of millions of dollars in covert destabilisation programmes .
Obama 's public engagement over the Israel - Palestine conflict has so far elicited a commitment by Israel 's Benjamin Netanyahu to the paper ­principle of a Palestinian state – backed by both his predecessors and George Bush and hedged around with so many restrictions it would barely merit Ruritanian status – but no climbdown over illegal settlement expansion .
The chances of a negotiated deal in such conditions seem minimal , particularly in the absence of Hamas , and the prospects that a US plan for a settlement might then fail and plunge the region back into conflict relatively high .
Meanwhile , ­resistance and wider violence have been growing again in Iraq , as US occupation troops pull back from the cities .
And in Afghanistan , far from ­winding down the occupation , Obama is ­escalating the conflict as promised , with another 21,000 US troops being sent this ­summer to fight the ­unwinnable war , as attacks on Nato forces have reached an all - time peak .
At the same time , the spread of the Afghan war into ­neighbouring Pakistan has left thousands of civilians dead , created more than two million refugees and led to a civilian carnage from US drone attacks across the northwest of the country .
In case anyone imagined such wars of western occupation would become a thing of the past in the wake of the ­discredited Bush administration , ­General Dannatt , head of the ­British army , recently set out to disabuse them .
Echoing US defence secretary Robert Gates , he insisted : " Iraq and ­Afghanistan are not aberrations – they are signposts for the future " .
In such a context , the neutralisation of Iran as an independent regional power would be a huge prize for the US – defanging recalcitrants from Baghdad to Beirut – and a route out of the strategic impasse created by the invasion of Iraq .
But so far , the signs from Tehran are still that that 's unlikely to be achieved by a colour - coded revolution .
The UK population increased by a record amount last year to top 61 million for the first time , figures revealed today .
There were 408,000 more people living here in 2008 , the Office for National Statistics said .
That takes the total population to 61.4 million - an increase of more than two million over 2001 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The increase was driven by a baby boom as fertility rates shot up to their highest rates in a generation .
The increase is the highest since modern records began in 1972 and more than twice the increase of 2001 when the population rose by 201,000 .
Statisticians are now trawling historic records to confirm it is the biggest population increase in history .
For the first time in nearly a decade natural changes to the population caused by shifts in birth and death rates have overtaken immigration as the biggest factor affecting population growth .
The vast wave of immigrants who came here from Eastern Europe after the EU expanded in 2004 has slowed to a trickle , as the recession took hold , the figures showed .
Arrivals from the A8 countries of Eastern Europe fell by more than a quarter - 28 % - from 109,000 to 79,000 in the year to December last year .
More Eastern European immigrants went home in the same period - up by more than 50 % to 66,000 .
Overall migration levels - the numbers arriving minus those leaving - fell 44 % to 118,000 - the lowest since EU enlargement .
The most recent figures showed a huge increase in returns , as the number of A8 workers registering for employment fell 42 % to 116,000 in the year to June this year .
Chief statistician Karen Dunnell said the emigration was probably due to the economic downturn .

She said : " You have to say that probably the unemployment and the economic situation , given that quite a lot of people from the A8 countries are coming to work , is probably having an impact . "
The ONS later confirmed the increase in population was the highest in nearly 50 years .
In 1962 the population rose by 484,000 and in 1947 the post - war baby boom drove up population levels by more than half a million ( 551,000 ) .
The surge in Eastern Europeans returning home and the decline in arrivals meant they added only 13,000 to the total population last year .
The ageing population meant there were a record number of mid-octogenarians .
There are now 1.3 million over 85s , making up 2 % of the total .
Statisticians said the increase in birth rates was caused in part by higher fertility rates among British nationals , and in part by immigration , as foreign - born mothers tend to have more children .
There are also more women of child bearing age .
There were 791,000 babies born in the UK last year , an increase of 33,000 on a year earlier , and almost twice the rise seen at the start of the decade .
ONS statistician Roma Chappell highlighted the significance of the shift .
" That 's actually quite exciting because it 's the highest fertility rate we have seen in the UK for some time .
" You have to go all the way back to 1993 to find a time when the fertility rate went higher .
" For the first time in a decade natural change exceeded net migration as the main driver of population change . "
" Prior to 1998 natural change was higher than net migration .
This is n't a new phenomenon for the UK .
" If you go back it was quite common for natural change to exceed net migration as a driver of population growth . "
She added : " The balance is still positive so the population is still growing due to net migration but the increase is the lowest it has been since accession in 2004 . "
" What has driven this is the emigration of non-British citizens especially citizens of the A8 countries . "
The population is now growing by a rate of 0.7 % every year , more than double the rate in the 1990s and three times the level of the 1980s .
Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said the figures showed migrants were coming here to work then returning home .
He said : " The fall in net migration is further proof that migrants come to the UK for short periods of time , work , contribute to the economy and then return home .
" Our new flexible points based system gives us greater control on those coming to work or study from outside Europe , ensuring that only those that Britain needs can come .
" Britain 's borders are stronger than ever before .
Our border controls in northern France are stopping record numbers of migrants reaching our shores - 28,000 in 2008 .
" We are rolling out ID cards to foreign nationals , we have introduced civil penalties for those employing illegal workers and from the end of next year our electronic border system will monitor 95 % of journeys in and out of the UK . "
" The British people can be confident that immigration is under control . "
Shadow immigration minister Damian Green accused Home Secretary Alan Johnson of " sleeping on the job " over population growth .
He said : " Alan Johnson says he does n't lose sleep over Britain 's population growth .
Perhaps he should , instead of sleeping on the job .
" These figures show our population is still rising fast , even when the recession is driving hundreds of thousands of people to leave .
" This puts added pressure on housing and transport , and shows that there is still no proper control over immigration numbers . "
Sir Andrew Green , chairman of protest group Migrationwatch UK , said overall foreign immigration was " virtually unchanged " and the population was still due to cross the 70 million mark within 25 years .
He said : " It is the usual Government spin to claim these numbers as a success for immigration policy despite the fact that foreign immigration is virtually unchanged at about half a million a year .
" What has really happened is that EU citizens have voted with their feet ; the number leaving has doubled in the face of the deep recession in Britain but EU migration is something over which the Government have no control whatever .
" As for the Government 's much vaunted points - based system , it has had very little effect so far ; work permit immigration fell last year by 16,000 , or roughly 3.5 % of foreign immigration .
" The bottom line is that the population of the UK will exceed 70 million within 25 years even at these levels of immigration . "
Tim Finch , head of migration at think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research ( Ippr ) , said the figures showed high immigration levels were not inevitable , and attacked " irresponsible scaremongering " surrounding the issue .
" Ippr has pointed out for some time that migration flows go in cycles , and these latest figures for 2008 indicate that after a number of years in which net migration was high , it is now declining sharply - almost certainly because of a combination of the economic downturn , the short - term nature of much migration from new EU countries , and the impact of stronger controls and management put in place by the Government , " he said .
" There has been a lot of irresponsible scaremongering about immigration in recent years which was based on the false assumption that high net migration into the UK was inevitable for years to come .
" As our recent report on re-migration showed , migration flows go both ways and we now need to be thinking about how our managed migration systems can continue to attract and retain the migrants we need to help our economy to recover and grow . "
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Everyone in the full - time political class pays great homage to us entrepreneurs .
We are hailed as the “ backbone of the American economy ” and the “ real engine of job creation . ”
Even the liberal wing of the Democratic Party joins in this chorus , carefully differentiating us from that part of the private sector they can successfully publicly disdain as inherently evil .
We are the “ good ” business folks , according to politicians throughout the whole spectrum .
So why are the Congress and the president waging war on the entrepreneurial class with unprecedented zeal , scaring us into a protective hunker - down mode while simultaneously stimulating the economy with matching unprecedented fiscal and monetary inputs ?
It is like trying to drive a car with one foot floored on the accelerator and one foot hard on the brake .
It does n’t work .
The economic war is waged on many fronts .
First , let ’s have a lesson in Taxation 101 for the leaders in political Disneyland .
Back in 1986 , we had a monster makeover change in the tax code , and one big change effectively encouraged millions of small - and medium - sized businesses to file as Subchapter S corporations , which means the business ’ income is reported on the individual owner ’s tax return as personal income .
But here comes the zinger , you political Musketeers :
That income is n’t really the same as our personal income .
Most of us have banking partners who expect to be paid first out of the personal income .
Many small - and medium - business owners , like me , actually have significant banking restrictions on our ability to pay ourselves .
So when you Musketeers talk about raising taxes on the rich making more than $ 250,000 , you are raising taxes directly on millions of businesses .
And yes , that mantra you recite about us creating three - fourths of new jobs is true .
The second foot on the brake is your proposed monster health care taxes that are mainly directed at us .
Have you allowed us to pool our buying power through associations or to be able to buy catastrophic health coverage for very young workers as an interim step ?
No , this is n’t about insurance , it is about power .
You ’ve got so many other feet on the brakes .
Reinstate the death tax and lots of small and medium owners will need to resume or begin buying life insurance to protect their business instead of investing in new jobs .
Brake .
You ’ve got our Main Street banker friends scared of your regulators looking up their underwriting with a magnifying glass , so credit is very tough even if the mark - to - market accounting rule has been eased .
Brake .
“ Cap - and - trade . ” Brake .
I can hear the silent primordial scream of many liberals to these claims ; they are thinking that business always claims that every progressive tax and regulation will have adverse consequences and life always goes on just fine .
Those entrepreneurs always cry wolf , they ’re thinking , but the system always absorbs it .
I reply , every system has a saturation point , and you ’ve threatened to go well past it .
Snicker if you want .
Have you seen the under - 24 unemployment rates , especially among minorities ?
Hey , let ’s raise the minimum wage to $ 10 an hour and see who absorbs it and where .
Political class , you ’ve got us entrepreneurs beaten down , discouraged and depressed .
Capital may be the engine of entrepreneurial activity , but optimism is the fuel .
If you guys just took some of your feet off the brakes , we could do what we entrepreneurs have always done - build stuff and add jobs .
Just let us build without fear .
If you do n’t do as I suggest , we will continue to hear of the “ jobless recovery ” as we entrepreneurs continue to look at your feet on the brakes and ring up “ no sale . ”

Research shows that the concentration of carbonate and the pH of the groundwater can slow uranium ’s progress toward waterways .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Uranium 's migration through the soil depends on groundwater 's chemical composition , according to a recent study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory .
Scientists showed that uraniumattached to soil particles and moved slowly when the groundwater was at neutral pH and contained low levels of carbonate ion or dissolved carbon dioxide .
Such conditions often occur at riverbanks when the river water rises and mixes with the groundwater .
This work appeared in the September 1 issue of Environmental Science & Technology .
To control uranium 's fate and transport , scientists must understand how fast uranium attaches to and releases from soil particles under different chemical conditions .
For example , at a former plutonium production site in southeastern Washington State , uranium - contaminated groundwater is moving toward the nearby Columbia River .
Using the results of experiments and a mathematical model , scientists are learning how the river 's changing levels slow uranium 's movement .
The scientists began with uranium - contaminated sediment from an Integrated Field Research Challenge Site .
This site is located on the southern tip of the Hanford Site , a former plutonium production site near the Columbia River in southeastern Washington State .
Then , they conducted experiments where they exposed the sediment to solutions with different pH , calcium , and carbonate levels .
In these experiments , the sediment and solutions were constantly stirred .
The researchers found that uranium 's detachment from the sediment was slowed when the groundwater 's pH and carbonate concentration were decreased .
The result implied that uranium release from the sediment will be slow where groundwater is diluted by river water with low levels of carbonate and at neutral pH , and will be much quicker at inland regions where groundwater contains high levels of carbonate and is more basic .
Next , the researchers used the experimental data to evaluate a mathematical model to describe the uranium absorption and desorption under variable groundwater chemical conditions .
The model is designed based on the most advanced knowledge available .
While the model provided a good description of the experimental results , discrepancies between the model and the experimental data exist .
Research is on - going to understand the fundamental theories behind the observed dependence of uranium adsorption and desorption on groundwater 's chemical composition .
These theories will help improve or re-design the mathematical model .

Update at bottom : Palin releases ‘ snarling ’ statement against Johnston , CBS
Milking fifteen minutes into a questionable career is one thing , but apparently the one man wrecking crew intent on humiliating Alaska ’s former governor is also a gentleman .
Claiming that Sarah Palin “ joked about her son Trig ’s Down Syndrome , calling him her ‘ retarded baby ‘ ” and other things is just part of Levi Johnston ’s “ job ” now , but he wo n’t reveal things that “ could ” and “ will hurt her . ”

Johnston , who fathered a child with Palin ’s daughter Bristol and has since been leaking dirt about the former vice - president candidate , is now hinting that there may be even bigger scandals he ’s not discussing .
According to Johnston , after he and Bristol broke up the Palins shut him out , and since then the battle has been escalating .
In a new interview , he told CBS ’s Maggie Rodriguez , “ When she started coming out with these things and saying things about me , it was kind of like , alright , it ’s time , we ’re going to take the gloves off , I ’m going to tell a little bit of something . ”
“ Do you feel that you ’ve betrayed them because you ’re airing this dirty laundry ?
asked Rodriguez .
“ That might be true , but at the same time they threw me out , ” Johnston replied .
“ During that , that came out that Sarah did n’t really like me , I knew Todd did n’t like me .
So they were kind of betraying me at the same time , backstabbing me , just putting on a front to me to make Sarah look good at the convention . … I really do n’t care any more . ”
Johnston went on to say , however , “ There are some things that I have that are huge , and I have n’t said them because I ’m not going to hurt her that way .
…
I have things that would get her in trouble and could hurt her , will hurt her , but I ’m not going to go that far . ”

When pressed by Rodriguez , Johnston said he was referring to “ things she has done while she was governor ” but “ I ’m not even going to talk about them . …
All the big things I ’ve got , I ’m keeping it in .
It ’s just something that probably will never come out . ”
“ I ’m sure she ’s got something coming for me , ” Johnston concluded , but he added , “ I ’m not worried about her saying anything about me . … I do n’t have anything to hide . ”
Palin fights back , tears into Johnston , CBS

On Wednesday afternoon , the former Alaska governor struck back at her serial antagonizer and the network who has repeatedly aired his accusations .
Reporting for ABC News ’
The Note , Rick Klein noted that Palin was “ blasting away at the father of her grandson , issuing a blistering statement today that impugns Levi Johnston ’s motives in continuing to speak out against the Palin family , and attacks his decision to pose for ‘ Playgirl . ’ ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Palin ’s statement :
We have purposefully ignored the mean spirited , malicious and untrue attacks on our family .
We , like many , are appalled at the inflammatory statements being made or implied .
Trig is our ‘ blessed little angel ’ who knows it and is lovingly called that every day of his life .
Even the thought that anyone would refer to Trig by any disparaging name is sickening and sad .
CBS should be ashamed for continually providing a forum to propagate lies .
Consider the source of the most recent attention - getting lies — those who would sell their body for money reflect a desperate need for attention and are likely to say and do anything for even more attention .
People magazine referred to Palin ’s statement as “ snarling . ”

* opening reception changed to Friday July 29th August 5th ( It seems Jorge is having some difficulties flying out of Cuba , hence the 2nd date change )
‘ RECHARGEABLE ’ , the personal exhibition of visiting Cuban artist Jorge Luis Santana will be having its opening reception on Friday July 22nd 29th August 5th at the Brew House Space 101 Gallery in the South Side , from 6 pm to 9:30 pm .
The exhibition will feature installations , video , paintings and photos from the artist .
The official press release :
With RECHARGABLE , the Camagüeyan artist closes a cycle of work for more than 20 years of creation .
The exhibition brings together a set of very current ideas and projects , together with others that Santana has been in process of during his artistic career , casting in about 25 pieces , including installations , paintings , sculptures , photographs and video art , giving it a unique generic and technical feel .
Here the artist focuses more attention on the effectiveness of the materials , finishing and cleaning in the execution of the works , giving more value to the conceptual and offering a sharper look the its recurrent , but always original sociological concerns , on the influence of context on the behavior of the individual , the environment and its relation to the cultural fabric of society and the Soliloquy of the interior of the human being with different choices of destination , the history and time .
In this regard , we will notice how Santana is interested more and more by the approach of the everyday and the problem of the image and its contents .
Iconographies and purposes outlined in various creative periods converge , revealing the relationship as a whole , a cultural statement , visually in a way that is characteristic and representative of the artist .
Santana gives great importance to the creative process , the final selection , multiple solutions to internalize and investigate , as well as linkages with other materials and techniques often outside the artistic practice .
This allows you to establish a kind of feedback which incorporates his work contents and knowledge by way of support where the speech is based .
Opening reception is Friday July 22nd 29th August 5th : 6 - 9:30 pm .
Weekly Gallery hours through August 13th :
Wednesdays & Thursdays : 6-9pm
Saturdays : 12-6pm
The Brew House Space 101 Gallery is located at 2100 Mary St in the South Side ( 15203 ) .

Filmed at 1300 - fps , you can see the cannon knock down three different houses made of straw , stick , and brick with an explosive vortex ring .
The vortex ring that comes out is not smoke , however .
After detonating the explosive gas mixture of acetylene and oxygen , " one of the most dangerous gas mixes in the world , " the ring forms from the pressure drop inside the vortex .
It condenses the lake 's damp air and shoots a cloud out at 200 - mph , knocking down anything in its path .

Appearing on Italian talk show , Parla con Me , Quentin Tarantino announced that he intends to make Kill Bill Vol.3 in the next few years .
He says he intends to for there to be a 10 year break in between the 2nd ( Kill Bill Vol.2 ) installment and the third ; which would make 2014 the release year .
Hard to hold him to that though as he was talking Inglourious Basterds for over a decade too !
Tarantino went on to say that he wanted a 10 - year break because he wanted The Bride ( Uma Thurman ’s character ) to “ have a break ” after all she had been through but went on to say that “ The Bride will fight again ! ”
SWEET !!

A spider , seemingly possessed , spins an uncharacterisitic web — just before wasp larvae nesting on its abdomen suck the last nourishing juices from the spider 's dying body and make a cocoon in the weird web .
A worm gets into the brain of a shy , shade - loving snail , compelling it to crawl out of its safe home and into the open where it gets attacked by a bird — which is destined to be the parasite 's next host .
Creepy tales like these are happening all over the animal kingdom , and not just on Halloween or under a full moon .
Some organisms have taken evolutionary advantage to a whole new level , achieving success by insidiously — and still quite mysteriously — changing the behavior of another animal against its will .
View a Slide Show of Zombie Animals
Although not undead in the strictest sci- fi definition of " zombie , " these captive creatures nonetheless behave as if possessed by a force from beyond .
That force , however , is often controlling them from the inside , making the unfortunate hosts do deadly things .
In the case of the spooked spider ( Plesiometa argyra ) , a parasitic wasp ( Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga ) lays her eggs on the spider 's abdomen .
Just before the larva emerges , the host spins a strange , new type of web — one that looks nothing like its usual wide nets .
This silk platform , however , is perfectly suited to supporting a cocoon for the vulnerable young wasp larvae , which have been feasting on the spider 's innards as they grow .
The snail - manipulating flatworm ( Leucochloridium paradoxum ) grows and multiplies inside the snail .
Once ready to move on to its next host , the worms push up into the snail 's tentacles , making them swell and squirm , mimicking the action of bugs that birds like to eat .
As the snail crawls , blindly , into the sunlight , a passing bird is likely to swoop down to snatch a tasty tentacle or two .
The worm - infested meal will then infect the bird , which passes it onto other snails via dubious droppings .
The mechanisms by which these parasites are commanding their hosts remain , by in large , unsolved mysteries .
" We do n't know how it works , but it 's obviously some type of chemical , " says David Hughes , a researcher at Harvard University .
" It 's co-opting a preexisting behavior . "
As part of their normal routine , snails climb stalks and spiders spin webs , but the parasites have managed to take these particular behaviors and mold them to their own advantage — often resulting in their hosts ' demise .
" Typically you have behavior that a host would do at some point in its life , " adds Edward Levri , an associate professor of biology at The Pennsylvania State University in Altoona .
" It 's just happening at an odd , nonadvantageous time for the host , to the benefit of the parasite . "
Creepy control
So many very different — and very bizarre — examples of parasite - controlled behavior modification have been observed that researchers have a wealth of instances to study .
But it is no longer enough to document these parasites .
" We have to go beyond describing behavior , " Hughes says .
" Now people are trying to look at how parasites are changing behavior . "
Figuring this puzzle out , however , has proved to be quite difficult .
" Modified organisms are more complex than we had previously believed , " says Frederic Thomas , a scientist at the Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Diseases research group in Montpellier , France , and the department of biology at the University of Montreal .
With improved technology , researchers in this freaky field have been able to start sequencing the genomes and parsing proteins of some of these parasites and hosts to unravel where behavioral changes happen .
" In at least some cases , some of these parasites produce neurotransmitters or hormones that mimic host hormones , " Levri says .
Not all of the parasites , however , are traditional body snatchers .
" You can easily understand that a parasite can control the behavior when it is inside , " Thomas says .
But how do some manage to dictate a host 's behavior when they 're not , technically , hosting a parasite ?
" To me , it 's like magic , " he adds .
The aberrant web - spinning P. argyra demonstrates this to some extent , the parasitic wasp eggs having been laid on the outside of the spider 's body .
In another bizarre example of external control , a different species of wasp ( Ampulex compressa ) is able to control a cockroach — via an injection into its brain — and force it to enter its nest to become food and shelter for the wasp 's larvae .
Are humans next ?
Even people may not be fully immune to such manipulation .
Much of our modern - day behavior seems to suit the interests other species , such as hitchhiking invasive species and airline - riding viruses that hop continents in a matter of hours .
But can we also be manipulated from within ?
To a certain degree , yes .
Perhaps the most familiar example is rabies , which can cause human hosts — like other mammals — to salivate excessively , thereby spreading the deadly virus .
Researchers have even shown that malaria - infected people are more attractive to mosquitoes , which spread the infected blood to another host , according to a 2005 PLoS ONE paper .
Such pernicious parasitism is indeed widespread throughout various kingdoms .
" We know it 's evolved a few times , " Exeter 's Hughes says .
So , he wonders : " Has it been different solutions to the same problem ? "
In the quest to understand both how these uncanny behaviors work and how they emerged , researchers are also enlisting the help of evolutionary ecology .
They are examining these behaviors on a smaller scale .
For example if two larvae are growing on a controlled host , like the P. argyra orb - web spider , what happens to the spider 's behavior when one is mature and the other is n't yet ready to emerge ?
Some hosts have evolved to cope with frequent parasitism .
For example , one beetle that is frequently killed off early by a parasite has adapted by increasing its sexual activity and producing more offspring , Thomas notes .
But the chilling question remains :
How can bugs control other bugs ?
And in some of the more extreme examples , Hughes ponders : " How can a member of one kingdom modify the behavior of another kingdom ? "
Until scientists find that answer , it 's all eerie action , for sure .
In the first interview with one of the six Uighurs recently released from Guantánamo to the Pacific nation of Palau , Radio Free Asia in Washington D.C. spoke by phone to Anwar Hassan , who revealed that , although the men were enjoying their new - found freedom , they were all concerned that they were unable to contact their families .
As RFA described it , “ Hassan said that strict Chinese government controls on Internet and phone communication with the Uighurs ’ homeland following ethnic violence in July have prevented them from doing so . ”
“ We have n’t been able to talk to our family members yet , ” Anwar Hassan said in the telephone interview .
“ We have stayed eight years in the jail … Our biggest desire on getting out of the jail was to talk to our family members and let them know we are alive and give them some peace of mind , ” he said .
He added , “ Even though we are free now , in one sense our situation is n’t too different from when we were in jail , as the Chinese government has blocked all communication channels to our homeland .
I think this is because the Chinese government does not want the outside world to know what happened in our homeland so they can strike harder against our people .
Now , this has become our main concern . ”

RFA explained that Hassan , and the other men who flew to Palau with him — Ahmad Tourson , Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman , Edham Mamet , Adel Noori and Dawut Abdurehim — received a warm welcome from the country ’s president , Johnson Toribiong .
“ The president of Palau greeted us and met with us when we got here , ” Hassan said .
“ He is a very easy - going and pleasant man .
Everybody here is very good to us . ”
However , he also explained that he and his companions “ had very mixed feelings on the occasion of their release , ” as RFA described it .
“ We spent eight years of our lives over there for nothing .
There was no reason given for that kind of treatment , and even thinking about the experience causes great pain , ” he said .
“ On the other hand , ” he added , “ when the Chinese government demanded that the US hand us over to them , the American government refused to give us to them , so when we think about that , we are very happy to be here . ”
Hassan also explained that Palau “ wo n’t be the final destination for the men , who have been caught up by political forces far beyond their control , ” as RFA put it .
“ We are living here temporarily , ” he said .
“ So our main concern is : where is our next stop ?
When will it happen ?
How soon ?
All of these questions are bothering us right now . ”
For Agence France - Presse , Bernadette Carreon visited the men in Koror , the capital of Palau , and reported that they “ spent their first day of freedom on Monday shopping . ”
As they walked around the shops being greeted by the local people , they were accompanied by their translator , Mampimin Ala , who was flown in from Australia to help them adjust .
AFP also explained that they had “ penciled in a day ’s swimming at the spectacular Rock Islands … after revealing that was one of life ’s treats they missed most while detained at the US naval base in Cuba . ”
George Clarke , one of the lawyers for the men , who traveled to Palau with them , told AFP , “ They have not touched the water for eight years , ” adding , “ They are happy that the Palawan people have accepted them and relieved that they have finally been released from jail , ” Gitanjali Gutierrez , another of their US lawyers , said it was “ important for them to meet as many locals as possible in the next few days as [ they ] rebuild their lives in freedom . ”

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- David Letterman told his audience Thursday that he is the victim of an alleged extortion attempt and admitted to having sexual relations with several members of his staff , according to a press release from his production company .
David Letterman admitted to having sexual relationships with female staff members , his company says .
Letterman made the announcement during taping of the " Late Show . "
" This morning , I did something I 've never done in my life , " Letterman told his audience , according to a release from Worldwide Pants Inc .
" I had to go downtown and testify before a grand jury . "
The 62 - year - old funnyman said he received a package three weeks ago from a person who claimed to have information about Letterman 's sexual dalliances , ultimately demanding $ 2 million to prevent public revelation .
Letterman said he went to the Manhattan District Attorney 's office , which conducted an investigation , and an arrest was made earlier Thursday .
In his grand jury testimony , Letterman said , he revealed the relations with members of his staff .
" My response to that is , yes I have , " he said .
" Would it be embarrassing if it were made public ?
Perhaps it would .
I feel like I need to protect these people -- I need to certainly protect my family . "
It is not known when the sexual encounters with staffers took place .
Letterman married long - time partner Regina Lasko in March .
The couple , who have been together since 1986 , have a son , Harry , 6 .
Letterman has been host of " Late Show with David Letterman " on CBS since 1993 after leaving NBC , where he was host of " Late Night with David Letterman " for 11 years .
" Late Show " airs at 11:30 p.m. " Late Night " aired an hour later .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - A lawyer for Roman Polanski denied on Wednesday that the film director , now in Swiss custody , may opt to face justice in the United States , where he is wanted on a 1977 sex charge , to avoid lengthy extradition procedures .
Earlier , another member of Polanski ’s legal team appeared to suggest that the Oscar - winning director might be prepared to go to the United States voluntarily .
“ If the procedure drags on , it is not impossible that Roman Polanski could choose to go and explain himself in the United States , where there are some arguments in his favor , ” lawyer Georges Kiejman said on France ’s Europe 1 radio .
However Polanski’s French lawyer , Herve Temime , said there was no question of the director abandoning his fight against extradition .
“ There has been no change in strategy at all , ” Temime told Reuters , denying that there was any disagreement within the team mounting Polanski ’s legal defense .
“ There were some comments by Mr. Kiejman that were misunderstood , ” he said .
“ There is no disagreement at all . ”
Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 in connection with the sex case and a court this week rejected his request for release on bail , saying there was a strong risk that he would flee .
U.S. authorities have until the end of November to make a firm extradition request .
Judicial sources say the process could take years if Polanski challenges it .
Polanski , 76 , has dual French and Polish citizenship .
Swiss authorities arrested him as he flew in to Zurich to accept a lifetime achievement award at a film festival .
In 1977 , he pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13 - year - old girl and spent 42 days in prison having psychiatric tests .
But he fled the United States in 1978 , before sentencing , fearing that the judge would overrule his plea agreement for time already served and send him to jail for 50 years .
Polanski , who had U.S. box office hits with his films “ Rosemary ’s Baby ” and “ Chinatown , ” went on to have a successful career in Europe , winning a best director Oscar for his 2002 Holocaust movie “ The Pianist . ”
In denying him bail , the Swiss court said Polanski would have a strong motivation to run away as a jail sentence in the United States would mean a painful separation from his French wife and their two children , aged 11 and 16 .
The court also said Polanski had the financial means to flee .
Souvenir clock featuring King Pumipon Adunyadet and his mother .
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
September 25 , 2009 -- Many
Thais , whether they are royalist ``Yellow Shirts '' or pro-democracy ``Red Shirts '' , are waiting for King Pumipon Adunyadet [ often spelled Bhumipol Adulyadej in the Western press ] to die .
It may take years .
Their feelings will be different , either positive or negative .
This is because Pumipon has influenced Thai society for years .
But the issue to discuss is whether this influence is created by others or based on the king 's own power ?
Most Thais , both Yellow and Red , believe that Pumipon is the most powerful political actor .
Many academics like Paul Handley believe this too .
But it is not the case .
If Pumipon was powerful , like an absolute monarch , when he dies there would be a civil war between those who want to become the next king .
That is unlikely .
There will be a power struggle and rivalries , but it will be a struggle among the elites , including former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , to see who can use the monarchy for their own ends .
After the 2006 coup , Thaksin lost this battle .
Maybe he might return to the fight .
Among the Yellow Shirts there will also be such rivalries .
When Pumipon dies , my guess is that the Thai army and the conservative elites will hold a gigantic and very expensive funeral for him .
Resources which ought to go to welfare and raising wages will be used for this .
My guess is the funeral will be at least twice as long as the one recently organised for his sister , which lasted a whole year .
Perhaps Pumipon ’s funeral will last five years .
Extensions of other kingly activities could take the whole thing to 10 years !
Pictures of the King will increase even more .
The reason for this huge funeral will not be in order to satisfy “ millions of Thais who will be heart - broken by Pumipon ’s death ” .
Many will be celebrating in private .
No , the reason for a huge funeral will be in order to shift the propaganda machine into an even higher gear .
The conservative elites will be desperately trying to promote and re-promote the ideology of the monarchy .
Anyone who opposes the army , or the authoritarian elites who are now in power , anyone who campaigns for democracy , will be accused of lese majeste [ insulting royalty ] and of trying to “ overthrow Pumipon ” .
The fact that he is dead will be of little consequence .
While all this is going on , the extremely unpopular and disrespected crown prince will be gradually shifted onto the throne .
His equally hated mother , the queen , will be there too , but both will be under the larger - than - life picture of Pumipon .
We will never be able to forget Pumipon and his so - called “ wonderful works ” .
We will see the crown prince , but the words “ Pumipon ” will be blaring out from loudspeakers .
If all this propaganda does not work , there will be the lese majeste law , the contempt of court law , the computer law and the internal security law .
If that does not work , the army can always shoot pro-democracy demonstrators .
When the generals staged coups or intervened in politics , they were not following the orders of Pumipon .
Pumipon has always been shy , timid and lacking in courage and character .
Pumipon has no leadership qualities .
He goes with the flow .
When Thaksin was prime minister , he praised Thaksin .
When the soldiers staged a coup , he praised them .
His speeches use obscure language so that the elites can make their own interpretations and Pumipon does not have to take any responsibility .
He is happy that people crawl to him and he is happy accumulating his vast wealth .
The queen and the crown prince have a reputation for being tyrants .
Maybe that is so , but they have no more real power than Pumipon .
So when the generals decide to do anything , they stage an elaborate play in order to make us think that they are going to the palace to “ take orders ” .
In fact they are there to “ tell ” the king what they have already decided to do .
Pumipon will nod in agreement or will be unavailable for an audience , depending on the advice he gets from the Privy Council .
The advice is not based on decisions made by Prem , the Privy Council chairperson , it is based on the consensus of those in power in the army and outside .
After Pumipon ’s nod of agreement , the generals come out of the palace and announce to the public that they have “ taken orders ” from the king .
That way they can build legitimacy for their actions and fear to oppose them .
When Pumipon dies , the powerful army will still be there .
The tanks and guns will not have disappeared .
The raw and repressive power of the conservative elites rests with the army .
But the generals will panic because their sole source of legitimacy will have died .
That is why they will extend the funeral as long as possible .
When Pumipon dies , the generals will still pretend to go to the palace and “ receive orders ” from the queen and the crown prince .
Occasionally , when it is some minor and rather silly issue , there might be real orders and the generals will follow them just to keep the royals happy .
But on all important matters of policy , they will be merely informing the royals of their decisions .
If the crown prince is hated and despised by Thais , why would the army promote him to be the next king ?
If Pumipon is all powerful , why does he not appoint the princess as his heir to the throne ?
The answer is that Pumipon is too cowardly to decide anything .
The army is reluctant to appoint the princess over the crown prince because their false claim that the monarchy is steeped in “ ancient tradition ” would collapse by such an appointment .
Not only that , changing the succession , because the prince was unsuitable , would mean that the monarchy could always be changed and even be abolished .
Do not think for one second that when Pumipon dies , Thailand will descend into chaos .
It is and has been in chaos for the last three to four years despite Pumipon .
It was in chaos in the mid-1970s .
Pumipon is not universally loved by all Thais .
Most Thais are Red Shirts .
Most Red Shirts tolerate the present king .
A few love the king , but most are waiting for him to die .
After Pumipon dies most Red Shirts will not tolerate the crown prince or his mother .
The queen lost popular support after she openly sided with the [ royalist , far - right ] Peoples Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) .
When Pumipon dies , the work of those who want a republic will not be easier .
The king ’s death will provide opportunities and dangers .
The royalist Yellow Shirts will be more desperate and dangerous .
But the legitimacy of their actions can be attacked .
Democracy does not fall from a branch like a ripe mango .
We have to reach up and pick it and at the same time , reach up and pull down the conservative elites and their entire authoritarian system .

This artist rendering provided by the European South Observatory shows some of the 32 new planets astronomers found outside our solar system .
Outer space just got a little more crowded Monday as European astronomers unveiled 32 newly detected planets orbiting nearby stars .
The discovery by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher ( HARPS ) team includes four " Super - Earths " only five to six times heavier than our own world .
" None are in a habitable zone " — they 're too hot to support life — says team scientist Stephane Udry of Switzerland 's University of Geneva .
DISCUSSION : Astronomy expert , readers talk habitation , life forms on other planets About 400 " extrasolar " planets orbiting nearby stars have been detected since 1995 , starting with a discovery made by the same team , led by Switzerland 's Michel Mayor , of a Jupiter - sized planet orbiting the star 51 Pegasi , 50 light - years away .
( One light - year is about 5.9 trillion miles . )
" We are on the good track to detect ( indirectly ) Earth - type planets within the next five to 10 years , " Udry says .
Using the European Southern Observatory 's 11.8 - foot - wide telescope at Chile 's La Silla Observatory , the team detects planets by " radial velocity " measure , which reveals the gravitation wobbles induced on stars by their planets .
" Wow — 32 or so planets at once — that certainly is a record for the largest number of new planets announced at the same time , " says planetary scientist Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institute of Washington .
" It really shows that the Europeans have taken the lead " in radial velocity planet hunting , he adds .
The team announced the newly discovered planets at a science meeting in Porto , Portugal .
They range in size from 5.4 times more massive than Earth to 7.1 times heavier than Jupiter , the largest planet in our solar system , and their host stars ranged from about 30 to 150 light - years away .
Two of the " Super - Earths " — thought to be rocky planets like Earth and not gas giants — orbit stars like our sun , and the other two orbit smaller " M " class stars , dimmer and redder than the sun .
So " we have yet to find firm evidence for a habitable , Earth - mass planet , " Boss says .
But he says the Super - Earth detections suggest that upcoming planet hunts , including NASA 's Kepler spacecraft , should find " lots of Earths . "
Dr. Alan P. Boss , a research staff member at the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington , D.C. , and author of The Crowded Universe : The Search for Living Planets , answered your questions on habitation and life forms on other planets in the discussion below .

Ben Goldacre , Saturday 17 October 2009 , The Guardian
For those with the finances to try to silence their critics , this has been a week of spectacular own goals .
Trafigura has loudly advertised the report on the dumping of toxic waste in Africa by taking out a super - injunction through Carter - Ruck .
And on Wednesday Simon Singh , the science writer being sued by the British Chiropractic Association , won his right to an appeal .
Briefly , Singh was sued by the BCA over an article in the Guardian in which he criticised chiropractors for claiming they can treat children ’s colic , sleeping and feeding problems , ear infections , asthma and prolonged crying , by manipulation of the spine .
He said these interventions were “ bogus ” , with “ not a jot of evidence ” .
Before this case most people had n’t really noticed chiropractors .
Now the internet is awash with reviews of the evidence and its flaws , so this is a good time to revisit the evidence .
Richard Brown , vice - president of the BCA , writes in the British Medical Journal ( the article is open - access ) that there is “ substantial evidence for the BCA to have made claims that chiropractic can help various childhood conditions ” .
He provided references to 19 academic papers .
These have now been examined and effectively demolished in a response by Edzard Ernst , professor of complementary medicine at the Peninsula medical school , Exeter .
I am happy to see that someone else has done this work , and I will now walk you through his summary .
Four of the BCA ’s references do not contain data about chiropractic treatment for the conditions being discussed , and so are irrelevant .
Eight refer to types of evidence that can tell us little about whether a treatment works : questionnaire surveys , case reports and so on .
That ’s 12 of the 19 references out already .
Among the rest , we are given a small pilot study , by Mercer and Nook , but it is unpublished , and the short conference summary that is available does not have enough information for anyone to know whether their methods were sound .
We are given a trial by Wiberg et al , in which 50 children with colic got either chiropractic or dimethicone : they found less crying in the chiropractic group , but because the babies and parents could not be blinded – they knew which treatment they were getting – even the researchers themselves felt this improvement might be due to a placebo response , or other non-specific effects unrelated to the chiropractic treatment , such as extra attention .
Hawk et al have a systematic review of various types of spinal manipulation for non-spinal conditions and look at the treatment of asthma , otitis and colic .
Systematic reviews examine trials and summarise them .
They give a positive conclusion for the treatment of asthma , but this relies on a study about osteopaths manipulating the ribs , so that ’s not relevant .
They are also positive about colic , to be fair , but , for evidence , they rely on the flawed and unblinded study by Wiberg , described in the previous paragraph .
This review therefore adds nothing .
There is a Cochrane review looking at various treatments for bed- wetting , and Cochrane reviews are high - quality summaries of the evidence , as you will know .
This one found two trials of chiropractic , which were not of high quality – in fact , the authors described them as “ weak evidence ” .
So that ’s not good .
Browning did a trial – which was published after Singh ’s article – comparing spinal manipulation with occipitosacral decompression .
Both are dubious treatments , and the trial found no difference between them .
So both may be effective , or both may just be equally ineffective ; either way , no prize .
But most interesting are the studies which the BCA chose not to mention : three randomised controlled trials and two systematic reviews , arguably the strongest evidence , were omitted .
The BCA is aware of these studies , because it has specifically commented on other work based on them .
So why did they not explicitly reference them ?
I do n’t know .
But they are negative papers , which failed to show that chiropractic was effective ; while quoting irrelevant papers , questionnaires , case studies and weak trials , the BCA ignored these higher - quality studies , with their unflattering results .
There are huge , endless debates to be had on our libel laws , on the risks they pose to the public by stifling access to information , and on the changes that could be made .
But , for today , know this : there is no good evidence that chiropractic is effective for the conditions claimed by the BCA , for the reasons you now know .
Shout it from the highest rooftop , when you tell your friends about Trafigura , because , until the law changes , the strongest disincentive to this effect is a very close examination of the companies involved .
Of course , I will be spending the next day or so evaluating the Senate Health Care Reform bill , released by Senator Max Baucus today to the sound of one hand clapping …
… but I wanted to take a quick moment to provide first impressions on a bill that , prima facie , seems as bad or worse as most people feared it would be .
A few points for your immediate consideration , to be followed by more in - depth analysis in the very near future :
Former health insurance executive for Cigna ( now a leading whistleblower ) Wendell Potter warned us yesterday of what we might expect to see .
Speaking before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee , he argued that once you take the crucial reform elements out of the bill … and you take out the only measure that will serve to provide competition against the private insurance companies ( ie. the public option , or some facsimile ) … all you have left is a plan that GIVES BUSINESS to the insurance companies .
As Potter said , it might as well be called the “ Insurance Industry Profit Protection and Enhancement Act . ”

Act of 2009 , encompasses a comprehensive set of reforms that address the critical need for expanded coverage , lower health care costs , and greater choice and quality .
Other legislative proposals , including the “ Baucus Framework ” being considered by the Senate Finance Committee ’s “ Bipartisan Six , ” would benefit health insurance companies far more than average Americans .
“ The practices of the insurance industry over the past several years have contributed directly to the growing number of Americans who are uninsured and the even more rapidly growing number of people who are underinsured .
H.R. 3200 would go a long way toward making many of the standard practices of the industry illegal while providing much - needed assistance to low and moderate income Americans who cannot afford the overpriced premiums being charged by the cartel of large for - profit insurance companies that now dominate the industry .
H.R. 3200 would provide premium and cost - sharing assistance through the Health Insurance Exchange it would create .
It would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a defined package of “ essential health services ” that all plans , public or private , would have to cover .
It also would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage or basing premiums on pre-existing conditions , gender or occupation .
It would eliminate deductibles or co-pays for preventive care as well as the lifetime limits currently common in health insurance policies .
The bill also would set an annual cap on out - of - pocket expenses that is more reasonable than in other proposals .
As important if not more important than those market reforms , H.R. 3200 would also create a public insurance option to compete with private insurers .
Contrary to the misinformation being disseminated by the health insurance industry and its allies , the public insurance option would not have a competitive advantage over private plans .
It would have to meet the same benefit requirements and comply with the same insurance market reforms as private plans . ”
Let me get this straight : the House bill … would allow people to buy from private insurers , buy the inexpensive government - run plan , or not buy insurance at all .
The Senate bill … would force EVERY American to buy plans from private insurers , or pay a fine .
Since about the only reforms left in the Senate version are that people with pre-existing conditions could not be denied , and premiums cannot be raised except for specific reasons including “ age ” and “ tobacco use ” … and since the only assistance anyone is going to get is in the form of subsidies for poor people to help buy overpriced private insurance , and caps for the middle class on how much they can be forced to pay out of pocket … it seems to me like Potter was right : only the insurance companies are going to profit from this .
They will get a lot more business , they wo n’t have to stop their current practices ( overcharging , rescission , spuriously denying claims ) , and EVERYONE is going to be forced to pay TOO much for policies that AREN ’T WORTH IT … only to have their claims denied when they try to get reimbursed .

Again … let me make sure I ’m getting this : the plan proposes helping poor people with subsidies to buy insurance , but if they still ca n’t afford it ( because they ’re effing POOR ) … we ’re going to FINE them ?
… let me make sure I ’m getting this : the plan proposes helping poor people with subsidies to buy insurance , but if they still ca n’t afford it ( because they ’re POOR ) … we ’re going to them ?
They claim the Senate version still contains “ competition ” because it calls for the creation of “ co-ops . ”
Ok fellas …here ’s a little Business 101 : a “ co-op , ” where people form large groups to buy insurance plans and get a “ group rate “ … that is n’t competition … it ’s just “ collective bargaining ” to take advantage of “ volume pricing . ”
You ’re just forming a larger group so the insurance companies have a better incentive to offer you a lower price … it provides ZERO competition to the insurance companies .
Only another insurance provider offering better prices and service can do THAT .
And once again … it is ironic and patently hypocritical that Republicans would have a problem with the so - called “ socialism ” of a government insurance plan… but are perfectly ok with the “ sort - of - communist ” collective known as a co-op .
I would guess it is because the insurance industries LOBBYISTS have much less of a problem with co-ops .

It ’s also noticeable that while real reform and competition are absent , everything the REPUBLICANS HAVE WANTED is in there .
Lower overall price tag : CHECK … strict measures to prevent illegal aliens from purchasing insurance ( unnecessary since there is n’t a public option , and illegals already CAN ’T BUY private insurance ) : CHECK … restrictions so federal money ca n’t be spent on abortions except in extreme cases ( unnecessary because Medicare laws already explicitly prohibit it ) : CHECK !
is in there .

Well , at least Baucus got something for all the compromises to the bill … exactly ZERO ( zip , zilch , nada )
Republicans say they ’ll vote for it , and most are still complaining about the proposed cuts to Medicare costs ( Medicare , being the GOP ’s FAVORITE “ socialist ” program ) … and the Democrats are also reasonably upset with the final product .
Representative Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) said “ The Senate and the president to some extent have been like a child looking for a unicorn .
I do n’t see it … “
More details certainly to follow …at a minimum , the House bill and the Senate bill … well … have quite a bit of daylight between them .
The complaint has been investigated and
resolved to the customer 's satisfaction Redflex Traffic Systems — Scammed !
RedFlex is pulling the same crap in Louisiana right now .
Gary and I have many things in common when it comes to this company .
My 16 year old also got a Threat Letter / Bill of Attainder in the mail ... however , it was addressed to me and told me that I had to pay up .
We received the Bill of Attainder the day I filed an official complaint with the Louisiana State Board of Private Investigators for the surveillance activities of the speed vans .
I was trained and licensed as a private investigator and under Louisiana law , you must have a license to perform what they are doing .
The day before the Board was to meet , RedFlex and their deep pocket attorneys filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order .
It seems as though the judge had no idea what was going on and granted the TRO .
Right after that , the attorney for the Board resigned .
The Attorney General 's office took over on behalf of the Board and filed a Motion for Summary Judgment , pointing out RedFlex 's twisting of the law and misrepresentations to the Court .
That hearing is scheduled for February 11th .
The traffic cams are turned on now .
I received another notice in the mail Christmas Eve extorting me and threatening that if I do not send the money immediately , RedFlex will either sue me , disable my car or report me to a collection agency .
RedFlex is not a Court ( but could be considered a kangaroo court ) .
As a citizen , I am accountable to City , State and Federal Court ... not a RedFlex Court .
RedFlex has come into our state and refused to adhear to state and federal law , not to mention the Constitution of Louisiana and the United States ... i.e. , shining bright lights in the face of drivers , illegally accessing our DMV information , using recording equipment to send out citations through the mail ( police officers are strictly prohibited from doing this ) ...
P.I. Law , denial of due process , right to face my accuser , vicarious liability , Uniform Traffic and Safety Laws , etc. , etc. , the list goes on and on .
Our legislature said
No to this program 5 times but our Mayor was suckered and fell for it .
Also , RedFlex is a foreign company who is not on the Safe Harbor list .
They are under no regulations and have taken the stance they are accountable to no one .
Our laws do not apply to them .
This company is using the United States Postal System to conduct their scam and what is really bothersome is that since they are not accountable to anyone ... we have no way to ensure there is no unethical use of the private information of our citizens , including DMV records , credit records ... not to mention should should someone send in their check for payment , now this information is vulnerable .
They are transferring information via the web to Scottsdale ... and since they are based out of Australia , information is probably going there as well .
Also , what RedFlex has done is convinced the City Council to take the crime of speeding and turn it into a civil matter ( which violates the Louisiana Constitution ) .
However , they have also chosen Not to follow the Code of Civil Procedure ... creating their own rules , artificial police force and mock court .
Other cities in Louisiana have been approached and their legal counsel has come out against it stating all of the law violations .
This has to be stopped immediately !
Detectives are in talks with lawyers of a nursery worker who abused young children amid claims that she has named some of her victims .
Vanessa George , 39 , who worked at Little Ted 's Nursery in Plymouth , Devon , is said to have identified up to 10 of the youngsters she abused .

The confession was made in custody and senior detectives are now examining the claims , according to the Daily Mirror .
Devon and Cornwall Police said officers are investigating whether any of George 's victims could be positively identified .
A spokeswoman for the force said : " As part of ongoing inquiries , detectives from Devon and Cornwall Constabulary are involved in a dialogue with George 's defence counsel , and the question of victim identification is part of that .
" It would be inappropriate to go into this further until sentencing is complete .
" We continue to update parents regularly regarding the investigation .
" Currently , no individual children have been identified and this information confirmed , but we continue to investigate this . "
George , from Plymouth , will be sentenced at Bristol Crown Court next month after pleading guilty to charges of indecent assault , taking indecent photos and distributing photos of children .
Co-defendants Colin Blanchard , 39 , from Rochdale , and Angela Allen , also 39 , from Nottingham , have also admitted several sex offences .
The trio are said to have met on Facebook , but police still do not know how they found each other .
Transcripts of George 's police interviews released by the Crown Prosecution Service showed her admitting that her crimes were " vile " and " disgusting " .
But despite that realisation , she refused to name any of the children .

Her apparent change of heart has come just two weeks before her sentencing date .
After her guilty plea earlier this month , Mr Justice Royce urged her to give up the identities .
George took more than 100 images of children being molested , and referred to the mobile she used as her " fun phone " .
Devon and Cornwall police could not identify any of the youngsters , whose heads were out of shot .
Around 30 parents of children who attended Little Ted 's sobbed in the public gallery of Bristol Crown Court as the admissions of guilt were made .
George 's lawyer , Geoff Parlby , will not be commenting , a spokeswoman for his Plymouth - based law firm said .
At the plea hearing on 1 October , George admitted seven sexual assaults on children and six counts of distributing and making indecent pictures of children .
Blanchard pleaded guilty to 17 child pornography counts and two sexual assaults on children .
He also admitted a further charge of possessing extreme pornography .
He was caught when a colleague found some of the images on a computer .
He had been on the sex offenders register before after receiving a police caution for a previous offence .
Allen admitted four child sex assaults and one count of distributing an indecent image .
The trio recorded the abuse on their mobiles and then swapped the pictures via email using unprotected accounts , including MSN Hotmail .
But they never met in person .
George was arrested at her home in Douglass Road , Plymouth , just after midnight on 8 June .
Mr Justice John Royce warned them they faced substantial prison sentences as he adjourned the case for reports .
He also urged George to co-operate with police in identifying all her victims .
He told her : " A lot of people are affected by this case and I would like your help . "
Mr Justice Royce said many parents still do not know if their children were among the victims - but George " must know " .
Addressing Nicolas Gerasimidis , George 's defence lawyer , Mr Justice Royce said : " Your client must know , it seems to me , who she has abused and who she has not .
" If I were a parent , I would want to know whether my child was abused or not .
" Would it not be decent for her to indicate who she has abused ?
It is a factor that I have got to take into account . "
Defence lawyers for Allen and George suggested there was a degree of encouragement of the two women by Blanchard .
But the judge rejected suggestions that Blanchard was the main instigator who groomed the two women to abuse children .
He said of George : " She is not a child .
This is a married woman who can make up her own mind whether she indulges in this sort of activity or not . "
Detective Inspector Costa Nassaris , of Devon and Cornwall Police public protection unit , said police feared many of the victims - some of whom were between 12 and 18 months old - may never be identified .
He said : " Work is ongoing , we 've not given up on that , but the probability , I would have to say , is very low that we will identify any of these children . "
Mr. Dicks argued that it would be “ inconceivable ” for the Air Force to reopen the bidding without considering the W.T.O. panel ’s findings .
“ The U.S. government cannot reward illegal market actions that have harmed U.S. manufacturers and stolen U.S. aerospace jobs , ” he said in a statement .

The United States had also claimed that Airbus received about $ 8 billion in research and development and facilities financing .
Congressional aides in Washington said that the United States had won some  though not all  of those points as well .
Both Airbus and Boeing have about six weeks to review the finding and comment on it .
The trade body is expected to issue a formal ruling by the end of the year .
Both sides can appeal that ruling , but W.T.O. rules limit the process to 90 days , making a final outcome likely in the spring .
European officials who had been briefed on the report said that the W.T.O. panel had rejected 70 percent of the claims in the American complaint .
“ Reimbursable investment loans for the A380 were not judged to be prohibited in their totality , ” said one person with knowledge of the report .
American officials who had been briefed on the ruling disputed that the United States had lost on that many points .
In some cases , they said , only one of the various arguments needed to be accepted for the panel to find that some subsidies were unfair .
I meet Norman Tebbit , that old icon of the Right , loyal keeper of the Thatcher faith and now Baron Tebbit of Chingford , in the central lobby at the Houses of Parliament .
I arrive early and am musing on the magnificence of the building – the gilt , the chandeliers , the mosaics , the murals – when he appears from behind the statue of Gladstone , looking gaunt and slightly menacing , but then he has always looked gaunt and slightly menacing .
Possibly , even , he was born gaunt and slightly menacing .
" Congratulations , Mrs Tebbit , " the midwife may have said to his mother , " you have a lovely , healthy baby boy , if gaunt and slightly menacing . "
Anyway , I introduce myself and we shake hands .
His palm feels papery and dry ( " ... and such cute little hands , Mrs Tebbit , if papery and dry " ) .
I tell him it must be a fabulous place to work , much better than Burger King .
Do you ever get bored of the building ?
No , he says , and he particularly likes it late at night , when the corridors are deserted , " and you really do expect to see a white rabbit " .
We head towards the coffee shop , making small talk all the while .
He does n't come into the House as much as he used to , he says ; not since he and his wife , Margaret , moved , as they did recently , from West Sussex to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk , which is further away from London .
Both were injured in the 1984 Brighton bomb – 25 years ago next week – but while he largely recovered ( he still has a slight limp ) his wife was permanently disabled , and the problem with Sussex was that they were too far out of the nearest town for her to go into it very often .
She has full - time carers but , still , it was always one hell of a palaver .
Now , they are more in the centre of things and she can get out and about without it being such a to - do .
" And she does like going out , " he says .

He is 78 , quite frail , and wearing a blue , pin-striped suit that hangs from his bony frame .
His hair consists of just a few fronds at the back , Mr Burns - style .
Still , he is wonderfully gentlemanly , opening doors and standing back to allow me to go through first , guiding me with a hand to the back , insisting he pays for our coffees and later reminding me to drink mine .
" Do n't lose your coffee , " he says .
His fellow Tory Steve Norris once described him as a " racist and homophobe " – but if he is then he is the most charming racist and homophobe I have ever met .
Seriously , I 've racked my brains and can't recall ever encountering a more charming one , or one that even stood me a coffee .
We sit at one of the Formica tables , where I thank him for my drink , and remind him to claim for it on expenses .
He laughs his thin , reedy laugh – " and what a thin , reedy laugh , Mrs Tebbit ! " – then says that no one in his day would have claimed for moat - cleaning or big TVs or flipped their houses or what have you .
" We always went by the rule that if you would n't be happy to read something about yourself on the front page of the Daily Mail tomorrow , then do n't do it .
But this bunch of boobies had even forgotten the Daily Mail test .
I think it 's because so few of them have any experience outside the Westminster village .
There is a big pot of money sloshing around , everyone helps themselves , no problem .
The peer pressure in my day was very different . "
I inform him that I have bought him a present .
He is excited about this .
" I love presents ! " he exclaims , practically clapping his hands , which seems a bit weird .
I 'd earlier popped into the parliamentary bookshop where I 'd bought him one of those little gift books they sell at the till , titled The Little Conservative Book , " with over 150 quotes to inspire the Tory faithful " .
It 's nothing to get that excited about , actually , and only £ 3.99 , but he seems happy to have it , and is happier still when I point out he is all of Page 83 with his quote about Neil Kinnock , which he reads out : " I wonder if Neil Kinnock exists at all , or he 's some plastic puppet squeezed into shape by his PR experts and trade union leaders , or whoever bullied him last . "
He follows this with a " Ha ! " and then a dry : " It could now be said about one or two others ... "
I also refer him , as anyone would , to page 153 , which quotes the cricketing metaphor from Geoffrey Howe 's 1990 resignation speech , the speech that did for Thatcher , more or less , and encapsulated his difficulties in working with her , particularly when it came to British negotiations in Europe .
I read it out to Lord Tebbit , which is cruel , but strangely fun , too .
The quote is : " It 's rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find , as the first balls are being bowled , that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain . "
Tebbit arches his eyebrows and then says : " Unfortunately , of course , the truth of the matter is that he [ Howe ] broke it himself because he wanted to play boules rather than cricket . "
I laugh .
He can be deliciously snide .
When I later ask if he was gobsmacked when he heard John Major had been carrying on with Edwina Currie , he says : " I just thought it was a wonderful illustration of mutual bad taste . "
Still , he only has nice things to say about Blair and Brown .
Only kidding .
He says : " I often defend Gordon Brown as being an essentially good man but wrong in every detail but with Blair I go quite biblical .
I go to Ecclesiastes .
He 's the poisoned vine which gives forth only poisoned fruit .
We 're advised it has to be rooted out and burned .
I look around now and I see nothing but poisoned fruit . "
I say that some people look at Thatcherism and see only poisoned fruit too .
Certainly , if my privatised train does n't turn up , all I see is poisoned fruit .
( And I wanted my kiddie to have milk at school ! )
He , though , wo n't have the Thatcher legacy tarnished .
" I think it 's more about what we did n't do than did , " he says .
" We did n't sort out welfare .
We did n't deal with the incipient failure of our schools .
We did n't deal with the health service .
Those were our principle shortcomings . "
Bloody hell , I say , what were you all doing all those years then ?
Suduko ?
He says that when Thatcher came in " Britain was a basket case and so we had to focus on the economy , and get that stable . "
I tell him he seems good with words , which he is pleased about .
He even says , a little pompously , " I have always regarded myself as a wordsmith . "
He then defines " wordsmith " : " We take the raw material , it 's all there in the Oxford English Dictionary , and shake it into something . "
Ah , now I know .
( Hey , two can play at this deliciously snide game ! )
Were you , I ask , a reader as a boy ?
" My mother , " he says , " once said I would read the label on the bottle of sauce on the table rather than sit without reading . "
He was born in Edmonton , north London , in 1931 .
His father , Leonard , who famously got on his bike to look for a job during the depression , worked variously in a pawnbrokers , a jewellery shop and ran a pub , while his mother , Edith , was a butcher 's daughter .
Did either of them read ?
" No , " he says .
So what was it with you ?
" I just emerged ... well ... "
Different ?
I suggest .
By way of reply , he tells me about being evacuated to Cardiff , along with his older brother , when he was eight .
" I was n't away for very long , " he says , " but I saw another hunk of the world that I 'd never seen before .
The couple on whom we were billeted were a comfortably off middle - class family with a nice detached house and a daily maid , which was a life I had n't known .
I think my brother and I were a little too much for them .
And we then moved on to a more ordinary family . "
So is this where you first saw you could " better " yourself ?
Is this where your Conservatism began ?
He says : " I was always very individualistic and never , in any way , a collectivist . "
He then adds : " I 'm not a joiner . "
And he does seem like something of a loner .
He left school at 16 and had worked at the Financial Times , served in the RAF and flown planes as a commercial pilot for BOAC before finally being elected as MP for Epping in 1970 .
I say it 's a bit different from , say , David Cameron 's pre-politics CV which probably reads : " Eton ... um , that 's it . "
He says : " I think Cameron is very much like Barack Obama .
He is very bright , very well - educated and is extremely gifted at PR , but without very much experience outside you do n't know , any more than the Americans knew when they elected Obama , quite what sort of leader he will be . "
What is your feeling ?
Do you think he has a principled core , at least ?
" In many ways , yes , but then one 's feelings are undermined by his aspiration to be seen as the heir to Blair – or , more recently , his remark that there is not a cigarette paper between the Conservative and Liberal parties .
What on earth was he smoking in that cigarette paper ? "
He 's always asked what he thinks of Cameron so , turning the tables rather , I ask what he thinks Cameron makes of him .
He says : " I 've had one private conversation with him , at my request , since he became leader and I have n't had a reply from him to the last three letters I 've written to him .
No , I did get one reply from a young man in his office which , if I 'd have been a sixth - form politics student , I would have thought a very interesting letter . "

This hurts , as it would hurt , if you 'd once been in the thick of it , as he was between 1979 and 1987 when he was Employment Secretary , then Trade and Industry Secretary and finally Tory party chairman .
What is your most abiding memory of being part of Thatcher 's government ?
" I remember that if I heard on the news in the morning of some event or another , I did n't have to ask myself what her reaction to that would be because she had a structure of belief which made it very easy to know . "
He thinks Heseltine brought her down , possibly more than Howe .
" Michael could n't stand the idea of working for a woman .
Just could n't get his mind round it .
He – a great big handsome alpha male – junior to this woman ! "
Yes , he still sees Thatcher , he says , and had lunch with her and Cecil Parkinson just last week .
In my mind 's eye , I can see the three of them , hogging the one comfy sofa in Starbucks , as certain people always do .
( How come I never get that comfy sofa ?
What do you have to do to become the sort of person who always gets the sofa ? )
And how did it go ?
I ask .
" Well , " he says .
" She and I both made the same terrible mistake . "
Ohmigod , I say .
You both wore the same outfit !
He laughs , reedily , then says no , that was n't it .
" It 's that we neglected to clone ourselves fifty years ago . "
Because that would mean you could meet today as young people again ?
" Yes , " he says .
" And I think if we were younger we'd both be able to do it all again . "
How is she now ?
" Some days she is on very good form and some days she is not so good , " is all he will say .
Parkinson 's resignation still rankles , by the way .
" We lost him because of his affair with his secretary whereas , these days , somebody like Prescott survives while having an affair in his office with his tax - payer - provided secretary . "
He is full of rage , I think .
Once
Thatcher was deposed , he would have stood for the leadership if he had n't promised his wife to retire from frontline politics to spend more time with her .
Does he regret not standing ?
He says it 's one of those questions that 's impossible to answer .
" Someone once asked me that if I 'd known what politics was going to cost myself and my wife , would I have still gone into it ?
To which my answer was : please tell me the alternative .
Was I going to be killed in an aircraft accident ?
Or was I going to meet my long - lost aunt in Australia who was going to tell me she was going to leave me a million pounds ?
You can't do it .
It 's what happened . "
The bomb was planted by the IRA in the Grand Hotel , Brighton , during the 1984 Tory party conference .
What , I ask Lord Tebbit , is your first memory of it ?
" Being woken by a bloody great bang and seeing the chandelier on the ceiling swinging wildly and feeling the bed being tipped over which , if you 're sober , is a pretty worrying experience . "
His and Margaret 's bed fell down through four floors but while he was protected by a mattress falling on top of him , she was not .
When , I ask , did the severity of her injuries become apparent ?
" It was n't until a day or so later that I knew how seriously injured she was .
The implications soak though rather gradually when you are still in a fairly muzzy state of shock . "
He still wakes in the night to turn her in bed so she does n't get bed sores , pushes her wheelchair , reads to her and helps her cut up her food when they go out to dinner .
I ask if he would ever entertain meeting Patrick Magee , the IRA man who planted the bomb and was jailed in 1985 but released in 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement .
I 'd read , I tell him , that in the interests of reconciliation , the daughter of Sir Anthony Berry , who was killed that night , had met him .
He says : " Oh yes , she is always going on about that . "
I take it you would n't then ?
" Not until he has repented and sought to atone for his crimes by , for example , giving evidence against those who instructed and paid him to commit murder .
When in church we confess and are given forgiveness , and it is on this basis that we repent .
It is not given on the basis that we defend and justify our sins . "
Are you a religious man ?
" Let 's just say I 'm a fellow traveller on the Christian bus . "
And , yes , it is very much a heterosexual bus .
He once remarked that no gay should be allowed to be Home Secretary because " I think it would be dangerous .
It would mean that somebody who has a clear minority interest at heart is legislating also for the 97 , 98 per cent who are not of that persuasion . "
Oh come , I say .
That 's crazy - man talk .
Michael Howard was Jewish and Home Secretary and he did n't legislate so that no one could buy retail until they 'd first checked out if Uncle Bernie knew someone who could get it cheap .
He says : " I take the view that in , for example , cases of adoption that a child is best brought up in a traditional family , and oppose the concept of adoption by homosexual couples of children . "
What about civil partnerships ?
" I did n't see the necessity for it .
All those things could be arranged between the parties .
People have often said to me that , if they were homosexuals , their rights were inferior to mine but that 's not so .
A homosexual has the right to marry a woman but he just does n't choose to . "
He is a dinosaur , I suppose , and I suspect it might be about deference : deference to his sexuality .
And his race .
I ask if he regrets his infamous " cricket test " – whether British citizens from ethnic minorities support , in a cricket match , England or their country of origin .
Not in the least , he says .
" It proves itself more and more valid .
The question asked was are you part of the country you have come to and are you looking forward with that country , or are you looking over your shoulder to where you came from ? "
So if , for some reason , you and your family had to flee to Saudi Arabia , you 'd put your daughter in a burka ?
You 'd let them chop her hand off if she were caught stealing ?
" If I took a Saudi Arabian passport and swore loyalty to the king and saw the destiny of my family as being in Saudi Arabia then , yes , I would adopt Saudi ways . "
He is a man of integrity in his way – true to his beliefs , loyal to his Margarets – but I do n't think we could ever seriously holiday together .
Even a spa mini - break might be a struggle .
I do try to get at his hinterland , and discover this much : he does n't watch TV , or films , and does n't even read books much any more .
However , he does like shooting , has written a game cookery book , and is currently writing a children 's book .
" It 's about a paraplegic boy and his help dog . "
He also likes to fume about Blair : " I do n't know what his true beliefs are but he obviously is in love with celebrity and , indeed , with money .
I do n't believe anybody who is not avaricious could become so extraordinarily rich in the way that he has .
It 's not as though he invented the internet or something like that . "
He then looks at his watch and says he must leave .
I walk him back to the lobby , and off he goes : a thin man , fat with rage .
But then he 's always been a thin man , fat with rage .
He may even have been born that way .
" ... such rage , Mrs Tebbit , such rage ! "
Corporation says it has ' no intention ' of charging – as Times and Sun owner News Corporation prepares to put up a paywall
The BBC has today said it has " no intention " of charging for online news , in a declaration that is unlikely to please James Murdoch and his father Rupert as they prepare to start charging for News Corporation content on the internet .
Sir Michael Lyons , the BBC Trust chairman , said the corporation has " no intention of diluting BBC commitment to universal access to free news online " as he outlined the areas director general Mark Thompson 's ongoing strategic review will cover .
The BBC 's internet news operations came under fire in August at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival from James Murdoch , chairman and chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia , who accused the corporation of " throttling " the market and preventing its competitors from launching or expanding their own services online .
News International , the News Corp subsidiary that owns the company 's British newspapers , including the Sun and the Times , is planning to start charging for its journalism online .
Lyons said today that the BBC Trust " recognises external concerns over scale and growth of BBC online operations " .
But he added : " Equally , it 's an immensely popular service with audiences and an important tool for the economy . "
Lyons said he wanted Thompson to ask what " licence fee payers really expect to get from their licence fee and what they might be surprised to see the BBC doing in the online world " .
He indicated that some areas , such as the iPlayer and news online , are safe when he asked : " Beyond the core offer of news , sport , education , children 's and the iPlayer , which parts of the online service are essential to the BBC 's mission and which could be stopped ? "
However , Lyons also questioned the future of content created for online that is not directly related to specific BBC programmes , asking , " where should the boundary be drawn " between this and " the online expression or extension of BBC programming " ?
Lyons also said the BBC Trust has asked Thompson to look at how the corporation should " serve all audiences " with " fresh and new " programmes , not a " diet of the predictable and comfortable " , while " nurturing home - grown talent ... across the full range of genres " .
Other questions include " does increased quality and distinctiveness come at a price ? " and how can the BBC be " more open " , both for " programme - makers and for audiences " .
Another concern expressed by the trust is that " if it spreads itself too thinly the BBC may lose focus on the core mission to provide fresh , new , high - quality content " .
The BBC is consulting its rivals about the strategic review , which was announced by Lyons in September , and Thompson is due to deliver his initial thoughts in the new year .
John McVay , the Pact chief executive , said : " Rather than making cuts in content , the BBC should look at its own fixed overheads and in - house capacity .
Looking to make cuts online and on - air is not the compact the BBC has with the licence fee payer . "

Of course , there have been people that look incredulous when I tell them I am building a wood lathe .
Some reasonably common responses : " Why the hell would you do that in this day and age " , and " they are so cheap from China , what a waist of your time " .
To me though , it seems completely sensible .
I like making stuff , and learning about how things work .
If I did n't love making things why would I want a wood lathe in the first place ?
Making something that helps you make other things is very satisfying , particularly if you do it in a way that uses all your creative ingenuity .
If you want to make something like this yourself , and you plan , as I did , to spend very little and to recycle other peoples landfill material , you certainly will have to think ' outside the box ' as you put materials and things to new and unintended uses .
Anyway enough babbling .
I hope you got something out of this instructable and look forward to any comments you might have .
Final inspirational quote from the famous mechanist Dave Gingery with a qualifier : take care and do n't be reckless ...
" It is interesting to note that most of our best ideas meet with opposition in our own minds as quickly as we conceive them .
The objections we raise usually seem so reasonable that much of what we might do never gets done .
If you do n't want to do a project just write down the first dozen or so thoughts that come to your mind and you will have at least a half dozen good excuses .
If that does n't do the trick just toss the idea to the experts and they will usually be happy to kill it for you .
If you really want to do it , though , it is most likely that you will find that it does not really cost very much and it is not nearly as technical and dangerous as established experts would have you believe . "

Holden 's readying a limited edition version of its Commodore SSV with Pontiac 's twin -nostril grille and hood scoops .
According to Australian sources , the special edition will be called the Commodore G8 SSV and be available as a sedan , ute and wagon !

Apparently , the move to stop the export program in the wake of GM 's bankruptcy and the killing off of the Pontiac brand has left a warehouse of parts once destined for cars to be exported to the US .
Holden 's marketing department — sensing an opportunity — has decided to use the stockpile on VE Commodores , which will be sold as a premium priced , limited edition Holden .
Brilliant !
Even better news is the special edition will apparently also be available as a ute and wagon !
GM had announced plans to bring over a G8 El Camino Sport Truck ST to the United States but then nixing those plans , along with even the idea of a wagon version of the Zeta - platformed RWD G8 .

Although there 's no official confirmation yet from Holden , the mere thought of the G8 surviving provides us some level of comfort — even if we 're not getting it here .
Frankly , the mere thought of a Pontiac El Camino vastly increases the likelihood we may have to move to Australia for some good ol ' fashioned muscle car hoonage !
Seriously , this is the best news we 've heard in weeks .
UPDATE : Aussie site carpoint 's reporting the following :
" It is unclear how many of each will be made , but dealer contacts have suggested it will be close to 1500 in total , or about 500 of each body style .
Prices of each limited edition model will be $ 1000 more than a regular SS V .
The Holden bulletin outlined to dealers the following : Pontiac G8 SS - V ute manual $ 47,490
Pontiac G8 SS -V sedan manual $ 55,290
Pontiac G8 SS - V wagon manual $ 57,290 "

Virtual Insanity : VR Treadmill Goes In Every Direction
Decades ago , we all thought that virtual reality would be the next big thing .
We envisioned big VR helmets and endless worlds that we could adventure through forever where all of our senses would be engaged .
There were some problems with our conception of VR , though , and it fell out of our collective future , mostly because of cost and technology constraints .
But quietly , in the background , companies are still developing virtual reality technology .
Just a few years ago , Sony filed a patent for technology that would allow a virtual world , complete with sounds and smells , to be projected directly into the brain .
And a European research project called Cyberwalk is working on another challenging aspect of the VR environment : locomotion .
The omni-directional treadmill called CyberCarpet created by Cyberwalk would revolutionize the way virtual reality is used for therapy , training , architecture and , eventually , gaming .
A traditional treadmill , of course , only moves in one direction .
Walking straight ahead at all times does n’t allow for full immersion in a virtual world .
Other solutions , such as a large sphere that the user manipulates from inside , have been proposed but are plagued with problems .
The omni-directional treadmill works by densely packing small balls under a walking surface and letting the friction of the user ’s shoes do the moving .
The kinks are still being worked out – namely stopping and starting – but based on the above video it looks like the CyberCarpet is in a pretty great place already .
The device has already been used to take a few lucky individuals on a virtual walk - through of ancient Pompeii .
Next stop ( we hope ) : Lawnmower Man - type virtual worlds .
Wait .
It gets worse .
A new report from the International Monetary Fund shows that the kind of recession we ’ve had , a recession caused by a financial crisis , often leads to long - term damage to a country ’s growth prospects .
“ The path of output tends to be depressed substantially and persistently following banking crises . ”
The same report , however , suggests that this is n’t inevitable : “ We find that a stronger short - term fiscal policy response ”  by which they mean a temporary increase in government spending  “ is significantly associated with smaller medium - term output losses . ”
So we should be doing much more than we are to promote economic recovery , not just because it would reduce our current pain , but also because it would improve our long - run prospects .
But can we afford to do more  to provide more aid to beleaguered state governments and the unemployed , to spend more on infrastructure , to provide tax credits to employers who create jobs ?
Yes , we can .
The conventional wisdom is that trying to help the economy now produces short - term gain at the expense of long - term pain .
But as I ’ve just pointed out , from the point of view of the nation as a whole that ’s not at all how it works .
The slump is doing long - term damage to our economy and society , and mitigating that slump will lead to a better future .
What is true is that spending more on recovery and reconstruction would worsen the government ’s own fiscal position .
But even there , conventional wisdom greatly overstates the case .
The true fiscal costs of supporting the economy are surprisingly small .
You see , spending money now means a stronger economy , both in the short run and in the long run .
And a stronger economy means more revenues , which offset a large fraction of the upfront cost .
Back - of - the - envelope calculations suggest that the offset falls short of 100 percent , so that fiscal stimulus is n’t a complete free lunch .
But it costs far less than you ’d think from listening to what passes for informed discussion .
Look , I know more stimulus is a hard sell politically .
But it ’s urgently needed .
The question should n’t be whether we can afford to do more to promote recovery .
It should be whether we can afford not to .
And the answer is no .

It is interesting to see new data being published regarding Option ARMs in the new OCC and OTS report .
According to the recently released report , there were 900,000 active Payment Option ARMs in the United States .
What is troubling about the current report is the performance of these loans .
Many of these loans are located in the depressed states of California and Florida that have dealt with record breaking budget problems .
These loans have the potential to once again destabilize the housing markets in these regions .
What is interesting to note about this report is that 1 out of 4 of the option ARMs are either in foreclosure or in serious delinquency .
The vast majority of these loans will not hit recast dates until 2010 yet the performance of these loans is already disastrous .
The difference between a recast and a reset is that a recast is a change in payment irrespective of a low interest rate .
Let us first look at their geographic location :
For the most part this mortgage problem will hit certain regions disproportionately .
75 percent of these loans are located in California , Florida , Nevada , and Arizona .
The data reported in the OCC and OTS report out on Wednesday falls in line with data provided by Fitch last month :
These loans are going bad and the problem with these loans is they do not qualify ( in most cases ) for the HAMP program for modifications .
The debt - to - income levels are too high and many of these loans are severely underwater .
What the data at times fails to acknowledge is the fact that many of these loans were piggybacked with second mortgages of equal repute .
For example , someone may have gotten an 80 % loan - to - value option ARM but on top of that , took a 10 year ARM second mortgage to cover the other 20 % .
This was extremely common during the bubble in California .
So let us look at this new option ARM data , the first time ever reported in the OCC and OTS data :
Let us examine the above .
In one year , you have seem problems for these loans double .
In June of 2008 6 % of option ARMs were seriously delinquent and 4.5 % were in foreclosure .
In June of 2009 15.2 % of these loans are seriously delinquent and 10 % are in some form of foreclosure .
Keep in mind that the vast majority of these loans do n’t hit recast dates until 2010 to 2012 !
That is , the inherent structural problems of these loans are still part of the future terms and these problems are occurring more because homeowners over stretched .
Add in recasts and you have a recipe for further disaster .
What can we take from the above data ?
That the vast majority of these option ARMs will become foreclosures .
This will further depress housing prices in states like California .
It is an interesting mix as well .
Many of these option ARMs were made to so - called prime borrowers :
“ New to this report are performance data on Payment Option ARMs .
Although Payment Option ARMs were made to prime borrowers in nearly the same percentage as the overall portfolio ( 64 % versus 68 % overall ) , the added risk characteristics and geographical concentration of these loans cause them to perform significantly worse than the overall portfolio . ”
Now is n’t that something ?
In terms of the proportion of prime borrowers , there is n’t much of a difference in terms of credit score but the overall risk is vastly different .
That is why we have seen the rise of the strategic default where homeowners who can make their payment purposely stop paying on their home .
Option ARMs fall under the Alt - A category .
Let us look at how loans are performing in the current market :
Every type of loan category is seeing delinquencies rise .
Why ?
This is on top of loan modifications and trillions backing the banking system .
The problem as we all know is that a loan modification has little significance if someone is dealing with job loss and rampant unemployment .
We are focusing on the wrong things .
Instead of looking at loan modifications and other programs that are failing miserably , we should spend the same considerable time examining new sectors of employment for the average American .
Yet the tunnel vision focus on helping mortgages is based on the reality that the banking sector relies on this as their cash flow stream .
They do n’t care how the average American pays their mortgage or even if they have the job .
They do n’t mind getting taxpayer bailouts or handouts as long as they get paid .
The option ARM is a toxic pariah on the system .
These loans never had any right of being in the market .
What we need to do is institute claw backs where those who made profits on this criminal product should have all their funds confiscated and property taken back .
It is funny how those on Wall Street raise their right hand and say , “ I promise never to do that again ” and get away with a decade of fraud .
This is like a bank robber being allowed to keep his stolen money after promising he will never be able to do it again .
We need to gut the system and claw back what was got in a criminal way .
Look at what is happening with Bernard Madoff .
What is not being said is how many people actually made money with his scheme .
Those early in the game made billions .
Lawyers are now going to claw back those gains .
We should apply the same to the banking and Wall Street sectors .
The fact that we have no strong movement on this front is troubling but also tells you who is running the show .

Hardy Schober ist einer der Eltern , die ein Kind beim Amoklauf von Winnenden verloren haben .
Heute ist er beim „ Aktionsbündnis Amoklauf Winnenden “ und dritter Vorsitzender des zugehörigen Fördervereins .
Schon während der Woche wurde die Aktion „ Familien gegen Killerspiele “ am heutigen Samstag in Stuttgart bekannt , bei der Eltern und Jugendliche ihre „ Killerspiele “ in einen Container werfen sollen , um sie anschließend zu verbrennen .
Versteht mich nicht falsch , alle Menschen die einen Angehörigen oder irgendeinen anderen Menschen , der ihnen wichtig ist , bei einer Gewalttat verlieren , haben mein tiefstes Mitgefühl .
Aber bei allem Verständnis , dieses Aktionsbündnis geht entschieden zu weit .
Nicht nur zeugt der Kampf gegen „ Killerspiele , die dazu dienen , Menschen zu ermorden “ von einem absoluten Unverständnis der Sachverhalte , dieser blinde und falsche Aktionismus greift auch auf die völlig falschen Mittel zurück .
Die erwähnte Sammelaktion ist von der Sache her nichts anderes als eine Bücherverbrennung , wie sie einst im Dritten Reich statt fand .
Ich musste mir heute schon mehrfach anhören , dass der Vergleich unangebracht ist , aber das ist er in keinster Weise .
Versteht mich nicht falsch , natürlich sind traumatisierte Eltern keine Faschisten , denn sie handeln ja aus ganz anderen Gründen , aber der Zweck heiligt einfach nicht die Mittel .
Das öffentliche Sammeln und anschließende Verbrennen von Kunstwerken ist einer Demokratie einfach nicht würdig , auch wenn man sie , aus welchen Gründen auch immer , nicht gutheißt .
Warum habe ich jetzt Herrn Schober eingangs nochmal gesondert erwähnt ?
Es liegt an einer Stellungsnahme die heute durch die Presse geistert und welche der SWR wohl am ausführlichsten zitert :
„ Sie haben unsere Aktion nicht verstanden .
Wir gehen nur gegen Killerspiele vor “ , kritisierte Hardy Schober vom Aktionsbündnis Winnenden .
Der Intellekt der Spieler sei nicht sehr hoch .
In Dutzenden von E - Mails war das Amoklauf - Bündnis deswegen angefeindet worden .
Schober hatte sich überlegt , für die Aktion einen privaten Sicherheitsdienst zu engagieren , weil es im Bündnis Bedenken wegen möglicher Übergriffe gebe .
Es seien mehr als 200 ablehnender Mails eingegangen .
Schober vermutet die Absender der Mails in der Computerspiel - Lobby .
Dieses Statement strotzt nur so von Ignoranz und Arroganz .
Den Intellekt des Gegenübers in Frage zu stellen ist unterste Schublade .
Und auch der Protest kommt nicht von der Lobby , sondern von Menschen , die es nicht akzeptieren wollen schon wieder in diese unsägliche Ecke gestellt zu werden .
Dass da einigen der Kragen platzt ist sicher nicht schön , aber auch nicht verwunderlich , wenn man ständig mit solchen Tiefschlägen traktiert wird .
Also lieber Herr Schober , Sie haben unser aller Mitgefühl , aber wenn sie nicht wollen , dass dieses Mitgefühl in Wut umschlägt , verlassen Sie Ihren Holzweg besser gestern als heute .
OSLO , Norway —
The first time I went to prison , it was to an idyllic place with lush woodland , bright - colored houses and the waters of the Oslo fjord sparkling in the summer sun .
It was July 2006 and I was visiting Bastoey , an open prison 45 miles south of the Norwegian capital .
It is home to about 115 detainees , including murderers , rapists and other felons , who enjoy activities not usually associated with prisons .
In summer , they can improve their backhand on the tennis court , ride a horse in the forest and hit the beach for a swim .
In winter , they can go cross-country skiing or participate in the prison 's ski-jumping competition .
Inmates work between 8:15 a.m. and 2:30 p.m .
The island is a farm , so there are cattle to tend , timber to cut and organic crops to grow .
Inmates also work at a sawmill , using axes , knives and saws .
Another job is to restore wooden houses dotted around the island .
Based on their time in Bastoey , many men will obtain professional qualifications .
After work , inmates retreat to their homes : comfortable wooden houses shared between four to six inmates .
Bastoey is based on the idea that traditional , repressive prisons do not work .
" The biggest mistake that our societies have made is to believe that you must punish hard to change criminals , " explained Oeyvind Alnaes , Bastoey 's then - prison governor .
" This is wrong .
The big closed prisons are criminal schools .
If you treat people badly , they will behave badly .
Anyone can be a citizen if we treat them well , respect them , and give them challenges and demands . "
Alnaes ' views reflect the way Norway and the rest of Scandinavia run their penal systems .
In Norway , there are no death sentences — or even life sentences .
The maximum jail term anyone can receive is 21 years , including for murder .
Most people will serve two - thirds of their term before being released .
Convicts retain the right to vote and can exercise it while in jail .
All inmates start their sentence in a traditional , closed prison .
These more secure facilities share some of the ills their American counterparts are known for , including high drug abuse , lack of education and job opportunities , which means most detainees spend 23 out of 24 hours locked in their cells .
Even so , the experience of closed prisons here is quite different from those of prisons abroad .
The second time I went to prison was in September , to a high - security detention facility in central Oslo .
I was there to meet Bjoernar Dahl , a 43 - year - old inmate who , a few days before , had been debating crime policy with the justice minister and an opposition politician , during a primetime television election debate .
The debate was broadcast live from inside the prison walls , in front of an audience of inmates and guards .
" It was high time the politicians came here to talk about crime policy , " said Dahl , who is serving a five - year sentence for complicity in smuggling amphetamines .
" This is about us , what happens in prisons and how we can return to society in a way that is beneficial to everyone . "
The show caused no outrage in Norway .
There were no headlines expressing shock that inmates could voice their opinions in public debate .
Nor was there condemnation of NRK , the Norwegian public broadcaster , for hosting a political debate inside a prison .
" There is a greater tendency to keep prisons open [ to the public ] so that people can see inmates as human beings they can identify with , " said Nils Christie , a professor of criminology at the University of Oslo .
That 's not to say that crime and punishment issues are uncontroversial in Norway .
The Progress party , the largest party in opposition , has for years called for tougher , longer sentences for perpetrators of violent crimes — a view that has now been adopted by the Labour - led government .
But overall , Norway is much less repressive than America is .
Norway has one of the lowest incarceration rates in Europe at 66 per 100,000 inhabitants , compared to 738 per 100,000 inhabitants in the U.S .
" When you listen to the justice minister , he generally emphasises the need for reintegration into society rather than the need for punishment , " Christie said .
" In Norway , there is more emphasis [ than in other countries ] on seeing prisons as part of normal society . "
Official policy suggests that inmates finish their sentence in an open prison like Bastoey , to ease their reintegration into society .
Another issue of debate , now solved with the addition of more cells , has been the long waiting time convicted criminals had to wait before going to prison , as Norway does not overcrowd its detention centers .
It could take months , sometimes years , before they could serve their sentences .
During that time many would be staying at home .
Editor 's note :
This story was updated to clarify two points about the debate over Norway 's penal system .

A new study provides " incontrovertible evidence " that the volcanic super - eruption of Toba on the island of Sumatra about 73,000 years ago deforested much of central India , some 3,000 miles from the epicenter , researchers report .
The volcano ejected an estimated 800 cubic kilometers of ash into the atmosphere , leaving a crater ( now the world 's largest volcanic lake ) that is 100 kilometers long and 35 kilometers wide .
Ash from the event has been found in India , the Indian Ocean , the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea .
The bright ash reflected sunlight off the landscape , and volcanic sulfur aerosols impeded solar radiation for six years , initiating an " Instant Ice Age " that -- according to evidence in ice cores taken in Greenland -- lasted about 1,800 years .
During this instant ice age , temperatures dropped by as much as 16 degrees centigrade ( 28 degrees Fahrenheit ) , said University of Illinois anthropology professor Stanley Ambrose , a principal investigator on the new study with professor Martin A.J. Williams , of the University of Adelaide .
Williams , who discovered a layer of Toba ash in central India in 1980 , led the research .
The climactic effects of Toba have been a source of controversy for years , as is its impact on human populations .
In 1998 , Ambrose proposed in the Journal of Human Evolution that the effects of the Toba eruption and the Ice Age that followed could explain the apparent bottleneck in human populations that geneticists believe occurred between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago .
The lack of genetic diversity among humans alive today suggests that during this time period humans came very close to becoming extinct .
To address the limited evidence of the terrestrial effects of Toba , Ambrose and his colleagues pursued two lines of research :
They analyzed pollen from a marine core in the Bay of Bengal that included a layer of ash from the Toba eruption , and they looked at carbon isotope ratios in fossil soil carbonates taken from directly above and below the Toba ash in three locations in central India .
Carbon isotopes reflect the type of vegetation that existed at a given locale and time .
Heavily forested regions leave carbon isotope fingerprints that are distinct from those of grasses or grassy woodlands .
Both lines of evidence revealed a distinct change in the type of vegetation in India immediately after the Toba eruption , the researchers report .
The pollen analysis indicated a shift to a " more open vegetation cover and reduced representation of ferns , particularly in the first 5 to 7 centimeters above the Toba ash , " they wrote in the journal Palaeogeography , Palaeoclimatology , Palaeoecology .
The change in vegetation and the loss of ferns , which grow best in humid conditions , they wrote , " would suggest significantly drier conditions in this region for at least one thousand years after the Toba eruption . "
The dryness probably also indicates a drop in temperature , Ambrose said , " because when you turn down the temperature you also turn down the rainfall . "
The carbon isotope analysis showed that forests covered central India when the eruption occurred , but wooded to open grassland predominated for at least 1,000 years after the eruption .
" This is unambiguous evidence that Toba caused deforestation in the tropics for a long time , " Ambrose said .
This disaster may have forced the ancestors of modern humans to adopt new cooperative strategies for survival that eventually permitted them to replace neandertals and other archaic human species , he said .

A river giant vanishes
One of the world 's largest freshwater fish is on the verge of going extinct .
A three - year quest to find the giant Chinese paddlefish in the Yangtze river failed to sight or catch a single individual .
That means that the fish , which can grow up to 7 m long , has not been seen alive for at least six years .
There remains a chance that some escaped the survey and survive , say experts , but without action , the future of the species is bleak .
The concern for the Chinese paddlefish is that its fate will parallel that of the Yangtze river dolphin , a large mammal species that was once abundant in the Yangtze river system , but has recently been declared extinct .
Some people call it the ' elephant fish ' and we found out it swims on the surface of the water like a whale
Professor Wei Qiwei
Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science
A number of fish species vie for the position of the world 's largest freshwater fish , including the arapaima ( Arapaima gigas ) of the Amazon river and the Mekong giant catfish ( Pangasianodon gigas ) .
At up to 7 m , the Chinese paddlefish ( Psephurus gladius ) is much longer than either , though it may not exclusively live in freshwater .
The fish is suspected to be anadromous , meaning it spends some of its life in marine waters before returning to the river to spawn .
But it is so rare that little is known about its behaviour , life history , migration habits and population structure .
It is endemic to the Yangtze river system in China .
" It has special characteristics such as its sword - like rostrum .
Some people call it the ' elephant fish ' and we found out it swims on the surface of the water like a whale , " says Professor Wei Qiwei , one of the leaders of the research team from the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science in Jingzhou , China .
The last confirmed sighting of a Chinese paddlefish was made in the river on 24 January 2003 .
Now scientists have published in the Journal of Applied Ichthyology the results of a three - year survey to find and locate the fish .
Professor Wei and colleagues surveyed the upper Yangtze river between Xinshi , Sichuan Province and Chongqing , covering a distance of 488.5 km .
Most of this stretch of water lies within the Upper Yangtze National Nature Reserve , a protected area .
Elusive target Between 2006 and 2008 , the team used a number of boats to deploy 4762 setlines , 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets in a bid to catch the fish .
They failed to catch a single individual .
The team also used hydroacoustic equipment that beams sound through the water to create a picture of the river and anything in it .
This identified nine possible targets , of which two could be paddlefish , say the researchers .
But they could not confirm these finds .
The fish now appears on the brink of extinction , say the scientists .
FRESHWATER GIANTS
Record - breaking freshwater fish ( weights not included if unknown ) : Mekong giant catfish 2.7 m , 293kg European or wels catfish 4.57 m , 336.3kg White sturgeon 3.8 m Amazon arapaima 2.48 m , 147kg Chinese paddlefish 7 m
They speculate that some paddlefish may have eluded the research team , avoiding its nets and capture methods .
Professor
Wei also thinks that some younger , smaller paddlefish may also still exist .
" The individuals born in the late 1980s and early 1990s should survive in the wild , since the Yangtze river system is large and it has some complicated habitats where the paddlefish could hide , " he says .
But without intervention , the future for the species is bleak .
" It is not a good future for the species .
Maybe we have only ten years to save the species according to the estimated life span of 30 to 40 years , " Professor Wei says .
" The offspring born in 1990 will be 30 years old by 2020 .
It is impossible for the species to be a viable population by natural reproduction .
With the current situation of ecology and environment in the Yangtze river , man assistant measures have to be taken . "
With so few fish left the team proposes that modern reproduction methods need to be considered , such as using surrogates to rear the fish in captivity .
Other techniques may include preserving genetic material , cloning , or gynogenesis , where fish eggs are coerced into developing via parthenogenesis .
However the team need to find live paddlefish in order to be able to start this process .
From the middle of last century the population of Chinese paddlefish has declined rapidly due to overfishing , habitat degradation and pollution .
The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 on the Yangtze river also created a barrier to the migrating fish which further affected fish stocks .
The species has been listed as critically endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 's Red List of Threatened Species since 1996 .
Last chance to find
The team believe the upper Yangtze is probably one of the last places that the fish may be present and propose to focus their efforts there .
They also hope to be in a position to act if any fish materialise on the river .
" In the last three years , we have been trying to set a quick - response network along the upper-stem of the Yangtze river to save accidental catches of the paddlefish , " Professor Wei says .
" However , the network not only costs money and time , but is also a great challenge . "

Even with " active shutter " 3D technology for television sets , the wearing of special glasses is still required in order to get the proper experience .
They are n't those red and blue or red and green 3D glasses that we are used to seeing from the 50s and 60s , but you still have to wear glasses .
Now , though , efforts are being made for a 3D television viewing experience without the glasses : the Full Parallax 3D TV .
The idea behind Hitachi's Full Parallex 3D TV is called integral photography with overlaid projection .
Tech - On ! describes the set up for this 3D television :
Specifically , it consists of 16 projectors and a lens array sheet to cover them .
The lens array sheet ensures parallax in any direction ( not only in the horizontal direction ) .
Because of parallax , the 3D image seen by the user differs in accordance with the angle from which the screen is viewed .
In order to get a display that does n't require special glasses of some kind , the total pixel count requires the multiplication of the pixel count in the 3D image by the number of viewpoints showing different images .
The 3D effect requires different viewpoints , but as the number of viewpoints increases , the resolution decreases .
Adding more projectors could solve the problem , and that is why the Parallax has so many projectors .
There are also efforts underway to increase the pixel count by using micro-projectors based on lasers , increasing the projector count by even more .
It is clear that efforts are being made to bring a more realistic experience to television viewers .
And , as technology advances , it becomes even more possible .

This work in flies will help understand how the human brain makes memories Laser - controlled flies may be the latest addition to the neuroscientist 's tool kit , thanks to a new technique .
Researchers have devised a way to write memories onto the brains of flies , revealing which brain cells are involved in making bad memories .
The researchers said that in flies just 12 brain cells were responsible for what is known as " associative learning " .
They describe their findings in the journal Cell .
Associative memories are made when an animal learns to link a cue to a particular outcome .
It might for example learn that a certain odour is a sign that a predator is nearby .
" So the appearance of that odour predicts that something bad is going to happen , " explained Gero Miesenbock from the University of Oxford , UK , who led this study .
Previous research had already identified that the brain cells or neurons responsible for this type of learning are those that produce dopamine .
This is a chemical which acts as a signal that can be transmitted from cell to cell in the brain .
Professor Miesenbock and his team " tapped into these gene regulatory mechanisms " of the neurons - programming them to respond to a laser .
A laser flash releases a chemical that activates the neurons
They modified the neurons by adding a sort of trigger , or receptor , to each one .
This receptor was activated by a chemical called ATP .
" Since there 's no ATP floating around in the fly 's brain , the [ modified ] receptors remain closed and the flies behave just like normal flies that do n't have the receptor , " said Professor Miesenbock .
Now for the laser - activated trickery .
The scientists injected ATP into the flies ' brains , in a form that was locked inside a light - sensitive chemical cage .
" [ Then ] we turned on the laser light and the light sensitive cage fell apart , " Professor Miesenbock explained .
" The ATP was released and acted only on the cells [ with ] the receptor . "
Memory circuit
The laser flash was paired with an odour , which allowed the scientists to find out if their memory - writing experiment had been successful .
They gave the flies a simple choice between two odours - one of which the flies had been exposed to just before the laser flash .
" [ The flies ] moved along a narrow chamber and at the midpoint they were presented with an odour on the left and an odour on the right , " said Professor Miesenbock .
He knew that the laser had successfully written a bad memory into the fly 's brain when the insect avoided the odour that had been paired with the laser flash .
This is a real breakthrough in our understanding of how memories are formed
David Shepherd , neuroscientist
The flies associated the smell with a bad experience , so the laser flash gave the fly a memory of a bad experience that it never actually had .
Simply by looking inside the flies ' brains with a microscope , the researchers were able to narrow this memory formation process down to just 12 neurons .
" We labelled the cells .... that were made responsive to light and which ones were not , so by elimination we could narrow it down . "
This finding , said Professor Miesenbock , has begun to unravel how animals and humans learn from mistakes and how " error signals " drive animals to adapt their behaviour .
" In the fly we have isolated and manipulated these error signals , so what we can now do is try to understand how these signals are calculated in the brain and how this works mechanistically .
" I have every expectation that the fundamental mechanisms that produce these error signals are the same in the brain of the fly as they are in the brain of the human .
David Shepherd , a neuroscientist from the University of Bangor in North Wales described the study as " a fantastic piece of work " .
Professor Shepherd , who was not involved in this study , told BBC News : " We have known for years that flies are capable of sophisticated behaviours such as learning and memory .
We have also been able to manipulate gene and cell function in flies .
" This work combines these elements to make a real breakthrough in our understanding of how memories are formed . "

This morning 's existing home sales number showed that sales surged in October by a surprising 10.1 % .
But new home sales continue to remain quite weak .
Today 's chart , showing the " distressing " gap between the two measures , comes courtesy of Calculated Risk , which explains :
The initial gap was caused by the flood of distressed sales .
This kept existing home sales elevated , and depressed new home sales since builders could n't compete with the low prices of all the foreclosed properties .
The recent spike in existing home sales was due primarily to the first time homebuyer tax credit .
But what matters for the economy - and jobs - is new home sales , and new home sales are still very low because of huge overhang of existing home inventory and rental properties .

Brother ; drive out power in yourself .
Never let it fascinate you ... – Nestor Makhno
The plow marked the moment when History first entered into geological time and humankind , once a single creation out of many , began to transform the forces of general life .
This is civilization – the old curse of Cain , first to till and kill , primal architect of cities , the father of that pathology known as ‘ Progress ’ .
If Anarchist John Zerzan has one wish in his new book , it is that we might wake from this nightmare of myth and History .
Wise children often ask their social science teachers :
Why do I have to learn this junk that does n’t matter ?
The teacher seldom has a good answer because the question is rarely understood :
Why must I learn theirjunk , theirHistory ; that is , the ghostly lessons of their wreckage .
Zerzan ’s latest collection of essays is entitled A People ’s History of Civilization and it will probably be met with the same derision from a self - satisfied Left which has dogged idealists even before Fourier .
The influence of utopians has always been an embarrassment , as if the inspired initial spark of a political project keeps raising its shrill orphan voice while the Parties have long since grown into maturity ( or senility ) and realpolitik ( or compromise ) .
The anarchic idea is ageless and perfect , “ an enthusiastic and Dionysian pessimism ” as Novatore has it ; it is necessarily outside of history , close to the uncanny spheres of obsession and dream .
But after the plowshare has been broken , dream - visions have usually been met with fixed bayonets from both sides .
Martyrdom is the only acceptable elite in anarchism .
Who Killed Ned Ludd ? , as the title of one of Zerzan ’s best pieces asks .
Look for the assassin at the feet of the Angel of History .
If agriculture was the original sin of History , the Fall was our descent into Symbolic forms which created a psychological removal best expressed by the use of artillery .
With the epoch of History proper , beginning with the Neolithic , internal abstractions are projected outwards onto a terra nullius , a void now dedicated to the manufacture of first commodities , the domestication of animals and conflict management , in terror of the silences of a world made ancient by representation and signs .
The great farming apparatus of this era mirrored institutionalized ritual and the codes of orthodox magic , which are the ancestors of surveillance technology and remote control .
Division of labor lead to the great land enclosures and the dawn of the money form , nascent surplus - value with its classes of guardians , warriors , magistrates , clerics .
Greek books were read in boustrophedon , which means ‘ after the action of an oxen plowing a field ’ , each line progressing and then reversing back in a bi-directional motion , equating the patterns of informational technology with the golden gizmo of sedentary humanity .
The subsequent Bronze Age saw pottery , the production of rich varieties of armaments , the complexities of credit and written script , and the formation of the great elites – and naturally , slavery .
Early statecraft was far more ‘ modern ’ than is commonly acknowledged : banking , proto - welfare , heated toilet seats , the wide application of credit and debt enslavement ( we have conveniently lost the custom of the Jubilee write - down ) , micro - breweries , were all part of the ancient world .
Zerzan sees our much - vaulted great leaps forward as merely rarified variations on a theme , but he follows these zigzags with penetration and a knack for devilled detail .
The other irruption into the natural world is that old monster , Time .
Zerzan rejects the picture of an unbroken continuum where all tributaries lead to an inviolable present , a comforting illusion which mirrors the artifice of irrigation systems and continues to haunt all ideologies .
The capitalist regimen of days reduces dynamism to the motors of production and psychology to an internal fateful machine ( it also allows our current Neoliberal ideologues to declare that all historical epochs are over ) .
With some reservations , Zerzan co-opts three rough historical eras from Spengler and Jaspers to chart the fairly abysmal record of human enlightenment .
After all , a good anarchist cannot totally dismiss the solemn judgment of Nihilism .
Yet Zerzan sees a constant spirit of revolt puncturing the gray impenetrable historical mass : revelatory and salvific moments , anarchies when ‘ the passion for destruction ’ and unlettered prophecy break through the chronologies of States .
His chapters on labor history are full of madcap millenarians , outré unionists , and the ‘ aristocracy ’ of damned refusal .
The much - maligned angry mobs of the Middle Ages , a period usually rendered as a vast darkness before the autocratic glory of the Renaissance , were not always witch - hunters and fanatics – many were intransigent partisans against monarchic cruelty and the despotism of the Church .
We can characterize Anarchic Time as a series of sudden raids into the Legal - Capital span , transversal lines used like a mocking sniper ’s sight at the colossus of History .
Despite his antagonism to much of the traditional Left , Zerzan shares two of Marx ’s voices : the polemical and the historic - analytical .
One of his main criticisms of Marx – or more properly , of Marxists – is that only the means of production are to be handed over the working class , not the means to fundamentally change or halt what is produced .
Even if all production were localized in people ’s democratic communes , metabolism between worker and land is never possible because the land is still seen as abject material .
This fatal mistake can only produce a resurgent bourgeoisie , soon back in charge again as both Bakunin and Trotsky wryly predicted .
Thus , the laws of the capitalist mode of production will inevitably return behind whatever cosmetic façade tragedy chooses to trade for farce .
There is also the question of Power ; or rather , the claim to Power .
Who would elect to be powerless in the face of the Beast ?
But , Pasolini : “ Nothing is more anarchic than power .
Power does what it wants and what it wants is totally arbitrary or dictated by its economic reasons which escape common logic . ”
Two possibilities , then ?
Careless , heedless resistance and the power of the refusal of old power ( the power of the doomed ? ) ; and the historically - commandeered application of Power , uncontrollable and fraught with unintended consequences , riddled with dialectical traps for both socialist and capitalist states .
And is the power of the State only able to be broken by another rival power ?
Can this rival power ever be rejected in turn , after it has smashed all the old statues ?
And if it cannot , then perhaps a reign of terror by the oppressed is always justified , necessary and righteous in its dark parody of unjust justice , an act of cleansing for the wretched of the earth ?
Are such questions even worth asking , as they hardly apply to the time - beside - time of anarchist revolution – or if they do , are they not equally applicable to the other political schools ?
Is not every revolutionary some kind of anarchist , but only before the Revolution ’s final victory ?
Still , as per Zerzan , the theory and practice of Power might itself be yet another hostile intrusion into humanity , just like the disciplines of History , Agriculture and Time .
Certainly , ideas of power run through historical processes – but they do not necessarily ordain destiny .
Perhaps they did not even create the past .
Power is not a thing but a relation between things , to use a little Marx .
It has its applications , its system of violence and peace , its doctors and its various schools , on every level of society .
Maybe we need an anti-education , like we need an anti-history .
Recent work on archeology and society , notably by David Graeber & David Wengrow here , indicates that Zerzan may be mistaken in his essential schema of agriculture - hierarchy - civilization ( as would be capitalists and authoritarians ) .
The ages of the earth now seem to weave in and out with a much more Lamarckian than Social Darwinist loom .
Technologies appeared and were rejected and did not necessarily follow each other automatically ; leadership at times existed only temporarily , then life fell back by season into egalitarianism ( this may be the ritual source of the sacralization of kings in Frazer ’s Golden Bough ) ; large communities existed in ‘ urban ’ environments , but seemed to have functioned in some cases as true decentralized soviets ; agrarian projects were maintained without the evolution of grain capital hordes ( and were abandoned when deemed unnecessary ) ; private property did not always arise out of mass farming and hunter - gatherers could prove more rigid and tiered than farmers .
Earlier epochs may have been more fluid and more able to sustain multiple ideas of culture than our own ; almost all we knew of them until now came from the speculations of various ideologues .
Yet this may be exactly where Zerzan ’s anarchic eruptions look back to , look forward to , both announce and recall , which makes his central hypothesis irrelevant and proves his argument against the fabrication known as History .
So he ends his book with a beautiful gloss on Benjamin ’s ninth thesis from Theses on the Philosophy of History ( 1940 ) , that mysterious and profound meditation at the twilight of irony , legend and lived life :
A messianic dimension is needed if history is to be redeemed , if a part of our happiness our ancestors could not have is to be validated .
To ‘ awaken the dead and make whole what has been smashed . ’
To unmask the paradigm of history and its fundamentally legitimizing enterprise .
Time and history ceaselessly advance all encompassing domination ; a rupture , a break is needed … a break with history .
We were conscripted into history and we must make our exit from it .
Zerzan notes a choice of targets by radicals in 1830 which may augur this escape : a clock tower .
Shoot out the Symbolic with the guns of the Real , then forward to the very Capital of Pain .
Avanti popolo , alla riscossa ...
Today Hillary Clinton has a chance to do what the BBC , most British newspapers and the rest of the political class have singularly failed to do : she can confront the Conservative party over its noxious new alliances in Europe .
When she meets William Hague in Washington she can ask him why the Tories now share a Brussels bed with far - right allies most Americans would consider beyond the pale .
As the Guardian reports today , pressure on the issue is building in the US .
If only we could say the same here .
Not that there 's been a shortage of information on either Michal Kaminski , the Polish politician who leads the new Conservatives and Reformists grouping in which the Tories sit , or its Latvian affiliate , the For Fatherland and Freedom party .
We have heard Kaminski first deny , and then admit , that he wore an infamous fascist and antisemitic symbol .
We have heard him explain that Poles should apologise for the horrific 1941 pogrom at Jedwabne only once the Jews have apologised for all that they inflicted on the Poles .
We know that he began his political journey in a neo -Nazi organisation .
As for Latvia , no one can claim not to know that the Tories ' new allies are prime movers behind the annual parades which celebrate the Latvian legion of the Waffen - SS – a band of brothers that included men who roamed the country gunning down Jewish men , women and children in their tens of thousands .
For Fatherland and Freedom admire the Waffen - SS so much , they tried to get its veterans rewarded with a military pension – a move too far even for Latvia 's other nationalist parties .
We know all this , yet where is the outrage ?
Where is the revulsion at David Cameron becoming partners with men who cheer those who fought for Hitler and against Churchill ?
The Guardian , the Observer , the New Statesman and now the Jewish Chronicle have been shining a light in this dark corner , but from the rest of the media there has been little more than silence .
How to explain this ?
Politics provides a small answer , in every sense .
People can sense that power is shifting to the Conservatives , and many are anxious not to offend the new masters .
But two larger explanations are possible .
First , Kaminski and the Latvians are merely the tip of a large and ugly iceberg , one that has itself been ignored for several years .
It 's become bad form to mention it , because we are meant to be friendly towards the newest members of the European Union .
But the truth is that several of these " emerging democracies " have reverted to a brand of ultra-nationalistic politics that would repel most voters in western Europe .
It exists in Poland and Latvia , but also Lithuania , Estonia , Hungary , Romania and beyond .
During the long decades of the Soviet era this chauvinistic , often racially supremacist politics was buried ; but in 1989 it was exhumed , shook off the dirt , and breathed once more .
It shows itself in two ways .
One is in a loathing for those deemed " other " .
Sometimes that 's Roma people , often it 's Jews .
And this is not in the past , but the immediate present .
Just this month Oszkar Molnar , an MP from Hungary 's main opposition party – on course to form the country 's next government – told a TV interviewer that " global capital – Jewish capital , if you like – wants to devour the entire world , especially Hungary " .
His party leader said there was no need to discipline him because he'd broken no rules .
But the more obvious manifestation of this old - new nationalism is its desire to rewrite recent history .
Steadily , eastern European governments have sought to craft a new , internationally accepted narrative in which the crimes of Nazism and Stalinism are regarded as equal , with , if anything , the latter as the greater evil .
It is the theory of the " double genocide " , and it manifests itself in places like the Vilnius Museum of Genocide Victims which lingers on the 74,500 Lithuanians who suffered under Moscow rule but dedicates no exhibit to the 200,000 Jews murdered by their fellow Lithuanians in the 1940s .
When the state prosecutor decided to chase up those guilty of war crimes from that period , he promptly investigated a quartet of Jewish survivors of the ghettoes who had escaped to fight the Nazis as partisans .
This is not the work of extremist parties on the lunatic fringe .
The " International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania " – whose very name implies moral equivalence and which omits the actions of Lithuanians themselves – sits inside the prime minister 's office .
The motive is not hard to fathom .
These are ultra-nationalists who want to clean up their past , recasting themselves as victims – and forgetting the years in which their forebears were , in fact , the bloodiest perpetrators .
Remember : the killing rate in the Baltics was among the highest in Europe ; the percentage of Jews murdered was in the mid to high nineties .
Sadly , none of this really figured as we contemplated EU enlargement in 2004 .
We ushered in these new states without properly checking their baggage .
They were pro-American and signed up for the " war on terror " and , for many on the right , that was good enough .
That blind eye has continued .
In July , the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe , which includes Britain , the US and Canada , issued a Vilnius declaration including much of this " double genocide " language .
" The western mainstream has been tricked , " says Prof Dovid Katz of Vilnius University , who after official pressure was forced to teach his truthful account of the Holocaust in students ' homes this summer rather than on campus .
Which leaves that second explanation for our blindness .
It 's easy to imagine that the place of the Holocaust is almost sacred .
It is taught in schools and has a national memorial day .
It is , we imagine , a rare moral absolute in our secular age .
But that 's in the abstract .
When it becomes concrete , a real event committed by real people , suddenly we become hazy .
" It was all a long time ago , " the Tories say when confronted .
" It was terribly complicated . "
Or , as Ken Clarke put it , airily brushing aside concerns about the party 's EU chums : " It 's all an anorak issue . "
It seems we care about the Holocaust when we imagine it as an episode of historical science fiction , in which faceless " Nazis " belonging to no time and no place staged a terrifying horror show .
But when anyone tries to anchor it in the real , to say that this happened in this place , with the enthusiastic participation of these people , polite company mumbles an excuse and shuffles for the exit .
Surely , by any moral standard , we cannot let this assault on historical truth stand .
We owe at least that to the victims .
If nothing more , it means demanding that the man set to be our prime minister ditch his friends in Europe – and find some new ones .
The strange thing is , I always knew that one day , when every last survivor was gone , there would be " debate " about the Holocaust .
Claims that were once deemed shameful – questioning the veracity of documented events – would become somehow acceptable .
But I never imagined that I would live to see that grim day for myself .
Yet here it is : right here , right now .
Her text message arrived about 6 pm .
“ Is there n e way u can drop me some food ?
We ’re at Tatum and Shea so we are close .
Just no place to stay or food money .
If u cant that ’s fine ”
It was monsoon season .
A storm was coming and I was just getting in the car to drive her brother to a concert .
I figured I ’d be back home in an hour .
I ’d pick them up and take them to a pizza place where we could sit down and eat .
I ’d assess the situation over dinner .
The last time I spoke with her was two weeks ago when I visited her in the psych ward .
The next day she checked herself out .
A social worker called on the doctor ’s behalf to ask if I thought she might harm herself or anyone else .
” I do n’t really know , ” I heard myself say .
My daughter is mentally ill .
She is a heroin addict .
And she is more than that .
She ’s creative , strong - willed , kind , generous and protective of others ; she ’s a math whiz with a love of bright clothes and shiny accessories .
Just 18 , she has already been through five rehabilitation programs .
Her most recent one lasted over a year and cost the equivalent of a private undergraduate education .
When she came home she enrolled in a community college .
Her father and I were never so happy to write a tuition check .
Her brother went with her to scope out the campus and her sister , who is away at school , put her anger aside , to wish her good luck .
We were all so hopeful .
The “ we ” she refers to in her text is her 22 year - old , mentally - ill , heroin - addicted , felon boyfriend .
He too , is more than the labels I ’ve assigned him .
They were living together , in what can only be described as squalor , until the lease was up .
Now , they are homeless .
Back in my home , I look through the cupboards and in the fridge : cereal , crackers , apples , a banana , a half jar of capers .
Capers for the homeless .
Every Sunday , I pass the large food collection box in the lobby of the church I attend .
The community is affluent and generous .
The box fills up weekly with macaroni , canned tuna , peanut butter , stuffing mix and the like .
But every now and then , there is a truly curious donation : capers , pate , spiced almonds or a tube of marzipan .
*
What gives ?
Are there people who think , “ You know who I bet would love these spiced almonds ?
The guys down at the homeless shelter .
The salt ’s so good for them .
Helps them retain water , keeps them from getting dehydrated in the summer heat . ”
( But that package is tiny .
It would barely make a snack for one person . )
“ Those people at the shelter know who could use a nice pack of peanuts .
They ’ll get it to the right person . ”
And about those capers , does someone imagine that a jar of capers would be just the thing to “ give the soup kitchen macaroni and cheese a lift . ”
I say this to a woman I hardly know but who happens to be standing near the donation box .
She defends the caper - givers .
“ You know , ” she says from her high - horse , “ just because they are homeless does n’t mean they do n’t have refined palates or that they would n’t appreciate something different . ”
“ Touché , in a Donna Reed way , ” I say smiling .
But inside , I ’ll have none of it .
I imagine it this way :
Preparing to escape the Arizona heat and head to their summer home in Nantucket , Mary & Nigel are cleaning out the cupboards .
“ Put anything the kids might like in this box , ” Mary says , “ food for the shelter in that one .
We ’ll throw the rest away . ”
“ Do the kids like capers ? ”
“ No , besides those have probably expired . ”
“ When did we get them ? ”
“ Oh , I think they came in one of the Schmidt ’s Christmas baskets .
About five years ago !
Throw them out . ”
“ No .
I ’m going to give them to the homeless .
That and the pate and all the other crap people send us that we will never eat . ”
“ Really , they ’re old , throw them out .
Besides , the people at the shelter do n’t want capers and pate . ”
“ Well , they should want capers and pate .
In fact , they should be exceedingly happy with whatever they get .
Where ’s that tube of marzipan ? ”
Roast Chicken with Caper Sauce 1 whole 3 - 4 lb. chicken
4 - 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter
Salt and pepper
1 small lemon
1 small onion
1 jar of capers ( optional ) Preheat oven to 475 F .
Remove innards from chicken cavity , rinse chicken inside & out and pat fully dry .
Rub 2 - 4 Tblsp. of butter inside and out of chicken .
Sprinkle salt on chicken , inside and out ; then a little pepper .
Cut lemon & onion in half and place inside cavity .
Place chicken , breast side down , in a V - shaped rack in a roasting pan .
Cook for 20 minutes then turn breast side up .
Baste with pan juices .
Cook 6 - 8 minutes and repeat until skin is nicely browned .
Then , turn oven down to 350 F .
Chicken is done when internal thigh temperature reaches 170 F .
Let chicken sit 5 minutes before carving .
Optional capers sauce :
Pour pan juices into a clear measuring cup & remove most of fat .
Return to medium heat .
Add capers and 2 Tblsp. butter .
When warm ( 2 - 3 minutes ) drizzle over sliced chicken .
*
I put the capers back on the shelf and fill two plastic bags with crackers , apples , peanut butter , bread , cereal and bottled water .
By the time I ’m ready to go , the monsoon is howling .
I go to the closet and find two raincoats .
Out of kindness and loyalty , a friend asks if she should come along .
She does n’t want to and I know it .
“ No need to drag you into this , ” I say .
She is relieved and in an uncharacteristic flood of words , she explains why .
It boils down to this ; it ’s uncomfortable , very uncomfortable .
She does n’t know what to say or do .
I understand but I feel sad .
I want my friends to be willing to tolerate the discomfort and treat this daughter the same way they treat my other one .
I know it is too much to ask .
I ca n’t even do it myself .
I ’m coming , I text her , where exactly are you ?
At Albertson’s .
Thks mom , we havn’t eaten in 2 dys .
The rains have flooded the streets .
It ’s dark out but I see them .
They are under the overhang that protects the shopping carts .
The cart closest to them is filled with bulging plastic bags .
I see someone who looks like he could be an assistant manager coming out of the store .
He ’s twenty - something .
He is wearing a white button - down shirt and dark slacks .
I brace myself for what I imagine will be their eviction .
But he is handing them something .
My daughter dashes toward the car .
She has lost more weight .
“ Hi Momma , ” she says in a cheery voice .
“ That guy just gave us a chicken .
You know the kind they roast in the store . ”
I feel a rush of gratitude .
That young man , with a job and an education and every reason to ignore them or shoo them away from his store , chose instead to give them a chicken .
I want to grab him and thank him .
His kindness pierces me .
My eyes tear up .
I catch my breath .
Roast chicken , the quintessential comfort food — how perfect !
“ How nice , ” I manage .
“ Hop in the car , I ’ll take you guys somewhere dry for dinner . ”
“ We ca n’t mom .
We have too many bags to try to load up and carry around in this rain .
Did you bring any food ? ”
I give her the two bags and the two raincoats .
“ Oh thanks , C is going to be really happy about these raincoats . ”
I glance over and see C pacing and smoking .
She makes a move to leave .
I ca n’t stop myself .
Instead of grabbing her and hugging her , I say , “ When are you going to get your act together ?
This is no way to live . ”
“ I know , Mom , but this is my life right now , I just need to deal with it . ”
It is hard not to admire her moxie .
We are in Phoenix .

Mac sales saw double - digit growth in the third quarter of 2009 , maintaining Apple 's position as the fourth - largest U.S. PC manufacturer , according to new data released Wednesday from IDC .
IDC
Overall , Apple came in fourth for U.S. vendors , selling an estimated 1.64 million Macs stateside during the frame .
That 's up 11.8 percent from the 1.47 million the company sold in the same frame one year prior .
Last quarter , IDC reported that Apple shipped 1.2 million computers in the U.S. , a year - over - year decline of 12.4 percent .
That was good for a 7.6 percent stateside market share , in terms of shipments .
Overall , the U.S. PC market grew an estimated 2.5 percent .
The bulk of that came from portable machines , as netbooks continue to grow in popularity , IDC said .
In the U.S. in particular , consumers gravitated toward low - cost machines to save money on back to school purchases .
" Despite a continuing mix of gloom and caution on the economic front , the PC market continues to rebound quickly , " said Loren Loverde , program director for IDC's Tracker Program .
" The competitive landscape , including transition to portables , new and low - power designs , growth in retail and consumer segments , and the impact of falling prices are reflected in the gains by HP and Acer , as well as overall market growth . "
Leading the domestic pack was HP , which held a 25.5 percent market share with 4.47 million PCs shipped .
Close on its heels was Dell , which took 25 percent of the market , but was down 13.4 percent from a year prior .
The second - largest computer maker sold 4.37 million units .
In third was Acer , which achieved staggering year - over - year growth of 48.3 percent .
The netbook maker shipped an estimated 1.95 million units to take an 11.1 percent share of the US market , up from 1.31 million units during the year - ago quarter .
Behind Apple , in fifth place , was Toshiba , which shipped 1.43 million units during the frame , good for an 8.1 percent share .
All other PC manufacturers combined accounted for 20.9 percent , with 3.66 million units shipped .

In all , 17.5 million PCs were shipped in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2009 .
Worldwide , the top vendor was again HP , with 15.79 total million units shipped , giving it a 20.2 percent share .
Acer 's strong quarter propelled it to No. 2 , moving 11 million units , a 25.6 percent increase from last year .
Dell , Lenovo and Toshiba rounded out the top five globally .
Total worldwide PC shipments grew 2.3 percent year over year during the third quarter , to 78.1 million units .
It was a positive result worldwide , as all regions either met or exceeded expectations , with the exception of Japan .

" The continued strength of both the US and worldwide PC business in the face of difficult economic environments underscores the value that both consumer and corporate buyers place on PCs , " said to Bob Oâ Donnell , vice president , Clients and Displays .
" With the forthcoming launch of Windows 7 and expected commercial refresh beginning in 2010 , the prospects for future PC market growth are very solid . "
Gartner
Market research firm Gartner also released its preliminary sales figures Wednesday .
Their totals also placed Apple as the fourth - largest U.S. PC maker , but with overall slightly lower numbers .
Gartner estimated that Apple sold 1.57 million Macs during the third quarter stateside , good for an 8.8 percent market share .
That amounts to a year - over - year increase of 6.8 percent .
Last quarter , the firm said Apple had an 8.7 percent share of the U.S. computer market , moving 1.42 million total Macs in America .
In Gartner 's estimate , Dell was the top domestic PC maker in the third quarter , with a 26.2 percent share of sales .
The company shipped an estimated 4.67 PCs during the frame , off 8.9 percent from a year prior .
HP came in second , with a 25.7 percent share and 4.57 PCs shipped .
That 's a 2.7 percent increase from the third quarter of 2008 .
The firm also recorded Acer 's explosive growth , with the company growing 61.4 percent year - over year to ship 2.5 million machines in the U.S. in the September quarter .
Acer , in third , as 13.9 percent of the domestic market .
Coming in fifth stateside was Toshiba , selling 1.4 million machines good for an 8 percent share .
Overall , sales increased in the U.S. 3.9 percent , with 17.81 million PCs shipped .

" The consumer mobile PC market drove U.S. shipment growth in the third quarter of 2009 , fueled by back to school sales , " said Mikako Kitagawa , principal analyst at Gartner .
" However , the results came with a revenue loss because of very steep declines in average selling prices ( ASPs ) .
Consumers were comfortable buying PCs , but they were relentlessly looking for bargains .
Our preliminary research shows consumer mobile PC ASPs declined more than 20 percent compared to a year ago . "
Globally , the firm estimated a small 0.5 percent growth , with 80.86 million total PCs shipped .
HP was the top global producer , with 16.12 million of those , good for a 19.9 percent overall share .
HP 's share in the third quarter grew 9 percent year over year .
Shipping 12.48 million units during the frame was second - place Acer , which grew 23.6 percent worldwide from a year before .
In third , fourth and fifth , respectively , were Dell , Lenovo and Toshiba .

Gartner has predicted that the launch of Windows 7 will not have a major impact on future growth of PC sales .
However , inventory adjustments could skew shipment totals higher .

John Ortved ’s The Simpsons : An Uncensored , Unauthorized History more than lives up to its billing .
Through direct interviews or newspaper and magazine reports going back two decades , Ortved serves up plenty of dish on the making of television ’s longest running sitcom — not to mention its cultural impact , the fights over who deserves proper credit ( and sizable cash payouts on a several - billion - dollar franchise that has made creator Matt Groening a very , very rich man ) and why the show attracted some of the brightest , craziest writers in the business .
Ortved ’s chewy oral history serves up a plethora of mind - blowing and fascinating information , such as :
1. Nancy Cartwright originally auditioned for the part of Lisa , but when she saw the mockup for what Bart was supposed to look like , she uttered “ Oh man , yeah ! ” in a voice not far removed from one she ’d used for The Snorks , an animated children ’s show that had recently finished airing .
Groening heard Cartwright and shouted , “ that ’s exactly it , that ’s Bart ! ”
2 . The Simpsons has made fun of religions and ethnicities of all stripes , but one they wo n’t touch is Scientology — because Cartwright is a card - carrying member .
So much so that in 2009 , she made robo-calls on behalf of the organization in Bart Simpson ’s voice , which made current ( and past ) showrunner Al Jean hit the roof because Fox owns the rights to Bart ’s voice .
Eventually Cartwright gave up on the robo-calls .
3. John Swartzwelder , one of the members of the show ’s legendary original writers room , was credited with more scripts — 59 — than any other staffer .
His anarchic sense of humor and reclusive ways ( he ’s never granted an interview ) emphasized his enigmatic status , even among his co-workers .
Swartzwelder stopped writing for The Simpsons in 2004 and now writes novels like The Exploding Detective and The Time Machine Did It , which he distributes through his own company , Kennydale Books .
4 . The Simpsons was almost grounded before it ever began .
The lag time between script and animation is between six and eight months , in part because the grunt work was outsourced to South Korea .
When the first episode came back , the verdict from Brooks , Groening , Simon and the Fox network heads was unanimous : “ awful ” , “ unfilmable ” and a waste of the hundreds of thousands of dollars it cost to produce .
( Even Jim Brooks recalled thinking that the show was in serious trouble because “ you could n’t call the emperor anything but naked at that moment . ” )
They managed to salvage the episode by airing it later and pushing back the premiere date so that another script could be filmed — much more successfully .
5. Sam Simon , the showrunner for the first three seasons and considered to be the unsung genius who put James L. Brooks ’ production and Matt Groening ’s creation into day - to - day brilliance , was married to actress Jennifer Tilly from 1984 to 1991 .
The exes are still friends and still share a love of Texas Hold ‘ Em Poker ( Tilly won the third World Poker Tour Ladies Invitational Tournament in 2005 , and Simon has placed well in his outings . )
6 . The person responsible for the Simpsons ’ signature color design — yellow skin , Marge ’s blue hair — was Gyorgyi Peluce , a Hungarian émigré who worked for Klasky - Csupo , the animation company that worked on the show for the first three seasons .
Peluce ’s rationale : “ I wanted to give them a color that did n’t look like anything else that had come before . ”
7. Both Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner ( who voice Homer and Marge , respectively ) started off as regulars on the Tracey Ullman Show , the variety show where The Simpsons got its start as one - minute segments .
Marge ’s rasp , by the way , is Kavner ’s normal voice , almost uninflected .
8. “ Do the Bartman ” , the 1990 song that became a monster hit in The Simpsons ’ first season , was co-written and co-produced by Michael Jackson .
The late entertainer had a couple of cameos on the show , most notably as a mental patient who thinks he ’s Michael Jackson ( interestingly , when the character sings a part of “ Man in the Mirror ” , it ’s actually a Jackson stand - in , not Jackson himself . )
9 . The writers ’ room has been predominantly made up of Ivy Leaguers , especially those who cut their college teeth on The Harvard Lampoon .
Conan O’Brien ( who wrote for the show from 1991 - 1993 ) is the most famous , but other Lampoon alumni include Josh Weinstein & Bill Oakley , who became showrunners for the sixth season .
10 .
Merchandising revenues from the first year of The Simpsons were estimated to be $ 750 million — outpaced only by New Kids on the Block and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .
There were t- shirts with classic
Bart slogans , bubble gum , snow boots , notebooks , underwear , even Simpsons pasta .
And of course , Butterfinger used the Simpsons as their spokespeople ( “ you do n’t lay a finger on my Butterfinger . ” )
Unless other facts emerge , the NFL is not expected to discipline Oakland Raiders coach Tom Cable for the assault allegations that a former wife and girlfriend levied against him , a league source has said .
However , the league has directed Cable into a clinical evaluation process to determine whether further action is necessary due to conditions such as anger management or substance abuse .
Historically , the NFL has not disciplined people when law enforcement has studied the incident and determined there is not enough evidence to proceed with the case .
In the case of the alleged assaults against women previously in his life , no charges were filed against Cable , nor were any civil cases brought against him .
What 's notable about this is that legal experts said California is protective of its complaining witnesses and has an extremely low tolerance level for domestic abuse .
Meanwhile , a source close to former Raiders assistant Randy Hanson told ESPN 's Bob Ley on Monday that Hanson has not been contacted by anyone from the NFL office or NFL security regarding Hanson 's training camp incident with Raiders coach Tom Cable .
Napa County district attorney Gary Lieberstein said last month he would not pursue charges against Cable for allegedly breaking Hanson 's jaw in August , citing inconsistencies in Hanson 's story that were not corroborated by the three assistant coaches in the room at the time .

It ’s often easy to forget in this day and age of high definition graphics and 5.1 surround sound that Role Playing Games made their meager start with a pencil , paper and dice .
BioWare certainly knows this heritage , with the Baldur ’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights series closely following the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set .
That AD&D lineage runs strong in Dragon Age : Origins , which weaves an epic tale of loyalty , corruption , intrigue , and some kick ass combat .
The Kingdom of Ferelden is in a period of civil war , and the hero is forced by fate to serve with the Grey Wardens .
It is the Wardens ’ mission to protect the kingdom from the evil forces of the Arch Demon .
Armies of Darkspawn , lead by the Arch Demon , are poised to wreak havoc across the lands .
As the tale unfolds , the hero must unite a kingdom rife with political discourse and tyranny to defeat the forces of evil .
The tale begins by having the player select one of six backgrounds for the hero : Human Noble , Magi ( Human or Elf ) , City Elf , Dalish Elf , Dwarf Commander and Dwarf Noble .
The hero ’s name , gender , voice , appearance and attributes can all be customized .
Many cosmetic attributes can be fine tuned to alter the hero ’s appearance .
Gameplay - affecting attributes are comprised of Strength , Dexterity , Willpower , Magic , Cunning and Constitution .
The land of Ferelden features three major classes : Warrior , Mage and Rogue , with four specialties per class .
A Warrior can be a Berserker , Champion , Templar or Reaver .
Mages can fine - tune their craft as an Arcane Warrior , Blood Mage , Shape Shifter or Spirit Healer .
Rogues have the ability to specialize as an Assassin , Bard , Duelist or Ranger .
Depending on the attributes chosen , it is possible to have more than one specialty .
In addition to the class and race benefits , there are various talents , skills and spells suited for each specialty .
Each background includes a unique starting place for the story .
The beginning stages are quite rudimentary in scope but provide an appropriate backdrop to introduce the game ’s basic mechanics .
The menu system can be a bit cumbersome for newcomers , but it offers a variety of options for the journeyman .
Regularly used items , talents , and spells can mapped to the top three face buttons .
The remapped buttons come in quite handy for combat as well as often used items and talents .
Once the background is established , Dragon Age fits it seamlessly into its story .
Much of the story content will take place in dialog cutscenes .
The voice acting is done quite well considering just how much of it there is .
As conversations unfold , there are dialog options which result in consequences , for better or worse .
The dialog system truly turns this into a “ choose your own adventure , ” when dealing with tasks and missions , and there is weight to the choices made .
Frequent saves are advised if the player is seeking certain results .
As the story progresses , the fate of Ferelden changes based on the player ’s decisions , and there are plot twists along the way that effect alliances with various tribes , creeds , and kingdoms .
This brings a sense of value to the story , and it never becomes only about leveling up .
Level grinding is not a necessity , as there is plenty of combat to be had within the scope of the story .

October 2009
1. Western Sahara ( the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic ) is located in northwest Africa and covers an area of 266,000 square kilometres .
It is bordered by Morocco to the north , Algeria to the northeast and Mauritania to the East and southeast and has a 1,200 - kilometre - long Atlantic Ocean coastline .
The Saharawi Republic was proclaimed on 27 February 1976 ; its capital is El Aaiún .
2 . In the pre-colonial times , the Saharawis lived as one independent community and developed their own cultural forms of expression and socio-political organisations ; it was these idiosyncratic elements that constituted the distinctiveness of the Saharawi society over the centuries .
The Saharawi are known for being a tolerant , open and peaceful society that has never been involved in any form of political or religious extremism .
3. Western Sahara is the last African decolonisation case in the agenda of the United Nations Africa , and it has been on the UN list of the Special Committee of 24 since 1963 when it was under Spanish colonial rule .
The United Nations General Assembly has since consistently recognised the inalienable right of the Saharawi people to self - determination and independence , and called for the exercise of that right in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 1514 ( XV ) containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples .
4 . It was in this context that the UN repeatedly called on Spain , the administering power of Western Sahara , to decolonise the territory by means of organising a self - determination referendum for its people .
Spain , however , failed to assume its responsibilities , and instead handed over the territory to both Morocco and Mauritania that militarily invaded and occupied the territory in 1975 .
The occupation was in contradiction of numerous UN resolutions and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) .
The historic ruling of the ICJ , issued on 16 October 1975 , affirmed unequivocally that :
“ The materials and information presented to it [ the Court ] do not establish any tie of territorial sovereignty between the territory of Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco or the Mauritanian entity .
Thus the Court has not found legal ties of such a nature as might affect the application of General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) in the decolonisation of Western Sahara and , in particular , of the principle of self - determination through the free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples of the Territory ” .
5. Moreover , in line with the General Assembly Resolution 2625 ( XXV ) , which stipulates that “ no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognised as legal ” , the UN has neither approved the occupation nor recognised the legality of the Moroccan annexation of Western Sahara .
More precisely , in its Resolutions 34/37 of 21 November 1979 and 35/19 of 11 November 1980 , the General Assembly deeply deplored the aggravation of the situation resulting from “ the continued occupation of Western Sahara by Morocco . ”
6 . It is thus natural for the efforts aiming at settling the question of Western Sahara to have as ultimate objective the enabling of the Sahrawi people to decide their future by means of a free and fair referendum on self - determination .
African Union and the United Nations efforts and mediations
7. Following a 16 years protracted war , the two parties to the conflict , Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO [ the Western Saharan people ’s liberation movement ] , accepted the UN - OAU jointly elaborated Settlement Plan that was approved by the Security Council in its Resolutions 658 ( 1990 ) and 690 ( 1991 ) .
The plan provided for the entry into force of a ceasefire to be followed by a free and fair referendum on self - determination , without any administrative or military constraints , in which “ the Saharawi people would choose between independence and integration into Morocco ” ( Para 4 and 6 of the Peace Plan , S/21360 ) .
It was also agreed that the electoral body for the referendum will be based on the last Spanish census of the indigenous population made in 1974 ( Para 53 , S/ 21360 ) .
8 . The ceasefire entered into force on 6 September 1991 .
However , the referendum has not been held yet , due to the delaying tactics and obstructions made by Morocco that , from day one , used all means to undermine the peace process .
Morocco also exhibited the same obstructionist attitude towards the Houston Agreements that were negotiated and signed by both parties in September 1997 under the auspices of James Baker III , the then Personal Envoy of the Secretary - General for Western Sahara .
9 . At the request of the Security Council , following Morocco ’s rejection of the Settlement Plan , Baker put forward The Peace Plan for Self - determination of the People of Western Sahara ( Baker Plan ) , which was supported by the Security Council in its Resolution 1495 ( 2003 ) .
The plan envisaged four to five years period of self - governance for the territory at the end of which a referendum would be held in which not only indigenous Saharawi but also Moroccan residents in the territory since December 1999 would participate .
As a gesture of goodwill , the Frente POLISARIO accepted the plan despite the risks it involved , but Morocco rejected it out of hand .
10 . Morocco ’s main objection was that the plan included independence as one of the ballot options .
However , the Secretary - General in his report of 16 October 2004 stated that the “ United Nations could not sponsor a plan that excluded a referendum with independence as an option while claiming to provide for the self - determination of the people of Western Sahara ” ( para.14 ) .
The Secretary - General and his Personal Envoy , James Baker III , were of the view that it was inconceivable for a referendum on self - determination organised by the UN not to include the option of independence .
11 . In fact , the reason behind Morocco ’s reneging on its commitments and its unwillingness to allow any referendum on self - determination for the Saharawi people is the fact that it knows too well that the territory is not Moroccan and that any free and fair referendum on self - determination , to be held even with the participation of the Moroccan settlers residing in the territory , will definitely lead to the independence of Western Sahara .
In an interview with the US Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) , broadcast in August 2004 , James Baker III revealed the reason behind Morocco ’s change of heart and its rejection of the referendum saying that “ The closer we got , the more nervous I think the Moroccans got about whether they might not win the referendum . ”
Morocco ’s rejection to peace
12 . Since its rejection of the Baker Plan in 2004 , Morocco repeatedly declared that it was willing to accept a solution to the question of Western Sahara only “ within the sovereignty of Morocco ” .
In this context , on 11 April 2007 , it presented to the UN a proposal aiming at granting “ autonomy ” to the territory of Western Sahara “ within Morocco ’s sovereignty and territorial unity ” .
13 . Presented as a major concession , this project , which puts aside all the achievements made so far by the UN to settle the conflict , is another delaying tactic by Morocco that aims at gaining recognition by the international community of its colonial fait - accompli in Western Sahara .
In other words , the recognition of Moroccan “ sovereignty ” over a Non-Self - Governing Territory without meeting the requirements of the UN doctrine and practice relating to decolonisation .
14 . The Saharawi Government and the Frente POLISARIO have underlined on countless occasions that the Moroccan project is bound to fail , for it is based on totally unacceptable premises :
First , the proposal evidently departs from the assumption that Western Sahara is already an integral part of Morocco ’s territory .
This assumption is clearly unfounded since , from the viewpoint of international legality , Morocco does not exercise any legal territorial sovereignty or even administering power over Western Sahara .
As the Secretary - General stated in his report of 19 April 2006 ( para. 37 ) , “ no member State of the UN recognises Morocco ’s sovereignty over Western Sahara . ”
Moreover , as clearly established in General Assembly Resolutions 34/37 ( 1979 ) and 35/19 ( 1980 ) , Morocco is only an occupying power in Western Sahara .
Second , Morocco once again ignores the fact that Western Sahara is still considered by the UN as a question of decolonization whose final status must be decided by its indigenous people , not by the occupying power .
Third , by declaring that autonomy is the only solution , Morocco is prejudging the will of the Saharawi people by limiting from the outset their choice to autonomy .
This clearly violates the sacrosanct principle applicable to Non-Self - Governing Territories , as enshrined in General Assembly Resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) , that requires the free and genuine expression of the will of the people concerned through a popular consultation that necessarily includes the option of independence .
Fourth , the Moroccan approach deliberately ignores the Saharawi national reality , the long struggle of the Saharawi people for freedom as well as their strong attachment to independence that has been manifested daily for over thirty years .
Furthermore , , it ignores the fact that the Saharawi Republic ( SADR ) has been recognized by the African Union as full Member State and has today diplomatic relations with dozens of countries in the world .
Fifth , the project is also dangerous .
Indeed , willing to impose an autonomy - based solution on a people who are fundamentally hostile to any form of Moroccan domination or control and that have fought the Moroccan occupation for over three decades , is taking deliberately the risk to increase the tension , and create an intolerable situation that would jeopardise the stability of the territory and the region and undermine the chances for a just and final settlement of the conflict .
15 .
In order to overcome the deadlock already caused by Morocco , the Frente POLISARIO presented to the UN , on 10 April 2007 , a proposal titled “ Proposal of the Frente POLISARIO for a mutually acceptable political solution that provides for the self - determination of the people of Western Sahara ” ( see the annex ) .
The proposal is based on two pillars :
It stresses the need for the referendum on self - determination that would include the options already agreed by the two parties ( independence , integration , autonomy ) and endorsed by the Security Council in numerous resolutions .
Should the referendum lead to the independence of Western Sahara , the Frente POLISARIO will be ready to negotiate with Morocco the establishment of strategic relations between the two countries in all domains , particularly those that are or could be a cause of real or assumed concern to Morocco .
16 . On 30 April 2007 , the Security Council adopted Resolution 1754 ( 2007 ) in which it took note , in the preamble , of the two proposals and called upon both parties , Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO “ to enter into negotiations without preconditions in good faith with a view to achieving a just , lasting and mutually acceptable political solution , which will provide for the self - determination of the people of Western Sahara ” ( OP2 ) .
17 .
In this context , under the UN Secretary - General ’s auspices , delegations from the Frente POLISARIO and Morocco met at Greentree Estate in Manhasset , New York , on 18 - 19 June 2007 .
A second round of negotiations between the two parties was also held in Manhasset on 10 - 11 August 2007 .
In October 2007 and April 2008 , the Secretary - General submitted his reports to the Security Council in which he insisted on the fact that the two parties should enter into substantial negotiations and that the two proposals should be the basis for the negotiations .
A third and fourth round of negotiations took place in Manhasset on 7 - 9 January and 16 - 18 March 2008 .
The Security Council adopted Resolution 1783 ( 2007 ) and 1813 ( 2008 ) in which it reiterated the substance of Resolution 1754 ( 2007 ) .
18 . The Frente POLISARIO came to the four rounds of negotiations encouraged by the same sense of earnestness and good faith with which it participated in the preceding process of negotiation led by James Baker III .
On the four occasions , it has fully cooperated with the Personal Envoy of the Secretary - General for Western Sahara in the discussion of all issues including the confidence - building measures ( CBMs ) , which he proposed in the second round with a view to creating a positive climate between the two parties .
It is regrettable , however , that the Moroccan delegation rejected to discuss the Sahrawi proposal and the proposed CBMs , exhibiting once again its unwillingness to move the negotiation process forward .
19 .
A fifth round of formal negotiations is expected to take place at some time in the future .
The aim of the recent round of informal talks held in Austria in August 2009 is precisely to pave the way to the fifth round .
The Saharawi Government and the Frente POLISARIO have always underlined that the negotiations process underway should not become an objective in itself and consequently should not be emptied of its main content and ultimate goal , namely providing for the right of self - determination of people of Western Sahara .
Moreover , they are hopeful that Morocco would one day cease its dilatory manoeuvres and engage , in good faith , in the effective implementation of the Security Council and General Assembly Resolutions which continue to support the inalienable right of the Saharawi people to self - determination and independence .
20 .
Since the sixty - third session of the General Assembly ( 2008 ) , major events have taken place .
21 . The UN Secretary General has , in early August 20098 , decided to appoint Ambassador Christopher Ross ( USA ) , as his new Personal Envoy for Western Sahara in replacement of Mr. Peter Van Walsum .
Mr. Ross undertook two regional visits ( January and June 2009 ) which allowed him to discuss with the leadership of the two parties , Morocco and the F.
Polisario , as well as with the leaders of the two observers , Algeria and Mauritania , the prospects of progress for the stalemated peace process .
With the support of UNSC resolution 1871 ( 2009 ) , and the generous cooperation of the Government of Austria , both parties held , from 10 to 12 August 2009 , informal conversations under the auspices of the UNSG Personal Envoy , in Durnstein ( Austria ) aimed at preparing the grounds for the fifth round of formal negotiations .
The conversations did not lead to a tangible progress .
It was once again apparent that Morocco ’s intransigent position which it has already exhibited in Manhasset continues to impede any substantial progress toward a peaceful and lasting resolution of the conflict .
Both parties agreed however to continue the negotiations in a date and location that the UNSG Personal Envoy will determine .
A report by the UNSG to the UNSC is expected to be finished before the end of April 2010 .
The renewal of African Union position
22 . Meanwhile , the Saharawi people is pursuing the implementation of its national strategy in defence of their legitimate right to be a free and sovereign nation , a process that should not be halted by the lack of progress in the negotiations with the occupying power .
The Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic ( SADR ) has actively participated in all summits and meetings of the African Union .
It is worthy to recall that the Special Summit of Heads of States and Governments of the African Union ( AU ) on conflicts in Africa , held at Tripoli ( Libya ) , Aug 31 , 2009 , adopted an important decision on Western Sahara , which “ Calls for the intensification of the efforts towards the holding of a referendum to enable de people of Western Sahara to choose between the option of independence and that of integration into the Kingdom of Morocco . "
[ Special Session .
AU Summit ; 31 august 2009 , Tripoli , Libya . ]
By adopting this position , the AU intends to support the commendable efforts undertaken by the UN in the peace process in Western Sahara , which the AU is the initiator and co-sponsor .
It is clear for the African Union that Morocco ’s position constitutes the major obstacle to peace .
In his report to this special session , the chairman of the AU Commission , Jean Ping , said that the Western Sahara conflict is '' still at an impasse , ” because , he said , “ polarization of the positions of the parties and , more recently , because of Morocco 's insistence that its autonomy proposal is the only basis for negotiations with the Polisario , although the Security Council of the UN has noted the proposals of the two parties , as submitted in April 2007 . ''
The SADR has been consolidating its relations with a high number of friendly countries in the world , mainly in Africa , Caribbean area , Latin America , Asia and South East pacific region ..
It has been actively present in Latin America and Africa on the occasion of important events that took place in the two continents .
In tandem with these diplomatic achievements , several ambassadors accredited to the SADR have presented to the Saharawi President their Letters of Credentials in the Saharawi liberated territories .
The Frente POLISARIO has also become an observer member of the Socialist International .
23 . The Saharawi liberated territories , over which the SADR exercises its full sovereignty , have assumed an increasing importance in the overall policies of the Saharawi Government .
Significant political , social , economic and cultural events have taken place in those territories , especially in Tifariti where the 12th Congress of the Frente POLISARIO and the 35th anniversary of the foundation of the Frente POLISARIO as well as opening sessions of the Saharawi Parliament were all held there .
Hundreds of foreign delegations and dignitaries as well as international media took part in those events .
The Saharawi Government is undertaking great efforts to provide the necessary infrastructure and security conditions for the Saharawi population living in those territories , while undertaking consistent efforts in coordination with friendly countries and neighbours to prevent and eventually to disrupt any illegal activities related to internationally organized crime .
It has actively participated , given the long experience of its military forces , in the consolidation and effectiveness of regional security structures in conformity with its obligations as a full Member of the African Union .
Landmines
24 . After signing the Geneva Call Deed of Commitment for Adherence to a Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines in 2005 , the SADR has destroyed the major part of its antipersonnel mine stockpile , and facilitated mine action activities in the liberated territories .
The SADR has also declared its commitment to the Ottawa Treaty on banning antipersonnel mines .
It should be recalled , however , that Morocco continues to use this lethal weapon ( more that 5 million of personal landmines are planted in the territory ) in the areas under its occupation whilst refusing to adhere to the Ottawa Treaty .
UNHCR activities in Western Sahara
25 .
The UNHCR sponsored exchange programme of visits between Saharawi families separated by the Moroccan occupation is still running albeit at a slow pace .
It is regrettable that Morocco has obstructed for an extended period of time the visits to be conducted by land , and continues to block other confidence - building measures adopted by the Security Council such as cultural seminars and postal services .
The recent visit in September 2009 to the region of the President of the UNHCR , Mr. Gutierres , was critical in the decision of the international community to increase the amount of humanitarian programs for the Saharawi refugees and certainly helped to overcome Morocco ’s obstructions with regard the program of family visits by land .
Human Rights violations by Morocco in Western Sahara
26 . MINURSO was established in 1991 for two inseparable purposes : first , to monitor the ceasefire between Morocco and Frente POLISARIO forces ; and second , to organize a referendum for the self - determination of the people of Western Sahara by which they will freely choose between independence and integration into Morocco .
Eighteen years later , due to Moroccan obstruction , no such referendum has taken place .
27 . Until the fundamental right of self - determination of the Saharawi people is secured , the United Nations has a responsibility to protect the population of the Western Sahara pursuant to its clearly defined obligations towards Non Self - Governing Territories , as set out in Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations .
It is worthy to recall that Members of the United Nations have accepted as a ‘ sacred trust the obligation to promote to the utmost … the well - being of the inhabitants of these territories ’ and to ensure ‘ their just treatment and their protection against abuses ’ .
These fundamental Charter obligations include the provision of basic human rights .
28 . A human tragedy keeps on unfolding in our country since 1975 whose cruellest chapters are gradually overcoming the breach of the imposed silence .
Moroccan news paper , Al Jarida Al Oula published in 2008 summer what a Member of Morocco delegation in Manhasset negotiations confessed to a Moroccan Official investigative body :
“ There are several people ( … ) three or four officers from the ( Moroccan )
Army that have committed what can be called war crimes off the battlefield , and many civilians were thrown off helicopters or buried alive on account of being Saharawi ”
29 . Hundreds of Saharawi have been detained , made to face unfair trials and 32 political detainees , whose names and data were transmitted to the UNSG personal Envoy , are still imprisoned in Moroccan detention centres where the cruellest methods of physical and physiological torture are practiced with impunity .
The entire occupied territories continue to be under a military siege and a total media blackout , whilst Moroccan authorities deny access to NGOs , international media and observers .
30 .
The recent wave of repression undertaken in September 2009 by Morocco forces in Bojador , Aaiun and Smra left dozens of victims , manly women and young ladies , like the famous human right activist , Sultana Kahaya .
Torture , abuses , arbitrary detention , have been in situ graphically documented .
( http://asvdh.net/english/,
http://www.spsrasd.info/en/main3e.php and www.arso.org).
31 . It should be recalled in this regard that on 8 September 2006 , the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) delivered a report expressing serious concern at the human rights situation in Western Sahara , and documenting incidents of arbitrary arrest , harassment , and intimidation of human rights activists , including excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators .
While the report , unfortunately , has not been yet made public , it linked clearly the egregious and brazen human rights abuses in the occupied territory to the denial of the Saharawi people ’s inalienable right to self - determination .
The High Commissioner therefore recommended that the United Nations should institute a capacity to monitor human rights in the occupied Territory .
32 . The findings of the OHCHR and recommendations were confirmed by a similarly critical reports published by Human Rights Watch in December 2008 , [ Human Right Watch , Human Rights in Western Sahara and in the Tindouf Refugee Camps , 19 December 2008 ] and by the European Parliament fact - finding Mission of February 2009 , which documents Morocco ’s systematic and abusive efforts to suppress political dissent in the occupied Territory .
33 . According to Human Rights
Watch , these efforts are manifested by ‘ arbitrary arrests , unfair trials , restrictions on associations and assemblies , and through police violence and harassment ’ .
The report also finds that Moroccan security forces ‘ arbitrarily arrest demonstrators and suspected Saharawi activists , beat them and subject them to torture , and force them to sign incriminating police statements , all with virtual impunity ; and the courts convict and imprison them after unfair trials ’ , all in violation of Morocco ’s obligations as a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
In light of these grave findings , Human Rights Watch recommends that the Security Council should ‘ expand the mandate of MINURSO to include human rights monitoring and reporting in both Western Sahara and in the POLISARIO - administered camps in Algeria ’ .
34 . In his reports to the Security Council on 14 April 2008 ( S/2008/251 ) , and S/2009/200 0 f April 14 , 2009 the Secretary - General noted that , while MINURSO has no staff dedicated to human rights monitoring , “ it is the duty of the United Nations to uphold human rights standards in all of its operations , including its operations related to Western Sahara ”
35 . The F. Polisario urged the Security Council to act upon the recommendations of the High Commissioner and establish a human rights component within the MINURSO mandate to protect , promote and monitor the human rights situation of the Saharawi people as long as the conflict over the decolonization of Western Sahara remains unresolved .
The UNSC , because of Morocco ’s rejection which was supported by a European Permanent Member historically known by its negative interference in the decolonization process of Western Sahara , made a reference to the importance of the “ human dimension of the conflict ” in its latest resolution ( S / 1871/2009 of April 30 , 2009 ) , thus failing to adopt a more clear recommendation with regard human rights monitoring system in Western Sahara , despite the efforts undertaken by several UNSC members .
Our hope is that the United Nations will address responsibly the long - standing and systematic denial of the human rights of the Saharawi people , and pave the way towards securing a democratic and legitimate process of self - determination in the Western Sahara .
Exploitation of Saharawi natural resources
36 .
In the meantime , the Moroccan authorities continue to illegally and massively exploit the natural resources of Western Sahara .
The UN legal department opinion of January 29 , 2002 stated clearly that any extraction of these resources is illegal since Morocco has no legitimate authority to engage in such exploitation .
37 . Morocco claims that it has developed the territory .
It is a classic “ argument “ used by all colonial powers .
However , the revenues ( Five billion USD ) that the occupying power extracts from exploiting the Saharawi rock phosphate ( 3,500,000 tonnes annually at a price of about US$ 300 per tonne ) and the fish industry , for example , go solely to the regime .
They are then used to buy more weapons and reinforce the presence of more than 130,000 of its soldiers stationed in the occupied territory , to sustain economically the needs of more than 300.000 Moroccan settlers , whilst the socioeconomic situation in the occupied territories is deteriorating , with an unemployment rate that exceeds 35 %.
UN Member states should not participate directly or indirectly , in these illegal activities .
In this connection we urge the EU to reconsider the chapters affecting Western Sahara coasts in the Fishery agreement it has signed with Morocco .
The EU should keep its proclaimed reputation not to engage in agreements with countries that are violating international law and human rights .
Conclusions
38 . For United Nations , Western Sahara remains a colonial case to which the UN doctrine and practice relating to decolonisation must be applicable .
This means that the Saharawi people have an inalienable right to self - determination and independence to be exercised in a free , fair and democratic referendum on self - determination .
Morocco , which has already recognized from 1966 to 1973 in statements before UN the right of independence of Western Sahara and has accepted many peace plans based on the option of independence , should cooperate with the international community to put an end to its expansionist colonial war .
39 .
Over thirty years of institution and nation - building have made the Saharawi nation an irreversible reality .
The Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic is a fully - fledged State that exercises its full sovereignty over the Saharawi liberated territories and has the administrative and political capacity to handle its own affairs and conduct its international relations .
Indeed , the establishment of an independent Saharawi State in Western Sahara , as a result of a genuine democratic process , is the sine qua non for a secure , prosperous and integrated Maghreb .
40 . Today finding a just and final settlement of the question of Western Sahara in line with international legality is not only necessary but also possible .
The Settlement Plan , the Houston Accords , the Peace Plan for Self - determination of the people of Western Sahara and the Manhasset negotiation process can provide , at any moment , if the political will exists , an appropriate and honourable framework to settle the conflict .
41 . The Saharawi Government and the Frente POLISARIO , in keeping with the Security Council position , are ready to work and cooperate with the UN Secretary - General in order to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution which will provide for the self - determination in Western Sahara through the free and genuine expression of the will of the Saharawi people .
We are strongly committed to give all chances to the current negotiating process .
42 . However , as long as Morocco continue to feel that it has both a veto power to disrupt UN efforts and a guarantee of impunity with regard its policy of violations of human rights in the territory , the chances for the peace process to succeed will continue to be under a great and clear danger .
September 2009
Annex
Morocco ’s commitments :
1. On 7 July 1966 , the Representative of Morocco , Mr. Day Ould Sidi Baba , stated before the meeting of the Committee of the 24 , gathered in Addis Abeba , Ethiopia , that : “ I ask for the independence of Western Sahara as soon as possible and this should be an authentic independence , hence we can get over the actual impasse ... ” [ Statement by Mr. Day Ould Sidi Baba , of Morocco ; Committee of 24 , meeting in Addis Ababa , on 7 June 1966 ]
2 . In the same year , on 13 October 1966 , the Moroccan Foreign Minister , Mr. Charkawi , stated before the 21st session of the General Assembly , that : “ Morocco supports a real independence for Western Sahara , putting the future of the region in the hands of its sons which in the context of liberty will decide freely on their self - determination ... ” [ Statement by Mr. Mohamed Charkhawi , Minister of Foreign Affairs of Morocco ; 21st Session of the General Assembly , 13 October 1966 ]
3 . Four years later , King Hassan II himself , in a press conference held on 30 July 1970 , stated : “ Instead of going on claiming the territory of the Sahara , I would make the specific request that a popular consultation takes place , assuring that the first result being the departure of the non-Africans and allowing the people of the Sahara to choose between life under the Moroccan aegis , under their own aegis , or under any other aegis . ”
Translated from the original in French .
4 . Three months later , the Moroccan Foreign Minister , Mr. Boutaleb , stated before the 25th session of the General Assembly , on 12 October 1970 , that : “ Morocco and neighbouring countries , concerned about peace in the area , the development and cooperation among them , have decided to implement and facilitate the application of the self - determination of the territory of Western Sahara in collaboration with the international organization and the administering power . ”
[ Statement by Minister of Foreign Relations of Moroco , Mr. Butaleb ; 25th Session of the General Assembly on 12 October 1970 ] .
5 . Two years later , in June 1972 , the Council of Ministries of the OAU held in Rabat , Morocco , from 5 to 12 June , adopted with the direct support of Morocco , resolution CM / res. 272( XIX ) that , “ Calls on Spain , the administering power of Western Sahara to enable the people of this territory to exercise their right to self - determination and independence without delay and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations ” [ OP2 , resolution CM / res.272( XIX ) ] .
6 . One year later , the tripartite Summit among Morocco , Algeria and Mauritania held in Agadir , Morocco , on 24 July 1973 , reflected this consensus whilst expressing :
“ Their unshakable attachment to the principle of self - determination and their will to make sure that this principle is implemented within a frame that ensures the free and true expression of the inhabitants of Western Sahara , in conformity with UN decisions regarding this question ” .
( Algerian Mauritanian - Moroccan Summit , Agadir , 24 July 1973 ) .
7 . The regional consensus established at the highest political level was defended by Morocco three months later before the 28th session of the General Assembly , on 3 October 1973 , when the Moroccan Foreign Minister Mr. Benhima stated :
The first casting call has been released for True Blood ‘s third season and reveals some juicy details about what ’s coming up .
Assuming Alan Ball did n’t sneak in some fake information , here ’s who we ’ll see on True Blood next summer :
Tommy Mickens , Sam ’s long lost younger brother .
He has a scar on his face from ear to cheek , works at a tire store in Arkansas , and a family with a bad reputation .
He does n’t know who Sam is when Sam finds him .
Sounds like we ’ll also being seeing Tommy nude ; the casting call specifies that the role involves “ backside nudity ” .
Another shapeshifter in the family ?
During the course of looking for his family , Sam encounters Betty and Marvin , an African - American couple who live on a rundown street in Arkansas .
Marvin dislikes the Mickens , but Betty – impressed by Sam ’s ability to quiet her pitbull – helps him find Tommy .
As previously reported , the show is casting Talbot , the King of Mississippi ’s long - time trophy husband .
The official casting call reveals more about the character , however .
He ’s extremely good - looking , like underwear model hot , with a sarcastic personality .
He ’ll first appear in episode 3.02 as he shows Bill around the mansion where he ’s been “ invited ” to stay .
Does this mean Bill was kidnapped by the King ?
Jesus Velasquez is a recurring character in season 3 with the possibility of becoming a regular in season 4 .
Let ’s absorb that for a moment ; the casting call for the beginning of season 3 already assumes there will be a fourth season .
Hurrah !
Back to the character , he ’s gay , Latino , and – naturally – gorgeous .
A good - natured guy , he works as an orderly at a nursing home , caring for an elderly patient who makes racist remarks that he takes in stride .
He first appears in episode 3.02 .
Olivia , an elderly woman who uses a walker and an oxygen tank , might be under Jesus Velasquez ’s care .
She sees Bill and mistakes him for her son .
Could he be her ancestor ?
Those who have read the books will be familiar with Franklin Mott .
Described as “ sexy , sexy , sexy , sexy ” , this vampire is tall , dark , handsome and has an instant connection with Tara .
When she faces down some racist rednecks , he rushes to her aid .
Is he too good to be true ?
Tara also encounters Reverend Daniels , the pastor at Lettie Mae ’s church who tries to bring Tara comfort and reconciliation with her mother .
It sounds like Lettie Mae has developed an infatuation with her pastor as well .
In what sounds like a challenging storyline for Bill Compton , True Blood is casting a biker gang called the F*ck You Crew who take turns stabbing and feeding on Bill .
Cooter ( aka Coot ) is the gang ’s leader , Louie , Jimmy , and Gus are his subordinates high on V .
These are recurring roles .
Jason Stackhouse tries to get it on with Jen and Missy , recent NYU grads who are studying to become vets , but keeps seeing them with bullet holes in their heads .
Sounds like Terry is n’t the only one suffering from PTSD .
Yvetta is Eric ’s new dancer at Fangtasia , and his lover .
She a gorgeous Eastern European who speaks Czech .
Although she ’s currently only slated for one episode , there ’s the option she ’ll become a recurring character .
It ’s also been revealed that episode 3.01 is titled “ Pack of Wolves ” .
A former Fox News pundit has joined the debate over the network ’s journalistic ethics , and she ’s singled out one personality in particular .
Former Fox News pundit Jane Hall , who now works as an associate professor at American University , said on Sunday ’s edition of CNN ’s Reliable Sources that the decline of actual debate and the emergence of Glenn Beck is why she left the network .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There ’s less of a debate and I ’m uncomfortable with Beck , who should be called out as somebody whose language is way over the top , ” she told CNN ’s Howard Kurtz .
“ It ’s scary . ”
“ The reason I had left was in part is because I think they had less debate than they used to , ” she said .
“ But it is a fair point to say , you know , ‘ How much debate is there on MSNBC ? ’
I mean , how many Republican strategists — we have a bifurcation of the media that I think is going on . ”
When she remarked about Beck , Kurtz asked , “ Was that a factor in your deciding to leave Fox ? ”
“ Yeah , it was , ” Hall replied .

There 's a fair chance this is a joke .
Dear god , tell me this is a joke .
Apparently dismayed by legions of counterfeit corn flakes , Kellogg 's has developed a laser to etch " Kellogg 's " into individual flakes .

Indications this may be a joke :
1 . I 'm not totally sure you can laser - etch corn .
2 . There 's no way Kellogg 's has or deserves a monopoly on flakes of corn .
3. A Kellogg 's " food technologist " claims that " In recent years there has been an increase in the number of other brands trying to capitalise on the popularity of Kellogg 's corn flakes . "
Corn flakes are not a new invention , you guys .
Why the sudden popularity ?
Plus , " capitalize " is spelled with a z ( zed ) .
4 . Corn flakes requires tons of sugar to be palatable anyway , and the combination of sugar and milk is sure to erase the delicate laser etching .
5 . This appeared in the Daily Mail , which I do n't know anything about — but it is British , and my damnable xenophobia has convinced me that all British publications not called the Guardian are lying tabloids .
6. LASER -ETCHED CORN FLAKES LASER -ETCHED CORN FLAKES .

It 's pretty hilarious , regardless of whether it's true ( and the above six points indicated it is not ) .
Way to be exciting , Corn Flakes , even though you have neither marshmallows nor peanut butter !

The following is a guest post by my friend Maren from Dori's Diner .
Maren and her family moved in to Maryland about the time that we were deciding to move out , so we did n't get to know each other well until we both started reading each other 's blogs .
Now , I consider her one of my best blogging buddies , and I 'm excited to get to share her thoughts with you today .
Choosing to breastfeed my kids was n’t much of a choice .
After all , I knew the benefits , both physical & financial .
For instance , I knew that infant formula was an imperfect substitute for breast milk , especially considering that the exact properties of breast milk are n’t yet even known .
I also knew that breast milk plays an important role in the growth of an infant ’s immune system and is one of the main sources of germ protection for the vulnerable first 6 months of life .
Monetarily , I knew that formula was pricey with an annual range of $ 648 to $ 2800 depending on the brand and type of formula used for the recommended first year of life compared to the negligible amount needed to increase a breastfeeding mother ’s diet .
And that ’s not counting all the bottles , nipples , liners , etc used to deliver the formula .
As I became more environmentally aware , I realized that breastfeeding also fell into the category of being environmentally conscious .
I first considered the cost of producing , marketing , and distributing the formula , as well as the cost of tending to the waste after feeding ( plastic lids , cans , wrappers , and bottle liners , some of which are recyclable , and some which are not ) .
I also realized that as with most prepared foods , infant formula was subject to contaminations , sloppy handling techniques , and other biological hazards of the food industry .
Considering that 99 % of the formula market is produced by only three major brands : Nestle ( Good Start ) , Abbott Labs ( Similac ) , & Mead Johnson ( Enfamil ) , I felt the twinge of fear that anyone feels when in the presence of a large oligopoly that likely does not carry out sustainable initiatives , even if they do give it lip - service .
Armed with all this information , I committed at the end of my first pregnancy to breastfeed my child for at least a year , as well as all future children .
Four children later , I realized that simply choosing to breastfeed is not enough to make it happen .
The problems started immediately with a fussy little girl who refused to latch on .
Later , anatomical problems were discovered , but at that point , I had resigned myself to formula and shelling out the big bucks for a year .
When my second daughter appeared , we seemed to have bypassed some of the earlier issues , but ran into new ones that terminated our otherwise healthy breastfeeding relationship after just a few weeks .
( Post - partum depression & poor health . )
Call me stubborn , but when I was pregnant with my third daughter , I was determined to stick it out for at least a few months , even if it meant pumping exclusively .
Stubborn I might have been , but nothing compared to the will - power of daughter number three who was born early and small , and had trouble suckling from the breast .
I pumped for 5 weeks , trying every few days to latch her on , until one night , when she was tired and hungry , but not frantic , she latched on and never looked back .
I breastfed her for 14 months , when I finally weaned her .
What was the turning point ?
An ugly round of mastitis , a common breast - infection that some women are more prone to than others .
Because breastfeeding , as opposed to pumping or formula feeding , is one of the best remedies for mastitis , I found myself even more committed to making it work .
And this was despite many people ’s insistence that I should quit and move to formula exclusively .
Armed with confidence , I pumped with daughter number four for three weeks before she was able to latch on and nurse exclusively .
As I look forward to my fifth child , I realize a few important things :
Breastfeeding is best , not just because of cost & physical benefits , and satisfying bond but also because of it ’s sustainability within the environment and the marketplace .
With adequate education , support , and ability , most women can breastfeed if that is what they desire .
Ideally , most women would breastfeed if they were educated in the how - to ’s and why ’s of breastfeeding exclusively for at least the first 6 - months ( per WHO ’s recommendation ) .
Formula feeding is not ideal for a number of reasons , but is a necessary alternative for hose who cannot ( for a number of varying reasons ) breastfeed or must supplement .
However , more sustainable alternatives need to be developed .
Some solutions that seem ideal include :
Breastfeeding exclusively for at least the first 6 months of the infant ’s life .
If necessary , using a pump and bottles to give the mother breaks to sleep , etc .
If this is not possible , or supplementation is needed , consider purchasing an organic formula ( and supporting the companies that sell & distribute them ) that is not produced by one of the big three companies , such as Earth ’s Best or Bright Beginnings .
If you ’re ambitious , consider making your own formula !
Wet Nursing or Cross - Nursing : once accepted , these practices of temporarily nursing a friend or family member ’s baby ( cross- nursing ) or hiring someone to nurse your baby long - term ( wet nurse ) have fallen by the wayside .
Fear of disease & a pervasive sexual stigma tend to cause people in the Western world to cringe when thinking about nursing another ’s baby .
And yet both cross - and wet nursing are making a small comeback as more Western women are becoming aware of the many benefits of breast milk .
Currently , the La Leche League discourages wet & cross-nursing for a number of reasons ( including diminished milk supply in the birth mom , disease , etc ) , but there are still many women who have had successful shared nursing experiences .
On a personal note , I used some of a very close friend ’s frozen milk supply when working my third daughter to my breast .
Of course , I knew this friend well enough to trust that her milk was clean and suitable for my newborn .
Banks : another suitable alternative to breastfeeding that is often used for infants that require breast milk but cannot get it from their mother .
There are only 10 in the United States , mainly because of the social stigma and the enormous cost of collecting , screening , pasteurizing , and delivering the donated human milk .

There is no perfect world and certainly no one - size - fits - all solution to the many different lifestyles each mother leads .
I also do n’t consider myself a breast - feeding radical — I know firsthand how very difficult it can be for so many different reasons , and excess guilt is n’t healthy .
However , I believe that an educated woman will find many good reasons to work at a satisfactory breast - feeding relationship , something that is good for mom & baby and the environment as well .

Yes on One ( and only one version of Christianity )
by Jeremy Hooper
Yesterday , we showed you how a Catholic group is gunning for a Maine grandmother and the pro-equality campaign that she supports , simply because she professed to have a fondness for both the Vatican and her gay son / son - in - law / grandchild .
But now for even more insight into how little the supporters of Maine 's " yes on 1 " campaign support true religious freedom , check out the following comment .
It was just left on Stand For Marriage Maine 's Facebook wall :
Now , we do n't know anything about the other user in the above exchange .
But it does n't matter .
Ms. Murphy is suggesting that one simply cannot be both a Christian and a supporter of the " No on 1 " campaign .
In fact , she even uses a little " c " , quotation marks , and a " so - called " qualifier to refer to anyone who might be both faithful and pro-gay - filled .
And she suggests that it's the Christians who wish to protect the state 's legislatively - approved equality who are the ones playing games here , not the folks who will tyrannically vote it away because they simply do n't like it .
What kind of mutant strain of myopia are they using ?!?
Why do they feel that they have the right to not only deny LGBT people of whatever right that does n't fit within their parameters of faith - based acceptability , but also the right to deny the beliefs of any religious person who sees the world differently than they do ?!
They tell us until they are blue in the face that is is the gay community and its supporters who are destroying faith in America , and that in a gay - accepting world , they will not be free to hold onto their beliefs .
But let 's ask the alternate question :
What would happen to faith in America if these kinds of mindsets were free to set the agenda for the entire nation ?
We 're getting cross just thinking about it .
And we mean that quite literally :
In their world , we 're sure we'd get a cross OR ELSE !
Stand For Marriage Maine [ Facebook ]
** UPDATE : The thread has continued :
Your thoughts
The reason why the fundamentalists think that the LGBT crowd is destroying faith is because in the eyes of the fundamentalists there is only one true faith - theirs .
Their faith , their whole faith , and nothing but their faith .
Calling them ' myopic ' is accurate , but in some cases it 's an understatement .
Some fundamentalists have a compulsive need to be right on every single issue , which means that their God oh - so - conveniently agrees with them on every single issue .
' God ' provides a basis for every one of their views , for without that basis their position would collapse like a house of cards .
This means that they can't afford to admit that they might be wrong about their God , and they even take it a stage further .
They say that if you disagree with them , you can't be a ' real ' Christian , or Catholic , or whatever .
It 's an easy way to distance themselves even more from dissent - not just to say that other Christians are theologically wrong , but to say that the other Christians are n't even Christians .
The fundamentalists seal themselves into an isolated bubble , shielding themselves from harsh reality .
This is one reason why fundamentalists are so vitriolic .
They may sincerely believe that gay acceptance will harm children , but the unspoken truth is that they can't bear to admit that they might be wrong .
It 's the most threatening thing that could ever happen to them .
At present , gay rights is one of the most public struggles , so they 're all piling in on that .
But we should n't lose sight of another problem just over the hill ; they would n't shut up if they won the LGBT fight .
They 'd start shouting about something else .
They want to make the whole of society in their own image ; one more reason to oppose them .

" You can safely assume that you 've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do . "
Anne Lamott .
And , it certainly is not just christians , it 's fundamentalists , from all religious persuasions .
And , it is exactly why church and state must be separate .
Even within each local religious clique , where perhaps the majority of their religious beliefs are similar , you will rarely find any two adherents whose belief system is identical .
And , that 's usually fine , because ( and I have seen it happen hundreds of times ) , when the disagreements amongst the faithful become so disjunct , they simply separate into smaller cliques .
Of course , it is fine within the context of " religion " , because the consequence of disagreement is usually just that they physically dissociate themselves from each other .
That is why there is not one ( 1 ) Christian church , but literally hundreds of them .
But , it becomes a problem when fundamentalists believe that it is their ordained duty , not only to believe themselves , but to force their myopic opinion onto others .
When the jihadist believes that god is demanding action , rational reasoning may not be able to persuade the delusional to behave in a manner conducive to social civility .

FACT : 100 years ago the ' True Christians ' would have been calling every single person on that page a fake ' christian ' for supporting equality for women and blacks .
Religion means whatever the hell people want it to mean .
Posted by : penguinsaur | Oct 14 , 2009 11:52:22 AM
I am one who has been called a " pseudo - Christian " because of my beliefs that :
The Bible does not conflict with real , credible science .
* cough * Darwinism * cough *
The Bible says nothing about consentual , loving relationships between two people of the same sex .
The God I worship would not reject someone outright for being who they were born to be .
The two most important things Jesus said we should do are 1 ) love God 2 ) love each other .
Oh , wait .
They probably would not argue about that last one .
They would say they do that .
Um , yeah .

Bonnie - - how I can relate to what you 're saying !
Most of my extended family would identify with the religious right .
Quite frankly , I do n't understand how someone who is truly a Christian could support most of the right 's agenda , but I certainly do n't question the sincerity of those right - wingers who say they 're Christians .
What I find really interesting about the above posting is that Sylvia does n't even respond to her " friend 's " points about loving your neighbor or keeping government out of your business .
And she says that he 's the one who did n't get it .
Posted by : Rachel Snyder | Oct 14 , 2009 4:17:52 PM
The reason why Sylvia makes a stand that it is inconsistent to vote no on 1 and consider yourself a Christian is because homosexuality is condoned by Christ and the Bible .
To call yourself a Christian , you are saying that you align yourself with Christ and follow Him .
However when you take a stance in direct opposition to Him , then how can you be a Christian ?
Sylvia made the point by quoting the Word of God , but it was not received hence her frustration .
How can someone say that they stand for something , then act in direct rebellion to it ?
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 1:47:44 PM
Josh , voting no on 1 does not mean that you personally affirm homosexuality or homosexual unions , no more than cherishing the first amendment means you personally affirm non-christian faiths .
Posted by : zortnac | Oct 15 , 2009 2:27:52 PM
Hey Josh ,
Thank you for your support !
Would n't have expected you to say that , " homosexuality is condoned by Christ and the Bible , " but I 'm glad to see that Jesus condones being gay !
As for the riddle of someone saying they stand for something , then rebel against it - I 'm afraid you 'll have to answer that one for us , as you seem to contradict yourself in your post .
Posted by : DN | Oct 15 , 2009 2:37:33 PM
Josh - are you certain that a ) your interpretation of the Bible is correct in every regard , and b ) you yourself do not take any contrary stances to it ?
Please justify your responses , and why we should n't listen to gay - friendly theologians .
Furthermore - c ) are you certain that what 's written in the Bible holds forever ?
Bear in mind that if you answer ' yes ' to this question , you are saying that the penalty of blasphemy is death ( Leviticus 24 ) .
Leviticus 20:10 also states that adulterers should be killed as well .
But that 's a bit besides the point .
Is homosexuality so important to your beliefs , so absolutely fundamental , that gay rights supporters are automatically written off as Christians ?
Really ?
I would have thought a God that created the universe , every lifeform currently living , the laws of physics , etc , etc , would have a bit more to worry about than what gender sleeps in what bed .
Posted by : Baron Scarpia | Oct 15 , 2009 2:56:52 PM
Josh , I presume that you meant to say that " homosexuality is CONDEMNED by christ and that bible " , rather than CONDONED .
Otherwise you might be " in direct opposition " to your misguided opinion as well .
The fact of the matter is that reasonable ( read : intelligent / thinking ) people can read the lunacy of the bible , and arrive at completely different opinions as to what the farce means .
And , that the religious are excessively intolerant of their own members who " go rogue " is just endemic of the broader pathology ; that the fundamentalist religious are simply intolerant of everyone who does n't tow their myopic line .
And , that is exactly why the church and state should absolutely be separate .
Because your fundamentalist Catholic myopia is not in the majority .. and should you succeed in theocracizing the US , you might find yourselves looking down the sharp end of that intolerant religious stick .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Oct 15 , 2009 3:10:59 PM
Um Josh ?
You can take a break from moderating the M4MM Facebook page and come over here to comment , but I think you made a telling mistake !
" The reason why Sylvia makes a stand that it is inconsistent to vote no on 1 and consider yourself a Christian is because homosexuality is condoned by Christ and the Bible . "
I think you mean to say that homosexuality is " condemned " by Christ and the Bible ...
And yes , that 's one hell of a Freudian slip !
Posted by : Matt | Oct 15 , 2009 3:19:31 PM
yes , my apologies for typing the wrong word , i did intend condemn and not condone .
Some responses : " a ) your interpretation of the Bible is correct in every regard , and "
The bible is clear on homosexuality , there is no grey area on this issue .
" b ) you yourself do not take any contrary stances to it ? " not knowingly or intentionally .
I 'm not perfect and I am a sinner and I am trying everyday to be more like Christ .
The Bible is the ultimate authority in my life .
" c ) are you certain that what 's written in the Bible holds forever ? "
YES " Bear in mind that if you answer ' yes ' to this question , you are saying that the penalty of blasphemy is death ( Leviticus 24 ) .
Leviticus 20:10 also states that adulterers should be killed as well . "
Take this in the light of John 8 and understand likewise that the sin of homosexuality is forgivable , but Christ clearly states to acknowledge it as sin then do it no more .
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 3:24:17 PM
I would like to encourage every Christian who is passionate about this topic to read this article .
http://www.soulforce.org/article/homosexuality-bible-gay-christian
When interpreting the Bible , one cannot read the texts assuming he or she already knows what it means .
That 's a hermeneutical fallacy .
Reading the Bible and assuming that it condemns homosexuality without doing extensive research on it yourself shows that you really do n't hold the Bible in very high esteem , or else you 'd seek to find what it really says and not just believe what you 've heard from others your whole life .
Consider the viewpoint in the link , consider your current viewpoint , then study the texts extensively for yourself .
If you have n't done that , then I do n't believe you can really make a valid , intelligent decision .
And like others have said , I 'm also glad Jesus condones homosexuality !
He sure has given me a wonderful partner , and I am very thankful to Him for that .
Posted by : Katie | Oct 15 , 2009 3:27:04 PM
Josh :
What role do you play in the " yes on 1 " campaign ?
And do you see any disconnect between your wholly faith - based stances and your attempts to roll back CIVIL equality ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 3:35:15 PM
For anyone who claims to be a Christian and supports homosexual marriage can you please reconcile your stance with Romans 1:21 - 32 , Genesis 2:21 - 25 ?
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 3:36:29 PM
G - A-Y , I am a volunteer , a Christian who believes that marriage is defined by God as being between one man and one woman .
I am not employed by anyone in the campaign , and I had no involvement in anything to do with them before marriage was redefined in the state of Maine in direct opposition of multiple votes by the people to keep it as being between one man and one woman .
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 3:40:04 PM
G - A - Y in response to the second half of your question , Homosexuality is not a physical attribute , it is a behavior , a chosen behavior .
You can choose to be involved in it or not .
Chosen lifestyles are not a basis for civil rights .
Whether or not you are born with an inclination towards a lifestyle does not make it right , all people are born with inclinations towards all types of sin , but everyone must choose whether or not to follow and pursue that sin , or deny it .
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 3:44:34 PM
But Josh , they 've put you in charged of moderating the Facebook page , yes ?
I do n't care if you are paid or not :
You are working for the campaign .
The majority of campaign workers are unpaid .
So my question remains :
How do you justify using your PERSONAL faith to deny others ' CIVIL liberties ?
At my legal wedding ( in CT ) there were orthodox Jews , a nun in full habit , several methodists , and various other people of faith .
They all came to support my CIVIL marriage ( which has elements of spirituality , but no religion ) .
Do you not see that America is a very diverse place ?
Do you not see that CIVIL marriage is the only form for which organized gay activists are fighting ?
Do you not see that it is your side who is denying TRUE religious freedom by saying that no other version of faith is correct except your own ?
Or do you just not care ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 3:45:54 PM
Oh , and Josh :
The certainty with which you say the things you say is simply stunning .
Do you not care that medical science does not see it the same way ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 3:47:18 PM
G- A - Y I am certain , beyond any doubt the the Bible is true and wholly inspired by God , without error or contradiction .
I know and recognize that I am not , as clearly shown by my post earlier .
The only place in life where I stand with such confidence is with the Word of God .
You can pursue me and you will have no problems finding error in my life and finding contradictions and hypocrisy , after all I am human .
But I recognize truth and seek to be conformed and changed by it daily to be like the God that created me , and you .
What you or I believe is irrelevant , truth remains independent of belief , it is not relative .
I suppose that you will see this stance and confidence as narrow minded and bigoted , as I have been called by many as I stand for Marriage , and I guess I am OK with that since that persecution is for my confidence in Christ .
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 3:59:15 PM
Josh :
Yes , this is what YOU believe .
That 's not what I 'm asking .
That 's not what any of us on the pro-equality side are asking .
We are asking where you get off saying that your personal religious beliefs can infringe on others ' civil rights ?!
And why do you draw the line with LGBT people ?
Clearly you also stand against people of other forms of faith .
What next -- will you who hold the concrete , infallible truth go after non-Jesus - based faiths ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 4:02:57 PM
Oh , and Josh : I hope this exchange , if nothing else , will show you how to conduct an open forum .
Here at G - A - Y , comments are moderated for one reason and one reason only :
So I can fore myself to read ( or at least skim ) every single one .
The only time anyone has ever been denied a comment is if they break a few , very limited rules ( some of which are demanded of us by our service provider ) .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 4:04:14 PM
Josh : " Chosen lifestyles are not a basis for civil rights . "
That seems to be a stance very detrimental to the religious liberties you enjoy every day .
I wonder , if you think recognizing someone 's right to a civil marriage means you affirm homosexuality , do you think recognizing someone 's right to follow the Wiccan faith means you affirm paganism ?
Posted by : Christopher Eberz | Oct 15 , 2009 4:07:30 PM
G - A -Y , you are free to moderate your site , as is SFMM .
I would not be here if your blog did not bring up the SFMM site specifically .
I also will not continue to participate on this blog and would have no issue with your not allowing my participation .
I have said all that I have to say .
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 4:20:28 PM
Josh , I would love an opportunity to talk Biblical misuse with you .
Unfortunately , you stifled that exact discussion over at facebook not two days ago .
I 'm not about to abuse Jeremy 's blog ( or mine , for that matter ) for that purpose so that you can continue to censor dissenting views on your political campaign site .
I also wo n't do that because -- and this is important -- WHAT YOU AND I THINK THE BIBLE SAYS IS IRRELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT OF CIVIL MARRIAGE .
Posted by : Matt Algren | Oct 15 , 2009 4:44:00 PM
Josh : Please , I implore you to stop missing the point .
The point is that we * do n't* moderate comments , while you have banned every pro-equality voice from SFMM 's page .
The point is that our side welcomes discussion , while urs tends to shut it out .
Of course we all CAN deny comments , if we so choose .
But the point is that your side does and our side does n't .
And the point is that your side 's choice to do so ( which extends far beyond SFMM ) is detrimental to democracy .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 4:44:38 PM
And no , Matt , I have no clue who Marie Labot is .
Kind of bizarre that she 'd claim to know me .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 15 , 2009 4:46:36 PM
G - A-Y , I will respond one last time only to say that I spent weeks on the SFMM site up daily until 1 - 2 am debating , being civil and going point by point .
I was met with hate and slander over and over .
It perpetuated to the point that many supporters of Marriage abandoned the page because of constant attack from no on 1 supporters .
There are FB pages and blogs that exist for the sole purpose of seeing SFMM and NOM pages crippled if not eradicated because they disagree with their stand on marriage .
Just as I am not in this debate on the offensive , but rather defensive to protect marriage , the moderation of SFMM is defensive against all those who attack it continually .
Posted by : Josh | Oct 15 , 2009 4:57:30 PM
No , Josh , you are n't getting around Leviticus like that , for a very good reason .
If God in Leviticus condemned adulterers to death , and Jesus does not , then God CHANGED HIS MIND .
After all , Jesus is God , yes ?
Or are you claiming that the Jews in Leviticus were sinless ?
This means that the Bible can not be inerrant .
God changes the rules .
The Bible says ' p ' in one place and ' not - p ' in another .
Taking the Bible as an ultimate authority in every matter is to ignore the thousands of interpretations available of it .
It is to ignore the context in which it was written .
And , if you take the Bible literally , it is to ignore the huge , overwhelming scientific and historical evidence that contradicts it .
I could continue , but one thing I 've learnt from arguing with people like yourself is not to give them a choice of targets .
So I 'm going to end by repeating Jeremy 's question - ' How do you justify using your PERSONAL faith to deny others ' CIVIL liberties ?...
Do you not see that CIVIL marriage is the only form for which organized gay activists are fighting ?
Do you not see that it is your side who is denying TRUE religious freedom by saying that no other version of faith is correct except your own ?
Or do you just not care ? '
Posted by : Baron Scarpia | Oct 15 , 2009 5:02:59 PM
That is simply not true Josh !
I too have monitored the SFMM Facebook page , and the VAST majority of comments have been respectful .
I have screencap after screencap of the sort of comments that you have deleted : http://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2009/09/sfmm-well-you-see-we-delete-because-sticking-our-fingers-in-our-ears-is-just-easier.html

I refuse to even debate this point .
I have tangible evidence .
And you are bearing false witness in suggesting that you are simply deleting the " haters . "
Your side ALWAYS claims that you are being harassed , attacked , etc , when the reality is that we are simply asking to justify your views .
After all , you * are * choosing to strip us of a hard - fought right that we have earned .
We are holding your side accountable -- unapologetically and unabashedly .
But we are doing so fairly , in large part .
And not to mention :
Some of your supporters have been unbelievably hostile !
From now on , Ill start screen capping those as well

" For what may appear to be just one can moving across a bonnet and down around a mudguard there could actually be five or six cans used to create that effect .
Left , The Associated Press / Graham Family ; right , Glenn Paul / Equal Justice Initiative
Updated , Nov. 9 , 5:15 p.m. | Round 3 : Kent Scheidegger and Marc Mauer on what the Supreme Court justices asked and what that might reveal .
Is life without parole cruel and unusual punishment for juvenile offenders convicted of non-homicide crimes ?
Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project and Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation are debating this question today on Room for Debate .
On Monday , the Supreme Court heard arguments on the cases of Terrance Graham and Joe Sullivan , two prisoners in Florida who were sentenced to life without possibility of parole for crimes they committed as minors .
In 2005 , the court ruled that the Eighth Amendment ’s ban on “ cruel and unusual punishment ” prohibited the execution of juvenile offenders .
Does sentencing a teenager to die in prison for crimes in which no one was killed also violate the Eighth Amendment ?
Go here to read Round 1 of the debate .
Go here to read Round 2 , where Mr. Scheidegger and Mr. Mauer respond to each other ’s positions .
Go here to read Round 3 for their take on what happened at the Supreme Court argument .
Round 1
Proportionate Justice
Marc Mauer is the executive director of the Sentencing Project and the author of “ Race to Incarcerate . ”
The Sentencing Project submitted an amicus brief supporting the petitioners , Terrance Graham and Joe Sullivan .
There are more than 1,700 people in the United States serving sentences of life without parole for crimes committed as juveniles .
No other nation has even a single person serving such a sentence .
Now the Supreme Court will consider an extreme outcome of this policy , two cases of juveniles serving no - parole life terms for non-homicide offenses .
Children do not have fully matured levels of judgment or impulse control , and they are uniquely capable of change .
There is no question that the two juveniles , Joe Sullivan and Terrance Graham , were convicted of very serious offenses .
So why is it problematic to incarcerate them for life ?
First , children are different than adults .
As the Supreme Court noted in its 2005 decision in Roper v. Simmons banning the death penalty for juveniles , children do not have fully matured levels of judgment or impulse control , and are more susceptible to peer pressure than adults .
Brain imaging research documents that adolescent brains are not fully developed , particularly in areas that control reasoning and risk taking .
It is for these reasons that all states already impose age restrictions on voting , driving and consuming alcohol .
Read more …
Children are also uniquely capable of change .
No matter how serious a crime committed by a 13 - year - old , there is no means of predicting what type of adult he or she will become in 10 or 20 years .
That ’s why we need professional parole boards to consider whether and at what point they are capable of returning to society .
The diminished capacity of young offenders renders life - without - parole sentences “ cruel and unusual punishment ” banned by the Eighth Amendment .
As the Supreme Court noted in the Roper decision , there is a “ basic precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense . ”
The two Florida cases fail on this principle because they involve non-homicide offenses and because of the way the sentences were imposed .
Many of the juveniles serving life without parole sentences are doing so as a result of the harsh penalties adopted by many states in the 1990s that automatically transfer certain juvenile cases to adult court .
Upon conviction in adult court , they are often sentenced to mandatory life terms .
Thus , at no point is there an opportunity to permit consideration of the individual circumstances of the child and the potential for rehabilitation .
The impact of these policies can be seen in the Sullivan and Graham cases , both sentenced in Florida courts .
Of the 109 juveniles nationally who have been identified as serving life without parole terms for a non-homicide , 77 are in Florida alone .
It is difficult to imagine that young people in Florida are so much more violent or beyond redemption than children in any other state , but it ’s not difficult to determine that sentencing policies in that state have produced these results .
Joe Sullivan was convicted of sexual battery at the age of 13 .
He is now 33 and confined to a wheelchair as a result of multiple sclerosis .
It would seem reasonable for the court to allow for a consideration of whether he and Terrance Graham still present a threat to public safety .
Society ’s Proper Defense
Kent Scheidegger is the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation .
He wrote an amicus brief supporting the State of Florida in the Graham and Sullivan cases .
One month before his 18th birthday , Terrance Graham committed a string of home invasion robberies .
In one invasion , he stuck a gun in the resident ’s stomach and ordered his cohorts to ransack the house .
The question for the sentencing judge was not whether to give Graham a second chance .
He had already received a second chance .
The previous year a judge had let him off easy for another violent robbery .
Judges should be allowed to impose a life sentence on the very worst juvenile offenders .
Graham got only 12 months in jail plus probation for that crime .
Almost as soon as he was released , he chose to spit in the face of society ’s mercy and take up robbery once again .
In light of Graham ’s choice of the criminal path despite all efforts to help him choose better , the judge decided a life sentence was needed for protection of the innocent .
The second case before the Supreme Court involves a sentence imposed 20 years ago when Joe Sullivan was 13 .
A life sentence is rare at that age , but Sullivan was a rare 13 - year - old .
He broke into the home of an elderly woman and committed a savage rape , a crime so vicious it is hard to imagine anyone doing it , much less a 13 - year - old .
Read more …
Sullivan had already racked up an astonishing record for one so young — 17 crimes including several serious felonies .
As with Graham , the judge made an individualized determination that Sullivan had spurned the second and third chances he had been given and a life sentence was now necessary .
No one disputes that most juvenile offenders should be treated differently from adults .
The question is whether judges will be able to impose a life sentence on persons individually determined to be far worse than the typical teen miscreant .
More fundamentally , the question is who should decide what range of punishments are available for the very worst .
Should that decision rest with the people , through the normal democratic process , as it always has ?
Or should the Supreme Court read this limitation into the Eighth Amendment ’s ban on “ cruel and unusual punishment , ” which has never contained such a limit before ?
If it does , the people will be unable to change that decision except by the drastic measure of amending the Constitution .
Supporters of a constitutional cutoff at the 18th birthday cite research showing that juveniles are in general less mature than adults and that the brain continues to change into early adulthood .
That is true , but it does not support the conclusion .
General trends of maturation do not support the notion that everyone a day short of 18 is less mature and less responsible for his acts than everyone a day older .
Individuals mature at different rates .
Psychological studies cited by Graham and Sullivan ’s supporters show that many delinquent teenagers will desist and be law - abiding adults .
Yet the same studies show that there is a hard core of life - course persistent offenders that is unlikely to desist .
This group typically begins offending earlier , commits more violent offenses and remains violent into adulthood .
Our society can and should defend itself against them .
As our knowledge continues to grow , we should be able to change our policies accordingly .
This question of sentencing policy should not be cast in constitutional concrete .
It should be left to the legislatures of the states , where it belongs .
Round 2
No Magic to an Age Limit
Kent Scheidegger responds to Marc Mauer :
I agree with Marc Mauer that no juvenile should be sentenced to life without parole as a result of a “ mandatory minimum ” sentencing statute , without an individual evaluation .
But that has nothing to do with the Graham and Sullivan cases .
In each of these cases , a judge evaluated the crime , the defendant ’s criminal record , and the failed prior efforts at rehabilitation before deciding that we could take no more chances on a young criminal who had already received two or more .
While denouncing mandatory minimum statutes that impose a sentence based on a single , rigid criterion , Mr. Mauer demands a “ mandatory maximum ” rule that forbids a sentence based on a single , rigid criterion .
That approach is just as wrong , for the same reason .
Culpability and potential for rehabilitation cannot be reduced to the single variable of chronological age .

Our society uses rigid age cutoffs for voting , driving , etc. , as a matter of convenience and economy , not because we really believe there is anything magic about a particular birthday .
We accept the inaccuracy of using age as a measure of maturity because the consequences are not severe , and individual evaluations for the entire population would be impractical .
For juveniles who commit major crimes of violence such as rape , armed robbery and murder , the consequences of getting it wrong are severe , and there are vastly fewer cases .
We can and should evaluate each case on the merits .
In a very few cases , the right answer is life in prison .
Who Can Predict a 13 - Year - Old ’s Future ?
Marc Mauer responds to Kent Scheidegger :
In advocating to uphold juvenile life - without - parole - sentences even for non-homicides , Kent Scheidegger misses the mark on both public safety and the law .
Mr. Scheidegger contends that there is a hard core of young offenders who will never change their criminal behavior .
Yes , a relative handful of youths will persist in such behaviors well into adulthood , but we know this only retrospectively .
There is no scientific method that gives us the ability to predict which 13 - year - olds will become high - rate offenders over the rest of their lives .
This is precisely the reason why life - without - parole sentences are both cruel and unwise .
No one suggests that youths who commit serious crimes should be released from prison unconditionally if parole is an option .
The question before the Supreme Court is whether a parole review should be conducted at some point to distinguish between those youths who have demonstrated maturity and reform and those who still present a risk to public safety .

Current policy is also counterproductive for public safety .
At an annual cost of $ 25,000 for each individual in prison , and three times that for elderly prisoners , money that could be invested in proven prevention programs for young people is instead being spent on excessively long periods of incarceration .
Mr. Scheidegger asks why courts should have the power to ban state legislative policy as “ cruel and unusual punishment . ”
It ’s for precisely the same reason that the Supreme Court has struck down such state policies as racial segregation and the juvenile death penalty — because these policies violate our Constitution .
So , too , does the policy of juvenile life without parole for non-homicide offenses .
Round 3
Age as a Major Factor
Kent Scheidegger on how the court might find a middle ground :
Predicting Supreme Court decisions from the oral argument is always dicey .
However , it appears from the argument in the Graham v. Florida case that the justices are searching for some kind of middle ground .
There appears to be little or no support on the high bench for the categorical 18th - birthday cutoff that the defendants are seeking .
That is , no justice indicated support for an ironclad rule that no juvenile could ever be sentenced to life - without - parole for a non-homicide , and several justices seemed openly hostile to this proposition .
Read more …
Instead , the justices seemed to be concerned that the youth of the defendant be given its proper weight when the sentencing judge makes his decision .
Few people would disagree with that proposition in the abstract .
I certainly do not .
Forming that principle into a constitutional rule that can be enforced by the federal courts is not easy , though .
In capital cases , the Supreme Court ’s 33 - year experiment with micromanaging sentencing procedure has produced great delays , enormous expense , and results no one is happy with .
The Court is keenly aware of that and will not want to go down the same road again .
This case may end with a simple statement that the Eighth Amendment proportionality principle already in place for non-capital cases requires explicit consideration of the defendant ’s youth as a major factor along with the nature of the crime and the prior offenses .
That would be an anticlimactic end to a case that has produced much heated debate , but it may be the best solution available .
In the companion case of Sullivan v. Florida , there is a good chance the Supreme Court will decide it does not have jurisdiction to reopen this 20 - year - old case .
The lawyer for Sullivan was immediately peppered from all sides with questions on that point , and it was page 14 of the transcript of the argumentbefore he got to say anything about the underlying question of the sentence .
Complicated Outcomes
Marc Mauer on what Justice Kennedy ’s questions might reveal :
Predicting how the Supreme Court will rule on a case is a risky business , and I ’m not a gambler .
The juvenile life - without - parole cases are in some respects more complicated than the Roper case , in which the court struck down the death penalty for juveniles .
In that case , the court would either find the practice unconstitutional or not .
In Graham and Sullivan , though , several outcomes are possible .
The petitioners in these cases , of course , contend that life - without - parole for a non-homicide should be found to be cruel and unusual in all cases , and that is one possible ruling the court might come to .
But the court could also find various middle ground positions .
One would be to establish an age limit below 18 - – say , 15 years — under which these sentences would not be permissible .
Yeah , there was a nude patch for L4D .
No , I did n't try it .
Yes , I saw some screenshots .
Zoey is right :
It is sort of creepy .
Her pants are missing but she 's still got her jacket and her gear .
She looks more senile than sexy .
Now that I 'm thinking of it , a mod where all four survivors run around without pants would be unstoppably hilarious as all of their in - game banter took on twisted double - meanings .
It 's unusual to see nude mods for a strictly first - person game , since by definition you do n't see yourself .
This means that you 'd have to jump into a game and leer at someone else being Zoey .
The last thing I would want is for one of my gaming buddies to inhabit the body of a naked girl .
That can't be good for either of you .
But now when I jump into a game and end up being Zoey I have to wonder :
Does this guy have the mod ?
Does he see me naked ?
Is he really covering me , or just staring ?
Why does he always make me go up the ladder first ?

When it comes to fighting marriage equality , seemingly no organization has deeper pockets than the National Organization for Marriage , which has announced that is now dumping a half - million dollars into its home state of New Jersey :
The National Organization for Marriage ( NOM ) announces a new $ 500,000 voter outreach campaign in New Jersey highlighted by the release of a new radio ad , “ Give Me a Break , ” which will begin running on targeted New Jersey radio stations today and will continue for at least two weeks .
“ NOM ’s voter outreach will include telephone calling , direct mailers , and online advertising to let voters know that Democrats are considering following Jon Corzine over a political cliff by pushing gay marriage in the lame duck , ” said Brian Brown , executive director of NOM .
The ad , “ Give Me a Break , ” underscores that Gov. Jon Corzine had four years to push a gay marriage bill , and the losing governor should not waste legislators ’ valuable time by pushing a gay marriage bill in the lame duck session when New Jersey voters expect elected officials to focus on far more urgent priorities , like jobs , the economy and the budget .
“ In the next two weeks NOM will spend $ 300,000 in voter outreach on the theme of this ad , including radio ad buys , direct mail , and online advertising , ” said Brian Brown .
“ We have reserved an additional $ 200,000 for advertising and direct mail outreach if the legislature continues to spend more and more of its time into December fooling around with a vote for gay marriage that New Jersey voters do not want . ”
The latest installment in NOM ’s New Jersey campaign will bring the total NOM has spent in New Jersey in 2009 in automated calling , radio and television ads , and direct mail voter outreach to more than $ 1 million .
Promises are made to be broken – especially if you ’re the boss .
Workers do n’t care so much about whether their employers deliver on specific promises , according to the latest research in organisational psychology .
What matters most are the rewards and opportunities they end up getting , even if they were initially promised more .
Most psychologists have assumed that broken promises in the workplace spell serious discontent .
But previous studies have tended to record workers ’ perceptions about such breaches , without determining what promises were actually made .
To disentangle perception from reality , Samantha Montes and David Zweig of the University of Toronto in Canada began by asking students to put themselves in the shoes of hypothetical job candidates .
Half the students were informed that the recruiter made seven specific promises – about bonuses , training , support with personal problems , and so on – while half were not .
Then the students read about what had happened to the imaginary employees three years down the line , when the employer had delivered all seven inducements , five or them , or just three .
Advertisement
More than 550 students clearly understood the scenarios described , yet their perceptions of the situations were influenced more by the number of inducements given than by whether any specific promises had been made .
On the job
Next , Montes and Zweig asked workers with a variety of occupations to fill in a questionnaire about their own expectations of how likely an employer was to deliver the same inducements , before running an experiment with the same hypothetical scenario .
Even after controlling statistically for prior expectations , more than 440 workers who completed the experiment delivered the same message : keeping promises matters much less than absolute rewards .
Montes argues that people ’s responses to such hypothetical situations – where it is possible to manipulate the outcomes in an ethical way – are likely to reflect what would happen in the workplace .
“ If you really get them to visualise themselves in that scenario , you can get very close reactions to how they ’d really behave , ” she says .
To confirm that a similar picture emerged in the real world , the researchers recruited students at the University of Waterloo in Ontario , Canada , who were enrolled on courses that included four months of paid work experience .
Before starting their placements , the students were asked to rate the promises they had been offered .
Three months into the job , more than 380 of the students reported what inducements they had in fact received , and the extent to which they felt promises had been broken .
Again , perceptions of broken promises depended mainly on what was delivered , rather than any discrepancy with what they earlier reported had eventually been offered .
Good faith
Montes hopes the results will encourage employers to concentrate on delivering good conditions and rewards , rather than promising workers next to nothing in the mistaken belief that delivering a little more than was offered will be appreciated .
But will unscrupulous recruiters see the findings as a licence to throw truth to the winds when making promises to prospective employees ?
“ I certainly hope it is n’t interpreted that way , ” says Montes .
“ If organisations took it upon themselves to make outrageous promises , employees will definitely start reacting . ”
Still , some degree of forgiveness for bosses who ca n’t meet their promises makes sense , suggests Lisa Schurer Lambert , an organisational psychologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta .
“ In a tough economy , employees know that things are n’t going to pan out the way that management said , ” she says .
“ If they see that management is making an honest , good - faith effort , given the constraints , they ’ll understand . ”

Method Man‘s [ click to read ] tax woes have escalated into a serious case which could see the rapper serving a substantial amount of jail time .
Early Monday morning , the Wu - Tang Clan member , real name Clifford Smith , was arrested in Staten Island after turning himself in on two counts of tax - evasion , having failed to pay almost $ 33,000 in taxes ( not including fees and penalties ) from 2004 through 2007 .
If found guilty of the most serious felony ( Repeated Failure to File Personal Income and Earnings Tax ) , Meth could spend four years in prison .
Staten Island ’s District Attorney Daniel Donovan , who is ensuring that the rapper be “ aggressively investigated and prosecuted ” said in a statement , “ Taxes are a burden all citizens share in a civil society , whether you ’re an average Joe on the street or a high - profile rap artist .
Because of the alleged action of people like Mr. Smith , law abiding citizens face higher taxes and reduced government services . ”
This past March , Meth‘s Lincoln Navigator was taken by the IRS for his failure to pay income taxes [ click to read ] .
After the incident , the rapper assured that it was not a lack of money that was stopping him from paying the fees , rather , it was partially his indifference .
“ I never opened [ the tax department ’s ] letters , ” he told NY Daily News in March .
“ So this is how the tax man came to Meth ’s house and took his truck .
Not because I was broke !
I got plenty of money . ”
Method Man is scheduled to be arraigned today , although there is little news about the scheduling of his court date .
Whats for supper ?
The Man-Eating Lions of Tsavo as depicted at the Field Museum of Natural History ( Image : Field Museum of Natural History )
When the food gets scarce , it ’s every lion for itself .
In 1898 , according to numerous accounts and no fewer than three Hollywood movies , two male lions went on a nine - month killing spree around the Tsavo area of Kenya , devouring between 28 and 135 workers building the Kenya - Uganda railway .
Now an analysis of bone and hair samples from the notorious duo has backed the theory that scarcity drives dietary specialisation , and shows that food preferences can diverge within cooperating groups .

By comparing the isotopic ratios of nitrogen and carbon in the lions ’ remains with that of contemporary lions , humans and herbivore prey , Justin Yeakel of the University of California , Santa Cruz , estimates the lions ate around 35 people .
The study also made a surprise finding .
“ One lion was consuming a lot of humans , and one was not , ” Yeakel says .
He attributes 24 deaths to one cat , or 30 per cent of its diet , and 11 deaths to the other , just 13 per cent of its food .
By the late 19th century , elephants in the area had been hunted away , causing grasslands to become overgrown woodlands and the number of ungulate prey to decline .
Most lions probably left the region , but two turned man-eaters , Yeakel speculates .
“ People are a dangerous food to go after , ” he says .
“ One lion was able to figure out how to do it and was n’t afraid , the other was not . ”

“ They shoot at us and we shoot back , ” said Staff Sgt. Erik S. , who , according to German military rules , could not be fully identified .
“ People are going to fall on both sides .
It ’s as simple as that .
It ’s war . ”
The sergeant added , “ The word ‘ war ’ is growing louder in society , and the politicians ca n’t keep it secret anymore . ”
Indeed , German politicians have refused to utter the word , trying instead to portray the mission in Afghanistan as a mix of peacekeeping and reconstruction in support of the Afghan government .
But their line has grown less tenable as the insurgency has expanded rapidly in the west and north of the country , where Germany leads the regional command and provides a majority of the troops .
The Germans may not have gone to war , but now the war has come to them .
In part , NATO and German officials say , that is evidence of the political astuteness of Taliban and Qaeda leaders , who are aware of the opposition in Germany to the war .
They hope to exploit it and force the withdrawal of German soldiers  splintering the NATO alliance in the process  through attacks on German personnel in Afghanistan and through video and audio threats of terrorist attacks on the home front before the German elections last month .

Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the senior American and allied commander in Afghanistan , is pressing NATO allies to contribute more troops to the war effort , even as countries like the Netherlands and Canada have begun discussing plans to pull out .
Germany has held out against pleas for additional troops so far .
IT HAS long been a puzzle that girls who grow up without their fathers at home reach sexual maturity earlier than girls whose fathers live with them .
For years , absent fathers have taken the blame for this , because growing up quickly has negative consequences for girls .
For example , early - bloomers are more likely to suffer depression , hate their bodies , engage in risky sex and get pregnant in their teen years .
It could be a simple matter of not having as many eyes , particularly suspicious fatherly ones , watching over daughters .
Or it could be a complicated physiological response to stress , in which girls adapt their reproductive strategy to their circumstances .
If life is harsh , the theory goes , maybe they need to get their babies into the world as quickly as possible .
The animal world suggests that the effect is not restricted to humans .
Young mice , pigs , goats and even a few primates get signals from their kin which inhibit sexual development ; a strange male in their midst , by contrast , really speeds things up .
Research in humans has shown that girls growing up with stepfathers mature even more quickly than fatherless girls and that stepbrothers have a measurable effect too .
However , Jane Mendle of the University of Oregon and her colleagues have suggested another putative cause : genes .
Specifically , the same genes that might make a dad more likely to leave his family could be behind early sexual development as well .
The researchers came to their conclusion after analysing data collected through the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth .
Dr Mendle looked at 1,382 boys and girls , each of whom was related to at least one other subject through their mother .
Most of the mothers were pairs of sisters , but some were identical twins or first cousins raised as sisters .
The NLSY surveys asked the mothers about many things , including whether the father of their children lived with them .
They were surveyed every year from 1979 to 1994 and then every second year .
From age 14 their children were given annual questionnaires , and asked if they had engaged in sexual intercourse yet .
What the researchers wanted to know was whether the age at which a young person first had sex was something that ran in the family — regardless of whether the father had been around or not .
To find out , they compared young people who had grown up without their dads with cousins whose dads remained at home .
If the environmental effect of a father 's absence was causing children to mature faster , they reasoned , that would show up .
It did n't .
In fact , the more closely related the cousins were — by having mothers who were identical twins , for instance , versus cousins — the closer their age at first sexual experience , says Dr Mendle .
The researchers found it was as true for boys as it was for girls .
They published their work in the current issue of Child Development .
Dr Mendle now suspects that the same genetic factors that influence when a child first has intercourse also affect the likelihood that they would grow up in a home without their dads .
What kind of genes could cause both ?
They could be ones that predispose a person to impulsivity , for instance , or sensation seeking .
Or they could simply be genes that cause early puberty , suggests Dr Mendle — leading to early sexual experimentation , unintended pregnancy and a partner you never really chose and do not want to spend your life with .
Sales of Pabst Blue Ribbon are up a whopping 25 percent this year , according to Information Resources Inc .
" Well , of course , " you say .
In this economy , consumers are looking for low - cost options , and cheaper beers are going to do better than more expensive ones .
But Pabst raised its prices last year and now it is n't as cheap as you may think :
The beer now costs $ 1.50 more than MillerCoors ' Keystone , $ 1 more than Anheuser - Busch 's Busch and Natural brands , and 50 cents more than Miller High Life , Crain 's reports .
Yet , despite being more expensive , PBR is doing remarkably better than all those brands in profits .
Pabst 's success actually comes from years before the recession .
Pabst managed to pull of a strangely effective word - of - mouth campaign that made the long - declining brand an " ironic downscale chic choice for bike messengers and other younger drinkers who viewed the beer as a statement of non-mainstream taste , " reports Crain's .
Let 's call a spade a spade :
Those " non-mainstream , " " younger drinkers " are hipsters .
Usually found smoking European cigarettes and / or cloves , hipsters are known for their despise of anything " mainstream " and their fondness for irony .
They listen to bands that no one has ever heard of and start fashion trends that are cool because of their " uncoolness " , e.g. , trucker hats or vintage plaid shirts .
This is where Pabst Blue Ribbon comes in .
" It 's an anti-establishment badge , " said a major market wholesaler .
" It seems to play to the retro , nonconformist crowd pretty well . "
Hipsters enjoy drinking a beer that is n't as " established " as other better - known brands , asserting themselves are more " genuine " and " unique " than the mainstream that surrounds them .
They should be careful though .
With the incredible rise in sales , Pabst Blue Ribbon could become so popular , it may enter the mainstream , and hipsters will have to abandon it in favor of another " cheap " beer .
Matt Bartosik , a " between blogs " blogger , will drink any beer you buy for him .

We know that A - team work like horses , but this tournament gives chances to B or C teams .
KeSPA probably have their foot on this .

Exactly , it 's ridiculous to think the teams themselves decided not to play .
Kespa is throwing a hissy fit over Blizzard taking back competitive Starcraft in SC2 , and , because Blizzard sponsored GOM season 3 , Kespa 's retaliating the best way possible , by trying to drive Blizzard 's best link to competitive SC as it stands out of business .
Not that I blame Kespa or anything , they 're out to make money , and could stand to lose a lot with the coming of SC2 , but it seems like it 's us and the players that lose due to this series of events .

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn .
Conditions in financial markets have improved further , and activity in the housing sector has increased .
Household spending seems to be stabilizing , but remains constrained by ongoing job losses , sluggish income growth , lower housing wealth , and tight credit .
Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing , though at a slower pace ; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales .
Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time , the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions , fiscal and monetary stimulus , and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability .
With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer - term inflation expectations stable , the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time .
In these circumstances , the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability .
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period .
To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets , the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $ 1.25 trillion of agency mortgage - backed securities and up to $ 200 billion of agency debt .
The Committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010 .
As previously announced , the Federal Reserve ’s purchases of $ 300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009 .
The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets .
The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted .
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were : Ben S. Bernanke , Chairman ; William C. Dudley , Vice Chairman ; Elizabeth A. Duke ; Charles L. Evans ; Donald L. Kohn ; Jeffrey M. Lacker ; Dennis P. Lockhart ; Daniel K. Tarullo ; Kevin M. Warsh ; and Janet L. Yellen .

The US military has allowed journalists into its newly expanded secret detention centre at Bagram air base in Afghanistan this week .
The base has been described by campaigners as Guantanamo Bay 's " more evil twin " and the allegations of torture and murder within its secretive walls continue to this day .
The US claims this is proof of its determination to provide greater transparency and openness in its policy of extraordinary rendition and detention without trial .
The claim was somewhat undermined by the fact that the touring journalists had no access to the hundreds of inmates held at the facility .
Omar Deghayes is one man who has personal experience of both Bagram and Guantanamo .
He was not impressed by US grandstanding .
He had seen it all before and has strong reason to doubt the announcement of improved conditions at Bagram .
Having suffered hellish torture there himself , he has now discovered that his brother - in - law has been detained at Bagram for the last two months and , if anything , he appears to have been treated even more brutally .
Deghayes was born in Libya in 1969 .
He was forced to flee the country with his mother and siblings after the torture and murder of his father by the Gadaffi regime .
Arriving in Brighton as a teenager , he went on to study law in Wolverhampton .
The family were granted refugee status here in 1987 .
In 2002 Deghayes was arrested in Pakistan and was " sold " to the US for a bounty .
He was taken first to Bagram and then Guantanamo , where he was imprisoned without trial for five years .
During his time at Guantanamo he was blinded in one eye , which was already damaged since childhood , after guards repeatedly rubbed pepper spray in it .
The only " evidence " against him was a clip from an Islamic propaganda film showing Chechen fighters , one of which the US authorities claimed was him .
It later transpired that the image was not of Deghayes but of an Abu Walid , a Chechan rebel who had been killed some time in 2004 .
Deghayes had in fact never been to Chechnya and had always maintained as much .
Speaking to the Morning Star , he gave his opinion on the US press tour of Bagram .
" This is how they manipulate things , " he says .
" I have experienced it personally at Guantanamo .
They gave guided tours of the camp like it was a tour of the Himalayas or something . "
In 2002 a group of congressmen were given a guided tour of " Gitmo , " albeit a much sanitised one .
Following his tour of the facility Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe told CNN : " We are giving very good treatment to these people .
" Quite frankly , I personally think better than they deserve .
We 're dealing with terrorists here . "
As if to complete the bizarre theme park atmosphere , each congressman was given a souvenir cap , a Guantanamo flag and a DVD of their visit to take home with them .
Select journalists were also given guided tours , reminiscent of this week 's at Bagram .
Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith , who represented Deghayes and many other Guantanamo prisoners , notes in his invaluable book Bad Men that , for one tour , " there was a show block in camp four ... there was a show interrogation cell in camp five , designed to make solitary confinement look like a private suite . "
He goes on to say that " various military personnel were wheeled out for interviews about one humanitarian highlight of the prison or another .
" Whenever an inconvenient question might arise , they could shelter politely behind the barricade of institutional security . "
Deghayes agrees .
" Those on the tour , the congressmen and reporters were not allowed to meet the prisoners .
They were shown all the new facilities and it was like a nice party for them .
" Then they went back and gave glowing reports about how good it all was there , " he says .
" It was only when a whistle - blower told the real story that they became aware of what it was really like .
" The Obama administration is just copying the same policy as Bush .
It is the same bureaucrats giving the same camouflage and using the same deceptions . "
Asked what credence he gave to the US claims of improved conditions at Bagram , he stated : " My brother - in - law is in Bagram now .
" He was just picked up a few months ago .
He went to visit his in - laws in Afghanistan and they arrested him .
" My sister was finally able to visit him and she said the conditions were even worse than when I was there .
" She said he was in very bad condition .
His eyes and face were battered and bleeding .
It is worse there now than it ever was .
" They are saying there are all these new facilities , but that is not the issue , " says Deghayes .
" The real issue is that they are subjecting people to brutal and inhuman torture . "
Perhaps the most perfidious aspect to the situation in Bagram is that the US has stated that Afghan nationals held there have no legal rights .
Foreign nationals held there are said to have " some " legal rights , but those imprisoned in their own country by an invading foreign power have none .
The only way to ensure the freedom of those who still suffer torture and indefinite imprisonment is for the people of the US , Britain and elsewhere to continue to campaign and vocally criticise the policy .
This is something Deghayes is keen to emphasise .
" When Obama came into power it was under a mandate of closing Guantanamo and stopping these abuses , but he has not done it .
He has not come up with any new system , " says Deghayes .
" There is no legal system , no court system in Guantanamo or Bagram .
" Everyone who has been released from either Guantanamo or Bagram has been released due to campaigning and pressure brought on their behalf , not by any legal system or by being found innocent .
Many people have been told they should have been released but are still there .
" I know from personal experience that campaigning is the only thing that works and we will continue to campaign for the release of my brother - in - law and all the others . "
Bagram 's brutal record
Bagram air base is located 27 miles north of Kabul and is estimated to house in excess of 600 prisoners .
The recent extension will bring the number of prisoners it can hold to over 1,000 .
The reason for this extension of the facility is seen by many to indicate an intention to increase US troop numbers and presumably therefore prisoners in the region .
The base was originally used to process prisoners during the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 - part of Operation Enduring Freedom .
But since then Bagram has been filled with detainees held for years without charge , trial or legal rights .
Unlike Guantanamo where , after a hard - fought struggle , US lawyers have been granted access to detainees , those incarcerated in Bagram remain in a legal black hole .
Since 2002 there have been numerous reports of torture and at least two cases of murder .
In one of the worst cases a taxi driver by the name of Dilawar was beaten to death there in December 2002 .
His body was found to have suffered over 100 savage blows to the legs , apparently for the sadistic amusement of guards .
The autopsy report said that his legs had become " pulpified " and that he had died from blunt force trauma .
Omar Deghayes described his time at Bagram as follows : " Lying on the floor of the compound , all night I would hear the screams of others in the rooms above us as they were tortured and interrogated .
" My number would be called out and I would have to go to the gate .
They chained me and put a bag over my head , dragging me off for my own turn .
" They would force me to my knees for questioning and threaten me with more torture . "
Once again today 's job numbers show Collectively , Economists Are A Perpetually Optimistic Lot .
Payrolls were expected to drop 175,000 , the median of 84 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of economists .
Forecasts ranged from decreases of 260,000 to 100,000 .
Jobs losses this month totaled 263,000 , worse than even the most pessimistic economist projection .
Actually , economists missed by another 13,000 because revisions subtracted 13,000 from payroll figures previously reported for August and July .
Moreover , the unemployment rate hit the highest level since 1983 .
Bloomberg discusses the above in U.S. Economy : September Job Losses Exceed Forecast .
What really caught my eye though is the expected backward revision coming February 2010 .
The Labor Department today also published its preliminary estimate for the annual benchmark revisions to payrolls that will be issued in February .
They showed the economy may have lost an additional 824,000 jobs in the 12 months ended March 2009 .
The data currently show a 4.8 million drop in employment during that time .
The projected decrease was three times larger than the historical average , the Labor Department said .
Most of the drop occurred in the first quarter of this year , probably due to an increase in business closings , the government said .
Birth / Death Revisions
At this point in the cycle birth death numbers should have been massively contracting for months .
The BLS is going to keep adding jobs through the entire recession in a complete display of incompetence .
“ Most of the additional job loss … appears to be due to in part to an increase in the number of business closings , ” said BLS Commissioner Keith Hall in a statement .
The BLS ’s birth / death model underestimated just how many businesses were folding — particularly during the January through March quarter — as the recession worsened .
Economists had been bracing for a downward revision , but not necessarily one of this magnitude , which means the U.S. has likely shed more than 8 million jobs since December 2007 .
For example , in a note Thursday , Goldman Sachs economist Ed McKelvey said he expected the revision to be “ on the order of - 150,000 to - 200,000 . ”
“ It ’s a huge number , much more than usual , ” said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight .
The government ’s models “ tend to assume dying firms get replaced , but that did n’t happen . ”
Mr. Gault said the revisions suggest the economy was doing even worse in the first quarter than previously assumed , and cast doubts on the recovery .

Prepare for bin Laden trial
Attorney General Eric Holder has decided to put five of the worst suspected Al Qaeda operatives on trial in New York City for the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
Human rights advocates were pleased , while conservatives , by and large , were outraged .
Advertisement
But the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed might be just the light drizzle before the hurricane .
What would happen if we captured Osama bin Laden alive ?
It could well happen , and sooner than you think .
The best minds in the counterterrorism world have long believed that bin Laden is hiding somewhere in the largely ungoverned frontier territories of Pakistan , near the Afghan border .
The unprecedented Pakistani offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan is the single best piece of news in our long hunt for bin Laden .
Thousands of Pakistani troops nearby could force bin Laden to move in a hurry , resulting in his exposure and capture .
The political stakes would be astronomical , for both Republicans and Democrats .
The immediate advantage would be with President Barack Obama , of course .
President George W. Bush got a momentary boost in the polls when Saddam Hussein was caught in his spider hole .
Getting bin Laden could mean a 20 - point jump in the polls for Obama .
Republicans would have to be very careful to be gracious about a capture of bin Laden during Obama ’s presidency .
In 2003 , when Saddam Hussein was caught , Howard Dean ’s poorly timed ( if accurate ) comment that it had n’t made America any safer was taken as sour grapes at a moment when Americans felt like celebrating .
Republicans would be very wise to uncork rhetorical champagne and spill praise on Obama , however much it pained them .
Some top Republicans made poorly timed ( if accurate ) observations that Obama did n’t deserve his Nobel Prize , comments that made them look like spiteful children .
They will look 10 times worse if they denigrate the president when bin Laden appears on our TV sets in chains .
Would Obama deserve credit if bin Laden were captured ?
Outside of the farthest tea bag fringe of American politics ( where the assumption will be that Obama , the secret Muslim terrorist , staged bin Laden ’s capture ) , it is a no-brainer .
If the recent offensive by the Pakistanis were even partially responsible for bringing bin Laden to justice , Obama ’s role in encouraging that action would justly be noted .
Even if bin Laden is captured by random chance , the unwritten rules of American politics will result in Obama rising sharply in the polls .
Just as presidents are often blamed for wars and recessions that they did not cause or start , they occasionally receive credit for events that they had little to do with .
But then would come one of the biggest decisions of Obama ’s presidency :
What do you do with bin Laden ?
Do you fly him back to the United States immediately and prepare him for a federal trial under U.S. law ?
Or a military trial ?
Where ?
Do you convene an international tribunal and try to recapture some of the world unity that existed on Sept. 12 , 2001 ?
Al Qaeda has killed hundreds from Kenya to Spain , so such a trial would seem appropriate .
Yet an international tribunal would probably take the death penalty off the table , and that would be unacceptable to many Americans .
But there ’s an even trickier question :
Do you interrogate him in secret , as was done with Mohammed , before any trial ?
After all , we would expect him to have a lot of useful information about planned attacks .
Given Obama ’s public disavowals of torture in any circumstance , harsh interrogation of bin Laden seems unlikely , for better or for worse .
Republicans would be swift to accuse Obama of caring more about international public opinion than getting vital information out of the leader of Al Qaeda .
One can just picture Rudy Giuliani asking if bin Laden will be read his Miranda rights .
After the initial excitement of the capture wears off , these partisan attacks might well begin to work for the GOP .
So , as they prepare for the first trials of men who allegedly had a role in the terrible attacks of Sept. 11 , administration officials might give a thought or two to how they would handle the question of justice for the greatest terrorist of all .

In 1947 the SS Asturias took the first post - war child immigrants to Australia
By Nick Bryant
BBC News , Australia
The story of the British child migrants sent to Australia has been described as a history of lies , deceit , cruelty and official disinterest and neglect .
Before being shipped out to Britain 's distant dominion , many of the children were told their parents were dead , and that a more abundant life awaited them in Australia .
Most were deported without the consent of their parents , and commonly , mothers and fathers were led to believe that their children had been adopted somewhere in Britain .
On arrival in Australia , the policy was to separate brothers and sisters .
And many of the young children ended up in what felt like labour camps , where they were physically , psychologically and often sexually abused .
' Awful experience '
In testimony before a British parliamentary committee in the late 1990s , one boy spoke of the criminal abuse he was subjected at the hands of Catholic priests at Tardun in Western Australia .
A number of Christian brothers competed between themselves to see who could rape him 100 times first , the boy said .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
They liked his blue eyes , so he repeatedly beat himself in the hope they would change colour .
As parliamentarians reflected at the time , the term " sexual abuse " seemed wholly inadequate given the awfulness of his experience .
On Monday the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will deliver a national apology to a group known as the " Forgotten Australians " .
In so doing , he will recognise , on behalf of the Australian government , the ongoing suffering of some 500,000 people held in orphanages or children 's homes between 1930 and 1970 .
At the same time , Mr Rudd will also say sorry to some 7,000 child migrants from Britain who live still in Australia - castaways of the empire .
The Australian government viewed them as ideal young immigrants - a popular slogan at the time was " the child , the best immigrant " .
The British government saw them as a burden on the state , and was happy to see them go .
I spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me
Sandra Anker Sandra
Anker was sent to Australia in 1950 aged just six years old - or " exiled " , as she prefers to think of it .
She thought she was being sent to Africa , part of a wild adventure , but she ended up in Melbourne .
" I spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me , " she told me .
" I was at a loose end for a very long time . "
Crying as she spoke , she says she was deprived of a childhood and a homeland .
" It took years and years of misery of not knowing where we'd come from , who were , being denied our birthright of being British .
" It 's really been horrendous .
And I would n't wish it on anyone ...
We need to be welcomed back to our homeland . "
Child immigrants often did not know where they were going to end up Like most British migrants here , she is incensed that the Australian government has decided to deliver a national apology , before the British government has done so .
" There has been no sorries , no righting the wrongs .
We 've suffered all our lives , and nobody 's listened .
I feel that someone has to listen and say sorry .
The British government has so much to answer for .
How in the hell were we supposed to get back and find our families ?
Where do you begin ?
Where do you begin ? "
Shame Attending the national apology in Canberra will be Margaret Humphreys , a former Nottinghamshire social worker who set up the Child Migrants Trust in 1987 after being approached to help track down a former child migrant 's family .
In 1992 , in recognition of her work in the field - helping " a lost tribe , " as she puts it - she was honoured by the Australians , which conferred on her an Order of Australia , a top civilian award .
But not Britain .
Gordon Brown should hang his head in shame
Harold Haig
International Child Migrants Association " The Australian government is delivering an apology when the British government has done nothing , " she complains .
Ahead of the national apology , the Australian government contacted about 400 British child migrants for advice on how it should be delivered .
All of them , she says , demanded that it should be accompanied by a British apology .
" What about Gordon Brown ? " she asks .
" This is disgusting .
They have abandoned us .
There is a huge feeling here that we are being abandoned by Gordon Brown . "
Ahead of Monday 's apology in Australia , sources within the UK government have told the BBC that Downing Street will now consult with child migrants groups with a view to delivering some of kind of apology in the future .
Up until now , the UK Government has funded travel so that British child migrants can be reunited with their families - although the Child Migrants Trust has complained that it only finances one visit , and that too many restrictions are placed on the reunion scheme .
It has also helped fund the Child Migrants Trust for the past 15 years .
That is nowhere near good enough for Harold Haig , the secretary of the International Child Migrants Association .
He is appalled that the Australian apology has come before any British apology .
" Look , it 's an absolute disgrace , " he told me .
" Gordon Brown should hang his head in shame .
He is allowing the country that we were deported to apologise before the country where we were born .
It is an absolute disgrace .
He should hang his head in shame . "
The Child Migrants
Trust is also unhappy that the Australian government is combining the apology with Australian - born children who were abused while they were in care .
They look upon themselves as a unique group with a distinct history .
Ahead of Australia 's national apology , the British Department of Health issued a statement saying that " [t ] he child migrants scheme was wrong , " which has been the government 's stance since 1998 .
The British government has said it is considering the implications of the Australian apology .

So , your Geek Squad application was turned down , and now your dreams of driving the ultimate Geek - Mobile have vanished like Minovsky particles in the wind ?
No worries , here are 10 geeky car mods and must - have car accessories–listed in order of increasing awesomeness –that will make you forget all about the blank space on your door where that flippin ’ sweet GS decal should be .
10 . WEDGE TECH : How To Break Into Your Car In Less Than a Minute
So , let ’s just say that you ’ve locked your keys in your car , and you do n’t have time to wait for a locksmith , and you ’d rather not smash the glass on your mom ’s La Sabre .
What to do ?
Simple .
You pull out your Emergency Locksmithing Kit you keep in your backpack for just such an occasion .
This kit includes one or two plastic wedges , a 3 to 4 foot long piece of sturdy wire ( with a 90 degree bend about half an inch from the end ) , and a rubber band .
Now , you use the wedge to pry open the space between the door and the window .
Then , having wrapped your rubber band around the end of your wire , you insert the tool and begin searching for the locking mechanism hidden inside the door jam .
When you find it , you ’ll be glad you had that rubber band handy to give you a good grip on the locking mechanism .
For first timers , it should take you 10 minutes tops to get this .
Pros ( who would predictably be very absent minded ) will be able to do this in less than a minute .
A full locksmithing tutorial is available here detailing the entire process .
8. Super Grip Dash Pad Keeps Your Stuff Stuck
Sometimes the simplest devices can also be the most useful .
Take for instance a dash pad .
It ’s just a rubber square , uses no adhesives of any kind , yet it ’s capable of keeping your iPhone , your keys , spare change , even your radar detector ( if you ’re into that sort of thing ) from sliding off your dash , even under spirited driving .
They are movable , washable , completely reusable .
And best of all , they ’re very affordable , with most kinds priced between $ 3 and $ 10 .
7. Get An OBD II
OBD stands for On - Board Diagnostics , and it ’s a system built into almost every car made after 1996 .
For those who have already done the geeky thing by installing a computer in their car , you can purchase a special cable that will allow you to monitor every sensor and read out in your car , real - time .
You think the Nissan GT - R’s PlayStation style gauges are cool ?
Well , now you can check the precise speed of your left front wheel .
You can keep track of datastreams ranging from horsepower and torque numbers at any RPM , to recording your own 0 - 60 runs and determining your actual fuel consumption rate .
Hate those check engine lights ?
With OBD II , you can run your own vehicle diagnostic , and determine whether your engine is indeed in peril , or if it ’s just a malfunctioning sensor , all without making a trip to your local mechanic .
5. One - Up BlueTooth With a State of the Art Voice Command Technology
Just a few years ago , bluetooth was cutting edge , and the hands - free operation of a cell phone connected to your car ’s electronics seemed like science fiction come true .
And recently , Ford ’s Sync technology have taken voice activation technology to the next level by integrating it into our entertainment systems .
But there is still more that can be done .
Take Galpin ’s Scythe , a Mustang GT that was the victim of a serious techno-orgy at the hands of Galpin Auto Sports to create their vision of the car of the future .
The Scythe features a Shuttle XPC onboard computer , which manages every function of the car and it entirely voice programmable .
You think lambo doors are cool ?
These reverse - opening vertical doors open on command .
And once inside , you ’ll notice something quite odd indeed : two steering wheels .
That ’s right , the Scythe can be driven from either the driver ’s side or the passengers side , all per voice command .
Given the word ( which may include “ please ” ) the Scythe will retract the driver ’s side wheel into the dash , and extend the passenger ’s side wheel to your guest eagerly awaiting the chance to unleash those 1,000 methanol - powered horses .
If that ’s not enough , the Scythe features a “ personal assistant ” connected through a digital uplink to a 3G network capable of relaying traffic and weather conditions , sports , news , and stock market updates real time , as well as managing your daily calender .
Other features include flush - mounted cameras that offer 24 hour monitoring of your precious vehicle via cellphone or computer .
Any way you look at it , the technology lavishly incorporated into the Scythe is available now .
And any geek determined enough ( and well financed enough ) is capable of recreating this technology in their own car .

4. Trade In Your Spinners For Osmos Orbital Wheels
While everyone else goes for bigger , larger , and flashier rims , why do n’t you try something a little different , and truly extraordinary ?
In the 1980s , Dominique Mottas , an avante gaurd entrepreneur and automotive enthusiast had a startling idea : reinvent the wheel !
It sounded ludicrous even then , and it took 10 years to reach his first patent , but by 1990 , Mottas had created a revolutionary new take on a very old idea .
The design is straightforward .
Reduce rotating mass and the number of working components to a bare minimum .
This is accomplished by hollowing out the wheel , and instead attaching the steering mechanism to the wheel directly via a stationary non-rotating section .
The rotating sections , including the brake discs and a central 300 mm rim all slide through this stationary bit .
Really , the layout is pretty obvious in the pictures .
There had been hubless designs postulated before , but Mottas ’ “ Osmos Orbital Wheel ” was an improvement over previous models .
And even today , we have been unable to truly unlock all the potential afforded this stunning technological achievement .
Benefits of a Orbital wheel versus a typical wheel are principally steering accuracy , reduced weight , and solidity .
But this design allows incredible braking advantages as well , as multiple brake discs may be installed in each wheel , and the orbital design reduces rotating mass while increasing cooling potential , allowing brakes to perform at optimum capacity for longer periods of time .
Orbital wheels vibrate less than typical wheels , lower the center of gravity in your car , and the empty cavities in each wheel provide free space for all sorts of new technology to fit .
They are also a sight better looking than the old models as well .
For a complete history of the Orbital wheel , and a full list of the advantages and applications of this technology , visit osmoswheel.com .
3. LAYAR : The World ’s First True ‘ Augmented Reality Browser ’
Okay , this one next one is purely speculatory , but it ’s based on the possible use of a state of the art program called Layar , a new mobile application being heralded as the first true ‘ augmented - reality browser ’ .
Layar uses your cell phone camera to overlay information on top of objects in the real world .
For instance , suppose you ’re in the market for a new house .
Activate your Layar application , and simply by pointing your camera phone at a house you ’re passing by , you could see if it ’s for sale , what it would be selling for , seller ’s information , and information on other houses nearby .
Or , you could be in the mall , and again , by using your camera phone , you could determine precisely where “ Tweets ” are coming from , where friends may be , and so forth .
Really , the benefits and possibilities attached to this program are obvious .
So then , what does this have to do with your car ?
Well , that ’s certainly open to debate .
You can certainly do all the same things with it as you could on foot , but the prospect of having an overlay interface at your fingertips from within your vehicle transforms your mode of transportation .
Depending on how accurate the technology is , you could feasibly keep track of your social network ( Facebook friends , Twitter feeds , etc. ) in a spatial format .
Instead of “ For Sale ” signs being posted in car windows as they drive by you , you could instantly download seller information right from your phone .
Are you lost ?
Instead of relying on turn - by - turn instructions , simply scan your horizons with the Layar equipped phone and discover that you ’re not nearly as lost as you thought you were .
There are certainly more uses , and no doubt Geekdom will find them .
And yes , expect a iPhone 3G S app this fall .
And for your convenience , here are two videos of the device in action :

2. Screw a Radar Detector , Get A Liquid Cooled Infra Sonic Wave Pulse Generator
There are some among you who may have no idea what the hell a liquid cooled infra sonic wave pulse generator is .
And you fear you ’re techno - savvy reputation is in jeopardy .
Well , you ’re in good company .
This gadget started making the rounds around the internet last year as the mysterious secret weapon of Audi R8 Blackbird , which is perhaps the most technologically advanced road - going stealth car ever built .
It was made for use in Bullrun races , an event where obnoxiously wealthy individuals compete in a no-rules contest to see who can go from New York to California the quickest .
Obviously , to do this , you need to bypass numerous hazards , including traffic , patrol men with nasty radar guns , and even gentle forest creatures roaming the roads at night .
The Blackbird comes equipped with a warehouse full of goodies , all of which have been well documented elsewhere .
But the true purpose of the little box in front has never been officially determined .
Most seem to think that it ’s some form of radar avoidance .
Others cite that infrasonic waves are a new form of non-lethal weapon which causes anxiety , fear , and hysteria in individuals exposed to it , meaning it may be used to clear motorists blocking the driver ’s way , or even deter animals from wandering into the car ’s path on roads near heavily wooded areas .
Finally , some think it is an IR light transmitter with a night camera attachment .
At speeds of 150 mph , headlights become useless .
So an IR camera would illuminate areas much further ahead than typical headlights , allowing a driver traveling at high speed to see what ’s ahead of him much easier and more clearly .
Whatever it is , it certainly looks menacing , and the mystery surrounding this one gadget is enough to whet the palate of any tech - loving autophile .
Here ’s a video of Alex Roy , another Bullrun race driver , giving the Blackbird a once over .
The most detailed write - up of this vehicle , along with the various possible uses of the generator , can be found over at RideLust .
1. Convert Your Car to Run On Trash
Finally , what could be a better way of flexing your Geeky brilliance than by recreating the Mr. Fusion from Back to the Future ?
Sure , a Flux Capacitor would be better , but converting your car to run on trash is comparatively much simpler than messing with the fabric of the space - time continuum .
While this may sound new , this technology is almost a seventy years old .
During World War II , over one million Europeans ran on board gasifiers to make fuel from food and wood while diesel and gasoline were rationed or otherwise unreliable .
Gasification uses heat to transform solid biomass into a “ natural gas like flammable fuel , ” and nearly any dry , solid , organic compound can be converted into a clean burning , carbon neutral , gaseous fuel .
If you ’re interested , there is an extremely detailed website with a step - by - step guide to helping you convert your own vehicle to run on trash , and save the world by reducing your dependence on fossil fuels as well as your carbon footprint .
It sounds complicated , and depending on how tech savvy you are , it may be .
But even an English major could , with a bit of patience , make this in his garage on weekends when they want a break from Ulysses .
Here ’s a video of a Honda Accord that ’s been outfitted with its own gasifier :
Finally , for all the DIY ’s out there interested in converting their own vehicles to run on trash , please head over to Instructables immediately .

The mechanical strength of epithelial tissue found in multicellular organisms as diverse as fruit flies , worms , and humans is likely bolstered by a type of covalent bond that has never before been seen in biological tissue , according to a new report .
Researchers led by Billy G. Hudson , a biochemist at Vanderbilt University , show that collagen IV protein networks — which provide structural stability to tissue — are reinforced by the newly unearthed sulfilimine bond : S=N ( Science 2009 , 325 , 1230 ) .
This “ highly unusual cross- link ” is a “ very exciting discovery , ” comments Hans Peter Bächinger , a biochemist who studies collagen proteins at Shriners Research Center , in Portland , Ore .
In epithelial tissue , which covers bodily cavities and glands , three strands of collagen IV assemble into ropelike helical twists , forming the equivalent of a brick in the proteinaceous scaffolding known as the extracellular matrix that surrounds cells .
Researchers have known for decades that these collagen bricks are connected chemically by some sort of “ mortar , ” but the nature of that mortar remained a puzzle , Hudson says .
Using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry , Hudson ’s team discovered that methionine and hydroxylysine residues at the ends of each of the three collagen strands in the helical twist are chemically cross - linked by a sulfilimine bond to other strands in a nearby collagen trimer .
The three sulfilimine connections bundle together six collagen IV molecules .
Bächinger notes that “ the discovery poses additional questions , ” such as whether the bond is formed by an enzymatic reaction and which enzymes do the work .
Pinpointing the enzymes , Hudson says , may provide clues to the origins of a rare autoimmune disease called Goodpasture ’s syndrome , which is characterized by bleeding in a patient ’s lungs .
Besides acting as structural reinforcement , collagen IV ’s sulfilimine bonds seem to block the immune system from reaching inside the extracellular matrix , the consequence of which kindles Goodpasture ’s syndrome , Hudson adds .
He suspects loss or malfunction of the enzymes that form the bond may be the molecular cause of this disease .

Swptember 16 , 2009 – Many law enforcement officers now say the drug interdiction effort is costly and unsuccessful .
The bulk of drug arrests in 2008 were for simple possession , almost half for marijuana .
The new statistics point to a continued emphasis on drug interdiction – otherwise known as the “ war on drugs ” – that more and more law enforcement officers are now questioning .
While many experts hold the anti-drug campaign to be the key reason for the decline in the crime rate in the US , especially violent crime , since the 1990s , these police officers , as well as current and retired judges and prosecutors see , instead , thousands of American lives ruined for small drug infractions in a costly and possibly unwinnable “ war . ”
“ Not only do these officers see the terrible results that their work has had on individuals ’ lives , but a lot of what I hear from beat officers and undercover narcotics agents is they ’ve seen colleagues die in the line of fire trying to enforce laws that have no positive impacts , ” says Tom Angell , a spokesman for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) in Washington .
“ For a lot of them , this is about trying to keep good cops alive by repealing stupid prohibition laws . ”
According to the latest FBI figures , 82.3 percent of all drug arrests in 2008 were for possession , and 44.3 percent of these for possession of marijuana .
Arrests totalled more than 1.7 million .
“ You can get over an addiction , but you will never get over a conviction , said Jack Cole , a retired undercover narcotics agent and LEAP director , in a statement Tuesday about the “ collateral consequences ” of the war on drugs .
Changing attitudes
The emergence of frontline officers speaking out against the war on drugs is helping to kindle a debate about legalization of drugs across the US , says Mr. Angell .
It is even driving a Congressional bill written by Sen. Jim Webb ( D ) of Virigina to establish a new Blue Ribbon justice system panel that would take a serious look at drug legalization .
The US could gain $ 77 billion in revenue a year by legalizing – and taxing – marijuana , cocaine and heroin , says LEAP .
Culturally , attitudes about drugs may be changing .
A Zogby poll in May showed for that the first time a majority of Americans favor decriminalizing marijuana .
States such as Massachusetts and California have already taken steps in that direction .
“ [ Most ] drugs are more readily available at lower prices today than when Nixon declared a war against it , ” says Norm Stamper , a former Seattle police chief and a staunch proponent of drug legalization , referring in part to the lower price of marijuana .
However , White House “ drug czar ” Gil Kerlikowske recently said , “ Legalization is not in the president ’s vocabulary and it ’s not in mine . ”
Sending the wrong message ?
Pro-legalization groups are missing the forest for the trees , says Gregory D. Lee , a retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent .
He says the dwindling crime rate across the US is directly correlated to the government ’s investment in border and street interdiction .
“ Legalization sends a message that it ’s okay to do drugs when in reality these drugs have a tremendous impact on the future of the people who take them , ” he says .
“ [ Under legalization ] , the crime rate would rise because of crimes committed by people under the influence of these substances . ”
Mr. Lee points to the rising price of cocaine in the US as a sign that domestic and international interdiction is working .
“ The war on drugs , ” he says , “ is being won . ” By Patrik Jonsson .

An XXX Look Into The Jessica Simpson And Tony Romo Relationship
Total Pro Sports – Ever wonder what caused Tony Romo to finally decide he had seen enough of Jessica Simpson ?
You would think the presence of Natalie Smith would be enough of a reason , but there appears to be more too it .
So what is with Jessica and all that fried chicken ?
Wait a minute !
That ’s not Jessica Simpson .
That ’s Jessica Simplton !
And Tony Romo seems to have been replaced by Tony Homo !
What is going on here ?
Most are familiar with the TMZ television show , which has brought us great clips such as Shaq ’s challange to Beckham , and LeBron James getting dunked on .
Now we would like to introduce you to TMSleaze , the x-rated parody of the popular celebrity gossip show .
In this episode , TMSleaze looked into the relationship between Simpson and Romo , and found that there was some extra-curricular activities going on in the Cowboys ’ locker room which involved fried chicken , greasy cock and balls , and the great Ron Jeremy .
Guess the chicken just did n’t provide a big enough bone for Jessica .
Maybe that is why Romo was never really on his game when she was around .

Editors Note : Women perpetrators of child maltreatment are represented by the pair of bars on the extreme left in each of the five graphs shown just above .
Women , so many researchers think , are as likely as men  if not more so  to commit child sexual abuse .
However , although we frequently become aware of the fact that women sexually abuse children , and even though common sense tells us that since they are from the same planet , communities and families as men , the graph on the extreme right of the set of five shown just above reflects that we are incapable of seeing the truth about women , namely , that women , too , are human .
Child Sexual Abuse by Women 
The invisible crime
The fact that women are as , if not more , likely than men to sexually abuse children is known to any child who was abused by a woman .
It is known to any teenager or adult who can and wants to recall such abuse .
Is it possible that the reasoning for not giving child sexual abuse by women any attention is that it is more benign , less harmful than that by men , perhaps less violent ?
Well , judge for yourself .
The preceding link will take you to an index of articles , studies , and to stories such as the following .
Summary of UK TV programme - Panorama - BBC1 - 10 pm Monday 6th October 1997
The sexual abuse of children by women was once thought to be so rare it could be ignored .
In this programme the victims tell a different story .
Summary
This was a vivid and horrific programme in which the victims of sexual abuse by women told disturbing stories of emotional and physical damage : Rape and attempted murder of a 12 year old boy by a 19 year old girl
Rape and abuse of a 12 year old boy over a two year period by a 28 year old mother of four
Rape and abuse of boys by their mother
Rape and abuse of girls by their mother
Women taking a lead role in pornographic violence and abuse
Children abused by nuns
Children abused at play group
Boy abused by lesbians
It was acknowledged that the scale and nature of these attacks had been severely underestimated and there were examples of women using excessive force with implements such as chair legs and cutlery .

ABC News Was Misquoted on Crowd Size ABC News reported D.C. rally size as tens of thousands , not 1 M to 1.5 M .
Sept. 13 , 2009  -- Conservative activists , who organized a march on the U.S. Capitol today in protest of the Obama administration 's health care agenda and government spending , erroneously attributed reports on the size of the crowds to ABC News .
Matt Kibbe , president of FreedomWorks , the group that organized the event , said on stage at the rally Saturday that ABC News was reporting that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance .
At no time did ABC News , or its affiliates , report a number anywhere near as large .
ABCNews.com reported an approximate figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters , attributed to the Washington , D.C. , fire department .

As a result of Kibbe 's erroneous attribution , several bloggers and commenters repeated the misinformation .
In his blog , Kibbe apologized Sunday for the mistaken attribution of the crowd - size estimated to ABC News .
" With a dead IPhone , I had been shown tweets from a number of different folks behind the stage citing the ABC estimate , " he wrote .

The ...
For the subjects in the Calerie experiment , there was little about their diets that seemed freakish .
They ate normal foods , hosted dinner parties for friends and generally went about their lives normally .
The subjects do not represent a cross section of American society , however .
Whereas 66 percent of Americans are currently classified as overweight or obese , no one allowed into the study was seriously overweight by medical definitions : everyone began the experiment with a body - mass index that fell within a normal to slightly overweight range of 22 to 28 .
There were scientific reasons for this .
The effects of calorie restriction may simply be an evolutionary legacy , “ a metabolic , hormonal and molecular adaptation ” to a world of sparse resources , as Luigi Fontana , one doctor in charge of the Washington University trial who also holds a position at the National Institute of Health in Italy , described it to me .
By slowing aging and increasing resistance to disease during periods of food scarcity , the adaptive responses to fewer calories increased the odds that animals and humans that lived short lives might survive until they could reproduce .
In laboratory settings , calorie restriction seems to “ work ” — that is , it seems to influence primary and secondary aging — when the diet of an animal of normal weight is curtailed by a significant percentage .
The degree of calorie restriction can’t exceed 50 percent , which is when laboratory animals begin to die .
Until that point , however , the more severe the calorie - restriction regimen , the greater the health benefit — a lifespan 50 percent again as long in studies on mice and rats .
These results might not apply to the overweight .
As Fontana told me , moving a heavyset person ’s body - mass index from , say , 35 to 29 might increase his longevity by reducing the risk for diseases like diabetes .
Yet it is not “ triggering the anti-aging pathways ” that have been observed at the cellular and molecular levels in animals of normal weight when placed on a calorie - restricted diet .
And why set the restriction at 25 percent ?
Why not 20 percent ?
Or 30 percent ?
Or why not reduce calorie intake by 10 percent and increase exercise ( and calories burned ) by 15 percent , so that a subject ’s calorie deficit still equals about 25 percent ?
All were viable options .
But the study ’s architects determined that 25 percent was both humanly feasible and , based on data from previous experiments , could have noticeable effects on the rate and diseases of aging .
It is possible , meanwhile , that a sustained decrease in calories coupled with a sustained increase in exercise might have a potent effect on aging ( at the moment there are no large - scale studies under way , Fontana told me ) .
Such a combination , however , could complicate efforts to understand , in isolation , the effects of calorie restriction on humans .
The researchers in Boston , Baton Rouge and St. Louis screened the Calerie recruits in ways other than body - mass index .
They looked for subjects who were motivated and highly organized — desirable traits if you have to keep a journal record for two years of every morsel of food you eat .
They sought people who had strong moral support at home .
They ruled out anyone who counselors surmised might have a predisposition toward anorexia or bulimia — disorders that might conceivably be triggered by the new diet .
They also wanted participants who had stable jobs without too much travel , yet were flexible enough to allow them to visit the hospital centers weekly for weigh - ins , counseling and medical tests .
All the subjects are being paid : $ 5,000 at Tufts and Pennington , $ 2,400 at Washington University .
But screeners rejected those who said they were attracted to the study for the money — an unnecessary precaution , perhaps , given that enrollment in Calerie is effectively an arduous part - time job that pays third - world wages .
“ I figured out that $ 5,000 for two years for the 70 times I have to come in here worked out to a dollar an hour , ” Tom Jacobs , a participant at Tufts , told me .
Getting someone started on a calorie - restriction diet is far more involved than it might first appear .
For the past seven years , Fontana has been collecting data on about 50 members of the Calorie Restriction Society ; Fontana estimates that these men and women have cut their calories by 25 to 30 percent .
Yet this ca n’t be said with precision or authority .
Nor is it clear what their prediet biomarkers or vital signs were .
At the start of the Calerie experiment , a first order of business was to rigorously determine how many calories each recruit ate and burned on a typical day .
This required a methodical ( and expensive ) two - week laboratory test : participants drank water containing rare isotopes that , when excreted and analyzed , allowed researchers to discern a subject ’s carbon - dioxide production ( and his or her calorie burn ) to a precise degree .
After that , each subject received an individualized target .
Most of the subjects I spoke with called this the Number .
At the start , researchers determined that Doug Hansen burns ( and thus ingests ) what he told me was around 2,600 calories a day .
So he was put on a diet of 1,950 calories .
Jeffrey Peipert , an Ob - Gyn who is nine months into the study in St. Louis , was found to burn 3,300 a day — and thus given a number of just under 2,500 .
Many of the women , meanwhile , required far fewer calories .
Liz Ewen , a molecular biologist who is 18 months into the Tufts study , told me her number was 1,670 calories , down from 2,226 .
It seemed a common experience that no one had any idea before the study began what his or her caloric requirements were .
“ My wife and I both took a guess and we both got it wrong , ” Peipert told me .

At the start , the subjects were informed that although they would receive help with menus and recipes from the study ’s dieticians , they would be responsible for buying and cooking all their own meals for the next two years .
For each participant ’s first 28 days , however , all meals and snacks are free , custom cooked ( based on each individual ’s calorie requirements ) and packaged in large coolers to be picked up every few days and taken home .
“ That way we can be sure the subjects are getting the exact dietary prescription while they ’re learning how to do it , ” Morgan Schram , the study manager in St. Louis , told me .
The great challenge , at least for that first month , is to create food for the subjects that is simultaneously satiating , appealing and — most crucially — low in calories .
At both Tufts and Washington University , meals for new participants are prepared in facilities that resemble laboratory - kitchen hybrids .
The food is not particularly exotic : Mediterranean - style combinations of fish with Greek - style potatoes , for instance , or sweet - and - sour chicken with rice .
Whether the meals are bad or good is somewhat beside the point .
The meals are precise .
When I visited the kitchen in St. Louis , a nutritionist was cooking and weighing , to a tenth of a gram , each ingredient of a dish of farfalle with pesto and diced chicken .
Most of the recipes seem to steer participants toward foods that are nutrient - rich but low in calories , or what dieticians refer to as “ low in energy density . ”
A number of recent experiments — notably by Barbara Rolls at Penn State — demonstrated that humans tend to eat a consistent weight of food from day to day , but not necessarily a consistent number of calories .
For the Calerie study , this has proved a useful tool in the defense against hunger .
By building a diet around foods with a low - energy density , especially vegetables , fruits and soups , participants can conceivably ingest the same weight of food as they might on a regular diet while taking in fewer calories .
Apples are superb in this regard .
At the medical centers running Calerie , you see a lot of people walking around eating apples .
Even subjects who disliked apples have discovered that calorie restriction , which generally has the effect of making food taste better , has given them a surprising desire for the fruit .
By contrast , alcohol — many calories , not much nutrition — is n’t much use at all .
But it is n’t expressly forbidden .
If you wish , you can indulge in drinking or in energy - dense foods ( nuts or sweets , for instance ) , but probably not both nor in excess in either case .
“ I enjoy a regular glass of wine or drink at the end of the day , ” Peipert said .
“ But I think what I ’ve learned on this diet is that I enjoy food more .
I ’d rather have a Häagen - Dazs bar at 190 calories than a gin and tonic at night at 170 . ”
Conservative Counter - Revolution and the Coming Violence
Since the introduction of Sarah Palin into the 2008 election , the right wing has been on the warpath .
The rhetoric and volume of their message has been taken to increasingly fanatical extremes in an attempt to derail the movement for change and reform in America .
This has already resulted in many deaths , and the conflict is becoming more open with every passing day .
Revolution
The country has changed .
The majority of the last 30 years was dominated by an increasingly conservative political philosophy .
During the Bush years , the real world failures of these policies began to appear in undeniable forms .
The prison industry continued to boom under increasingly harsh laws until one out of every thirty two Americans was either behind bars or on probation , the highest rate in the world .
Borrow and spend economics to fuel tax cuts for the rich and the illusion of prosperity brought mounting deficits and debt .
Much of this money went into a burgeoning military , and today we spend almost as much as the rest of the world combined .
The gulf between rich and poor got much worse , especially with CEOs who now rake in 1 /3rd of all the pay .
Then came the domestic espionage , extraordinary rendition , torture , abandonment of diplomacy , massive foreign military aggression , and discarding of international treaties .
The thing that really caused Americans to wake up was the culmination of turning a blind eye towards corporate mergers , spiraling foreclosures caused by catastrophic health care costs , and the loosening of regulations that led to the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression .
This was the final straw , and there was a paradigm shift in the American electorate back towards a more centrist philosophy .
The elections of 2006 brought a swing back to the Democrats , who regained tenuous control over the US House and Senate .
In 2008 , progressive voices swept into power in a movement for change that included a center - left reformer named Barack Obama , who became the nation ’s first black president .
The revolution had come .
Counter - Revolution
Fear leads to anger .
The rhetoric during the election from the Republicans took a nasty turn as soon as Sarah Palin hit the scene .
They amped up the negativity and scare tactics , insinuating Obama was in league with Islamists , terrorists , socialists , communists , Marxists , and various other ‘ ists ’ .
Many people argued that this was ‘ just politics ’ , but after the election , and especially after the inauguration , the attacks did n’t go away .
In fact , they were elevated to a whole new level .
There were those who spread the conspiracy that Obama was foreign born , thereby ineligible to be president .
More conspiracies circulated about Obama wanting to take people ’s guns away , despite his expansion of the 2nd Amendment .
Rumor persist about massive tax hikes , despite him actually delivering a few hundred billion in tax cuts for 95 % of Americans as part of the stimulus package .
Recently the paranoia has reached epic levels , with conspiracies about the health care reform bill being some secret plot to kill grandma .
Many of these paranoid conspiracies and corporate disinformation talking points began to get traction in the media , especially the propaganda arm of the Republican Party : Fox News .
They had begun to try to delegitimize the president and dehumanize opponents .
The counter - revolution was taking form .
Republican conservatives tried to avoid the blame for their failed policies by suddenly hiding behind the libertarian banner .
They started taking over the Tea Parties and purging genuine libertarians from the leadership roles , leading to a growing rift between the two .
The claim of non-partisanship has been rocked recently by open sponsorship of the Tea Party Express by a Republican PAC .
Most importantly , libertarian social and foreign policy views such as getting the government out of marriage ( in essence legalizing gay marriage ) , more open borders and free flowing immigration , separation of church and state , de-militarization , abortion rights , legalizing marijuana , and repealing the Patriot Act are being openly attacked and replaced by more traditional GOP messages .
The same right wing voices that shouted the loudest in support of George W Bush , the more hard - line members of his administration , and the disastrous policies were bitter about losing power .
They wanted their country back , and were determined to do nearly anything to regain it .
The Rise of Right Wing Hate
Anger leads to hate .
All of this deliberate fear mongering has had a measurable effect .
There has been a chilling rise in right wing hate around the country .
President Obama receives an average of 30 death threats per day , a 400 % increase over Bush .
Conservative websites have called for a Honduran style military coup , offered a list of Democratic Senators to assassinate , and sold merchandise about Obama featuring Psalm 109:8 which reads : “ Let his days be few ; and let another take his office .
Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow .
The militias are back and recruiting like mad , one of them even demanded Obama leave the country .
Hate groups are on the rise .
The Oathkeepers are recruiting law enforcement and military members with a pledge that removes any loyalty to the president .
Pastor Steven Anderson virtually issued a fatwa on Obama , and members of his flock arrived at a Phoenix rally with loaded assault rifles .
Many have compared the current atmosphere to that which existed prior to the assassination of JFK .
Others say it feels eerily similar to the way things were before Timothy McVeigh blew up the Oklahoma Federal Building , killing 168 people .
Violence Erupting
Hate leads to suffering .
This conservative incitement is being used a political tool to try and energize the base while simultaneously creating apathy for everyone else to politics in the hopes that they can retake congress in 2010 , thereby hamstringing Obama and killing any potential reforms .
The conflict is spreading to more mainstream parts of America .
The hijacked Tea Party movement is staying mobilized so they can keep boots on the ground and forcibly oppose any reforms that are in the works , from health care reform to immigration reform to worker ’s rights to equal rights for LGBT folks .
Where this gets very dangerous is this : although this is the exact same playbook the Republicans used in 1994 , this time around progressive voices are not give up and going to stop seeking reform .
The winds of change have happened , there has been a generational shift , and strong progressive groups are pushing back against this intimidation on the street and in town halls , mobilizing their own people to come out in support of reform .
These confrontations on the street have already led to violence .
In St. Louis , Missouri Kenneth Gladney was involved in a scuffle with SEIU members after allegedly punching Reverend Elston McCowan .
Then there was a fight in Thousand Oaks , California where a mans finger was bitten off after punching a counter protester in the nose .
Most recently , two members of the anti-racism group ANSWER were involved in an altercation with 2 Tea Partiers rallying against undocumented immigrants in Ft. Lauderdale , Florida .
In each case , the conservative media quickly pounced on the stories before all the facts were in , and unjustly laid the blame entirely on pro-reformers , as if to use it as a rallying cry .
This is powder keg waiting to go off , and short of a massive police presence at each demonstration , there will be potential for conflict every time .
Beyond this , as a consequence of riling up their base in this counter - revolution , the Republicans are also fueling the violent extremists .
By effectively dehumanizing the reformers , the conservative media is giving justification to those who have already let the hate in their hearts take over .
For instance , the FBI reports a sharp increase in anti-gay hate crimes .
This polarization and sharp division is not good for the country , and can best be summed up in the words of Jon Stewart , “ conservatives hate Obama more than they love America . ”
This right wing hate has resulted in at least 8 acts of domes­tic ter­ror­ism in the US since Obama was sworn in , including the assas­si­na­tion of Dr. Tiller in his church by a man affiliated with Operation Rescue and the slayings at the Holocaust Memorial by the right wing racist James von Brunn .
Add to this the census worker who was hanged in Kentucky , and had the word ‘ FED ’ carved into his chest , and a pattern begins to emerge that proves these are not isolated incidents , they are symptomatic of more dangerous condition that is being fed by hate speech .
2010
This situation is getting worse on all fronts , and all signs point to an increase in violence in the coming year .
The instigation by various right wing elements continues to grow , as shown in the recent string of billboards going up .
Fox News continues its campaign of fear mongering and disinformation .
The voices for open revolt are growing on websites such as Stormfront and the FreeRepublic as well .
One commentator on a digg thread wrote : “ They dont have guns .
They wont dare leave the safety of the big cities .
The right will be able to starve them out by laying seige to the cities . ”
Firearms and ammunition sales have seen explosive growth as a result of this increasing paranoia which seems to seek an all out civil war , or at least an Operation Condor type of repression of reformers .
Further Tea Parties are going to happen over more charged issues than health care reform , and counter demonstrations are going to be right there next to them .
Due to the intolerance demonstrated by anti-reform forces , this could easily turn ugly fast .
In addition to that , as long as the fear campaign and conspiracies continue to be propagated , right wing extremists are not going to stop anytime soon either , and there promises to be more mass shootings as the 2010 midterm election ramps up .
Fear leads to anger .
Anger leads to hate .
Hate leads to suffering .
Editor 's note : Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN , appearing regularly on CNN's " The Situation Room , " " Campbell Brown , " " AC360° " and " State of the Union With John King , " as well as during special event coverage .
Gloria Borger says Republicans complain about Obama as they look for ways to avoid responsibility .
( CNN ) --
Every president believes , upon election , that his term of service will be transformative .
Some , like Barack Obama , actually campaign on the idea : that his brand of leadership and force of personality are so persuasive that they will change the way the world ( aka Washington ) does business .
" We are the hope for the future , " the candidate told a crowd before his huge wins on Super Tuesday last year .
" [ We are ] the answer to the cynics who tell us our house must stand divided . "
How has that worked out for the new president ?
No Republican votes in the House on the economic stimulus package ; a handful in the Senate .
No real help in the House on health care reform ; a single GOP vote , so far , in the Senate .
On Afghanistan , GOP applause when he sent more than 20,000 troops at the beginning of his term .
Now , Republican predictions of outright catastrophe if the president does n't send 40,000 more ASAP .
The math is a simple GOP political calculation :
The economy ?
Obama owns it .
Afghanistan ?
It 's his war .
No new president ever seems to believe that the loyal opposition will totally shut down .
After all , when Ronald Reagan came to Washington , even the liberal top Democrat Tip O'Neill allowed him the latitude to pass his tax cuts .
( We 'll give 'em enough rope ... " was the infamous O'Neill refrain . )
Sure , some GOPers complain that Obama let the liberals hijack his agenda -- and , in some instances , they 're right .
But mostly , their arguments have just been a rationale as they look for ways to leave no fingerprints .
It 's always easier to run to the hills and shout " no " from safe terrain .
Republicans have predictably gained some political traction with their " he's-a- big- spending - liberal " Obama narrative .
And there 's no doubt that House Democrats from moderate districts are increasingly at risk , given the burgeoning deficit .
Sill , Republicans have n't exactly been reborn , either .
Consider this : A new Washington Post / ABC news poll Tuesday reports that only 20 percent of Americans now consider themselves Republicans -- the lowest number in 26 years .
That 's not exactly a national vote of confidence .
So now comes the tipping point .
It 's almost one year , and Obama 's economic plan has been hatched .
The result ?
While Wall Street and some banks are coming back , the jobs and home loans are not .
It 's trouble for the Democrats .
As for health care and Afghanistan , more trouble ahead .
Assuming the president gets some kind of reform by Christmas , it wo n't be everything he wanted , but it will be more than enough fodder for Republicans to rip apart , piece by piece .
For deficit hawks , it will inevitably cost too much .
For seniors , there will be complaints it will raise Medicare costs .
And on and on .
Afghanistan is another conundrum preoccupying the president .
Send more troops , and liberal Democrats are horrified .
Send fewer than 40,000 troops for at least $ 40 billion -- as requested by the generals -- and Republicans will tag Obama as a weak commander in chief .
( Some of these are the same Republicans , by the way , who do n't want to add a penny to the deficit . )
The problem set is enormous :
How to set a broken economy on a path of growth while fixing high unemployment .
How to fix a broken health care system with 46 million uninsured .
How to fix a war in which it may already be too late to succeed .
Sad how the calculations work , though .
The more complex the political problems , the more simple the opposition math :
If it 's tough , disappear .
That may work for now and the midterm elections .
But when it 's time to challenge Obama , there 's more simple arithmetic to consider :
It 's hard to beat something with nothing .

Fortaleza has had problems with sex tourism in the past
There is growing controversy in Brazil over the arrest of an Italian tourist held after kissing his eight - year - old daughter in public .
Witnesses told police the man allegedly touched the girl in an intimate way .
Under a strict new law partly designed to combat child sex abuse in South America 's largest country , he faces eight to 15 years in jail if convicted .
The unnamed man has been in custody for almost a week .
A new attempt to secure his release this weekend failed .
His Brazilian wife says the case is all a misunderstanding , while staff at the resort where the incident took place have been reported as saying they saw nothing unusual .
' Misunderstanding '
The Italian tourist , a 48 - year - old businessman , was arrested on 2 September in the coastal city of Fortaleza , in the north - east of Brazil , where he was on holiday with his wife and daughter .
He was reported to the police by a Brazilian couple who claimed he had been touching a young girl inappropriately and had kissed her on the mouth while they were both at a swimming pool close to the beach in full view of other tourists .
It appears the couple who made the allegations did not know that the man was with his daughter .
The north - east of Brazil has for some years had a problem of paedophiles travelling to the area , often from overseas , and strongly - worded warnings about the penalties for exploiting children are posted in most hotels .
However the wife of the arrested tourist says it was all a misunderstanding by witnesses who had misinterpreted seeing a foreign white man with a young darker - skinned girl .
She told the Brazilian state news agency if there was any suggestion the claim was true she would not hesitate to take her daughter 's side , and recalled that she had been present the whole time .
The woman said the allegations had the potential to destroy her family .
Under strict new legislation passed only last month the offence of molesting a child under the age of 14 can carry a penalty of between eight and 15 years in jail .
The arrested businessman - who had been due to return to Italy with his family last week - remains in custody , and it is thought another attempt to secure his release will be made on Tuesday .

Round 1 : About a week ago , Verizon launched a commercial pointing out all the features that the iPhone does n’t have but that the upcoming Motorola Droid will have , such as a 5 megapixel camera and “ widgets ” , whatever that means .
And adding insult to injury , if you want to call it that , Verizon laced their commercial with some hip / indie / pop music that ’s been Apple ’s bread and butter when it comes to TV commercials .
Round 2 : An Apple fan taps Verizon on the shoulder and lets them know that he and other iPhone users are n’t afraid of Motorola ’s upcoming Droid , and to drive the point home , he decided to create a spoof of Verizon ’s commercial , which itself happens to be a spoof of an Apple commercial .
Get all that ?
Check out the video below , titled “ iDo n’t Care ” :
Very well done , with a pretty hilarious and self - deprecating ending .
And in case you were wondering ( we were ) what song is playing in the above video ( which is the same one Verizon uses ) , it ’s called “ Magic ( Oh Oh Oh ) ” by MoZella , a female songwriter based outta Detroit .
Sidenote : sort of an ironic name for the artist , Mozella ..
maybe there ’s a rival artist in town called WebKet ??
You can check out Verizon ’s original commercial below if you wanna contrast and compare .
AND , if you just ca n’t get that song out of your head and do n’t want to splurge on iTunes , we ’ve gone the extra mile and found the music video for Magic , which you can play endlessly on repeat below .
Overhead in one or more of your database tables can cause your database to perform poorly .
It can also cause other issues like Fatal Errors .
One of the more common fatal errors is memory allocation which can be easily fixed .
I will explain a fast way to solve for this issue , but let ’s start optimizing .
phpMyAdmin
Here are the steps to follow in phpMyAdmin
1 . Go to your web hosting account ’s cPanel and click the “ phpMyAdmin ” icon .
If you do n’t see one , look for “ MySQL Databases ” icon , click it , scroll to the bottom of the page , and click the “ phpMyAdmin ” link .
2. Select your WordPress database .
3 . Look in the “ Overhead ” column .
If you see a table with overhead , select that table by clicking on the box to the left .
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and in the drop down menu select “ Optimize Table ” .
5 . Once the table is optimized , you should n’t see any number in the Overhead column .
Click the Back button twice ( to go back to the tables list ) , and repeat from step 3 to remove any other tables that have overhead .
How to Fix Fatal error : Allowed memory size
Method 1 : You can assign the memory limit to any amount you like by changing the 16 M to other number , such as 32 M or 64 M .
64 M will set the memory limit to 64 megabytes .
To change the memory allocation limit permanently for all PHP scripts running on the server , modify the PHP.INI configuration file of the server .
Search for memory_limit after opening the file in an editor .
If the memory_limit does n’t exist , add the following line .
If it ’s there , modify the value of the memory_limit : to ;
memory_limit = 64 M .
If you do not have access to your PHP.ini file , there ’s another method you can try .
Method 2 : Add the following to wp - config .
php right before the ‘ stop editing ’ comment :
ini_set ( “ memory_limit ” , ” 64 M ” ) ;
I have tested this in WordPress 2.8.4 and it worked like a charm .
I recently met an entrepreneur who was raising money for his startup .
Six months prior , he had raised seed money (
As a potential investor , the first question I asked him is “ is the big venture firm following on ? ”
The answer was no .
What this means is the entrepreneur is going to have a * really * tough time raising any more money at all , because what all potential investors think is “ if this top VC that has hundreds of millions of dollars and knows this company the best does n’t want to invest , why would I ? ”
What the entrepreneur did n’t realize is that when you take any money at all from a big VC in a seed round , you are effectively giving them an option on the next round , even though that option is n’t contractual .
And , somewhat counterintuitively , the more well respected the VC is , the stronger the negative signal will be when they do n’t follow on .
Even in the good scenario when the VC does wants to follow on , you are likely to get a lower valuation than you would have had you taken money from other sources of funding ( angels , micro - VCs like Y - combinator ) .
This is n’t obvious if you have n’t done follow - on fundraising before , but I ’ve observed it first hand many times .
The reason is you wo n’t have the freedom to go out and get a true market valuation for your company .
Suppose you have venture firm X as a seed investor and they offer you , say , a $ 6 M pre money valuation for your follow on round ( usually called the Series A ) .
Suppose furthermore that if you were free to get a competitive process going that the “ true valuation ” for your company would be more like $ 10 M pre .
If you now go to another firm , Y , and pitch them , one of the first questions is going to be “ Is X investing ? ”
You say yes , X has made you an offer .
Now what Y is thinking is either 1 ) “ I should call up X and offer to co-invest at $ 6 pre , ” thereby keeping you at an artificially low valuation , or 2 ) if that ’s not an option ( e.g. because you already have 2 VCs in the deal , because X does n’t think Y is a high quality enough firm to co-invest with , etc ) Y is going to hesitate to offer you a term sheet , for fear of being used as a stalking horse .
This is industry lingo for when the entrepreneur uses firm Y to get a higher priced term sheet which X then matches and excludes Y .
VCs really do n’t like to be used as stalking horses .
So what having a big VC in as a seed investor does is prevent you from getting a competitive dynamic going that gets you a true market valuation .
Why are big VCs doing this ?
If you have a , say , a $ 200 M fund , spending , say , 5 % of your fund to get options on 50 companies is a great investment .
You could look at this from an options valuation perspective ( seed stage startups have super high volatility – the key driver of options price in the Black - Scholes valuation model ) .
More simply , just think of it as “ lead gen ” for venture capitalists .
Basically big VCs are spending 5 % of their budget generating captive leads for their real business : investing $ 10 M into a companies at the post - seed stage .
These seed programs are relatively new so we are only starting to see the wreckage they will eventually cause .
I predict in a few years , after enough entrepreneurs get burned , what I ’ve said above will be conventional wisdom .
Unfortunately there are a lot of good companies that will die along the way until that happens .
Disclosure : I sometimes compete with big VCs for investments , so I am not disinterested here .
I published the last post at Open Salon also , where a jerk irresponsible person named neilpaul commented ,
I think the NYT article on Sunday [ the Peter Singer piece I wrote about here ] about rationing has to be mentioned here .
Jindal is relying on irrational fear of rationing among his followers to blind them to the bullshit aspects of his arguments .
When people are terrified , they will believe any damned argument .
When I say fear of rationing is irrational , it is not because there wo n’t be any in the future .
There will be .
The fear is irrational because it will happen under any system and because rationing is n’t all that bad .
It will actually make the system work better .
As for the rationed , it will mostly be the elderly and they already had a good shot at life and have less to complain about than those who died young .
So this genius , have correctly understood that fears of rationing are irrational , goes and ahead and suggests that the right way to go about it is to withhold care from older folks .
Yes , that will calm everyone down .
However , since I could not persuade him to STFU about killing off the old folks , let ’s talk about rationing .
First , as Singer wrote , we in the U.S. have rationing now .
Health care is rationed by ability to pay .
As Singer said , we have more rationing here than in nations with government health care plans .
There is utterly no reason to think that the plan Obama wants to put forward to make rationing worse , and lots of reasons to think there will be less rationing than there is already .
As I wrote recently in “ Ir- rationing Health Care , ” the Medical - Industrial Complex is pouring obscene amounts of money into medical treatments that doctors themselves do not believe will provide better outcomes than older , cheaper treatments .
The for - profit health industry chases profits , not cures , which may be the biggest reason as a nation we get the worst outcomes for money spent on the planet .
I read in the Los Angeles Times this morning that our wonderful pharmaceutical industry has a new prescription drug out that grows longer , darker eyelashes .
Also in the same article is the little tidbit of information that pharma spends more than $ 11 million a day advertising prescription drugs directly to potential patients , a practice that is absolutely unnecessary to the nation ’s health .
The Obama Administration has declared it intends to leave choice of treatments in the hands of physicians , using Comparative Effectiveness Research not to ration , but to see to it that doctors get information on the effectiveness of treatments not from sales reps but from objective sources .
We also need to find ways to discourage doctors from over - prescribing and over - treating patients just to make money .
There are all manner of ways that the health care belt can be tightened .
However , one thing is not being considered by anybody ( well , except the insurance industry ) is making choices about where to put our health care dollars based on the relative “ value ” of the patient .
No industrialized democracy with national health care is denying care to older people as a form of “ rationing . ”
What nations might be doing is choosing not to treat conditions when treatment provides no real benefit , and prostate cancer is a prime example .
As I wrote in the “ ir- rationing ” article , diagnosis of a slow - growing prostate cancer in an older man usually does n’t warrant aggressive treatment , because the odds are the gentleman will die of other causes before the cancer becomes a problem .
But this is not “ rationing ” ; it ’s logical medical practice .
The treatments for prostate cancer have side effects that likely will cause more problems than the cancer and not lengthen the patient ’s life by even ten minutes .
The important point is that the patient is not being denied care just because he is old .
If the same elderly patient had another disease , even another form of cancer , in which treatment would improve the quality or length of his life , then he would get that treatment .
Peter Singer is an interesting guy , but he ’s a philosopher .
He ’s not an economist or a policy wonk .
As I wrote in the post about his article , I do n’t disagree with Singer but I think his rhetoric was unnecessarily inflammatory .
Yes , there are limits to health care as a commodity , but the cost - effective limits we are talking about now do not fit the definition of rationing , which is :
A fixed portion , especially an amount of food allotted to persons in military service or to civilians in times of scarcity ;
To restrict to limited allotments , as during wartime .
And that is not what we ’re talking about .
Nobody is saying any one group of people should have limits put on how much health care they receive .
Rather , we ’re talking about taking health care decisions away from profiteers and putting it into the hands of medical professionals who will make decisions based on what patients need .
That is not “ rationing . ”

An Interview with Dr. Ulrich Wiesner
( Dr. Wiesner Filed a Lawsuit in Germany Claiming E- Voting Unconstitutional AND WON ! )
By Kathleen Wynne - Founder HCPBnow.org
Former Associate Director of Black Box Voting http://blackboxvoting.org/
" The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society ; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies , to secret oaths and to secret proceedings . "
John F. Kennedy
No words were ever more relevant than these are when it comes to our elections and the counting of our votes .
When did secrecy take precedence over transparency in the counting of our votes in America through the use of electronic voting systems and , more importantly , why ?
What the majority of Americans have NOT heard about , but most election reform advocates are already aware of , isthe German Constitutional Court 's recent decision to ban electronic voting in Germany by ruling it " unconstitutional . "
Let 's think about this for a minute .
By using a Constitution , similar to our own , and which had to be approved of by the U.S. after World War II , Germany has , through its High Court , determined that computerized , secret vote counting does not subscribe to the democratic standards of their country !
Yet , still here in America , 95 % of us are using some sort of computerized voting system to cast and / or count our ballots --- completely government sanctioned , corporate controlled , using software protected from public scrutiny by trade secret laws .
NO ONE can guarantee even a single voter that their vote is being counted as cast .
What 's wrong with this picture ?
It is , indeed , encouraging that support is growing for a return to public hand - counts here in the U.S. and , as a result , we may someday soon reach a " critical mass " of support largeenough to put pressure on our courts to also recognize this fundamental right and " persuade " them to rule in a similar fashion as the German Court .
When that day comes , we will be forever indebted to our German counterparts .
Lotsa pressure on world leaders to save the world when they meet at the G20 next week .
Given the lack of consensus about how to fix the economy , and the fact that various countries have different priorities , it seems like a long shot that they 'll agree on anything -- or that if they do agree on something , that it 'll happen to be the silver bullet .
Already , there are signs that no consensus will be reached .
Germany 's Angel Merkel , for one , is sounding particularly strident in her opposition to a " global New Deal " , which is what the US and the UK would like to see .
But George Soros says it 's the last chance to save the world , and that if they do n't the world could face a depression worse than the 30s :
Times of London :
The G20 summit in London next week is , he says , the last chance to avert disaster .
“ The odds would favour that it fails because there are such differences of opinion .
It ’s difficult enough to get it right in your own country let alone with 20 governments coming together , but if it ’s a failure I think then the global financial and trading system falls apart . ”
If the G20 is nothing but a talking shop then he thinks we are heading for meltdown .
“ That could push the world into depression .
It ’s really a make - or - break occasion .
That ’s why it ’s so important . ”
The chances of a depression are , he says , “ quite high ” – even if that is averted , the recession will last a long time .
“ Look , we are not going back to where we came from .
In that sense it ’s going to last for ever . ”
On a somewhat more amusing note , we liked his explanation for how he knew when the market was about to turn :
He tells us that he has psycho-somatic illnesses – backaches and pains – that tip him off to changes in the market .
“ It ’s as if you ’re a jungle animal , and you see another animal facing you .
You have to make a decision : fight or flight ?
Your hair stands up and you growl and you decide , ‘ Am I going to attack because I ’m stronger or am I going to run away because otherwise he ’s going to eat me ? ’
You are very tense .
And that ’s the tension that gives you the backache . ”

ON A fine afternoon at the Texas State Fair , a ringmaster encouraged a gaggle of children to flap their arms like butterfly wings .
“ What could possibly go wrong on a day as beautiful as today ? ” he asked .
But a hundred yards away , something had gone quite wrong .
People were queuing for an unusual delicacy : balls of butter , dipped in dough and cooked in a vat of boiling oil .
Fried butter , in other words .
The balls were dusted with a thin coat of powdered sugar .
When bitten , they collapsed with an unctuous squelch .
Fairs are known for their decadent snack offerings .
Most are unhealthy , and some push the conceptual boundaries of food into new territory .
The Los Angeles County Fair , which ended on October 4th , featured a Meat Lovers ' Ice Cream Cone ( do n't ask ) .
The Minnesota State Fair is known for its foods - on - a - stick .
The Texas fair bills itself as the fried food capital of the state .
The claim is credible .
Sprinkled between the pig races and carnival rides are vendors selling fried ribs , fried guacamole , fried ice cream and even fried bacon .
Fried butter is a new development .
At the beginning of the fair it won an award for creativity .
The inventor , Abel Gonzales , won the same award in 2006 for a different recipe — fried Coke .
Nutritionists would shudder at all the fat , sodium and trans - fats .
Defenders say that the key is moderation .
“ If this is not your lifestyle , then it 's OK to indulge once or twice a year , ” says a spokeswoman for the fair .
Opinions among fairgoers were divided .
A woman selling toffee said that people had no business frying butter , with diabetes and high cholesterol as common as they are .
She said she preferred to cook with olive oil .
But a man eating a basket of fried butter with cherry jam was not too bothered .
“ It 's just butter , ” he maintained .
" I had butterflies in my stomach before the game , but now the ice has been broken , " said Israeli hoopster Omri Casspi after his successful NBA debut Wednesday .
Casspi scored 15 points pulled down three rebounds in the Sacramento Kings ' 89:102 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder .
s
Speaking to Ynet after the game , Caspi said , " I went through a lot to get here , and now I 'm embarking on a new journey , which I hope will be a successful one . "
Asked whether the fact that he is the first Israeli to play in the NBA entered his mind , Casspi said , " I thought about it more during the preseason .
When we began the warm - up I thought to myself , ' I made it to the NBA ' .
Undoubtedly , the first game is special , but during halftime , when I had only two points , I said to myself , ' Enough jitters , I have to start playing ' .
I 'm glad that I improved and scored another 13 points in the second half . "
Casspi , who was on the floor for 19 minutes , said he received good feedbacks from the Kings ' coaching staff .
" This is just the beginning ; there are 81 more games to play , " he said .
" I hope I 'll make the most of the chances I 'll get .
I 'm working hard . "
The Kings boarded a flight to New Orleans just an hour after the game in Oklahoma ended .
" These flights are like trips to the Galilee in Israel .
It 's very intense .
We have to pick ourselves up , because we cannot continue last year 's losing trend , " Casspi added .
Addressing his supporters in Israel , the small forward from Yavne said , " I want to thank everyone for the support ; it warms my heart .
I 'm glad the game was aired ( in Israel ) and I promise to keep working hard . "
“ Bankers own the earth .
Take it away from them , but leave them the power to create money and control credit , and with a flick of a pen they will create enough to buy it back . “
– Josiah Stamp , former President of the Bank of England
On November 22 , 2009 I delivered some remarks after a rally and march at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .
Following my return from China , this was the first time I had the chance to speak publicly on the transition phase to sound money , and while there are plenty of FED critics , it is still rare to find solid ideas on how best to replace the FED , and furthermore , how such a transition be accomplished .
Though stymied by government interventions in the short term , I believe the free market will win out in the long term .
For instance , there were probably over 100 people in the crowd I spoke to that possess physical gold and silver .
The dollar - denominated prices of gold and silver continue to rise at blistering rates since 2001 as the collapse of the dollar and fiat currencies unfolds .
It is so very important to realize that what we are seeing is not so much the appreciation of gold and silver as it is the unmasking of the devaluation in the dollar by the central banks .
My sincere thanks to the late Dr. Murray Rothbard where one day , while sitting in Shanghai skyscraper , a single mouseclick led me down the rabbit hole , and I began to start discovering the truth about the current dishonest monetary system .
“ END THE FED … .
Then What ? – The Transition to Sound Money ” is the title of my talk today , and it's a bit of an ambitious undertaking for a half an hour , but it 's an important topic since all of us who gathered here to protest the Federal Reserve today need to also have a plan on how best to replace the FED and the fiat monetary system .
One note before I begin .
I openly acknowledge that my idea is at best a starting point , and I welcome a healthy debate on this topic .
I have given this particular topic quite a bit of research since first becoming aware that the dollar was not backed by gold about 2 years ago , and this past summer I attended Mises University , which is one of the very few places in the nation where one can study Austrian free market economics – the other two places being George Mason University in DC , and Grove City College in Pittsburgh .
In this talk I will first address what the goal is – as one must always begin with the end in mind .
Then I will briefly discuss several transition ideas that are already present in literature , describe possible issues with each , and then spend the remainder of the time outlining my proposal .
The End in Mind
Simply stated , I believe the end in mind should be to strip the government of its Money Power and return it directly to the people .
Currently , a quasi - private banking cartel , the Federal Reserve , controls both interest rates and money production , aka the printing press .
There are really only three options available – a “ honest ” fiat monetary standard , a gold standard – which fractionally - reserved commodity money , or 100 % fully - backed commodity money .
Let me list why I discard the first two options and prefer the latter .
“ Honest ” Fiat Money ?
Fiat standards , or paper money , are proven to exist only for relatively short periods of time , and as we study history , have never been left unabused by governments .
Therefore , I do not believe a widely - used “ honest ” fiat currency can ever exist .
The human temptation to abuse the power is too great , and counterfeiting , via either government or individuals can never be prevented .
A prime reason to have sound money , besides facilitating a relatively stable medium of exchange for economic transactions is to impose fiscal discipline on government , a point completely missed by most modern - day politicians and Keynesian economists .
There are many fiat standard plans available in literature , such as Dr. W. Cleon Skousen 's Monetary Reform plan , but again , I do not believe these will work in practice .
[ Skousen , W. Cleon .
The Urgent Need for a Comprehensive Monetary Reform . ]
[ Money Masters .
Monetary Reform Act . ]
A fiat currency standard can never fulfill the requirements for sound money which briefly are : Money must be durable and not easily destroyed .
Money must be portable for convenience .
Money must be easily divisible into smaller units .
Money must be recognizable and uniform .
Money must be reproducible .
Money must be scarce , and it must also have a relatively stable purchasing power .
Fiat currencies can never truly fulfill the scarcity and purchasing power requirements .

“ The Money Matrix – What Makes Money Money ? “ ]
Return to the Gold Standard ?
Next , returning to a gold standard will never work .
If one remembers how the classical gold standard worked , it was really fraudulent money and still gave the government the ability to inflate the money supply .
Under a gold standard , a government might hold 100 ounces of gold , but would trade paper slips of receipt money that made say 200 ounces of gold payable to the bearer .
So this system , while much superior to today 's fiat currencies , has proven fairly robust it is still fraudulent and worse , since government controls the receipts , it is very easy for them to revert to a fiat currency , which is more or less what happened in 1933 when FDR stole the people 's gold .
[ Towne , Jake .
2008 .
“ Bernanke 's Great Lie – The “ Gold Standard ” and the Great Depression . ” ]
In today 's society with information being so widespread over the internet , I contend that a gold standard would be fairly ridiculous , as 100 years ago governments tended to hide from the people how their gold standards really worked .
They pretended that every ounce of gold held in vaults was backed by exactly the same amount of receipt money , and when you cashed in a receipt you were given the full amount .
In today 's world , if it is widely known that a currency is 50 % backed by gold , it would simply trade at half the price of gold .
If another country 's currency is 25 % backed by gold on reserve , the exchange rate would simply be equal to the ratio of the weight of gold .
100 % - Backed Gold and Silver Money
This leaves us with a 100 % backed commodity standard , or honest money .
As Murray Rothbard writes in “ What Has the Government Done to Our Money ? ” and “ The Case for the 100 % Gold Dollar ” successful societies have chosen gold – and silver – as money throughout time .
This is no accident as money evolved from the marketplace and remember the US government per the Constitution is legally allowed to only use gold and silver as money .

[ Towne , Jake .

Talk on Constitutional Money . ]
While it is possible to have a dual parallel standard of gold and silver , I suggest that gold is more suitable right for the following reasons :
Gold is presently a major financial market , with market turnover on the London exchange alone of over $ 20 trillion USD , which is higher than the numbers used for US GDP , and relatively comparable to the world 's property , equity , and bond markets .
Silver 's market cap was just a small fraction of this .
Gold is still saved rather than consumed while silver is chiefly an industrial metal .
Most importantly , there are 60 - 80 years of aboveground stock of gold as compared to the flow rate , or amount of gold mined each year .
Silver 's stocks - to - flow rate is just 1.5 years .
While the ratio in the earth is roughly 8 ounces of silver mined for every ounce of gold , the industrial consumption has resulted in the rather strange - but - true fact that there is far less aboveground stock of silver and gold .
There is over 5 billion ounces of gold stock , but just 1 - 2 billion ounces of silver stock .
Put into volume terms the entire gold supply would fit into a cube about 20 meters to a side while the entire silver supply fits into a cube 14 - 18 meters to a side .
These above factors , combined with a study of the futures markets and the efforts of the central banks to suppress the spot prices of gold and silver , lead me to conclude that the silver - to - gold ratio , the silver - to - barrel of oil ratio , etc. will likely skyrocket , and not have the potential of stability that gold will offers to the marketplace .
However , after the stabilization occurs , silver would be a good candidate for money in a future parallel standard with gold .

“ Unlocking the Money Matrix – The Summers Gold Price Suppression Scheme . ” ]
So for the purposes of this talk I will move ahead with the transition to an end goal of the monetary unit being equivalent to gold grams .
I want to add two points , first is that I believe that individuals should be free to trade and exchange as money any mutually agreeable commodity or item as they wish and the government 's only role should be to mint money and maintain the integrity , meaning the mass , of the monetary unit and protect the liberties of individuals in cases of fraud .
Of course , the government currently holds the monopoly on the privilege of creating money and currently commits wanton fraud , so obviously a better solution will be that of Rothbard 's suggestion to allow private firms to compete , as was done in the case of the ' thaler , ' a German silver coin made by a 16th century private minter .
Thalers were renowned for their uniformity ( consistent weight ) and fineness , and poor pronunciation later resulted in the Spanish milled ' dollar , ' which the American dollar was originally based upon .
[ Rothbard , Murray .

What Has the Government Done to Our Money ? ]
Secondly , since I am doing a lot of talking about coins , and no one wants to carry coins all over the place , I want to add that electronic digitized currency in gold grams or silver ounces is already being done .
The vaults of independent bullion banks would hold the physical gold or silver and when you swipe a charge card , this would move the specified weight from your account to the new parties .
Obviously , these vaults , or money warehouses , would need to be independently audited to prevent counterfeiting , and customers must always be able to remove their metal when desired .
The Transition to Honest Money
OK on to the transition possibilities .
First we must picture the scenario in which the transition to sound money will realistically take place .
I believe it is very naïve to assume that magically one day Congress will wake up and decide they have the political will to transition to sound money .
Therefore , I believe the need for such a plan will take place at a time when the dollar and Treasury markets are in severe crisis .
Idea # 1 – Transition in Slow Reverse
The transition suggestions made by Douglas Gnazzo in his book Honest Money and Edwin Vieira are worth mentioning and studying .
Gnazzo points out the transition from the constitutional silver dollar pegged to gold to the current Federal Reserve Note , which is an unbacked IOU of debt , took place slowly and went through phases from mostly commodity - backed by silver and gold to the classical gold standard which was fractionally based on gold , to the gold bullion standard which existed from 1933 to 1971 , to a fractional reserved fiat noteuntil roughly the year 2000 .
Following 2000 until present - day , the fractional reserve system has broken down and no longer exists as I 've proven in an article “ Yes , Virginia , There Are No Reserve Requirements . ”

Gnazzo's suggestion is to slowly transition backwards from the Federal Reserve Note to a 100 % commodity - backed gold and silver money .
While this idea is worth considering , I do not believe it is viable due to the time necessary and since fractional reserve banking has already broken down – we are off the precipice , so to speak .
I do believe that from 1980 - 2000 , such a reversion was theoretically possibly but unfortunately very few people were agitating for this , most especially Congressman Ron Paul of Texas , and it was never seriously discussed .
[ 1983 Debate Between Congressman Ron Paul of Texas and FED Governor Charles Partee . ]
Idea # 2 – Transition Overnight
The next idea comes from a member of the Mises Institute , Dr. Thorsten Polleit , and the man who I believe is the most knowledgable monetary economist on the planet , Dr. Jorg Guido Hulsmann , also from Mises .
I will refer to just Polleit 's idea here , which is a simple one – simply take all of the central bank gold and back the fiat currency with it overnight , thereby making all the money 100 % commodity - backed in one fell swoop and limiting the chaos to the people .
This idea certainly warrants further discussion , and is in fact pretty attractive .
Polleit has a great 1 - hour lecture I will link to that summarizes his paper .
[ Polleit , Thorsten .

Ending the Monetary Fiasco – Returning to Sound Money . ]
Again , I believe the key risks lie from two factors .
One , there is overwhelming evidence from groups such as GATA that central banks , including the FED have leased out large portions of their gold to the spot market .
Since the central banks carry gold on lease and gold in vaults as a single line item , such a calculation is only possible if valid audit results are available .
Central banks claim to possess just roughly 20 % of the world 's aboveground gold stock , though this number may in reality be less than 12 % .
[ Powell , Chris . 2009 .
“ Gold Suppression is Public Policy and Public Record . ” ]
[ Towne , Jake .
2009 .
“ Unlocking the Money Matrix – The Summers Gold Price Suppression Scheme . ” ]
Second , again I predict that no transition has a possibility of occurring until we have a severe dollar and Treasury market crisis , and the predictable responses of the governments and central banks will be to alter their balance sheets so that the end results are most profitable for themselves to maintain control over their populations .
It is also highly unlikely that central bankers will be able to break their habit of using their counterfeiting powers , and for these reasons , I regard changing from the current fiat monetary system to a gold - backing ashighly dangerous .
If you leave the bankers the ability to create deposits from thin air , one should not be surprised when they exercise this yet again , this time stealing the gold .
Idea # 3 – Divorced Transition
On to my plan .
Everyone here should understand just how tightly legal tender laws enable the Federal Reserve 's money - printing , the federal income tax , the US Treasury market , and our individual lives as parts of the economy .
It is an intertwined house of cards where if you remove one card , all of the rest quickly crumble , which is not too surprising since the whole tyrannical system was designed by a bunch of Keynesian economists who , in my humble opinion , can best be described as quacks .
[ Hulsmann , Jorg Guido .
2004 .
“ Legal Tender Laws and Fractional Reserve Banking . ” ]
I propose complete separation of the Federal Reserve system from the free market system that will replace it .
So , on one hand , you have the FED .
Recall that the FED 's power really stem from two abilities – the ability to create money and the ability to control interest rates .
Congress should pass a bill abolishing the FED and as quickly as possible install direct congressional oversight of monetary policy .
All Treasury debt owned by the FED – close to half of the total – would be immediately canceled .
The Federal Reserve Note ( FRN ) would be replaced with a fiat United States Note at a parity with the FRN .
The entire banking system should immediately stop extension of fraudulent dollars with money that does not meet fractional reserve requirements which will need to be reset , since , as I mentioned before , the fractional reserve system no longer exists .
Any money creation should be presented as a typical bill and subject to a public vote of Congress .
The control of the interest rate should be left to the free market .
On the other hand , we have the free market , completely divorced of this FED mess .
Immediately Congress should remove all capital gains taxes on physical gold and silver .
Just as was done with the Coinage Act of 1792 , the US Mints should be opened to provide free coinage of uniform gold and silver coins .
So if anyone has a bar or non-uniform coins , they can be brought to the Mints , assayed and then a set formula of differently sized coins delivered .
At the same time as the Mints are opened , legal tender laws should be removed .
Merchants , buyers , and sellers would have the ability to decide which forms of payment they wish to accept .
Barring psychological events , the FRNs and new United States Notes would continue to have purchasing power since in a monetary sense they will still be scarce but they will be not compete over the long - term with gold and silver .
Following Gresham 's
Law , the tendency will still be to spend the fiat money first which may possibly result in easing a dollar price discovery for gold and silver ( or rather a gold gram price discovery for the dollar ! ! ) , and a fairly smooth transition to the free market .
Foreign creditors will be rather unhappy , as the Treasury and Agency debt will likely either be formally repudiated or indirectly repudiated as they could be paid back with notes that are no longer backed by anything .
However , I want to point out that the endless enslavement of future generations by tyrannical Congress is an illegitimate debt in the first place .
To place blame and burden on future generations holds the same stunted logic as holding newborn Germans accountable for the Holocaust .
[ Rothbard , Murray .
1992 .
“ Repudiating the National Debt . ” ]
Also , the federal income tax which plundered $ 1.2 trillion in 2008 will likely not survive the removal of the legal tender law , so we would be best off abolishing this tax and recall our expensive $ 1+ trillion dollar - a- year overseas military empire and temporarily issue new United States Notes in the meantime .
[ Towne , Jake .

Looking to the Future
Now , what goes without saying is that this period would be fairly chaotic , but as stated previously it is my opinion that it is highly unlikely that any such political process would begin without a dollar and Treasury crisis already in progress , and already caused by the failed monetary policies of the central banks .
It is my belief that without the legal assistance of government , the same steps will likely still be followed by the free market via black markets and people simply disobeying government to continue their lives — but over a much longer period of time .
It is also why the more - sudden Polleit plan is in some ways more attractive than my proposal – the cauterization of the central bank and the restoration of sound money could practically occur overnight .
Now , how likely is either the Gnazzo , Polleit , or my plans to be enacted ?
I would say , in all honesty , the probability is extremely small at current time , but I would also add that the possibilities of the current monetary system surviving for the rest of our lifetimes is much smaller .
The times we live in right now are unlike any before in human history , where the entire world , not just the United States , is on the same unsustainable fiat monetary system .
The most probably future I see ahead will be much slower and more drawn out – over years – and possibly even a decade , barring psychological currency events .
Expect to see the reverse of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system .
I expect the future to bring financial market instability in bonds , equities , and derivatives , fixed foreign exchange rates , fixed trading windows for gold and the possible introduction of a Federal Reserve Gold Certificate Ratio where the FED pegs the dollar to a trading range based on reinstated US money supply figure ( possibly M3 ) .

In the meantime , those who have studied monetary history will be accruing gold and silver and hopefully more and more people like myself and yourselves will stand up to educate the rest of America and fight to gain back both our economic and personal liberties .
I happen to be pessimistic in the short - term , but in the long - term there is a future – without the FED – worth striving for .
Imagine an America where the family no longer must send both parents to work while sending the children to daycare .
Imagine an America where money saved in the present - day worth the same or even more decades later , enabling individuals to pursue retirements or have more leisure time for personal pursuits .
Imagine an America where everyone owns what they work for .
The more people that stand united against the blight of the FED , the better off society will be in the long run .
The main weapon against the FED is simply educating the public .

A New Hampshire court ordered a home - schooled Christian girl to attend a public school this week after a judge criticized the “ rigidity ” of her mother ’s religious views and said the 10 - year - old needed to consider other worldviews as she matures .
Ever since the judge ’s ruling came out in July , the case has aroused the interest of home - schooling groups nationwide , who have asked why a court has the power to decide whether someone ’s religious views are too extreme .
The girl ’s mother , Brenda Voydatch , has engaged the Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian legal group based in Scottsdale , Ariz. , to contest the ruling , in which the judge granted a request by the girl ’s father , Martin Kurowski , that the girl go to a public school .
On Tuesday , the girl , Amanda Kurowski , started fifth grade at an elementary school in Meredith , N.H. , under court order .
Amanda ’s “ vigorous defense of her religious beliefs … suggests strongly that she has not had the opportunity to seriously consider any other point of view , ” District Court Judge Lucinda V. Sadler said .
The case is the latest in a series of disputes this summer which have tested the limits of parents ’ right to raise their children in line with their religious beliefs .
• Two court cases saw parents who relied on prayer being tried for the deaths of their children .
In Wisconsin , Dale and Leilani Neumann were found guilty of second - degree reckless homicide in the death of their 11 - year - old diabetic daughter , Kara .
In Oregon , Carl and Raylene Worthington were acquitted of manslaughter in the pneumonia death of their 15 - month - old daughter , though the father was found guilty of a lesser count , criminal mistreatment .
• The case of Daniel Hauser , a 13 - year - old Minnesota boy with Hodgkin ’s lymphoma , precipitated a national manhunt that dominated the news in May .
Mother Colleen Hauser defied legal authorities that ordered the boy to be treated by oncologists and fled with her son , citing family beliefs in traditional American Indian medicine .
But those cases all involved physical danger and the state attempting to prove that parents were acting recklessly .
In the New Hampshire case , the court ruled that extreme religiosity by itself constitutes grounds on which to rule against a parent ’s wishes .
According to court documents filed in Laconia , a small city in the central New Hampshire ’s Belknap County , Amanda is a well - adjusted child whose parents were divorced in 1999 .
The mother has primary physical custody of Amanda , whom she has home - schooled for several years in math , English , social studies , science , handwriting , spelling and the Bible .
The course load , except for the Bible study , is similar to what public students get and the mother ’s home schooling has “ more than kept up with the academic requirements of the [ local ] school system , ” the judge ’s statement said .
The child also takes supplemental public school classes in art , Spanish , theater and physical education and is involved in extracurricular sports such as gymnastics , horseback riding , softball and basketball .
Her parents have been feuding for years over how she should be educated .
The father tried to get Amanda removed from the mother ’s tutelage in 2006 , but another judge ruled against him .
However , the court did appoint Janice McLaughlin as a guardian of the child ’s legal interests .
The father continued to push for some changes in the way his daughter was educated .
“ [ Mr. Kurowski ] believes that exposure to other points of view will decrease Amanda ’s rigid adherence to her mother ’s religious beliefs and increase her ability to get along with others and to function in a world which requires some element of independent thinking and tolerance for different points of view , ” Judge Sadler ’s ruling said .
The ruling quoted Mrs. McLaughlin as saying the child “ appeared to reflect the mother ’s rigidity on questions of faith . ”
The child would “ be best served by exposure to different points of view at a time in her life when she must begin to critically evaluate multiple systems of belief and behavior , ” it added .
The ruling also said Amanda told a counselor she was distressed by her father ’s refusal to accept her religious beliefs and that “ his choice to spend eternity away from her proves that he does not love her as much as he says he does . ”
According to the brief filed by the child ’s mother , Mrs. McLaughlin dismissed critical evidence and key witnesses in the case because they were “ connected to Christianity . ”
When the mother tried to give the guardian material on home - schooling , Mrs. McLaughlin reportedly said : “ I do n’t want to hear it .
It ’s all Christian - based . ”
Mrs. McLaughlin did not respond to a request for comment .
Douglas Napier , senior ADF counsel , suggested the court has a bias against Christianity .
“ What if this were Muslims who do n’t want their children exposed to infidel thoughts ? ” he asked .
“ Can a judge come into my home — even if my wife and I agree to home - school our children — and say it ’s to their best interest to put them in government schools ? ”
He added : “ Does anybody seriously believe a public school will broaden this girl ’s views on comparative religious thought ?
The schools are the number - one censors of religious thought . ”
New Hampshire state law mandates the judge must find some evidence of harm to a child before removing her from a home - school environment , Mr. Napier said .
“ The judge seems to have some allergic reactions to the fact this talented 10 - year - old girl has made some decisions on her faith , ” he said .
“ The judge did n’t consider and weigh the constitutional rights of the mother to raise the child in the way she sees fit . ”
Elizabeth Donovan , attorney for the child ’s father , said the father is basically objecting to the type of home - schooling Amanda is receiving .
“ She is a beautiful , brilliant 10 - year - old girl , ” Ms. Donovan said .
“ Her classroom was the corner of her mother ’s bedroom and a computer screen .
She was not having interaction with other children , no group dynamic , no opportunity to share with other students in a day - to - day school setting .
“ If she was excelling in a home setting , what might she do in a broader , more challenging public school setting ? ”
Ms. Donovan also denied that the court was anti-religious or illegitimately intruding into a family issue , noting that it was a custody dispute in which the parents had asked the court to intervene .
“ It has been conveyed [ that ] the court is reaching into this family ’s life and plucking the child out of her home , ” the attorney said , adding the mother had earlier agreed to allow the court to decide the child ’s educational future .
“ There have been three counselors for this child and all have recommended public school . ”
Mike Donnelly , an attorney with the Home School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville , Va. , called the judge ’s ruling “ unreasonable and inappropriate . ”
“ The fact that the court talks about the religion of the child and says it thinks the child ought to be in public school because she needs to be socialized shows they have overstepped their authority , which is troubling , ” he said .
“ The court can not just on its own pull opinions out of the air .
“ A lot of single moms are concerned about this case because their ex-husbands could use the home - schooling issue to get back at them as has happened in this case , ” he added .
“ And now 10 - year - olds ca n’t have firm religious convictions ? ”

That Double - Double is just a few months away , close enough you can almost taste it .
And as the months progress , it will take progressively shorter drives to reach what could the be most anticipated restaurant to come to northern Utah .
Add Centerville to the list of cities where residents may order from one of the simplest menus in the restaurant business : hamburger , cheeseburger , Double - Double , fries , drink , shake .
Centerville 's planning commission is holding a public hearing Wednesday on the In - N - Out 's conceptual site plan .
And within a few weeks , the restaurant could have a building permit for 475 N. 700 West .
Centerville is the just the latest city to begin the approval process for the California - based restaurant .
Northern Utah 's first In - N - Out to open will likely be in Orem , where construction is currently under way .
Other restaurants are planned for Draper , West Valley City , West Jordan , American Fork and Layton .
One opened in Washington , Washington County , in April 2008 .
The Orem location is expected to open sometime in October or November , said business license specialist Aaron Lyman .
The site , 350 E. University Parkway , already sports a " coming soon " sign , which will likely attract attention when students at BYU and Utah Valley University return in the fall .
" A lot of people are excited , " Lyman said .
In Draper , the restaurant is finalizing some details before construction begins at Draper Peaks Shopping Center , just off I - 15 at 12195 South .
In Layton , officials are still working with In - N - Out to find a prime location .
West Jordan senior planner Scott Langford said he expects In - N - Out to have a building permit this week .
That restaurant has been approved for Jordan Landing , on the northeast corner of 7800 South and Jordan Landing Boulevard .
The restaurant will be a welcome addition in Centerville close to the Davis Performing Arts Center , which is currently under construction .
" You always want to get businesses that all your citizens can use , " Snyder said .
Within three weeks , the restaurant could have a conditional - use permit and have its final site plan approved , he said .
Construction could start fairly soon afterward .

When author Michael Pollan spoke at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in mid-October , it ’s a safe bet his hosts did n’t offer fresh cherries to the “ local foods ” advocate .
As a locavore — someone who tries to eat only food grown within a 100 - mile radius of them —
Pollan would have likely reacted to cherries like a vampire reacts to garlic .
At this time of year , any fresh cherries in northern California would most likely have come from orchards in Chile , roughly 6,000 miles to the southeast .
Yet , when Pollan was handed the microphone he probably did not turn to David Wehner , Dean of the college hosting the event , and ask , “ By the way , Dean – Where did the electricity electrons powering this thing come from ? ”
Maybe he should have .
At least some of that electricity those electrons had just completed a 1,000 mile journey .
The energy was converted from wind to electricity at the Klondike generating facility just south of the Washington - Oregon border .
The electricity electrons traveled over power lines down the entire state of Oregon , then traversing three - quarters of the length of California to arrive at the microphone in Pollan ’s hand at Cal Poly .
But , to state the obvious : electricity is electrons are not cherries .
So , does it matter that this electricity particular electrons began life 1,000 miles from the microphone it powered ?
That question is at the heart of the report , “ Energy Self - Reliant States , ” published in October by the New Rules Project .
The report shows why “ local energy ” matters and then looks at the renewable energy potential of each state .
Among the reports ’ most important findings :
“ All 36 states with either renewable energy goals … or mandates could meet them by relying on in - state renewable fuels .
Sixty - four percent could be self sufficient in electricity from in - state renewables ; another 14 percent could generate 75 percent of their electricity from homegrown fuels .
“ Indeed , the nation may be able to achieve a significant degree of energy independence by harnessing the most decentralized of all renewable resources : solar energy .
More than 40 states plus the District of Columbia could generate 25 percent of their electricity just with rooftop PV . ”
The report , while necessarily a bit wonkish , is actually quite readable .
The authors do a particularly good job in providing the right amount of background on “ local energy ” without overburdening us with too much detail .
For example , I had n’t realized that centralized energy production is a relatively recent development in a our national history .
In 1900 , 60 percent of electricity was still produced on - site — only to drop to 20 percent , just three decades later .
The study finds several benefits to “ going local . ”
The first deals with “ hardware . ”
Barry Commoner ’s 4th law of ecology applies here : “ There is no such thing as a free lunch . ”
Unlike cherries , electricity does n’t electrons do n’t need to be shipped in crates on freighters , trucks or trains .
But that does n’t mean that getting electricity from Oregon to California is free .
It is n’t .
Some of the costs are easy to total , such as building and maintaining transmission lines .
Writing in the New York Times last February , a Massachusetts state official estimated the cost at between $ 2 - $ 10 million per mile .
Assuming a midpoint of $ 6 million dollars , the upfront cost of installing the “ hardware ” to ship electricity electrons from the Klondike wind farm to Michael Pollan ’s microphone is $ 6 billion .
Most of that infrastructure already exists .
The point remains , however , that any new construction to move energy long distances has a significant price tag .
( And while this should be obvious , it needs to be said :
When it comes to hardware , there is no discount for shipping electricity produced by environmentally friendly , renewable sources .
Even to the transmission lines of smart grids all electricity looks alike .
one electron looks just like another .
Not so smart , huh ? )
There are , of course , sound environmental reasons involved .
Another of Commoner ’s laws applies : “ Everything must go somewhere . ”
Transmission lines require large towers and sometimes , new substations .
Siting is a contentious issue because most people do not want these massive towers and electrical lines passing through their property or across beautiful landscapes .
More direct harm can come from building towers on land that is home to species already threatened with extinction .
While there are significant monetary costs associated with the siting process , the cost discussed here is not monetary .
It ’s the impact the electrical infrastructure has on the environment as a whole .
Then there ’s something called “ line loss . ”
As electricity electrons streams through a power line a small fraction of it is lost to various factors .
The longer the distance the greater the loss .
From the ILSA report :
“ For example , if Ohio ’s electricity came from North Dakota wind farms – 1,000 miles away – the cost of constructing new transmission lines to carry that power and the electricity losses during transmission could result in an electricity cost to the customer that is about the same , or higher , than local generation with minimal transmission upgrades . ”
That ’s one advantage to PV rooftop panels .
In the few yards between the panels and the wall socket in your house , the amount of electricity lost through transmission is effectively zero .
There ’s lots more to this report , but it ’s probably best to post what is probably the study ’s most important map and refer readers on sites with more information .
As an Arizonan , I ’m surprised ( and a little sobered ) to realize that we ’re the only state west of the Missouri that lacks the potential for complete renewable energy independence .
On the other hand , we could derive three - quarters of all our energy from carbon - free , renewable sources from within our borders .
In fact , only five states fall under the 30 % line , which I find a pretty remarkable fact .
You can download a pdf copy of the report , here .
There ’s also a good piece on the study at the NYT Green Inc. , site , here .
And , finally , I write on the report in a bit more detail over at my own site , The Phoenix Sun , here .
Kirk Cameron went to UCLA to convince students that Darwin 's theory of evolution is dead wrong ... but when the students challenged the actor - turned - bible - banger to a debate , Kirk appeared to be " unfit " for the clash .
As we previously reported , Kirk headed to campus to hand out copies of a " revised " edition of " On The Origin of the Species " -- in which the author attempts to connect Darwin to Hitler .
During the " event , " several students asked Kirk about his thoughts on Darwin .
Kirk responded , " I believe that Darwin was absolutely ... that the end game was to make God ... was to remove God from the world view of ..
I think that that was the end game . "
Excellent point .
Here 's another of our favorite exchanges :
MyBittorrent is familiar name to most in the BitTorrent community , so it came as a surprise when the site shut down this summer .
After a dispute concerning the site 's future , the two founders agreed to go their separate ways and close the site .
One of them has now returned with a brand new torrent search engine .
Founded in early 2004 , myBittorrent grew to become a prominent and well - established torrent site over the next few years .
The site had been flying under the radar for a long time and did n’t run into any legal troubles , but it did have a serious dispute with its domain registrar , GoDaddy , in 2006 .
After receiving a complaint from Microsoft , GoDaddy temporary hijacked the myBittorrent domain , but after emails back and forth the owners managed to regain control .
In the years that followed the two founders continued business as usual , frequently changing the look and layout of the site .
In fact , the two changed plans so often that they never really managed to add new features to the site .
“ Instead of adding new things we were always spending time on fixing features that used to work just fine , ” Rex , one of the site ’s founders told TorrentFreak .
Nevertheless , myBittorrent grew out to become one of the largest torrent sites , serving torrents to millions of visitors every month .
This popularity , together with the increased legal pressure against fellow torrent sites such as The Pirate Bay and Mininova , raised doubts with Rex ’s partner , who wanted to scale down .
Eventually this led to a rift between the two owners .
Rex wanted to continue with the site , but his partner opted to close down the operation permanently .
To resolve the dispute the two decided to go their separate ways .
This summer myBittorrent was shut down for good , but not before a replacement was in place .
To fill the gap left by myBitTorrent , Rex launched a new site under a new name – yourBittorrent .
“ The biggest difference between both sites is that yourBittorrent has verified and adult torrents , ” Rex told TorrentFreak , adding that he plans to include many new features in the near future , including an integrated subtitle search engine .
“ YourBittorrent will soon have a few million subtitles and IMDB - links linked to all movies and TV - shows .
The advanced search will also be extended to allow people to look for subtitles .
YourBittorrent is going to be the first site where you can do that , ” Rex said .
Another key feature is that the site will verify torrents to prevent the appearance of fake files and spam .
“ YourBittorrent has its own verification system with 60,000 verified torrents , and unlike some other torrent sites , we do take measures against fake files , ” Rex told Torrent Freak .
Thus far 2009 has not been the best year for BitTorrent .
Many sites have gone down or received negative verdicts in court , so it ’s good to see that yourBittorrent continues where myBittorrent left off .
Leaders remain split on specifying targets
World leaders meeting in Singapore have said it will not be possible to reach a climate change deal ahead of next month 's UN conference in Denmark .
After a two - day Asia - Pacific summit , they vowed to work towards an " ambitious outcome " in Copenhagen .
But the group dropped a target to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , which was outlined in an earlier draft .
Leaders also vowed to pursue a new strategy for growth after the world 's worst economic crisis in decades .
They resolved to conclude the Doha round of global trade talks in 2010 .
In a joint declaration issued at the end of their two - day annual summit , they said : " We firmly reject all forms of protectionism and reaffirm our commitment to keep markets open and refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services . "
They also agreed to keep stimulus spending in place until a recovery was seen .
' Staging post '
But leaders have failed to agree a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the Asia - Pacific Economic Co-operation ( Apec ) forum .
Officials said the leaders - including presidents Barack Obama of the US and Hu Jintao of China - now viewed the Copenhagen summit as a " staging post " , and not an end point , in the search for a global deal to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
There was an assessment by the leaders that it was unrealistic to expect a full internationally legally binding agreement to be negotiated between now and when Copenhagen starts in 22 days .

US Deputy National Security Adviser " We ... reaffirm our commitment to tackle the threat of climate change and work towards an ambitious outcome in Copenhagen , " they said in the final declaration .
" Global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will need to be accompanied by measures , including financial assistance and technology transfer to developing economies for their adaptation to the adverse impact of climate change , " the declaration said .
A Chinese official involved in the world climate talks said the 50 % reduction target was " a very controversial issue in the world community " which could " disrupt the negotiation process " .
US Deputy National Security Adviser Mike Froman said the leaders had reached the conclusion that " it was unrealistic to expect a full , internationally legally - binding agreement to be negotiated between now and when Copenhagen starts in 22 days " .

Apec seeks new balance of power Obama seeks to reassure Asia allies
This was unwelcome evidence that the gap between developing and developed nations , between rich and poor , East and West can sometimes be hard to bridge , says the BBC's Rachel Harvey in Singapore .
Mr Obama later met his Russian counterpart as the clock ticks for the world 's two leading nuclear powers to strike a new arms reduction deal .
The deal is meant to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start I ) , which expires on 5 December .
After the meeting , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he hoped that " as we agreed earlier ... we can finalise the treaty by December " .
The two leaders also said they were unhappy with the pace of talks over Iran 's nuclear programme .
" We are running out of time with respect to that approach , " Mr Obama said .
Mr Obama kicked off his week - long Asian tour in Japan on Saturday .
In Tokyo , he pledged Washington 's " unshakeable " commitment to the security of the region and said Washington wanted to pursue a policy of " pragmatic cooperation " with China , Asia 's rising power .
Following the meeting with Mr Medvedev , the US president went on to China .
The BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai says the face - to - face talks Mr Obama will have with China 's President Hu Jintao will offer an opportunity to take the heat out of some of those trade disputes , and to pursue areas of co-operation , such as technology transfer from the US to help China build a so - called green economy .

Whites to be rounded up into concentration camps called suburbs
A Glenn Beck special report : imminent threat to white culture
What would an atheist see in toast ?
" Friends , it 's getting worse . "
" Our white culture is under attack ! "
" Listen closely , my fellow conservatives , did you know that since the sixties , black activists have been secretly herding white people into concentration camps called suburbs ?
And now , with Obama as president , be warned friends , the rounding up is starting to accelerate .
Your country needs you to buy more guns and to buy them now ! "
" You 've seen the billboards : ' Work makes you Free ' and ' Save while you Spend ' .
Under those false promises wretched whites have become slaves , forced to compete viciously all day against each other , to pay for things they do n't need or want . "
" Every trace of our white culture is going to be lost and soon sordid affairs with wife swapping will be the norm - and that 's not good , by the way . "
" The suburban trap will be sprung on YOU one day , friends , so be warned : maybe a black child will go to school with your children and say something seemingly innocent like , " This is a real nice school , I think I 'll come every day . "
Then suddenly , you 're locked in your sedan and you 're driving north ! "
" Before you know it , you 've been trapped there for twenty years , with nothing to show for it except a perfectly manicured patch of grass , a dozen Thomas Kincade paintings and a prescription for erectile dysfunction .
Oh the humanity , the pain of it , oh it's too much to bear . "
Caller Tim from North Florida :
" I get up one pointless day after the other , forced to do work I hate .
I eat tasteless food from a microwave , before falling asleep on a couch .
Please , get me out of here ! ! "
Caller : Tom from Georgia :
" Please , help me , before my wife is forced to buy hundreds of useless knick - knacks . "
Glenn :
" Thanks , callers .
Friends , do you ever look back to that time in our history when the President was white ?
Can you still remember what it was like when the most beautiful woman in the world was n't Halle Berry ?
It 's all the black man 's fault !
Damn you Obama and your freedom hating liberals .
Damn you France .
Damn you aaaallll ! "

OTTAWA–Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's opponents say a closed - door speech in which he says a majority is within Conservatives ' reach and laments the possibility of left - wing ideologues in federal courts and agencies reveals his true colours .
" There have always been two Harpers , " Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said yesterday .
" The real Harper always comes out when he thinks he can't be heard . "
Ignatieff said a video of Harper speaking to a Tory audience last week shows him as " contemptuous of other political parties " and " spiteful " toward the " institutions that guarantee our freedoms . "
" He treats every adversary as a public enemy who has to be destroyed , and so you wonder why it 's difficult for me to continue to support him ? "
Ignatieff told a Montreal news conference .
While Harper 's language in the Sept. 2 meeting with Conservative supporters is blunt , his message about a majority is one internal party polls suggest has resonance after five years of minority governments , sources say .
His political rivals say the tape is proof Harper never intended to make Parliament work .
Ignatieff said a student taped the Sept. 2 speech in Sault Ste. Marie , was " shocked by what he saw , " and gave it to the Liberals who gave a copy to CBC .
" He 's got a public discourse where he says he 's trying to work with the other parties , " said deputy New Democrat leader Thomas Mulcair .
" But then in private we find out he 's the same sectarian , narrow - minded , venom - spewing Stephen Harper that we 've always known . "
On the tape , which runs 9 1/2 minutes , Harper says the coming election is a clear choice between a tax - and - spend Liberal government " propped up by the socialists and the separatists " and a Conservative government that will produce a balanced budget without raising taxes .
If the Liberals were still in power , " imagine how many left - wing ideologues they would be putting in the courts , federal institutions , agencies , the Senate – I should say how many more they would be putting in , " he says .
Harper made similar comments – and was widely panned for it – near the end of the 2004 election campaign , and this spring in a speech to a Conservative think - tank .
" They will deny this till they 're blue in the face in an election campaign , " Harper said last week .
" But I guarantee it , if we do not win a majority , this country will have a Liberal government propped up by the socialists and the separatists .
That government may not last long but every day it's in office it will do long - term , real damage to this country .
This country cannot afford a government like that .
" If they get together and force us to the polls , we have to teach them a lesson and get back there with a majority and make sure their little coalition never happens to this country , " Harper said to applause from the partisan crowd .
When Harper first mused aloud about a majority in the 2004 campaign , his party sank in the polls .
In the 2006 and 2008 campaigns , he sidestepped any mention of a majority , saying only he wanted a " strong mandate " from Canadians .
Harper says he 's confident about the 143 ridings held by Tories .
To form a majority , a party needs 155 of the 308 Commons seats .

Asked by reporters if he rules out forming a governing coalition with the NDP and the Bloc Québécois , Ignatieff said he has already been " very clear " on that .
He said he " already refused a coalition " last January because he did n't think it was " in the national interest , " and he does not believe he has to revisit that question .

In a remarkable piece of investigative journalism the New York Times has discovered evidence of widespread ebook piracy .
Again .
The surprise here is not that the paper has rediscovered piracy for the umpteenth time , but rather that , despite the paper ’s many discoveries , it has failed to gain a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding piracy .
Instead , the paper chooses to play to the worst fears of the publishing industry , while demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of what motivates consumers of digital media .
NYT columnist Randall Stross theorizes that the widespread availability of pirated ebooks combined with growing consumer adoption of digital reading devices like the Kindle , may ultimately lead to massive piracy of the sort that the music business experienced during the Napster era .
Apparently it ’s just a matter of time before Kindle owning consumers pirates wake up the fact that they can save 10 bucks by downloading bootlegged ebooks from RapidShare instead of buying direct from Amazon .
The scenario might actually seem plausible if you had no knowledge of either RapidShare or the Kindle .
Let ’s pause for a moment to compare the ebook acquisition process from both sources :
Kindle :
Find the book you want by searching the store that ’s conveniently integrated into your Kindle device .
Press the buy button .
Yes , you just spent $ 9.99 .
Painless , was n’t it ?
Start reading .
RapidShare :
Find the book you want by searching the… Wait a minute .
It turns out that RapidShare has no on - site search engine .
Turn to Google or some other search engine to find the exact URL for the book you want to download .
This might take a while , but fortunately pirates have loads of free time .
Once you ’ve found the exact URL you ’ll discover that you ca n’t download the file immediately .
Instead , you ’ll be told that all of the free download slots are in use .
You ’ll have to try again in two minutes .
Repeat this step until a slot opens up ( it might be hours , it could be days ) .
Alternately , consider paying for immediate access .
For a mere 6.99 € you can download from RapidShare without waiting .
That ’s only 20 cents more than the price of the book you ’re about to steal .
A small price to pay for sticking it to The Man .
Once you ’ve downloaded your book you ’ll need to find a way to move the file to your Kindle ( Whispersync might be convenient , but it ’s not the pirate way ) .
Prepare for the likelihood of some slight formatting problems with your new book .
In most cases you ’ll be able to figure out the intended meaning of the poorly OCR ’d text .
And you ’ll just have to get used to the page numbers that are embedded in the middle of each page .
If publishers can learn one thing from other forms of digital media , it is the importance of a quality consumer experience .
Consumers place a premium on convenience and ease of use .
As a result , free is not always the clear choice .
The best way to prevent piracy is by making it easier to buy a product than it is to steal the same product .
Despite my many reservations about Kindle ’s proprietary DRM , Amazon has made the Kindle book buying experience frictionless .
Publishers who fear piracy should work to emulate the Kindle discovery and purchasing process .
Right now the number one tool against ebook piracy is n’t DRM , it ’s Whispersync .
TONY JONES : Good evening and welcome to Q&A .
Well , many people spend their lives considering big questions about the meaning of life and the existence of God .
Well , tonight we 've got less than an hour .
But we do have a very good panel : one of Australia 's leading Catholic intellectuals , Father Frank Brennan ; renowned journalist and atheist , Christopher Hitchens , who is in Australia to deliver the opening address at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas ; social commentator and founding editor of The Monthly , Sally Warhaft ; and politics lecturer and former spokesman for the Islamic Council of Victoria , Waleed Aly ; and Deputy director of the Sydney Institute , biographer and commentator , Anne Henderson .
Please welcome our panel .
Please welcome our panel .
Okay .
Now , remember that Q&A is live from 9.30 Eastern Time , so join the Twitter conversation and send your questions by SMS to 197 55 222 or to our website at abc.net.au / qanda .
Well , as we go to air tonight , there are reports that thousands may have died in the earthquakes and tsunamis that ravaged our region in the last few days .
Well , these sorts of tragedies inevitably raise questions , like our very first one , which comes from Ejder Memis .
EJDER MEMIS : Yes , thank you very much .
I 'd like to speak to Mr Hitchens .
I 've noticed that you are wearing the Kurdistan flag on your label .
TONY JONES : We might come to that later Ejder .
EJDER MEMIS : The Kurdish really thank you very much for that - for your solidarity to the Kurdish people .
My question is that thousands of people dying from earthquakes - to the panel , question .
Thousands of people dying from earthquakes can't be called ' god 's punishment ' , why is it that a person being saved from under the rubble days later is almost invariable called a miracle ?
And , also why should God be credited for good act of a human being saving a fellow human being from under the rubble , while God being spared for the calamity that was brought up on the people ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Yes .
Look , I promise you I did not have anything to do with planting this guy in the audience and giving me such a brilliant opening .
He even recognises that I 'm wearing , on my lapel , the flag of free Iraq .
The Kurdish people like it .
Perhaps you 're Kurd yourself , I do n't know .
EJDER MEMIS : Yes .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
But if not , even better .
In England there are , I think , only three villages that do n't have a war memorial from the First World War .
One of them is called Upper Slaughter , by the way .
It 's in the Cotswolds .
I think there are only three of our that do n't - when I was a kid , I used to notice it .
And , of course , anyone who has been to an ANZAC day event will feel the same way , this unbelievable horror show and culling of the young .
Do you know what those villages are called by the Imperial War Graves Commission ?
They 're called the Blessed Villages .
What 's blessed about being the only village in a war which was fought for God , king and country , which did n't have any casualties and what does it make all the villages that did lose dozens , or sometimes more than that , of young men and frequently ever male member of the family ?
Are they cursed because they did what the church and the king asked them to do ?
It 's probably the stupidest thing the human race does , is to look for patterns in this way and say when a baby falls out of a high rise building and bounces on the grass below , that must be God .
And when millions of children die every day from lack of pure drinking water and just die of diarrhoea in a banal manner , that 's because God moves in a mysterious way or is n't involved at all .
So I think we 're off to a racing start , ladies and gentlemen .
On the key question , anyway .
TONY JONES : Frank Brennan , let 's hear from you .
Do you have any thoughts on the role of an omnipotent God in natural disasters ?
FRANK BRENNAN : Natural disasters happen and an omnipotent God lets them happen , for those of us who believe in God .
It 's not about God saying that we wo n't let nature take its course .
Those of us who do have a religious faith , we equally , I think , are committed to science but , like Christopher says , we all look for patterns .
We look for patterns in our daily lives .
We look for patterns in our histories .
We look for patterns in the world and , yes , some villages might be called blessed .
Well , if they did n't lose anyone , they would n't call themselves cursed .
And so what - how do they see themselves ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Only the people who call them blessed could do that , because it 's the natural corollary .
Now , several leaders of the Christian church , as you know , said about the last tsunami that it was a punishment .
In Britain several of them said it was a punishment for homosexuality .
It used to be said that earthquakes were punishment for sodomy .
Since we 're doing sodomy and the lash , I thought I might as well bring this up .
Oddly enough , the San Francisco Earthquake only hit when San Francisco was famous for other things .
When New Orleans got flooded , the only bits that did n't get flooded were the red light district .
Okay ?
So anyone who says they know God 's mind in this had better not mind looking a bit foolish or - which you obviously do n't - or had better say take responsibility - take responsibility and say , yes , by letting it happen , God must in some way wish it to .
TONY JONES : Let me bring Waleed ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Why would he do that ?
TONY JONES : Let me bring Waleed Aly into the discussion here .
Do you have any thoughts on this ?
WALEED ALY : Well ...
TONY JONES : And does Islam have a concept of a God that allows disasters to happen ?
WALEED ALY : Well , I think , by definition , if you believe in God , you would have to say that at the very least God allows this thing to happen because to say otherwise would be to presuppose that God lacks the power to stop it , which - I do n't know of any religious traditions , certainly no monotheistic religious tradition that would say that .
I do want to say something that I definitely agree with in what Christopher said , and that is that this sort of very simple dichotomised thinking about natural disasters - that they are punishment or reward and this is the prism through which we view them - I mean , this has to be some of the most rudimentary , unsophisticated thinking that religious people and , frankly , irreligious people , who perpetuate it even via criticism , have ever produced .
I think it 's a ridiculous assertion and I 've not really encountered a serious religious thinker , as opposed to one who is too busy playing forms of identity politics or some other kind of rabble rousing - persecuting some rabble - rousing religiosity , who would argue that .
The simple fact is that things happen in life that are , in our subjective experiences , grotesque and other things that are wonderful and our judgments , immediately , about whether they 're grotesque and wonderful are , in a sense , beside the point .
The question , I think , for religious people who are actually serious about being religious people and with all the introspection that that implies , is what do you do about it and what do you do with it ?
It 's possible that by surviving the earthquake and moving on to behave in all sorts of ways , that you cast yourself into some kind of eternal destruction in religious terms .
That 's entirely possible , in which case you probably would have been better off to have been killed in the earthquake .
It 's entirely possible that by gathering all sorts of riches in life and having an easy life , that you are similarly deforming your character as a person , so I think the key question is not so much what is God doing - although that 's a perfectly legitimate question - field of inquiry .
But I think the more important question for people , particularly religious people , is : who am I in response to this ?
What am I doing ?
Each of these is a test , whether you 're in the good side or the bad side of it , and what do you do with it ?
And I 'm more interested in that , frankly .
TONY JONES : Let 's hear from Anne Henderson .
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , where I come from , I can't take too much of the God is a person or a thing or a human creation .
I mean the idea of religion is a human creation .
I grew up a Catholic and we had heaps of that little pictures of what God was .
But God is meaning beyond meaning and the reason so many human beings have kept on believing in a God is because so much of ordinary material existence here does n't explain things enough .
And whether God had anything to do with natural disasters , I 'm really not very interested .
It 's a question of when people can't understand something they give a force a place in their understanding which is usually something spiritual or beyond the material .
And to me what God is is not so important but what God - that idea of God leads people to do .
When the New Orleans tragedy happened , one of the most heroic acts was the way the Salvation Army was there on the spot the minute it happened .
I spent three and a half years going to Villawood Detention Centre and got very much involved , as Frank did , with the so called illegal people that came to Australia without visas , and trying to get them visas .
When I went to the yard , which was a very unpleasant place to be in every week , it was n't the Fabian Society or the Pacifist Society that was there helping people but , invariably it was older nuns , people who had some connection with the Anglican Church .
We sat down , people who believed in Islam , people who believed in Christ , people who believed in anything you could think of , and we were all kind of in the same boat together .
But it was interesting how it was those that had some faith who had the time too , no doubt , who were there helping and to me it's , as Waleed ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Was this a private institution ?
ANNE HENDERSON : Private what institution ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
The one you were visiting , was it a private institution ?
ANNE HENDERSON : I was visiting a detention centre run by the government .
People who came to - oh , still .
It was a policy brought in by the Labor Government and continued under the Liberal Government and continues to this day .
Now , we take people to Christmas Island , which is off the coast .
TONY JONES : Anne , I 'm going to interrupt you , Anne , for a moment .
ANNE HENDERSON : And that was a government run thing .
TONY JONES : Sorry , to interrupt everyone just for a moment , because we actually have a question that 's coming up that actually leads us in similar directions .
But you 're watching a special politician - free edition of Q&A , answering the big philosophical questions .
The clock is ticking .
Let 's move to our very next question .
It comes from Joel Brown .
JOEL BROWN : My question is to Mr Hitchens again .
How do you account for the good work , specifically regarding the title of your book , Religion Poisons Everything , the good work done by religious aid organisations overseas in third world and developing countries , as well as locally on our own shores , and I 'm sure in your country , with the homeless and needy ?
TONY JONES : Actually , Christopher , can I interrupt ?
Before you answer that , think about your answer for a moment , because we have n't heard from Sally Warhaft .
I 'd like to bring her in and then go to you .
SALLY WARHAFT : I think this gets into the whole question of - the whole argument about whether or not , you know , God is great or not great and Christopher 's argument , obviously , in his book .
To me what 's missing and I think what Waleed touched on , is that lived experience of people is much more varied and personal than the kind of things that you can pick out to make a case against God or that , you know , God is somehow missing from a great disaster or tragedy but he is there in a miracle .
And I just think that , you know , the lived experience of people who are religious is - it 's part of what it is to be human , it seems to be , for a great , great many people across time and I do n't think it 's something that 's going to go away .
TONY JONES : Christopher ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
This was the tail of the last question .
I asked the lady from the Sydney Institute whether these ...
SALLY WARHAFT : Anne .
ANNE HENDERSON : I'm Anne .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , I do n't know you well enough yet .
ANNE HENDERSON : I 'll just introduce myself .
I'm Anne .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Perhaps we 'll be more bonded by the end of the ...
ANNE HENDERSON :
And some would say not much of a lady .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
We 'll be more - we 'll be more intimate by the end of the ...
TONY JONES : None of us would say that .
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , I know people who would .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
It 's just not the way I was brought up .
Perhaps by the end of the show we 'll be more intimate .
Why I asked her about - because she was n't content just to say religious people volunteer for charities , if that was news to anybody , but she had to couple it with a smear against Fabianism and social democracy .
Now , as a matter of fact ...
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , they were n't there , Christopher , that 's all I was saying .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I 'm sorry to say that without the ....
ANNE HENDERSON : I did n't say it was a smear .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : No , the efforts of Fabianism is you ...
ANNE HENDERSON : But you 're good at smears .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : The efforts of Fabianism ...
ANNE HENDERSON : What 's wrong with a smear ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I 'll get to the end of this sentence if it kills you , let alone me .
ANNE HENDERSON : We have to interrupt you , Christopher .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
The efforts of socialists and social democrats to make sure that things like education and health do not depend upon private charity given by rick people and religious institutions to the deserving poor are the reasons why a lot of it is taken care of because it 's taken care of , because we would have welfare and ...
ANNE HENDERSON : Hang on , I was n't rich .
But , just a minute , there 's another smear .
I was n't a rich person giving charity where it was n't got .
You have to understand the problem ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I did n't say that you were .
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , it seemed to come across that way .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I did n't even imply that you were .
No , the efforts of Fabianism and social democracy - socialism - were to make sure that these things did n't depend on the voluntary whim ...
ANNE HENDERSON : Yeah , but they do n't do that now .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ... or the idea of the deserving poor .
Now , that 's the first point .
ANNE HENDERSON : I know about Fabianism .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
The second point - well , because it 's so taken for granted now , I love to remind people .
Actually this meant ...
ANNE HENDERSON : But that was a long time ago .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
This meant social , political action , as you correctly say ...
TONY JONES : Hang on for one second .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
As you quite correctly say , and I can help you out here by emphasising it , quite a while ago .
That 's why I said not to forget it .
Now , to the point about religious activism .
Is n't it true - have n't you all heard that Hamas does so well because it supplies social services ?
Are you going to say that the same is true for Hamas , an Islamic jihad ?
Never mind that they 're religious .
They distribute services where otherwise there 'd only be secularism and corruption .
Well , if you want to claim that , you can't just claim the charitable part of it , it seems to me .
Mother Teresa endlessly praised for work that most of the time she actually never did .
I went to watch her very closely in Calcutta .
You do n't mind that she thinks that what Bengal and Calcutta mainly needs is a campaign , a clerical campaign , against birth control and family planning .
Has anyone here ever been to Bengal and concluded that 's what it really needs ?
That 's what she was really campaigning for , in case you are worried .
But never mind .
She gives a wonderful impression of being a charitable person .
So what Indians need is more missionaries to cure poverty , when everybody knows there 's only one cure for poverty , which is the empowerment of women , which means giving them some control over their reproduction .
You name me - you name me a Catholic or Muslim charity that goes into the fields determined to secure the empowerment of women ...
TONY JONES : Okay , well , let 's see ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ... and you 'll have the ghost of a point .
TONY JONES : Let 's see if Frank Brennan ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Up till now you do n't .
TONY JONES : Let 's see if Frank Brennan can address that point .
FRANK BRENNAN : Well , let 's take it .
I mean , people like ( indistinct ) have argued very strongly and persuasively , like yourself Christopher , that empowerment of women is the key to the development of peoples .
Now , why do n't we just drop the bagging and smearing and saying , all right , anyone who is out there , let 's judge them by their fruits ?
Whether they 're atheists or whether they 're Catholics or whatever , let 's drop the bagging and smearing .
Let 's say , right , we agree .
What we 've got to be working for is the empowerment of women .
And there are people of religious dispositions who are passionately committed to that and , yes , there will be mistakes made in terms of policies and in terms of moral theories , but that 's where I think , in a pluralist society like Australia , we can have the respectful dialogue and we can work those things through , as we do this evening .
TONY JONES : Waleed Aly ?
WALEED ALY : I 'm just trying to figure out which aspect to take .
I think ...
TONY JONES : I guess that the argument being made in that question is religion does n't poison everything because there are people who do good works .
WALEED ALY : I think there 's a real call that needs to be made for some honesty here on the part of religious people .
And that is that , yes , lots of religious people do lots of very good things and there was research published , I think , two years ago looking at generation Y Australians that found that those who were more religiously committed were more socially aware , they were more committed to the social good and all that sort of thing , and you can point to those studies and you can say , " That 's wonderful . "
But , in a sense , I think you get caught in a reactionary argument , which is with all these people lining up saying , " Look how horrible religion is , " you get a religious response that says , " No. No. No. No .
We 're good .
Look at these charities , " turning a blind eye to not only some of the points that Christopher raises , but also the fact that there are religious charities that do a lot of that religious work for their own ends that , in my judgment , are actually quite nefarious at times .
Religions can be used as a cover and a pretext for violence and evil and all sorts of things .
It can be instrumentalised in that way .
It can also be instrumentalised in the opposite way .
And so I kind of echo what Father Frank Brennan has said here and that is that if you actually look to the substance of what people are doing , rather than asking the first question , is this a religious organisation or is this not , and then trying to make some judgment about their conduct and their motives on the basis of that , then I think you get further down the track of making some kind of assessment .
I think we get caught in these petty games about , well , you know , are religious people good or bad .
Just get on with being good or being bad and let people make up their own mind .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
That 's excellent .
I really think that 's brilliantly phrased but there is one more thing we have to say , just to do with the logical inference .
If Catholic charities were better than I say they were , or Muslim ones , it still would n't have anything to do with the truth or otherwise of their preachments any more than a group like MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res , for example , which would be my favourite medical charity , or Amnesty International , which is completely secular , proves that there is not God .
I mean , it 's purely coincidental .
WALEED ALY : That 's an entirely separate argument .
But if the question ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , yeah , but it 's part of the premise that needs to be ...
WALEED ALY : No but if the question is about ...
ANNE HENDERSON : No , but ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
No , I 'm going to interrupt you all because there is a questioner and Christopher Hitchens obviously has got a lot of attention from our audience and here 's a question aimed directly at him .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Oh , dear .
TONY JONES : From Jessica Langrell .
JESSICA LANGRELL : Just another one to Mr Hitchens .
You typically stereotype religious people as dogmatic and fundamentalist .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ( Indistinct )
JESSICA LANGRELL : How is this , when people who listen to you feel as if you are the one being dogmatic and fundamentalist in your evangelical pursuit to convert the world to atheism ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , I have to - I would have expected more applause for a cheap point like that .
That 's more like it .
Now , that 's more like what I call applause .
I will have to , Tony , put myself in the safe keeping of your audience , both tonight here physically and those who are watching , and ask them if they really think that 's what I do or what I 'm like , and the reason the questions have come to me , all of them so far , is not just because of my sexual charisma .
But if it was - this description of me as dogmatic and my only description of others as being dogmatic was true , the I would n't be able to correct it in the time of this show .
TONY JONES : Christopher , just getting to the point of why religion still resonates .
Here 's a quote from your book for you to reflect on : " Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature ; the heart of a heartless world .
It is the spirit of a spiritless situation . "
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Yes .
" It is the opiate of the people , " the quotation goes on .
And it goes on even more beautifully to say that - no , it 's not from me .
It 's not from me .
It goes on to say that , " Criticism of religion has plucked the flowers from the chain , not so that men and women may wear the chain without consolation but so that they may break the chain and cull the living flower . "
It 's from Karl Marx .
It 's the opening of his critique of Hegel 's Philosophy of Right .
It 's the most misrepresented quotation probably of the 19th century .
It 's the one where he does n't say religion is the opium of the people .
TONY JONES : But he does ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
It 's the one that shows that atheists are not dogmatists .
TONY JONES :
But he does understand , essentially , in making that point why religion still resonates today .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Yes .
He understands why religion is ineradicable ; why it 's part of the human makeup and personality ; and why it 's the most interesting argument that we have , because it was our first attempt at philosophy , just as it was our first attempt at health care , cosmology , astronomy and so on .
It 's the argument that never goes stale .
FRANK BRENNAN : But I think one of the strengths of your book is that you do concede that religion is ineradicable , so given that reality , I mean , I come back to the point .
Why not drop the bagging and smearing and let 's say the solvent is respectful , public discourse .
We judge things by their fruits and if there be arguments which are put which are misconceived , then we talk that out .
TONY JONES : Okay .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Well , Father ...
TONY JONES : Hang on , I 'm just going - I 'm going to interrupt once again ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ... you 're the soul of charity but , I mean , who has been bagging and smearing , and you 've said that twice now , as if you 're sitting there , our only protection against a wave of smearing and battering .
As long as we have a civil conversation , we do n't have to keep on saying that that 's what we 're doing .
TONY JONES : Okay .
In this civil conversation we have an audience .
We 've got a gentleman up there with his hand up , and I 'm going to come to you .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : This question is for Chris and for Waleed .
You - Frank , sorry .
Frank and Waleed .
You said that we live in a pluralistic society where - duality society .
What is your views on gay marriage and why is it there seems to be such opposition from the Christian and Muslim societies against it ?
TONY JONES : Okay , we 'll take a quick answer from Frank and Waleed on that .
FRANK BRENNAN : I 've just finished a national human rights inquiry .
We 've heard about this constantly around the country .
I would approach the issue of gay marriage , distinguishing two things .
One , people of a religious disposition may have a view about what they call the sacramentality of marriage .
I would see that as a separate question from the civil institution of marriage .
Now , in terms of the civil institution of marriage , I think one of the welcome developments in Australia is we 've got to the stage of saying that discrimination against people on the grounds of their sexuality should be wiped out completely and that we 're a better society for that being the case .
In terms of the next step , whether or not in civil law there should be a recognition of the bond between two men or two women as being the same as marriage as it's presently understood , the real issue , I think , is whether or not that decision is best made by our elected politicians or whether it 's made by our elected judges .
And I think at the moment , in Australia , the view has been that that should be a decision of our elected politicians .
My own view is , moving around the country , I think that younger Australians , they do n't see it as a problem .
It 's not an issue .
I think for a lot of older Australians it 's still an issue and , guess what , a lot of them happen to be married .
So in terms of a free and democratic society , for those who are civilly married , then we 've got to bring them with us as we look at any change on that issue .
TONY JONES : All right .
Before I go to anyone else on that , you 're watching Q&A .
We actually have a video question that 's going to , I think , continue this discussion .
We 're watching Q&A .
Remember you can send your web or video questions to our website - the address is on the screen - like this video from Joseph Bromely of Malmsbury , Victoria .
JOSEPH BROMELY : Hello Comrades .
Can we ever hope to live in a truly secular society when the religious maintain their ability to affect political discourse and decision making on issues such as voluntary euthanasia , same - sex unions , abortion and discrimination in employment ?
TONY JONES : Christopher , this wo n't mean anything to you but I was a bit distracted by that because he looks enormously like a young Malcolm Turnbull .
I 'll just repeat his question .
WALEED ALY : I was thinking Syd Barrett , actually .
TONY JONES : Can we ever hope to live in a truly secular society when the religions maintain their ability to affect political discourse and decision making on issues like voluntary euthanasia , same - sex marriage , abortion and discrimination in employment ?
Waleed Aly ?
WALEED ALY : I frankly do n't understand the question .
Well , I do literally understand the question but there are assumptions embedded within it that I think need to be examined .
I actually think a secular society implies the ability of religious arguments to enter the discourse .
The idea of secularism , the reason for it coming into existence , was to open the public discourse to a range of views : religious ; irreligious ; and otherwise .
It 's about the separation of church and state .
That is , it 's about removing the levers of government , the levers of power , from a religious institution like the church .
That 's a different thing from saying that arguments that have their grounding in some kind of religious commitment cannot be aired .
That , to me , is actually an anti-secular position , because what it 's doing is its saying , " Here are the approved modes of discourse .
Here are the approved arguments . "
The idea of a secular society is to say : " You want to come from a socialist perspective ?
You want to come from a Christian perspective , an Islamic perspective , a Hindu perspective or some other perspective that , as yet , has not been conceived , fine .
And we 'll sort that out in the political process . "
I think to say on euthanasia religious people are not allowed to comment as religious people is ridiculous and anti-secular and anti-liberal .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Sally Warhaft ?
SALLY WARHAFT : I agree with everything Waleed said .
If what the question was meant to ask was , you know , as meaning a society without religion then I 'd say you want to be careful what you wish for and ...
TONY JONES : Perhaps he 's talking about a society without politicians who are expressly religious and therefore ...
SALLY WARHAFT : Well , then maybe we should all be praying very hard for that .
I 'm not sure .
But , you know , I mean , you imagine ...
TONY JONES : Or voting very hard for it .
SALLY WARHAFT : That 's right .
I mean and what Waleed said is absolutely true .
Secularism means everybody can get involved and , I mean , it 's a great thing about a country like this .
But , you know , you imagine back in time .
I do n't want to imagine a world that never had Mozart or Bach in it .
You know , you have to be careful what you ask for .
TONY JONES : You 're not religious though .
Why do you value religion ?
SALLY WARHAFT : Because I think that I 'm interested in what drives human beings , in what makes human beings human .
And I think there is obviously - whether you 're religious or not , there is something in human beings that passions and faith override reason in just about everything we do .
From we get up in the morning and we choose what to wear or , you know , there 's a lot that 's going on in human behaviour that is not that well thought out and , in fact , a lot of our reason is in analysis .
It 's after the fact and I think that ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
None the worse for that , though .
I mean ...
SALLY WARHAFT : Well , you need both , you know .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Though it 's true , there are n't many secular gothic cathedrals , for example .
SALLY WARHAFT : But ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Verdi could write a beautiful requiem .
TONY JONES : What do you call the Kremlin ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , it 's the - Verdi could write a very good requiem without actually being a believer , but I do n't think that John Donne could have written his sacred poetry not - thinking I do n't really believe any of this .
I mean it 's quite clear that there 's an instinct in all of us for the numinous and the transcendent , you might say .
I think you can have it without the supernatural .
In fact , I think you have to .
Well , again , I could n't agree more , with - if I may call you - may I call you Waleed ?
WALEED ALY : Waleed , you may .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
But that 's what secular means .
But in that case I think it behoves the religious to say what they genuinely mean .
Now , Frank just talked about homosexuality as if the church had never condemned it as a mortal sin .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Yes .
Yes .
Yes .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I mean , it 's extraordinary .
I would not know that you were a member of the Society of Jesus , except that it was a very Jesuitical point you were making and concealed your main one .
TONY JONES : I 'd like to ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
And I 'm sorry , Waleed , it 's the same .
Islam says the same .
You can not be a good Muslim and publicly be a homosexual .
Why do n't you ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Absolutely .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ... given the wonderful freedom of a secular conversation , when no one is going to say anything about your right to say it , why do n't you say what you actually think ?
How about that ?
ANNE HENDERSON : Can I say something ?
TONY JONES : Okay , yes .
Yes , Anne , and then I 'd like to hear from Frank .
ANNE HENDERSON : Can I just say that what I find interesting about your book , Christopher , is that everyone 's the same and yet we 're all violently different and if you are a cultural Catholic , as I am , I do n't listen to what the Pope says every day and take my guide from him .
My mother , who is 84 , says she had a Vatican bypass 30 years ago .
You know , it is n't like you see it .
Maybe because you 're not a believer , you do n't understand that within ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Sounds like progress of a kind .
ANNE HENDERSON : No , but she converted from a completely non-believing family when she was about 20 .
But the thing is that religion is so manifestly pluralist , as well .
I mean , there 's so many different ways in which people see God and even within the Catholic Church there 's violently different ways in which people practice their faith .
And the idea ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Did you say violently ?
ANNE HENDERSON : Pardon ?
I missed that .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
You did say violently ?
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , violently , as well .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I know you did n't mean to .
ANNE HENDERSON : I agree with you .
I agree with you on all that that you say about violence among religion .
And that 's the point .
I like the old Greeks and the Romans .
You had a god of war and a god of peace and , you know , you had different kind of gods .
I like that .
But the idea that we 're all following the Pope , I think , is a bit misguided .
TONY JONES : Okay , I want to ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
You 're either Roman Catholic or you 're not , but you can be tonnes of kinds of Catholic .
ANNE HENDERSON : Oh , you'd be surprised , Christopher .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
There are several - there are five popes I know about .
There 's a ( indistinct ) pope , there 's an eastern pope ...
ANNE HENDERSON : No , all right .
Well , I 'm talking about the one in Rome .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Most - not accepting the authority of the Holy Father , I leave it to this father .
But I mean , I think that 's not ...
ANNE HENDERSON : I think since about 1969 there has n't been .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : People who take their faith a la carte and cafeteria style do n't impress me very much on the points of principal and conviction that we 're supposed to be talking about .
ANNE HENDERSON : Look , if Catholics were following the pope , they 'd all have 10 children .
They do n't .
TONY JONES : Frank Brennan , can I ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , that 's a start , too .
TONY JONES : Can I hear Frank Brennan on ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Progress of a kind .
TONY JONES : ... the fundamental point that Christopher Hitchens made , which is how can you say something which is clearly against the teachings of your church , clearly against the teachings of the Pope ?
FRANK BRENNAN : I have n't said anything clearly against the teaching of my church or against my pope .
I have drawn a distinction between ...
TONY JONES : So but hang on a sec ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
You have n't said what the teaching was .
TONY JONES : ... is homosexuality a sin or otherwise and if it is a sin , is it the sort of sin that would see you go to hell , according to Roman Catholicism ?
FRANK BRENNAN : No , homosexuality is not a sin .
It 's a disposition .
If you want to argue - if you want to argue about whether particular homosexual acts are appropriate for an individual in a moral context , that would require a pastoral discussion with that individual .
What we were discussing previously was what should be the law in a civil society such as Australia where you have people of different religious convictions and the question was whether or not there should be same - sex marriage .
Now , that is not an issue which is resolved by determining what the Catholic Church says to its own members it regards as moral or immoral .
They 're quite distinct questions .
TONY JONES : Waleed
Aly , you on the same question , if you like .
Is homosexuality a sin in Islam ?
WALEED ALY : I 'll get to that .
The thing I want to say - no , no .
But there 's an important distinction here and I get often frustrated with this discourse of lumping the Islamic tradition in with the Christian tradition , particularly the Catholic tradition , because they 're structurally so fundamentally different .
The Catholic tradition has a church which has a kind of divine imprimatur and authority .
The Islamic tradition is a far more anarchic tradition in a sense .
There is no centralised authority , especially in the Sunni tradition .
So to say the Islamic teaching on anything is X is a position that immediately becomes contestable .
You can try to verify it statistically or otherwise but the point is that , at the very least in theory , if not in practice , any position that you take is a position that you take that may or may not - that may be fallible and is open to being contested by other Islamic theologians or other Muslims and so on .
So on any question , whether it be homosexuality or it be anything , you will find a position that the majority take .
And on the question of homosexuality , undoubtedly , if you took a poll in the Muslim world , you would find that most people would consider it sinful behaviour .
But if you took ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Dodging it .
It 's not what Muslims think , it 's what Islam teaches we asked you about .
WALEED ALY : Yeah , but - okay .
But my question is - my question is , what exactly ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Dodging it .
WALEED ALY : ... is your repository of a list of Islamic conclusions ?
There is not book called Islamic Law .
There is no Islamic body that says , " This is what Islam teaches . "
It has , for 1400 years , been an ongoing conversation .
So and what was ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Ongoing conversation is very good .
WALEED ALY : Yeah , and - but that 's my point .
If - if there is a criticism I would make of the Muslim world it is this : it is that particularly in the post - colonial era , as religion has become an identity movement , rather than something that 's actually anything to do with spirituality and faith , in my view , particularly in the post colonial world , that religiosity , Islam has become instrumentalised as a list of conclusions , as a political ideology , as though there is some manifesto you can just download from a computer and install into a society .
It does n't work that way , certainly not in the classical tradition .
The classical tradition was one of constant debate .
That 's why it was very difficult to get something like an inquisition going .
We managed it at some point but it was not terribly successful and it ultimately crumbled because you can't ultimately centralise authority to make definitive statements on behalf of God in the Islamic tradition .
That 's an act of policyism to do that in ( indistinct ) .
TONY JONES :
All right , I 'm just going to interrupt the flow for a minute , because we have another question tonight .
It comes from Heidi Crieghton .
HEIDI CRIEGHTON : Yes , my question is for Christopher Hitchens .
With many voters using our politicians religious persuasions to influence their vote , do you expect to see , in your lifetime , an openly atheist politician be appointed to the head of government , for example for Australia , Britain or the United States ?
TONY JONES : I 'm not going to let Christopher answer this immediately .
I 'd rather throw it round the panel first .
Frank Brennan ?
FRANK BRENNAN : I think undoubtedly .
I mean , perhaps not so readily in the United States or if in the United States the presidential candidate were atheist he or she would probably still proclaim some religious conviction in that that 's part of the United States .
But I think here in Australia whether or not one of our political leaders , I would think , was an atheist or of a religious persuasion , I think is almost an irrelevance to the Australian community .
TONY JONES : Okay , let 's hear from Anne Henderson on that .
I mean I can't think of any atheist prime ministers - Australian prime ministers to day .
ANNE HENDERSON : Atheist ?
Well ...
TONY JONES : You might know some .
Certainly not openly atheist .
AUDIENCE MEMBERS : Bob Hawke .
ANNE HENDERSON : Did Gough openly complain he was a believer ?
It 's not so much ...
TONY JONES : Not Bob Hawke .
ANNE HENDERSON :
It 's not so much whether you 're an atheist or agnostic or a believer , it 's what you say to the people you are .
I find it interesting at the moment , and I would n't have thought it would have happened in the 1980s , that all leaders of countries in the west seem to want to go to church every Sunday , Christian churches .
It was interesting that Tony Blair would n't take on being a Catholic .
I think is he considering it now ?
SALLY WARHAFT : He 's done it .
ANNE HENDERSON : He became a Catholic now after he left his position as prime minister .
The problem with democratic politics is - and spin and 24 hour news and whatever , the person who inevitably comes to lead the country , and I think that questioner had it right , is going to have to reflect the strength of belief in the country itself .
So if you went around , like Christopher , bagging all the churches and anyone who believed , I think it will be a long time before that happens and I would be very surprised if it ever did happen .
You could be an atheist , but I do n't think you 'd go around telling everyone that you thought everyone that was a believer was an idiot .
TONY JONES : Sally Warhaft ?
SALLY WARHAFT : I think there is - there is just no way the United States ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Again , scant applause for a cheap point .
That 's encouraging .
SALLY WARHAFT : ... I think that there is no way the United States would elect a president who was not a practicing Christian of some sort in my lifetime .
I just can not see it .
I mean , interestingly , they 're ready to elect a woman and I think they would have if there had n't of been an Obama there , but there is just no way - in fact , I think that 's probably going backwards in American culture at the moment .
Australia , I do n't think people could care less .
TONY JONES : Christopher ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , my only point would be - I 'll make a quick point about the United States .
It 's a good thing that atheists are not banned from holding the office , because we would have missed Mr Lincoln , for example .
And , in my opinion , Mr Jefferson and one or two other people probably worth having .
But as late as ...
SALLY WARHAFT : ( Indistinct )
ANNE HENDERSON : ... as late as the - in England the life of James Stewart Mill , in America the life of Benjamin Franklin , they were quite well known publicly , you would think , secure , confident professional thinkers who did n't say - did n't think it was advisable to let people know what they thought in public because that 's how dangerous it could be in a pious regime and it seems that and all people of faith can apparently congratulate themselves upon it , that faith still demands - professions of faith by people who do n't hold it that are , by definition , hypocritical .
So congratulations to religious opinion for bringing that beautiful thing about in what 's supposed to be a secular democracy .
TONY JONES : Okay .
No doubt we 'll come - we 're going to come back to religious questions shortly but you 're watching Q&A , the unpredictable program where you get to ask the questions .
If you 'd like to ask a question in person , go to our website , register to join the studio audience .
We 'll change subjects now or a while .
Our next question comes from William Mackenzie .
WILLIAM MACKENZIE : Is great talent an excuse paedophilia ?
What are the panel 's opinions on the Roman Polanski situation in Switzerland and America at the moment ?
TONY JONES : Waleed ?
WALEED ALY : Can someone explain to me why - I actually do n't understand the argument that he should n't be brought before a - I just do n't understand it .
I 'm happy for someone to convince me .
TONY JONES :
Well , there 's an argument in France that he 's very talented so he should n't , therefore , face trial .
ANNE HENDERSON : No , but have you caught up with the news ?
It 's all changed .
It 's changed today , which was interesting .
The French have backed off .
Hilary Clinton has said it 's a legal matter .
The Polish leader , I think , has backed off , even though he 's married to someone who is supporting Polanski .
And a Hollywood serious communicator has a blog or something where the anti-Polanski responses are running 100 to one and the New York Times has come out and argued against him , which is an interesting phenomenon .
So maybe it 's changing .
WALEED ALY : Can I say there 's a ...
SALLY WARHAFT : I do n't know why it would n't - would be interesting .
I mean , I just can't believe that they would n't argue that he should be tried .
I was reading his autobiography last night and Polanski's account of , you know , making love to this young woman on Jack Nicholson 's couch , it was just a - you know ...
TONY JONES :
So why has it taken so long ?
SALLY WARHAFT : Because he ran away .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
That 's where the talent comes in .
TONY JONES : Yeah .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ( Indistinct ) they say in Latin .
You touch the point of a needle .
He 's already had the rewards of being talented .
30 years on the lam after , I 'll say it directly , fornicating with and sodomising a 13 - year - old to whom he had given narcotics to lull her .
ANNE HENDERSON : And to which he pled guilty .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Now , excuse me .
You know , we do have our standards , even those of us who do n't believe we are being supernaturally supervised .
SALLY WARHAFT : Although the really sad thing is that this woman has come out and said that the trial by media that she 's going to have to endure in this is , she believes , worse than the actual crime , which is - it 's a really sad and terrible tale this .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
But that 's his fault too .
ANNE HENDERSON : Yes , it is .
SALLY WARHAFT : That 's absolutely it is .
And he still needs to be tried but it 's awful that she 's going to have to suffer so - she does n't want it to define her whole life .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
For discussing this - - -
SALLY WARHAFT : And yet he has to be tried .
He has to be ( indistinct ) .
ANNE HENDERSON :
But it was his lawyers that brought this back into the arena and so , in a sense , this has been all brought about because late last year his lawyers tried to get through a loophole in the law to have his charges dropped and , of course , that then set the prosecution out and running .
TONY JONES : Can I ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : For discussing ...
TONY JONES : Can I make a point and a sort of admission here , and I 'm almost surprised ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Oh , I want to hear the admission .
TONY JONES : I 'm almost surprised by the admission , which is that ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Bring on the admission .
TONY JONES : Well , it 's a simple one really , that I 've actually been to see several of his films in that period .
I 've watched others on DVD and when you think about it carefully , is that somehow supporting him ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
You mean , we'd have been deprived of the films if he'd been nabbed in the first place ?
TONY JONES : Not at all .
I 'm simply saying I wonder why I did n't think about this at the time .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , because we 're all capable of keeping two sets of books .
I mean , that 's part of our nature .
Well , I can see that I 'm not the only one .
ANNE HENDERSON : Yeah , we 're all sinners .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Just for discussing this subject , a couple of years ago , my magazine , Vanity Fair , was sued by Mr Polanski from Paris in London .
Not in America where he thought the jurisdiction would be easier on him .
He did n't even have to appear in person , because he thought that might be risky .
He made a video deposition .
We claimed he had no reputation to defend .
He walked away with a lot of our money on a libel judgment saying this could n't be discussed .
So I would say screw him and I would add - and I would add screw him for a change .
TONY JONES : Frank Brennan ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
It 's his turn .
FRANK BRENNAN : Going back to the question , I mean what about the 13 - year - old girl ?
I mean ...
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , she 's saying no .
FRANK BRENNAN : But go back to then and , I mean , to speak of , you know , the talent of the one who is the perpetrator - what about the talent and what 's happened to the victim and what the law has got to be about is protecting the victim , whether or not she 's talented .
And if the perpetrator be talented , well , it counts for nothing .
That 's what justice , according to law , has to be about .
SALLY WARHAFT : Although , sadly , you know , the stuff up of this means that it has n't protected her at all .
It 's gone on for 35 years and it could have all been over .
WALEED ALY : Can I just ...
TONY JONES : Yeah .
WALEED ALY : There 's a broader point , as well , that 's not about the Polanski case , and this is where I get in my lawyer mode .
It 's about the integrity of the justice system .
You cannot , I think , as a justice system , tolerate or reward someone just because they managed to get away with it for 30 years and say , " Oh , that was a long time ago . "
Well , no , there is a reason that the criminal of law does n't have a statute of limitations that applies to it , by and large .
And that is because we deem crime to be of such significant import that it must be punished irrespective of how - what time has elapsed between the commission of the offence and the finding of the offender .
There is ...
ANNE HENDERSON :
And imagine what we would say if it was a bishop .
WALEED ALY : Well , of course .
But I just cannot , just for the life of me ...
ANNE HENDERSON : Well , that 's right .
TONY JONES : Probably what everyone on the panel actually has been saying .
You 're watching Q&A , the live and interactive forum where you ask the questions .
Our next question comes from Basak Yildiz .
BASAK YILDIZ :
Why is it that the Islamic country , Iran , is the threat to the peace in the world and not the Zionist ?
Is it America 's support of Israel , while hundreds of people are getting killed in Gaza and West Bank , everyday with the support of America .
The Israel and Palestinian war has been going on for 61 years and we are not actually looking at what is actually happening and we 're fearing about what is not happening ?
We 're fearing about something that has n't happened .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Sally Warhaft , do you want to pick that up ?
And I might add , by the way , we had a number of questions asking why Iran 's nuclear program and not Israel 's is the illegal one .
SALLY WARHAFT : Mm . Look , this is - it 's a tragedy .
I think Israel and Palestine , it 's something where it almost takes half an hour to sort out what has to happen .
You know , the Palestinians need a state .
Israelis need to feel secure .
But it feels like that 's - it 's just so far away .
I think that part of the problem is obviously the delicacy of the Israeli coalition .
I mean , I do n't know , beyond what I 've just said , that - it 's simple what has to happen but how you make it happen and how you make people want peace more than they want other things is beyond me .
TONY JONES : Christopher Hitchens ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
It 's become a familiar thing .
I should perhaps preface this by saying that with Edward Said , the late professor Edward Said , I wrote a book about the rights of Palestinians and the way in which these have been negated by Israeli policy .
But I know a lot of people in the Arab and Muslim world who are fed up with having the subject changed to Israel whenever human rights for them comes up .
A very good example of this just last week in Tehran , where the government has an official Al - Quds Day , as it's called , the day of Jerusalem , where school children and others are paraded .
It 's a more or less compulsory demonstration to say they 'll give their blood and their lives for Palestine and hundreds of thousands of Iranians turned up to say , no , we 'll only give our blood for Iran , thanks .
We 're fed up with being told by the regime that they represent the oppressed of Palestine .
That we can't talk , and they are having to shed their blood because the regime keeps on killing them for wanting to have a say in their own internal affairs .
And a regime that does this and has just pulled off a blood stained military coup .
It 's overturned the results even of an already pre-determinedly fraudulent election that says that a woman 's voice is worth that of only - sorry , it takes three women in a court against one man ; that uses torture and rape as policies in prison and so forth .
If you want a regime like that to have nuclear weapons , you 're welcome , but you should say that 's what you do n't mind .
Are you going to say that ?
Are you going to say you 've no objection ?
That the real problem is the Jewish state ?
Come on , be serious .
BASAK YILDIZ : Sir - sir , you 're - sir , the Jewish state does n't have nuclear weapons .
Is that - is that what you 're saying ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , now , I appeal again to the fair mindedness and intelligence of the audience .
Did I say that ?
AUDIENCE : No .
BASAK YILDIZ : No , but you say ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Did I by - in any way imply it ?
BASAK YILDIZ : No , but ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : No .
Did I not begin with a throat clearing , which I 'll amplify if you like , about my long record of work about this , my defence of the Israeli dissidents who publish the news about Israel 's illegal program and have gone to jail for it .
I can refer you to all that , if you like .
BASAK YILDIZ : What ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
My point was directed specifically to you .
TONY JONES : Yeah , okay .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : I said , " Does this , in your mind , make the destruction of human rights in Islamic countries okay or not ? "
BASAK YILDIZ : No .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Good .
BASAK YILDIZ : No , it 's not .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Let 's hear from Waleed Aly .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , that 's progress of a kind .
WALEED ALY : This is - I think highlights the really difficult , I think , personally intractable situation that now confronts the world in dealing with Iran 's apparent nuclear weapons ' regime and I hear today that the UN is still not developing weapons .
But whatever you think about that , there is a problem because you do get questions like this .
Whether or not you agree with Christopher there 's a lack of moral seriousness about that question , you 're always going to get that question .
The minute the conversation turns to Iran , it is going to be deflected towards Israel .
And so the problem is that if you 're interested in disarming Iran or somehow reigning in that regime , it 's very hard to do that in isolation without also engaging in some kind of agreement that 's going to bring Israel into the mix and , of course , the US , who also have nuclear weapons .
I 'm encouraged by the fact that President Obama is talking about a nuclear free world and that when he headed the UN - presided over the UN Security Council this week , which I think is the first time an American president has ever done that , the vote to rid the world of nuclear weapons was unanimous .
That 's all good .
But now the really , really tough politics stars , and that is the politics of dealing with an Iranian regime that frankly probably sees very little incentive , if any , to try to disarm or to become less evil .
It 's got every reason to remain as evil and perhaps even become even more evil than it is .
And Israel is going to have to be part of that discussion , whether they like it or not , whether the US likes it or not , because without that I just can't see how there 's a way forward .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Tony , sorry , I simply must say this .
I 'm really sorry .
Implied in both what Waleed has said and the lady questioner , is the idea that Iran is perfectly entitled to have nuclear weapons .
At least if Israel is , it is .
BASAK YILDIZ : No . No .
That 's ...
WALEED ALY : No .
No .
That 's not what I implied at all .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Well , the Iranian government , do n't let 's forget , says it does n't want them and is n't planning to have them .
And so if it turns out they are , it 's not a problem to do with Israel , it 's to do with them breaking every undertaking they 've ever made at the United Nations ; every undertaking they 've ever made to the International Atomic Energy Authority ; every undertaking they 've ever made to the European Union negotiators .
It means that international law is completely meaningless and , yet , when Mr Ahmadinejad tests missiles , he says , " This is part of our nuclear program . "
How is that part of a peaceful ( indistinct ) ?
WALEED ALY : Yeah , can I just say ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Their party - their proxy party Hasbullah - I 've been to its rallies in Beirut .
Do you know what the symbol of the party now it ?
What they 've put on the flag ?
A mushroom cloud with a threat to the Jews written underneath it .
WALEED ALY : Can I just ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Now , actually , when you go to meetings of the American Jewish Committee , you do n't quite get that ( indistinct ) .
TONY JONES : Christopher , hold on .
We 're just going to hear from Waleed .
WALEED ALY : Yeah .
TONY JONES :
And then I 'm going to go to another question , which is related .
WALEED ALY : I think that 's a bit of a gross misreading of what I was - and I 'm certainly not implying that .
But what I am saying is the real politic of dealing with this situation is that for the Iranian regime - if you put yourself in the position of the Iranian regime that has now become such a grotesque , deformed regime that in a sense it has to perpetuated that deformity in order to survive .
That 's kind of the logic of those sorts of regimes .
The minute you do that - they are now in a position where it 's just going to be very hard to create the political environment for them to change course without dragging Israel in .
Now , whether or not you want to say that Israel 's acquiring nuclear weapons is equivalent to Iran's , worse , better - that , to me , is not the point as far as real politics is concerned .
How are you going to get that change to occur without incorporating Israel into the conversation .
That 's the point .
TONY JONES : Christopher , I 'd like to sort of put a line under this but I just want to ask you one question and a brief answer if you could .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
You mean I 'm incapable of a brief answer ?
I can be terse if I have to be .
TONY JONES : Okay , well , answer this tersely .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Try me .
TONY JONES : Israel , of course , did try and stop Iraq acquiring nuclear weapons by bombing a reactor .
Would it be justified , in your opinion , for them to do the same in Iran ?
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : What Israel did the Osirak reactor was what the Iranians had tried to do - everyone forgets this - with their own air force a couple of months before .
The Iranians had a huge sigh of relief when the Israelis pulled off a raid they could n't bring off themselves and disarmed Saddam Hussein .
There were a lot of people in the Sunni Arab world , believe you me , who hope that the Israeli 's take out the Iranian one in turn , but they can't say so in public , anymore than the Iranians could before .
My own view is that Israel both cannot and should not attempt such an attack .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Well , we 're going to move on again .
Actually , look , you 've had your hand up for a while .
I 'm going to take your question .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Thank you .
TONY JONES :
The lady in the front there .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Look , my one question is basically - or my one comment or passing comment is that so many times you 've brought up women and Islam .
I 'd just like to correct that I 've read the Qur'an and all Muslim scholars would agree with me that Islam gives women a lot of rights .
We over and over give Islam women - in Islam , through the Qur'an , I may not say it through individuals who preach the religion but Islam , through the Qur'an , gives women a lot of rights and I need that to be heard .
I need to have everyone to understand and hear that .
I mean , I am a young Muslim woman myself .
I sit before you .
I have a voice and I can speak to you and I can look you in the eye and I do have my rights .
And when I go to Iran - I 'm actually Iranian , as well .
So when I go to Iran I also have my rights .
I need it to be heard that the Qur'an - the Qur'an , Allah , ( indistinct ) Allah , gives us our rights .
People - individuals in countries and people who represent our religion may not and they may do the wrong thing to sort of stand in front and show us religion and preach us religion , but Islam does .
TONY JONES : All right .
We 're going to take that as a comment .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Thank you .
TONY JONES : And a very passionate one .
Okay .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : Oh , no .
Oh , no we 're not .
No , we 're not going to take that as a comment .
I can see your face .
I can see your hair and I can you sitting there in the audience with young gentlemen .
Do n't you tell me you can do any of that in Iran .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I can , though .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : No , you can't .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : Yes , I can .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : No , you cannot .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I can .
In Iran - in Iran - in the Islamic Republic of Iran , where I have been ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
You - you would n't - I could n't see your hair .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ... my hair would be out .
My hair would be out because my veil would be little .
My hair would be - it may be covered a little bit .
But just like in the Bible ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
Oh , come on .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ... in the Letter to the Corinthians ...
TONY JONES : Okay .
Okay .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ... it says to cover your head to be modest .
My modesty would be there .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
It 's a shame she spoiled what could have been a perfectly good statement .
TONY JONES : All right .
Okay .
I 'm sorry .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : My modesty would be there .
I mean , you 've been talking about these cheap jokes and things throughout this whole conversation , but you 're the only one making the cheap comments .
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
If you say you have - if you say that - you insult - you insult - you insult your sisters in Tehran who are being beaten ...
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Indistinct )
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS : ... who are being and raped every day when you say that they have their rights in the Islamic republic .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I do not insult my Islam sisters .
I do not insult my ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
It 's an insult to the women of Iran .
AUDIENCE MEMBER : I do not ( indistinct ) .
TONY JONES : Okay .
Okay .
We 're nearly out of time .
You 're watching Q&A live .
If you 'd like to join the audience , register on our website .
The address is on your screen : abc.net.au/qanda .
We have one last question .
It comes from Pam Collocott .
PAM COLLOCOTT : Many non-believers facing death change their minds about religion .
Is that fear or comfort ?
TONY JONES : Okay , we 're going to have to have quick answers from everybody .
Frank Brennan ?
FRANK BRENNAN : It 's often both .
ANNE HENDERSON : I would have said the same .
TONY JONES : Anne Henderson ?
ANNE HENDERSON : I would say exactly the same .
It 's , again , what I said before .
Where there is no meaning , people find God and that 's their comfort .
There 's even supposed to be a God gene , I think someone 's thought of .
And I do n't understand it totally and some part of me does so , you know , I would say I agree with Frank .
It 's fear and comfort .
TONY JONES : Waleed Aly ?
WALEED ALY : Well , let 's not ignore it's a perfectly rational decision to make at that point .
I mean , you 're on your death bed .
There 's absolutely no point not believing in God at that point .
ANNE HENDERSON : Because you might be right .
WALEED ALY :
You may as well jump on a team that , if it 's wrong , okay , you know ?
TONY JONES : Sally ?
SALLY WARHAFT : I would say God knows .
I mean , unless you 're from a team that , you know , dies repeatedly .
TONY JONES : Christopher , could you ...
CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS :
When Voltaire was dying the priest came and said , " You should renounce the devil , " and he said , " This is not time to be making enemies . "
It 's a religious falsification that people like myself scream for a priest at the end .
David Hume very famously did n't and was witnessed by James Boswell not doing so .
Most of us go to our ends with dignity .
If we do n't and if it is the wish for fear or comfort , then both of these things are equally delusory , as religion is itself .
TONY JONES : And I think what we 've - thank you .
We 've proven , I think , tonight , that this kind of discussion is worth having but that is all we have time for .
I 'm sorry to those people who have still got their hands up .
Please thank our panelists : Frank Brennan ; Christopher Hitchens ; Sally Warhaft ; Waleed Aly ; and Anne Henderson .
All right .
Next week - next week another iconoclastic panel , including the feminist author with dangerous ideas , Germaine Greer ; Gruen Transfer ad man , Todd Samson ; the Labour Party 's Belinda Neal ; and the Liberal Party Backbench rebel Corey Bernardi .
That 's all we have at the moment .
We 'll have one more by then .
So join us next Thursday for another great Q&A .
Good night .

A US Army major has opened fire on fellow soldiers at the Fort Hood military base in Texas , killing 13 people and injuring 30 , officials say .
Base commander Lt Gen Bob Cone said that the gunman had not been killed , as earlier stated , but was in custody .
It is not clear what motivated the attacker , named as 39 - year - old military psychiatrist Major Nidal Malik Hasan .
But some reports said the US - born Muslim was unhappy about being sent to Iraq or Afghanistan .
Lt Gen Cone said one of the dead was a policeman and others were soldiers .
MAJOR NIDAL MALIK HASAN US - born Muslim raised in Virginia Joined the army and trained to be a psychiatrist Treated soldiers returning from combat zones Described as a devout Muslim who attended prayers regularly Said to have been unhappy about imminent overseas deployment
Profile : Major Nidal Malik Hasan President Barack Obama described it as " a horrific outburst of violence " .
Speaking at a press conference in Washington , he said : " It is difficult enough when we lose these brave men and women abroad , but it is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on US soil . "
He extended his condolences to the families of the victims , adding : " We will make sure that we get answers to every single question about this horrible incident . "
Eleven victims were initially reported dead , but two of the injured later died , bringing the death toll to 13 .
' Racial harassment '
The gunman is now said to be wounded after being shot four times , but is in a stable condition in custody .
" His death is not imminent , " said Lt Gen Cone .

An official said authorities initially thought one of the victims was the shooter , causing a delay in identifying Maj Hasan as the suspect , AP reported .
Maj Hasan is a military psychiatrist and was reportedly due to be sent on a mission to Iraq or Afghanistan .
His cousin said Maj Hasan had been resisting such a deployment .
" He hired a military attorney to try to have the issue resolved , pay back the government , to get out of the military .
He was at the end of trying everything , " Nader Hasan told Fox News .
He also said that Nidal Malik Hasan had been battling racial harassment because of his " Middle Eastern ethnicity " .
Prior to Fort Hood , Maj Hasan served as a psychiatrist at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , which treats wounded troops from combat zones .
SHOOTINGS AT FORT HOOD US MILITARY BASE Shooting starts 1330 local time ( 1930 GMT ) at Soldier Readiness Processing Center near Howze
Theater where graduation ceremony is due to take place Thirteen people are killed and 30 injured Soldiers close off Howze Theater to protect about 600 people inside Gunman Major Nidal Malik Hasan is shot and detained Built in 1942 , Fort Hood is the largest US base in the world , home to about 40,000 personnel and includes two museums and a lake .
It has been a focus for anti-war protesters
Reaction : US base shootings
In pictures : Fort Hood shootings
Witness ' account
The shooting had begun at about 1330 ( 1930 GMT ) on Thursday at a personnel and medical centre at Fort Hood , where soldiers who are preparing to deploy go for last - minute medical check - ups , Lt Gen Cone said .
He said the gunman had two weapons , one semi-automatic , which " might explain the rate of fire " .
Asked whether the shootings were a terrorist act , Lt Gen Cone said : " I could n't rule that out but I 'm telling you that right now , the evidence does not suggest that . "
Two more suspects were apprehended in an adjacent facility , he said , but eyewitness accounts suggesting there might have been more than one gunman were later discounted .
A serviceman stationed at Fort Hood , who asked to remain anonymous , told the BBC : " I heard the emergency announcement over the speakers outside and saw people rushing to get indoors . "
Local congressman John Carter , speaking to NBC News , said gunfire had erupted half an hour before a graduation ceremony was due to begin .
' Like a city ' Fort Hood , near the town of Killeen , is the largest US base in the world .
Home to about 40,000 US troops , the base lies between Austin and Waco , about 60 miles ( 100 km ) from each city .
Soldiers at Fort Hood are among those deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan , and some will have returned from there .
The base has a centre that deals with combat stress .
Hilary Shine , of the Killeen Fire Department told the BBC's News Channel Fort Hood was like a small city .
" It has schools , a hospital , a convenience store even .
And it has a large daytime population - including civilians working on the base - with as many as 80,000 in this area during the daytime . "

IQ and Populations
The other day I came across this table of National IQs for all the countries in the world .
( Drawn from Richard Lynn 's and Tatu Vanhanen 's " Intelligence and the Wealth and Poverty of Nations " , via Gweilo , via razib . )
This is fascinating information , particularly when combined with population growth rates . {
For the purposes of this discussion , let 's stipulate that someone 's IQ is just something you can measure , which may or may not have some correlation to anything else you can measure .
Whether it has anything to do with intelligence or any particular cognitive ability will not be addressed .
} The U.S. Census Bureau has a terrific website called the International Data Base ( IDB ) .
This includes a facility to create a table of National populations for any year between 1950 and 2050 .
Let 's assume that countries are ( first - order ) self - breeding and that measured IQ was / will be stable in each country during the 100 year period .
Combining all these data yields the following graph :
The dark blue line is the average IQ of the world .
I 've also plotted the population growth of the five most populous countries , India , China , the U.S. , Indonesia , and Nigeria ; the average IQ of each of these countries is in parenthesis .
( Nigeria is currently ninth , with Brazil ( 87 ) , Pakistan ( 81 ) , Russia ( 96 ) , and Bangladesh ( 81 ) intervening , but by 2050 it will be fifth . )
As you can see , in a 100 year period the world 's average IQ will have dropped from 92 to 86 , a change of 6 % .
That is pretty darn significant .
And all because of differential population growth .
I extrapolated the population growth of each country another 50 years to the year 2100 ( lightly shaded region of graph ) .
At that time the world 's average IQ will have dropped below 84 .
Within this time period of 150 years , extremely short by any evolutionary standard , an incredibly significant change in this key metric will have occurred .
And there is no sign of the trend bottoming out , because the growth rate of countries with lower IQs exceeds the growth rate of countries with higher IQs .
The most populous country today is China , which has a high IQ ( 100 ) , but its growth is actually projected to be negative because of their " one child " policy .
After about 2030 India will be the most populous country , and it has relatively low IQ ( 81 ) .
At current growth rates by 2100 Nigeria will be the third most populous country , and it has a low IQ ( 67 ) . {
If you 're interested in playing with these numbers yourself , here 's the Excel spreadsheet with all these data .
If you publish further analysis or commentary , I would appreciate it if you 'd link back to this page .
} There were two assumptions we made up front , and I 'd like to revisit them .
First , we assumed countries are self - breeding .
With modern vehicles and opportunities for travel this is becoming less and less true , but for the bulk of the world 's population it is definitely a safe assumption .
The two largest countries , China and India , are both relatively undeveloped and by - and - large people do not travel in or out of them .
The third largest country , the U.S. , is the only possible exception to this assumption , because so many people immigrate into the U.S. ( in 1990 8 % of the U.S. population was foreign - born ) .
The second assumption is more interesting ; we assumed measured IQ was / will be stable in each country .
The Flynn Effect predicts this is false , and that measured IQ will increase over time .
( Historical data provide significant evidence for this . )
Many explanations have been offered for this effect , including steady improvement in testing procedures , and there is some evidence that in recent years the Flynn Effect has diminished .
If the overall world IQ changes due to differential birth rates among populations with different IQs ( that is , separate countries ) , then it seems plausible that a country 's IQ could change due to differential birth rates within its sub-populations as well .
In most countries and under most circumstances the birth rate of poorer and less educated people is significantly higher than the birth rate among wealthier and more educated people .
( China is the primary exception ; due to their " one child " policies the birth rate within all sub-populations is essentially the same . )
Given the positive correlation between measured IQ and wealth , and between measured IQ and education , these differential birth rates would suggest that individual countries '
IQs would decrease as populations expand .
If true , this would obviously accelerate the overall decrease in world IQ over time .
There are other factors at work .
For example , AIDS is presently the most common cause of death in Nigeria , which is one of the most populous and fastest growing countries .
Wealthier and more educated people are less likely to become infected by AIDS , because of awareness of the known transmission mechanisms and available protections , and also more likely to survive infection , because of availability of treatment ( at least to the point of having and raising healthy children ) .
Because of this the effective birth rate among wealthier and more educated people in Nigeria is probably higher than poorer , less educated people .
There is a substantial correlation between wealth , education , and measured IQ .
Thus the AIDS epidemic may have the effect of raising the average IQ of Nigerians .
The human race has been in existence for approximately 150,000 years , during which time natural selection has incrementally increased human intelligence and cognitive ability .
It is not possible to give IQ tests to humans from 100,000 years ago - at least not yet :) - so we can only surmise that there would have been a corresponding increase in measured IQ as well .
Only recently - within the last 10,000 years or so - has this trend been halted , primarily by organized agriculture which enabled a small group of humans to provide food for a larger group .
It now appears that very recently - within the last 100 years or so - this trend has been reversed .
I call this Unnatural Selection , since it appears that societal rather than evolutionary effects are at work .
The consequences of this overall decrease in world IQ have yet to be quantified , but they are bound to be significant .
More ruminations on this to follow , please stay tuned ...
Posted by ole at 12:03 AM
I do so like to believe in Physis : that tendency for natural selection to improve upon itself .
It 's the closest thing to God I have .
Yet I hardly believe mankind is so special as to warrant an exception , so I look forward to your ruminations .
I think the cud will prove indigestible , but I 'd still like to see some defense for your many premises .
Love that yellow line , BTW .
Good day for it , too .

Firstly , regarding the Flynn effect , people who like to discuss the IQ , do not explain enough that IQ is a relative measure at a single given time ... and as the Flynn effect has shown , IQ improves by huge quantities over generations ... you should be careful to be as clear as possible when talking about such issues ( i do n't believe you are particularly clear in this post ) secondly , IQ of 81 implies borderline retarded ... are you saying that most of the people in India are borderline retarded ??
I suggest you read this article http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/Issues/bell-curve/sowell.html which discusses some cultural issues around IQ scores and also describes how the ( new immigrant ) Jews in the U.S. had a lower than national average IQ in the 1920s , but in a couple of generations were far higher than national average ... there are obviously some cultural things related to IQ test performance ( for example , certain cultures may not be into abstract thinking , as shown by new immigrants whose descendants through familiarity with the culture do better ) ... also , it has something to do with nutrition , which is bound to improve ... people who talk about IQ should be careful not to ( apparently ) fudge these issues ...
Posted by : turkey time gobble gobble at September 1 , 2003 06:05 AM
Jensen has shown somewhere ( I 'm still looking for the reference ) that the Flynn Effect does not change g .
All the F.E. seems to change is the non-g loaded aspects of IQ .
Also what are the demographics of the future population ?
Current subSaharan
IQ's are partially explained by the low average age in those countries , and would n't that apply to the future Nigeria ?
Posted by : Dick Thompson at September 1 , 2003 09:50 AM
Thanks for the commentary !
Some points :
-- The Flynn Effect is real and important .
Please follow the links in my post for more information and discussion .
There remains widespread disagreement about the cause (s ) of the effect , but not about its existence .
-- The IQ numbers are not mine .
Lynn and Vanhanen developed these numbers carefully , please follow the link to their article for information about the origins of their data .
-- Average IQ does n't say anything about any particular person , particularly in populations with millions of people .
You have the cannonical bell shaped distribution .
-- I found it amazing that India 's average was 81 .
My contact with people from India must be with the right edge of the curve .
--
There are not " obviously " cultural things related to IQ test performance .
Over the past thirty years pyschometricians have refined IQ tests carefully to elminate cultural bias .
People invoke tend to postulate cultural bias when they disagree with test results .
--
The impact of nutrition on IQ is limited .
Studies designed to measure this ( e.g. identical twins raised in different environments ) fail to show much correlation .
-- After the age of five IQ is pretty invariant for any particular individual , regardless of their environment .
I would not expect the low average age of sub -Saharan countries to be a significant factor in their average IQ .

The impact of nutrition on IQ is limited .
Studies designed to measure this ( e.g. identical twins raised in different environments ) fail to show much correlation .
sandra scarr asserted in Born that way that there is likely a " threshold effect " in that there needs to be a minimum level of nutrition , etc .
i think this explains the big different between american black IQs ( 85 ) and the average of the west african ones ( 70 ) .
to my knowledge the 85 result goes back about a century , and i can't imagine selection bias would have been that strong , and they are only about 20 % white ....

This area is way out of my league .
Anyway , my child was designated " gifted " ( higher than 98th percentile ) a few years back and at that time I read up on specifics of nutrition re IQ scores and learned that children that eat at least one serving of veggies and one serving of fruit daily as well as take a multi-vitamin score 8 % higher on average when taking IQ tests .
Is that bunk ?
I do n't even remember where I got that info it was a good while back .
I 'm just curious because I was led to believe that is established as fact .
Posted by : Katy at September 1 , 2003 01:23 PM
hm ... they might be less lethargic .
but i doubt that veggies = more brains , after all , creatine is found in meat ....
Posted by : razib at September 1 , 2003 01:30 PM
and as the Flynn effect has shown , IQ improves by huge quantities over generations ... you should be careful to be as clear as possible when talking about such issues TTGG ( please do n't admit you actually saw Gigli ; ) ) , a ) Flynn himself does n't think these represent actual IQ gains .
While the Flynn Effect needs to be considered , its interpretation is a grab - bag at this point .
Sowell 's appeal to ' there 's just too much we do n't know ' , IMO , is at the expense of a lot of stuff we DO know .
And that 's unfortunate . b ) ' retarded ' means different things to different populations .
American blacks who score in the white retarded range have much higher degrees of social functioning .
Also , I think IQ is not measured as accurately in third world samples than it is in industrial nations .
But i do n't think the information is totally worthless .
c ) jews always scored high , and terman , spearman , goddard , etc. all knew this from the start .
i think anecdotes that state otherwise are a form of revisionism .
Ashkenazi have a clear historical reputation .
katy , I think its either bunk or its a correlation / causation thing .
As people with higher iqs are more likely to care about stuff like health and nutrition .
razib makes a point with the threshold .
Posted by : Jason Malloy at September 1 , 2003 03:23 PM
by " threshold " i mean that all things being equal there is n't a linear relationship between nutrition & IQ ( IQ = nutrition * k ) .
this might be true in other ways as well - visual & intellectual environment , etc. not my area , but i rushton et al .
have n't given me a reasonable explanation for the 15 point IQ difference between west africa & american blacks .
Posted by : razib at September 1 , 2003 05:44 PM
I just took an IQ test by " Emode " which seems to be quite error free and unbiased .
I scored a total of 113in all 4 categories , i.e. mathematical , visual - spatial , linguistic nd logical .
I got most questions right in linguistic are wich stated I was highly intelligent and have the natural fluency of a writer .
Where do I range or average with that score .
Posted by : Phyllis Turner at September 4 , 2003 02:07 PM
" at that time I read up on specifics of nutrition re IQ scores and learned that children that eat at least one serving of veggies and one serving of fruit daily as well as take a multi-vitamin score 8 % higher on average when taking IQ tests .
Is that bunk ? "
The only thing I could find regarding veggies and vitamins boosting IQ is this : " ... it has been found that many childre , although given what appears to be a perfectly adequate diet , eat too many sweets and ' junk foods ' and too little fruit 's and vegetables .
Their intake of vitamins and minerals is low , although not sufficiently so to attract medical attention .
When given vitamin and mineral supplentation , however , their IQ increases markedly .
Studies have taken large groups of apparently well - fed children and dived them into control groups , which are given placebo pills , and treatment groups , which are given proper supplementation .
The treatment group achieves a four point IQ advantage over the placebo group on average ... it helps only those who do suffer from a deficiency .

I find that all standardized tests are flowing over with biased questions .
They either fail to reflect the different cultural backrounds in communtication , and cognition , or fail to represent the multiple intelligences .
What IQ test would you recommend ?
I have taken emode and received 129 ?
Is this score fairly average ?

[ UPDATE ] – Sources at Bungie have since debunked this rumour at Halo .
Bungie .
Org .
See bottom of post .
We ’re always a little hesitant to contribute to the seemingly endless amount of rumour and speculation that exists online but for once , we ’ll make an exception .
If anything , someone will come along to illustrate exactly how we ’re barking up the wrong tree .
Regular readers of EDGE magazine will recognize the image at the bottom of this post as a teaser for their “ January ” issue , due to hit shelves on November 24th and a tradition they have been running for as long as I can remember .
Usually the teasers are fairly abstract and fun can be had online trying to work out what it might be referring to .
As a big Halo fan , the first thing this month ’s reminded me was however , was the trailer and imagery for Halo : Reach
Could this be the feature of EDGE ’s next issue ?
My initial conviction was overwhelming amidst my excitement and whilst I ’ve adopted a little more caution now , I ca n’t think of what else it might be ( though games like Elite 4 or the EVE : Online spin off Dust 514 would spring to mind as potentials ) .
It ’s certainly feasible that Reach info would drop around this time .
Recent Bungie Weekly Updates have just started to include snippets as to how Reach ’s development is going .
The first pre-alpha previews for Halo 3 went online around the end of November 2006 and like Halo 3 , there will be a beta of Halo : Reach which presumably will be released on a similar timescale to it ’s predecessor , i.e. in the first half of 2010 .
It ’s not just the Halo : Reach imagery either , the teaser bears some resemblance to the post- credits cinematic after beating Halo 3 on legendary difficulty .
( Starts at 02:55 – Spoilers if you have n’t finished it ! ) .
At the time , most speculation assumed that was teasing a Halo 4 and the continuation of the Master Chief ’s story .
We know another Halo game is being worked on by 343 Industries so this is just as probable but they are strikingly similar .
We ’re working up another source who might be able to at least rule this out .
Unusually , we could n’t find any discussion online amongst people who might have noticed the same thing so perhaps it ’s us !
If we ’re wrong on this one though , we ’ll be interested to know exactly what this is .
Let us know what you think !
Update 1 : A poster on the Halo .
Bungie .
Org forum outlines why the connection to the end of Halo 3 is likely hokum and has nothing to do with this .
My main point was really the similar imagery being used though admittedly I did n’t write it that way .
Just as well because ;-
Update 2 : Word from Bungie came in the same thread confirming “ no Reach story in EDGE ( or any magazine ) next month ” .
Sadly that leaves our Halo rumours track record in tatters at only 50 % !
Many people have speculated that it is in fact related to Mass Effect 2 .
Having had a chance to review this trailer again , I can only concur that ’s the most likely outcome , even without the official word above .
In my defence , it always had a blue tint in the trailers for the first game !
I ’ll still contend that it ’s a strange time for EDGE to do a Mass Effect 2 feature as it releases late January .
Perhaps they read our post on Bioware ’s flirtations with a permadeath mechanic ( of sorts ) and liked it Anyway , thanks to everyone for their comments .
We are at least almost as excited about as that as we are about Halo : Reach .
September 29 , 2009 – The National Institute of Drug Abuse has set aside $ 3,000,000 to “ support research studies that focus on the identification , and preclinical and clinical evaluation , of medications that can be safe and effective for the treatment of cannabis-use and cannabis - induced DISORDERS , as well as their medical and psychiatric consequences . ”
They state “ Cannabis - related disorders ( CRDs ) including cannabis abuse or dependence and cannabis induced disorders ( e.g. , intoxication , delirium , psychotic disorder , and anxiety disorder ) are a major public health issue .
Cannabis use includes marijuana , hashish , and other tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) containing substances . ”
Looks like they are going to spend 3 million dollars creating a drug to heal the DISORDERS created by the best drug the planet ever gave us .
It seems we have to keep Big Pharma happy …at whatever cost , and that means we need to turn cannabis use into a major public health issue .

Efforts to secure a new global deal to tackle climate change hang in the balance , with a " real danger " they could fail , Foreign Secretary David Miliband warned today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With less than 100 days until talks in Copenhagen aimed at securing agreement on worldwide cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , UK ministers are worried the negotiations will not succeed .
The Foreign Secretary said the complexity of the issue , other problems such as the recession clouding the political agenda and " suspicion " between rich and poor countries were hampering progress .
But ahead of visits that will take him around Europe in a diplomatic push to raise the issue of climate change , he said a failure to cut emissions could lead to global temperature rises of 4C .
This would lead to large scale migration as parts of the world disappeared under rising seas , threaten infrastructure as extreme weather events became more common , and put pressure on natural resources such as water - all of which could have serious impacts on peace and security across the world .
" The deal the world needs in Copenhagen is now in the balance , " he said .
" There 's a real danger the talks scheduled for December will not reach a positive outcome , and an equal danger in the run-up to Copenhagen that people do n't wake up to the danger of failure until it's too late . "
The Foreign Secretary and his brother Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband welcomed the announcement by the incoming Japanese government that it would cut the country 's emissions by 25 % on 1990 levels by 2020 .
The Climate Change Secretary said that while the talks hung in the balance , the announcement by the Japanese government showed that " the jigsaw pieces are in place for a deal " and political will was required to tip the balance in favouring of securing a deal .

Doom 's monsters likely have n't scare you in well over a decade , not since Quake 's zombie rottweilers and gigantic , blood - stained Shamblers took over your nightmares in the mid-90s .
These pieces from Brandon Duncan , though , are a reminder that those monsters still lurk in the dark recesses of your memory , ready to pop out when you least expect it and send you running backwards out of a room while firing your shotgun with no regard for aim or your limited ammo .
Duncan says the Doom series was " a huge inspiration " to him , and you can see it in many of his illustrations .
He drew from his teenage memories of the game 's monsters scaring the crap out of him to create this " Doom Bestiary " set :
" Here , it was a case of them elevating themselves above the rest of their peers , ( it was ) not to do with hip hop culture .
The minute they can afford different sets of dentures then ( the idea is ) ' I am a bit better than you ' , " Friedling said .

Campaign Edit
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 continues five years after the events of Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare .
Plot overview Edit
" This is for the record . " — Captain Price
The year is 2016 , and despite the efforts of the United States Marine Corps and the Special Air Service , the Ultranationalists seize control of Russia and declare Imran Zakhaev a hero and martyr , erecting a statue of him in the heart of the Red Square .
Meanwhile , Vladimir Makarov , one of Zakhaev 's former lieutenants , begins a campaign against Europe by committing brutal acts of terrorism over the course of five years .
In Afghanistan , U.S. Army Ranger PFC Joseph Allen assists his commanding officer Sgt. Foley in training the local soldiers until he is called to run a training course overseen by Lieutenant General Shepherd , who is recruiting one of the Rangers for a special operation .
After completing the course , Allen and the rest of the 75th Ranger Regiment assists in the taking of a city from local OpFor soldiers .
Impressed by Allen 's abilities , General Shepherd recruits him into " Task Force 141 " , an elite , multi-national counter - terrorist unit under Shepherd 's command .
Meanwhile , two other members of 141 , Cpt. ' Soap ' MacTavish and Sgt. Gary ' Roach ' Sanderson infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan mountains to retrieve an ACS ( Attack Characterization System ) module from a downed satellite .
During their infiltration , Soap orders Roach to plant explosives to cover their escape , but is compromised while retrieving the ACS .
While they are pursued by enemy forces , both men manage to escape with the module .
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - Intro
Allen is later sent on an undercover mission in Russia for the CIA , joining Makarov disguised as terrorist Alexi Borodin in a massacre of civilians at the Zakhaev International Airport in Moscow .
While they manage to evade capture by Russian forces , Makarov , aware of Allen 's identity , kills him during extraction , leaving his body to spark a war between Russia and the United States of America .
Angered by what was believed to be an American - supported terrorist attack , Russia retaliates with a massive surprise invasion on the United States after bypassing its early warning system , revealing that the ACS module MacTavish and Sanderson recovered had already been compromised before its retrieval .
75th Ranger Regiment Sergeant Foley leads his squad , including Cpl. Dunn and Allen 's replacement Pvt. James Ramirez , in defense of a suburb in north - eastern Virginia against the enemy Russian paratroopers .
During their assault in a Russian occupied suburban neigborhood , Shepard contacts Foley and orders his squad to extract an HVI , claiming that he has intel vital to the war effort .
Upon arriving at the HVI 's safe house , Sgt. Foley and his squad discover the safe house breached and HVI murdered along with several deceased soldiers bearing odd tattoos .
Foley takes notice that the safe room was not forcefully breached as Dunn checks bodies for intel .
They later proceed towards a war - torn Washington , D.C. , where U.S. forces are fighting the Russians for control of the capital city .
Sgt. Foley and his squad proceed to the Russian occupied Capitol building where they are tasked with destroying emplaced AA guns that prevent the Army from evacuating civilians .
They later provide air support for U.S. forces onboard a helicopter but are soon shot out of the sky .
The squad , running low on ammunition , make a last stand against the Russian Army before a sudden flash halts the their attack .
Meanwhile , Task Force 141 searches for evidence that implicates Makarov as the mastermind behind the airport massacre , as all proof of Makarov 's involvement died with Allen .
Intelligence leads them to a Favela in Rio de Janeiro , where the team investigates leads on Makarov 's contact , weapons dealer Alejandro Rojas .
They find out from Rojas that Makarov 's worst enemy , known as Prisoner # 627 , is locked up in a Russian gulag in Petropavlosk .
On the orders of Shepherd , the Task Force are sent to infiltrate an oil platform off the coast of Russia in order to rescue several hostages before assaulting the gulag .
The Task Force assaults the prison and manages to free 627 , who is revealed to be Captain John Price , who was previously captured during Operation Kingfish .
Price agrees to aid Soap and Shepherd in tracking down Makarov , with Soap handing the command of the Unit over to Price .
While Shepherd believes that they must continue their hunt for Makarov , Price decides that ending the war in America is their first priority .
To end it , he temporarily goes rogue , and leads the 141 on a raid of a Russian port , where they gain control of a nuclear submarine .
Price uses the submarine to launch a ballistic missile towards Washington D.C.
He sets the warhead to detonate in the upper atmosphere , unintentionally destroying the International Space Station and creating an electromagnetic pulse , crippling vehicles and electronic equipment on both sides and giving the Americans a slight advantage .
Back in the United States , Ramirez and his fellow squad mates seek shelter from the disabled aircraft that are now literally falling from the sky , and proceed to the White House after running into Pvt.
Vaughn , who tells the squad that Colonel Marshall is assembling whatever forces he can to retake the White House , which is now a stronghold for the Russian Army .
After finally meeting Col. Marshall , he orders the squad that taking the White House is their top priority , but they later receive a transmission informing them that the Air Force is preparing to carpet bomb the entire city to deny the Russians a strong foothold .
Foley 's squad fight their way to the White House and set off flares in the nick of time , aborting the air strike .
Flares are lit on the rooftops of other landmarks , signifying that the city is still in American hands .
Angered over destruction of the Capital , Foley , Dunn and the rest of the Rangers vow vengeance against the Russians , claiming they will burn Moscow to the ground as they did with D.C .
Narrowing down Makarov 's hiding place to two separate locations , Task Force 141 decides to split up .
Price and Soap travel to an aircraft bone - yard in Afghanistan , while Roach and Ghost raid Makarov 's safe house on the Georgian - Russian border .
At the safe house , Roach and his team obtain vital intelligence from Makarov 's computer and escape with Makarov 's men in pursuit .
However , when they reach the extraction point , Shepherd betrays them , retrieving the intelligence and taking it with him , murdering Roach and Ghost and burning their bodies in the process .
Price and MacTavish quickly learn of Shepherd 's betrayal , though Price states that he was n't betrayed since he never trusted Shepherd .
The duo then manage to escape an already ongoing battle between Shepherd and Makarov 's men with Nikolai 's help .
After contacting Makarov and offering to kill Shepherd for him , Makarov grudgingly reveals Shepherd 's location at a mountain base in Afghanistan , codenamed Site Hotel Bravo .
Price and MacTavish raid the base in an attempt to take revenge on Shepherd in a suicide mission .
During the infiltration , Shepherd tries to escape on a Zodiac motorboat , and a long boat pursuit ensues .
At the climax of the pursuit , Shepherd boards a Pave Low , only for Price to disable it by shooting the helicopter 's rotor , causing a crash landing .
Price and Soap tumble over a waterfall in the process .
After recovering from the fall , a dazed Soap gets up and approaches the crashed Pave Low with only his knife .
He sees Shepherd and moves in for the kill .
Shepherd counters by slamming Soap onto a destroyed car and stabs him in the chest .
Shepherd then proceeds to inform Soap how he " lost 30,000 men in the blink of an eye " and proceeds to empty his .44 Magnum , loading two bullets in it - supposedly one for Soap and the other for Price .
However , just before Shepherd shoots Soap , Price tackles Shepherd and the two engage each other in a brutal fist fight .
While Price manages to hold his own , Shepherd ultimately gets the upper hand , but the heavily wounded Soap is able to pull the knife from his chest and throw it into Shepherd 's left eye , killing him .
Price regains consciousness and inspects Soap 's wounds as Nikolai arrives in a helicopter to extract them .
Nikolai warns them that they will be pursued , but Price insists that Soap receives medical attention .
Nikolai mentions that he knows a safe place to go to ( " Da , I know a place " ) , and Soap and Price , now globally wanted criminals , go into hiding .

Locations Edit
Special Ops Edit
Main article : Special Ops
A new Special Ops mode includes one and two player cooperative play .
Special
Ops mode includes several fast - paced action missions similar to " Mile High Club " which are more difficult than normal campaign missions and are not related to the main storyline .
It picks out certain parts of the single - player campaign that " work well with co-op " .
Missions are unlocked by earning stars , which are acquired by playing levels at certain difficulties .
Regular difficulty earns one star , hardened earns two , and veteran earns three .
Missions are divided into five groups , named Alpha , Bravo , Charlie , Delta , and Echo - the last being the hardest .
Within the groups , there are types of missions such as " Breach and Clear " and " Elimination " .
There are special enemy types , such as those using Riot Shields , even the Special Ops exclusive Juggernaut , wearing heavy bomb squad armor .
There are a total of 23 Special Ops missions , two of which are only playable in two player co-op due to one player assisting the other in carrying out the mission 's objective from air support .
Multiplayer Edit
Multiplayer is similar to the previous two titles on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 .
However , multiplayer on the PC is quite different from previous games .
The PC version no longer includes dedicated server support .
While previous Call of Duty titles allowed multiplayer matches with up to 64 people and user - made maps and mods , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 on PC is almost identical to console versions .
Gameplay Edit
The basic gameplay stays the same from Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare and Call of Duty : World at War .
A few changes have been made ;
The HUD is now much more sleek and easy to read on a smaller TV than the HUD from Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare .
.
Blood will now cover the screen when the player is injured .
This effect will eventually go away and it is still possible to see through the blood .
Create - a- Class , while still unlocked at level 4 , has a few changes ;
There is a new slot called " Equipment " where the player can choose from a Blast Shield , Claymore , C4 , Throwing Knife , or Semtex instead of the standard M67 Frag Grenade .
Secondary Weapons now consist of Shotguns , Machine Pistols , Handguns , and Launchers instead of only handguns in the previous games .
Likewise with the HUD the Create - a- Class interface has been re-done from the previous games and is now much more sleek and user - friendly .
As with previous games , in addition to player created classes there are five preset classes , but this time they include weapons and equipment unlocked at higher levels rather than just the items that are available by default when Create - a- Class is first unlocked .
In - game Host Migration has been implemented - if the host of a multiplayer game leaves , the game will automatically pause for a few seconds to choose a new host , and then the game will resume , preventing many highly irritating mid-game ends with no or inaccurate results .
Idle sway for all non-scoped weapons and AK - 47s with attachments ( apart from ACOG Scope ) has also been removed .
Each of the perks has a Pro upgrade available , which the player has to unlock by completing a challenge for the specific perk .
These Pro upgrades improve the players current perk and automatically replaces it once unlocked .
In Split Screen , instead of all Pre-set Classes , users can rank up and create their own .
Ranks Edit
The ranking system works in the same way as the previous two games .
As the player plays matches , they will gain XP .
Once the player reaches a certain amount of XP , the player will level up .
There are now a total of 70 levels in Modern Warfare 2 , as opposed to 55 in Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare and 65 in Call of Duty : World at War .
There are also 10 levels of prestige , just like in the other two games .
As in World at War , the player can unlock a total of 5 extra custom class slots by the 9th prestige .
Gametypes Edit
Weapon list Edit
All the weapons from Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
Weapon attachments Edit
Weapons attachments return in Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 with a few changes .
Firstly , new attachments were introduced , such as the Thermal Scope and Heartbeat Sensor .
Secondly , some weapon attachments are now unlocked through the use of other attachments , such as getting 20 kills looking through the ACOG Scope to unlock the Thermal Scope or 60 kills looking down the RDS to unlock the Holographic Sight .
Lastly , the Grip and Grenade Launcher no longer count as a tier one perk .
There are a total of 14 weapon attachments , although not all attachments are available for all weapons .
Enemies throughout the campaign will now carry weapons customized with a variety of attachments .
When a player goes to pick up a weapon , it will actually tell them what attachments the gun has , except when the gun is using Bling or does not have any attachments .
Vehicles Edit
Perks Edit
Main article : Perks
Players can choose one perk from each of the three main tiers and one Death Streak perk for a single class loadout .
Three kill streaks can also be chosen , but these are not class - specific .
Pro perks are upgraded versions of existing perks that are unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements with the original .
All perks have Pro versions and all are unlocked by the Pro IV challenge for that specific perk .
Note that Pro V and Pro VI challenges exist .
Pro V does not earn anything except a large amount of XP .
Pro VI challenges unlock Emblems or titles for players to use in their Callsigns .
Pro perks include the benefits of the original version while adding new benefits .
There are less Perks than in Call of Duty 4 due to the addition of Pro Perks , as well as the removal of many less - useful Perks .
Maps Edit
Kill / Deathstreak Rewards Edit
Players can select three Killstreak Rewards at a time .
A player 's killstreak loadout cannot be changed from class to class ; instead , one loadout will be used for all classes .
Killstreaks now stack ( getting a higher killstreak no longer gets rid of the lower unused one , but it will not be available until after the current killstreak is used ) .
Also , killstreaks require one less kill with the perk Hardline .
Deathstreak rewards Edit
Death Streaks are the opposite of Kill Streaks : these give the player certain rewards for being killed a certain amount of times in a row without getting a kill .
Once the Death Streak activates , it remains active until the user gets a kill , no matter how many times the user dies until they get that kill .
Once the user gets a kill , the Death Streak will still be active for that life , but will then deactivate upon their next respawn .
Only one can be equipped to a class .
Unlike Perks , Death Streaks do not have Pro versions .
Accolades Edit
Accolades are awards earned in game and given after a match .
They do not reward XP .
Callsigns Edit
Main article : Playercard
Callsigns are multiplayer name - tags that appear on screen when a player achieves a kill , secures a command post , and other things .
The callsign includes the Emblem , Title and name of the player .
To unlock titles and emblems for a callsign the player will need to do certain tasks such as reaching certain prestiges or kills with weapons etc .
Challenges Edit
Challenges remain largely unchanged from the previous game .
However , on the event of prestiging , a tier of challenges will be unlocked , under the title of Prestige .
These challenges mostly require the player to get a certain amount of kills using a killstreak etc .
Factions Edit
Local split - screen Edit
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 also features local split - screen on a single console , similarly to previous installments of Call of Duty .
Up to four players can play on a single console .
Local split - screen features all of the same game modes and custom settings as online private matches , and for the first time allows players to unlock things and customize their classes just like in the online modes .
One of the offline multiplayer settings enables players to play with everything that they have unlocked online , but playing offline will not earn them XP for their online account , nor will anything they do offline affect any of their online leaderboard stats .
The Latest update patched the ability to host 10th prestige lobbies , greatly reducing the amount of hacking done online .
The previous update patched the ability to host Infection and Challenge lobbies .
The updates eliminate pretty much all forms of hacking online for Modern Warfare 2 .
Title Edit
Due to the commercial success of Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , Infinity Ward thought that the modern setting had entered unto a " world of its own , " they then dropped the prefix from the title .
[ 3 ]
Activision was reportedly getting " bored " with the series , and so ran with the idea .
It was later found from surveys that there was a 40 % drop in brand awareness after the removal of the " Call of Duty " prefix .
At E3 2009 the customer intent to buy the game had dropped significantly because of the title change .
It is speculated that Activision chose to bring the Call of Duty prefix back in response to these surveys in order to prevent confusion with consumers .
The Call of Duty prefix is still absent from the Hardened and Prestige editions , as well as in - game menus .

The third quarter was devastating for banks and homeowners .
To show the growing divide between Wall Street and the American economy , the FDIC just released its third quarter banking profile .
The FDIC fund is not only broke , it is now in the red to the sum of $ 8.2 billion .
We ’ve been warning that the fund was insolvent for over a year but now the FDIC has joined millions of homeowners in the negative equity category .
The problem with the system is we have a fund that is now negative , backing up some $ 4.5 trillion in U.S. insured deposits .
Who will be on the hook when more banks fail ?
Is n’t the economy supposedly recovering ?
The FDIC also updated their problem bank list and it has grown from 416 in the second quarter to 552 in the third quarter , a 32 percent increase .
We issued a warning that when this crisis hits a real trough , that over 1,000 banks will be obsolete and gone .
Much of this problem has to do with how assets are distributed amongst the big banks :
This is the new version of our economy .
$ 13 trillion in total banking assets at over 8,000 institutions .
But if we look closely at the data we will find that roughly 110 banks hold $ 10 trillion of all these assets .
In other words , you can have 7,000 banks fail and only 30 percent of the system ’s assets would be affected .
Talk about too big to fail .
But with the growing list of problems and losses to the FDIC banks somehow miraculously turned a profit in the quarter :
“ ( WSJ ) Despite the turmoil in the industry , banks posted a modest $ 2.8 billion profit in the third quarter of 2009 , as their securities portfolios recovered and banks with less than $ 10 billion in assets saw margins improve .
Bank profits were more than triple the $ 879 million they earned in the third quarter of 2008 and improved from a $ 4.3 billion loss in the second quarter of 2009 . ”
Now how is it possible to turn a profit when banks are failing and putting the FDIC in the red and using taxpayer bail outs to stay afloat without some form of accounting chicanery ?
The reason is simple and it is because banks now operate like hedge funds and have used the stock market recovery to prop up their bottom lines with little benefit to the American consumer .
Just look at banks like JP Morgan that in their last earnings report , showed most of their income stemming from their investment branch .
In their retail lending they have pulled back on loans and credit cards which are really a bigger factor for the average American .
And troubled loans keep growing because in the real economy , things are still in a deep recession :
“ Troubled loans continued to pummel U.S. banks in the third quarter .
Loan loss reserves topped $ 60 billion for the fourth quarter in a row , dampening profits .
Meanwhile , banks charged off a net $ 50.8 billion during the third quarter , an 80.5 % jump from the third quarter of 2008 .
The industry ’s annualized net charge - off rate rose to 2.71 % , the highest since records began in 1984 .
Though noncurrent loans continued to climb during the quarter , the rate of growth of such loans slowed for the second quarter in a row .
Noncurrent loans increased by 10.5 % to $ 366.6 billion during the third quarter . ”
If you are wondering how banks can turn a profit of a few billion even though they saw noncurrent loans increase by $ 366 billion , you would probably need to ask Bernard Madoff how he does his accounting .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are allowing this shell game to occur because they really need the Ponzi scheme to continue .
They want the public to believe all is well even though banks are bleeding red .
In their narrow world view , the heart monitor of the economy is Wall Street but clearly it is no longer a good measure of the vitality of our economy .
With 27 million unemployed and underemployed Americans , how is it possible that the stock market rallied by 60 percent in a few short months ?
This is a legitimate question to ask .
I heard someone on Bloomberg radio happily discussing the praise of “ cost cutting ” to maximize profits .
These people are blind in connecting the reality that our consumer driven economy is not being helped by firing people for one or two quarterly profits while stunting the balance sheet of millions of Americans .
Loan Performance recently released a report that shows that 1 out of 4 mortgage holders are now underwater .
If you want a chart of this data , this is how it looks :
Approximately 13 million American mortgage holders have negative equity in their home .
What this means is they are in a worse spot than even a renter .
If they had to sell , they would actually need to bring cash to the table .
Or , they can do what many are doing and simply let the home go into foreclosure .
And how many of the other homeowners are near negative equity ?
After all , you need over 5 percent in equity just to break even after all sale costs are factored in .
The bottom line is the FDIC is seeing a negative equity position in their banking system .
Sure , they can do financial maneuvers that yield short - term profits but then what ?
We are approaching an underemployment rate of 20 percent in this country .
These banks would not be standing without taxpayer bail outs .
They have the gall to increase credit card rates to 79.9 percent and even impose fees on people that simply do not use their credit cards .
At a certain point , there is going to be a massive uprising against the financial sector .
There is only so much deception the American public can take .

At 8 AM on Friday morning , Joelle and I were at the Verizon store in Camillus checking out Verizon ’s two new Android - based phones : the Motorola Droid and the HTC Droid Eris .
Joelle got me the Droid as an early Christmas gift and , at the request of Ryan , I ’m taking some time to post here about my initial experiences with the phone .
The Home Screens
These are the home screens on the Droid .
There are three available and you switch between them by dragging your finger across the screen .
You can put shortcuts to any applications you like anywhere on these screens as well as widgets that serve various purposes .
You can see that I have a few shortcuts on my middle home screen ( which is the main one ) and on the top of each screen is a widget .
From left to right : the Facebook widget which shows status updates from your friends , the Power Control widget which allows you to switch wi-fi , bluetooth , GPS and syncing on and off , as well as adjust the screen brightness ( this is one of the best widgets I ’ve found since these are otherwise buried in the settings menu , this is included by default as part of the OS ) , and finally the Weather Channel widget ( which I have recently replaced with the Weather Bug widget ) .
I ’ve read elsewhere on the internet that having a lot of widgets can slow the phone down considerably and can also be a battery drain so I ’m going to try to stay away from using them too much .
The last picture on the right is a shot of the phone while locked .
Touching and sliding the unlock symbol to the right will , obviously , unlock the phone .
This screen looks slightly different if you have a security code set .
In that case you would see a 3×3 grid of dots which you have to connect in the special way you picked in order to unlock your phone .
You can also put the phone on silent by touching and dragging the speaker to the left .
The Phone
Next is the phone application itself .
The dialer is easy to use and the tabs across the top of the screen make it easy to view your call log , choose from your contacts and access your favorites .
The second picture is what the screen looks like when you ’re receiving a call .
To answer , touch and drag the green button to the right ( to ignore , do the opposite ) .
While you ’re in a call , the screen shows who you are talking to and gives you options related to the phone call .
You can easily add a person to the conversation using the “ add call ” button ( a feature I have not tested ) , end the call , go to the dialpad ( to enter DTMF tones at an automated menu , I assume ) , mute , and go to speakerphone .
One thing that ’s really sweet is that the phone automatically turns the screen off while it ’s touching your face ( meaning you ’re talking on it ) and turns the screen back on when you pull it away from your ear ( so you can end the call or whatever else you need to do ) .
This prevents accidental button presses and works very well in my experience .
That last shot is just what the screen looks like after you end the call .
Miscellaneous Menus
These are just a few screen captures of random menus and such on the Droid .
The settings menu obviously contains any setting you could ever hope for , including the SD card and phone storage settings .
That shot shows how the Droid is limited to storing applications on its internal memory rather than utilizing the included 16GB SD card .
This is an odd restriction but does n’t seem to be a big deal so far since I have 10 - 15 apps installed and have barely used any of the internal memory .
The apps menu lists out every app you have installed .
Shortcuts can be dragged off of this menu and onto the home screen for easy access .
That last shot is of the Android Market where you can search for applications to fill your every need .
The browser and other stuff
Here ’s a shot of the browser in landscape mode .
As you can see the entire width of the website is visible and you can zoom in by double tapping on the screen .
The next shot is of the battery use menu which shows what applications / services are using your battery .
As you can see the screen is the biggest culprit ( I ’ve since been trying to keep the screen brightness way down ) with wi-fi being a close second .
The last one here is the text messaging interface which is pretty simple but displays your texts in a conversation format , which is a big step up from my Windows Mobile phone .
Bonus Material
Those are most of the key things I ’ve discovered so far .
Below you ’ll find a gallery of pictures with all the ones I ’ve showed you so far with a few more I did n’t .
One thing I did n’t take time to mention was the Barcode Scanner application which is capable of scanning normal barcodes found on items in the store ( as seen in my picture where I scan the barcode on my propane canister and then have the app look it up on Google ) as well as special 2D QR codes which can contain other data such as a URL .
Below is the QR code that links to the Barcode Scanner on the Android Market .
Scanning this code with the app will give you the option to open that application ’s page in the Market .
Edit : to download this application , search for “ barcode scanner ” in the Market ; the application is named exactly that and will show up in the search results .
You ’ll also find a couple bonus pictures in the gallery of my favorite novelty application so far .
If you ’ve watched any Star Trek you ’ll recognize it as a Tricorder .
It uses realtime data from the phone ’s various sensors to fill the screen with all sorts of graphs and numbers , which is pretty awesome .
Another application I really like is Gmote .
Installing this application on your phone , coupled with a server component running on your computer , gives you full control of your desktop from the comfort of your living room couch .
It has built - in compatibility with VLC ( unfortunately , not Media Player Classic ) and has the ability to control the mouse and keyboard of your computer using the screen as a touchpad and either the phone ’s physical keyboard or the onscreen keyboard .
I am very impressed with this phone so far .
It ’s fast , easy to use and a lot of fun to play with .
The only thing I have n’t liked so far is the battery life , but I have a feeling that will get better once I ’m not playing with the phone every minute .
If you have any questions please post them in the comments and I ’ll do my best to answer them .
Now , the gallery .

Whatever you call it , filmmakers have long had a fascination with prison .
Lock a guy up for all or part of a flick and you ’ve got all kinds of inherent drama just waiting to bust out .
The fear of confinement exists in all of us .
Preying on that fear has produced a host of memorable films over the years .
Be it intense drama , thrilling action , dark science fiction or ribald comedy , a trip to the pokey rarely disappoints .
Here are the fifteen very best prison movies .
15 ) Alien 3 – 1992
Director Favid Fincher took a lot of grief for ruining the Alien franchise with his big screen debut .
That seems a bit harsh .
The third chapter , set on a dark , desolate prison planet , looks fantastic .
It could have used a major script overhaul , but that was n’t Fincher ’s fault .
Far from perfect , it has its moments .
14 ) Kiss of the Spider Woman – 1985
William
Hurt snagged himself an Oscar playing a homosexual movie buff in love with his cell mate , a political activist imprisoned for his attempts to topple a corrupt government .
Since the majority of the narrative takes place inside a cramped cell , it perfectly depicts the loneliness and isolation of incarceration .
13 ) The Hurricane – 1999
The emotional story of middleweight boxer Rubin “ Hurricane ” Carter ’s twenty - year imprisonment and subsequent release for a 1966 triple murder .
A swarm of controversy surrounded glaring inaccuracies portrayed in the film , but that does n’t take away from it being a quality prison flick .
12 ) American History X – 1998
Edward Norton pumped some serious iron to play a violent neo -Nazi in this riveting drama .
The scenes behind bars are both eye - opening and chilling .
No punches are pulled by director Tony Kaye and writer David McKenna .
If you ’re thinking about pursuing a life of crime , watch this first .
11 ) The Green Mile – 1999
Adapted from a Stephen King novel , The Green Mile unfolds the life of a 1930s death row corrections officer played by Tom Hanks , and his relationship with gentle giant John Coffey — a man who possesses strange healing powers .
The plot often drifts toward melodrama , but it still contains several powerful scenes .
10 ) Brubaker – 1980
If you thought American History X was a nightmare , you ai n’t seen nothin ’ yet .
Robert Redford plays a warden who goes undercover in his own prison to reveal sexual abuse and torture among inmates , and rampant corruption and murder among prison officials .
Easily one of the most frightening fictional institutions ever put to film .
9 ) Papillon – 1973
Steve McQueen stars as real life French thief Henri Charriere , aka “ Papillon , ” who was sentenced to life in the notorious Devil ’s Island penal colony off the coast of French Guiana .
Based on a novel written by Charriere , the plot recounts he and pal Louis Dega ’s daring escape , which may or may not be true .
Whatever the case , it makes for a thrilling conclusion .
8 ) Dead Man Walking – 1995
Sean Penn should have scored Oscar gold as death row inmate Matthew Poncelet .
Raw and emotional , this riveting film dives head first into the issue of capital punishment .
Politics aside , it ’s hard not to be impressed by Tim Robbins ’ brilliant work behind the camera .
7 ) Bad Boys – 1983
Sean Penn again .
Shortly after portraying everyone ’s favorite surfer dude Jeff Spicoli , Penn signed up to play a teen hood sent to a rough and tumble juvenile detention center reserved for the baddest of the bad .
Gritty and brutal , this movie is not for the faint of heart .
6 ) The Longest Yard – 1974
There is no better place to stage a football game than behind prison walls ; violent and unstable men looking to hit something are n’t in short supply .
Burt Reynolds delivers the goods as washed - up former football star turned convict , Paul Crewe .
The climactic guards versus inmates gridiron showdown is classic .
5 ) Midnight Express – 1978
Note to self : never try to smuggle hash out of a foreign country .
Especially if that country is Turkey .
Although not classified in the horror genre , it would be easy to call this a horror movie after witnessing the inhumane torture subjected on young Billy Hayes .
If any fictional account can scare a person straight , it would be Midnight Express .
4 ) Escape From Alcatraz – 1979
Whether or not Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers successfully escaped from Alcatraz is n’t important .
Seeing how they devised and executed their ingenious plan is what makes this flick memorable .
Clint Eastwood was the perfect choice to play the enigmatic Morris .
3 ) The Great Escape – 1963
Steve McQueen again .
This World Ward II epic details the planned escape by a group of Allied prisoners from a German POW camp .
It ’s famous for catchy theme music and McQueen ’s iconic performance as “ The Cooler King . ”
If you have a spare three hours , be sure to check out this highly entertaining prison romp .
2 ) The Shawshank Redemption – 1994
One of the best films of the ’90s , Shawshank is a tour de force in storytelling and acting .
A circumspect banker named Andy Dufresne is handed two life sentences for murdering his wife , even though the evidence is circumstantial .
What happens after his arrival at Shawshank State Penitentiary is cinema at its finest .
1 ) Cool Hand Luke – 1967
“ I can eat fifty eggs . ” Immortal words from the incomparable Paul Newman .
It ’s a travesty Newman did n’t win Best Actor for the role of Luke Jackson .
Unwilling to bend to institutional conformity , Luke would become one of the big screen ’s greatest tragic heroes .
This film never ceases to amaze .
Jason Perlow has written an article about Richard Stallman , Watch Out for That Meteor , Stallman .
There are some factual errors in the article , so let me step up to the plate and fix them .
Here 's Perlow 's theme in a nutshell , as published in an extended caption under a disrespectful cartoon of Stallman : Richard M. Stallman ( RMS ) the founder of the Free Software Foundation , has labeled prominent Open Source software developer Miguel De Icaza a  Traitor for joining the Board of Directors of Microsofts CodePlex Foundation as well as for his creation of the Microsoft .NET - compatible Mono software development framework .
While RMSs hatred of all things proprietary has fueled the FSFs and GNUs mission to create
Free software alternatives for what seems like eons , the overwhelming desire for interoperability between open and proprietary systems makes this narrow - minded Cretaceous world view ripe for extinction .
I have some news for you .
The GPL ensures that Free Software will never be extinct .
Thank you , Mr. Stallman , for inventing it .
For that alone , he will go down in history .
Perlow will not .
And Miguel will not .
You and I will not .
But Stallman will .
Do you know why ?
Because with just his brain , he changed the world for the better .
How many people can say that ?
For that reason alone , even if you do n't agree with his goals , he has earned respectful treatment .
Anything less is boorish .
But if you simply can't restrain yourself from ad hominem attacks on Stallman , you should at least get your facts right .
Perlow based his article on a blog post by Martin Owens , but Owens , after reading Perlow 's article , wrote that Perlow got the facts wrong .
First , here 's what he wrote that Stallman said : Miguel de Icaza is basically a traitor to the Free Software community 
This was in response to my question about Richards thoughts on the new Microsoft  Open Source  CodePlex lab .
He went on to say that Miguels involvement in the project doesnt give much confidence as he is a Microsoft apologist .
The project looks to be concerned with permitting  Open Source programs to work on the Windows platform and thus divert valuable developer time away from free platforms such as Gnu / Linux .
He also went into an interesting story about Miguel and the FSF ( as Miguel used to sit on the FSF board ) , but I m hoping there is a good transcript of the event thing somewhere online , although this had nothing to do with Mono ( unlike some people have reported ) .
He wrote that last part to help any who might have been misled by Perlow 's account , after he read it .
How do I know ?
Look at this comment thread : Martin Owens Says :
2009 -09 - 22 at 05:02
Is that whats happening here ?
Hes not being criticised here for mono , Richard seemed to be saying that he was acti[ng ] in bad faith towards the Free Software community by attempting to undermine its core values of a completely free software platform .
The mono comments actually were separate in the discussion and the two were never linked ....

Yes I know , how totally incorrect can a reporter get .
So I put the Mono part somewhere else in the stack so it cant be confused with the Miguel part .
So , the very blogger Perlow based his rant on says he got it garbled .
Stallman never said Miguel was a traitor for doing Mono , not according to the blogger and others who heard the Q & A .
There is no transcript , though , which is why it seems odd to base a rant on something that ephemeral .
However , we do n't have to guess about Stallman 's views on Mono , because recently he published his views , so it 's puzzling how the garbling of the message could take root .
Here 's what he said in a nutshell : use it if you like it , but do n't depend on C# , because Microsoft may set its patent lawyers on you someday .
Does that strike you as radical ?
To tell people to watch out for patents ?
Your lawyer would tell you no different .
Stallman did n't talk against Mono , in short .
So Perlow 's long diatribe on that theme is out of his own mind .
Apparently the ' traitor ' remark -- and again , this was reported , but there is no transcript , so it may not even be the precise word used -- was in connection with Microsoft 's new Codeplex Foundation , for joining the board .
And what he apparently said was that he was a traitor to FSF core values , namely a completely free software platform .
Is that a goal of the Codeplex Foundation ?
Of Mono ?
Of Miguel ?
So , all rms was saying is that Miguel now pushes patent encumbered stuff , in partnership with Microsoft .
That is diametrically opposed to the FSF ideals .
And it is .
You can choose Miguel 's path if you prefer it , but it is contrary to what he once said he believed in .
So that is true , as Sam Varghese points out in this iTWire article .
Is that not exactly evidence of a total change of heart ?
From the FSF standpoint , what word would you suggest to capture that ?
Are people not allowed to criticize Miguel without being smeared ?
In short , Perlow attacked the man for something he did n't say .
He never said not to use Mono .
Nor is Mono even necessary for interoperability with Microsoft .
I note Microsoft is letting Intel port Silverlight instead of Mono to Moblin .
Surprise , Miguel .
Ah , the joys and surprises of partnering with Microsoft .
He will drink that cup to the full , no doubt , before this saga is done .
Why would * you* want Silverlight on Moblin ?
I can't imagine one good reason , personally , but the fact that Intel and Microsoft want it to happen may even be part of what 's behind the new push to tell us we must use both Windows and Linux and stop being so prissy about it .
I note that in Perlow 's article on how he can't live without Windows on the desktop , Why I Can Never Be Exclusive to Linux and Open Source on the Desktop , after detailing why he is bound to Windows in the workplace , he talks about at home :
At home , I cant be a Linux - exclusive either .
I run a bunch of multimedia stuff that I know will not run on Linux , such as the Slingbox player , Google Picasa and Adobe Photoshop .
Yeah , I know you can run Google Picasa and Photoshop with some degree of success in WINE , and you can even use Photoshop extensions in GIMP , but Id much rather run Photoshop and Picasa natively .
Theres also any number of other browser plugins and other apps that I use on Windows which have no true Linux equivalents .
So to get around this issue I run a Windows 7 desktop as my primary home system , and I use Synergy 2 to pan my mouse and keyboard input back and forth with a secondary Linux workstation .
OK .
Do as you please , but speaking for myself , I like being prissy about these things .
It encourages progress , in my view , toward a very worthwhile goal , namely a completely Free operating system .
And when things do n't work perfectly , I investigate , and generally I find it 's because Microsoft wo n't let it happen .
I am never going to be interested in proprietary , binary - only applications on any Linux distro , just because Microsoft is so overbearing .
I think it 's important to send them a message , namely some of us will do without rather than use their software , even if the software works fairly well , because we do n't approve of their business methods and we do n't trust our privacy in their hands .
But rather than tell you what I think , let 's let Miguel speak for himself .
You can then judge for yourself how accurate , or not , Stallman was , if he said what has been reported .
For the exercise , we 'll assume he did .
I thought it would be best to pick a subject where we actually know what is true , now that some time has passed .
We here at Groklaw were deeply interested in following the push to get OOXML accepted as a " standard " , in competition with ODF , which was already available and in use .
Miguel spoke about OOXML back in September of 2007 .
What was happening that month ?
We have a month by month , day by day , chronology , so we can focus in on that exact time period .
That very month , the national bodies were voting on OOXML , and right on time , as the voting was getting started , Miguel chose to say that in his opinion , OOXML was " a superb standard " .
Yes , he did .

Posted by kdawson on Mon Sep 10 , 2007 08:08 PM
from the say - it - ai n 't - so - miguel dept .
you - bet - it 's - not - out - of - context writes " A blogger on KDE Developer 's Journal has found an interesting post by Miguel de Icaza , the founder of GNOME and Mono , in a Google group dedicated to the discussion of his blog entries .
Six days ago Miguel stated that ' OOXML is a superb standard and yet , it has been FUDed so badly by its competitors that serious people believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with it . '
In the same post he says that to avoid patent problems over Silverlight , when using or developing Mono 's implementation ( known as Moonlight ) , it 's best to ' get / download Moonlight from Novell which will include patent coverage . ' "
Considering , with the benefit of time , that no one is actually using it , including Microsoft , and the current thrust , last I looked , was to edit it to make it match what Microsoft actually does and because it was internally inconsistent , would you say he was correct in his assessment ?
Or were there , in fact , some things wrong with it ?
I think it 's obvious .
As a standard , it 's a joke or a warning parable , depending on your point of view .
Why would he say that , then ?
Who knows ? [ Update :
In December of 2010 , a work agreement between Novell and Microsoft surfaced in a Novell SEC filing , and part of the agreement was that Novell was to be paid to show up at standards bodies ' meetings and at events related to Open XML . ]
But might it be viewed as a piece of evidence providing foundational support for a Stallman opinion that he is a Microsoft apologist ?

Subject : I tell you how does this look
Hola Miguel !
This is what I think about the Silverlight collaboration : * If I were you , I would be just happy that Microsoft officially works towards supporting Silverlight in Linux , the banned word in Xbox live .
*
This move actually makes Silverlight a more open approach to multimedia in the web than Flash because AFAIK Adobe does n't collaborate with gnash or other open source implementations .
But : * I think we 'll all agree that this collaboration can be seen as part of an strategy to gain acceptance in a flash dominated world .
I 've got no problem with that if this kind of competition benefits the users .. but why did n't Microsoft standarize Silverlight like they did with CLR and C# ?
This make me think that all this collaboration is temporal .
They could drop it after getting a fair share of market .
Of course , if anything this collaboration is better than nothing so even if people critizise it ( and they will ! ) , I do n't feel you did a bad thing .
*
Will you continue to develop a parallel batery of open source test suite ( like you have already ) that are available not only to you but also to other independent open source developers ? *
What about microsoft patents ?
If I create my own linux distro or I use a distro that is not mainstream or just does n't have a deal with the daemon .. err Microsoft .. like Novell has ..
Will I have to suffer the shadow of Microsoft patents over Silverlight when using or developing Moonlight ?
Thanks in advance ,

I do not blame them .
OOXML is a superb standard and yet , it has been FUDed so badly by its competitors that serious people believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with it .
This is at a time when OOXML as a spec is in much better shape than any other spec on that space .
Besides , it is always better to have two implementations and then standardize than trying to standardize a single implementation .

Miguel Naturally , this evoked a number of comments from startled readers , and Miguel posted the following comment : OOXML .
( Score : 4 , Informative )
by miguel ( 7116 ) on Monday September 10 2007 , @09:00 PM ( #20547277 ) Homepage
Folks , I made that comment on my blog because that reflects my personal opinion .
You really need to obsess over something else .
And before someone brings up the Microsoft connection , you should know that Novell official policy is to actively endorse ODF and that Novell 's position on OOXML is neutral .
My employer does not engage in any advocacy for or against OOXML ( but folks in engineering work on OOXML support for OO.org ) .
My opinions are my own , they do not represents the views of my employer .
Now , speaking purely personally .
I consider OOXML to be a pretty good standard all things considered , as I said back in January or February I did not agree with a lot of the criticism that was aimed at OOXML .
The quality of the critique was not very high , and it so far has consisted of throwing as much mud as possible and waiting to see what sticks , and what sticks repeat it a thousand times .
If these critiques were aimed at Linux or open source , we would be justly up in arms about the criticism being sloppy and having very little to stand on .
I went into some detail back in January : http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Jan-30.html [ tirania.org ]
Some of my opinions are based on the work that I did in Gnumeric many years ago .
Before there was any agreements between Microsoft and Novell , I was part of ECMA and when Microsoft initiated the OOXML specification process , it was me that got Novell 's OpenOffice.org hackers to attend the meetings .
At the time my goal was to extract as much information as possible from Microsoft because of the history we had with Gnumeric .
Michael Meeks and Jody Goldberg were some of the guys that went and attended the ECMA meetings .
From all the issues that were presented to ECMA , Novell was the second issue raiser ( behind Microsoft 's own QA of the spec ) , and it was all largely thanks to Jody 's diligent review of the spec .
From all the issues raised to date , on the latest status report only one issue had not been addressed ( 118 or 180 , I can not recall anymore ) .
Am personally proud that Jody and Michael made Microsoft add ~650 pages or so to the spec that documented the formulas ( one of the things we struggled a lot with in the Gnumeric days ) .
And all of this happened before the Novell / Microsoft agreement .
Our interest at the time was : lets get the most information we can get out of this spec to be able to interop .
So from that standpoint , I think that the folks at ECMA have done a pretty good job of addressing the issues raised by those that were implementing it .
The specification can be criticized on various levels , from critical issues , to mild issues , and in a way the distributed effort to stop OOXML helped debug the spec and raise the issues that need to be clarified .
There is certainly a number of critical issues that must be addressed , and it seems from every comment that Brian makes on his blog , that ECMA and Microsoft are committed to resolving those issues .
I would not have noticed them , so in that regard the anti-OOXML camp has done a great job in terms of finding problems in the spec .
But the majority of the criticism falls in other categories : mild , but conflated by a pedantic outrage over it ranging from OH MY GOD THEY USE A BITFIELD THAT IS JUST SO - NOT - XML ( am using caps to encapsulate the outrage in an actual discussion when an acquaintance of mine lost it ) misinformed ( Stephane Rodriguez shotting himself in the foot and asking " why does it bleed ? " , his document is making the rounds , and I have debunked it here : http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=279895&cid=20363627 [ slashdot.org ] and someone else on CodeProject or in Slashdot had to explain to him with sticks and balls his mistakes ) .
misrepresentation , like people claim that you must obtain a license from Microsoft to implement OOXML , that is simply not true , the OOXML specs are under the Microsoft OSP and some other very liberal patent grant license ( which am sure you can google up ) .
FUD .
The very thing that we accuse the big corporations of doing is now effectively used by our community ( well , am not sure if Rob Weir is part of " our " community or part of the FUDosphere ) .
Like that time when he said " OH MY GOD THE SKY IS GOING TO FALL : DOES THE SIN FUNCTION TAKE DEGREES OR RADIANS ?
OMG AIRPLANES WILL CRASH TOMORROW , WILL SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE PONIES ? " .
As it turns out , all of the issues that Rob raised could have been answered very easily ( which Brian Jones did on his blog , hence preventing the London - burns catastrophe from happening and saving the ponies .
Thanks Rob ! ) .
( Rob 's panic attack can be seen here http://www.robweir.com/blog/2007/07/formula-for-failure.html [ robweir.com ] and Brian Jones response http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/Default.aspx?p=2 [ msdn.com ] )
OOXML has been so politicized that it is dangerous to even bring the topic up .
I have decided not to blog in a number of occasions replies to Rob Weir 's FUD because I just do not have the energy or the time to compete with a guy whose full time job is to make sure OOXML is blocked .
Needless to say at the center of the debate there is a very juicy cauldron with money and there are a lot of economic interests tied to the outcome on all sides .
People claimed that 6,000 pages for 4 office applications was to big , but it comes down to 1,500 pages per application .
And someone mentioned that removing the examples and changing the font size to use the same font size that the ODF spec uses the spreadsheet ( or word processor , I cant remember ) spec goes down to 700 pages .
And 700 pages ( or even the 1,500 ) does not seem like a lot to me .
If I were an anti-trust prosecutor in the EU , I would have complained if the spec had any less than that .
Jody left Novell some time ago , and today coincidentally he blogged about his opinion on OOXML and ODF , his blog post is very interesting , as he is an independent developer working now only on gnumeric and not in OOo nor being paid by Microsoft ( as I know that many of you consider my opinion completely invalid and tainted ) :
http://blogs.gnome.org/jody/2007/09/10/odf-vs-oox-asking-the-wrong-questions/ [ gnome.org ]
It is an interesting read , regardless of your position on the subject .
So there you have it , a mouthful of personal opinions .
I bet you wanted to spend your time doing something else , like making out with your girlfriend ( haha , just kidding , if you actually reading my opinion on OOXML you have no girlfriend to make out with ) .
Miguel Ooph .
A mouthful indeed .

You seem to have answered a lot of questions that nobody thinks are the main questions , while not answering the important ones .
The main issue is that the spec says implementations have to document the behavior of particular versions of MS products , but it does n't spell out what that behavior is .
Am aware of those , they are minor issues .
I feel they are worthless , but whatever .
The issue has been raised with ISO , it has reached ECMA and they are going to get you the docs .
If I were triaging this as a bug report , I would say its irrelevant , but it seems that through ISO it became a big deal , so you going to get this documented .
Happier now ?
Minor issue ?
A standard that tells you to " do it like Microsoft " but does n't tell you precisely how ?
And you tell me .
Do we have all the docs ?
And since OOXML allows for proprietary extensions , could we ever implement OOXML the way Microsoft can ?
Is that minor ?
He was then asked a series of questions , including this fundamental one :
Not to mention the obvious " why do we need a second standard in the first place ? " , since ODF is already an ISO standard ( too many standards is like no standard at all ) .
And Miguel responded to that question like this : ... Well , that is a strategic discussion , not really something related to the quality of the standard .
ODF is a standard because it was rushed through and its missing fundamental pieces like a formula specification ( yes , I know , they are working on one , no need to give me the link again ) .
But as it stands today ODF is missing those bits .
Had the same level of scrutiny and criticism been applied to ODF than is being applied to OOXML there would be no ISO standard today ( google for ODF criticism on the formula issue , you will find the who - is - who of XML criticizing the decision to ship formula less at the time ) .
I will agree with you that having two is suboptimal , but we have to support them both * anyways * , so its not like its a big deal .

Homepage > but we have to support them both * anyways * , so its not like its a big deal .
Holy mackerel .
First : I really do n't care to get into a pissing match about the deficiencies of OOXML as a possible standard ( they are legion and often fundamental ; and whether or not you understand that and / or choose to minimize the severity of these things changes nothing ) .
I will say that I 'm very happy to finally see at least * some * open documentation for the new Microsoft Office format ; that has to make things easier for the people implementing filters .
As such I am completely unsurprised that those people are happier than they were a couple years ago .
In fact , I 'd be surprised if they were n't .
That part is probably something you and I agree on =)
However the quote above is utterly shocking .
Let me explain what I mean :
You are right that we have to support both OOXML and ODF out of practicality .
But you know what ?
That sucks .
It would be best for everyone if there was only one format to support .
Nobody would lose in that scenario , except perhaps the owners of companies with business models that depend on format variance to sell their product .
In the case of document format storage , a standard is truly important because formats ( poor or not ) that eventually lose implementations over time carve out blank spaces in our history once we can't read them properly .
These same formats are also the source of certain information inequalities in society ( e.g. those who ca n't obtain an implementation for financial , social or political reasons ) .
This may not matter so much for Acme Inc 's quarterly reports but it sure does for government , health and other socially vital information .
Remember when some hurricane Katrina victims could n't use the FEMA website because they had slightly older computers ?
This is n't a made up boogyman , this is stuff that bites us as a society fairly regularly .
Now imagine a hundred years from now when we can still read the constitutions of our countries , research papers , poetry and other examples of human kind 's great literary works that are hundreds or even thousands of years old ... but ca n't read the documents we 're creating at the start of the 21st century .
How will we learn from our history if we can't study it fully ?
Getting proprietary formats out of the way as soon as possible so that we do not extend this mess any further than necessary is absolutely the responsible thing to do in light of our ( hopeful ) future .
By allowing OOXML to pass from " specification " to " international standard " would be doing exactly that : extending the problem as it will give years if not decades more life to the format .
If OOXML was rationally implementable and properly documented , it would n't be as big of an issue .
It would be , as you put it , simply suboptimal .
The fact of the matter is that OOXML is not rationally implementable and not properly documented .
That 's why it lost the recent vote ; it was n't because of lobbying ( and trying to imply that when Microsoft got its hand caught in the cookie jar is pretty ballsy , by the way ) .
Are some interests acting out of concerns for their business models or pet projects when they rally for ODF and against OOXML ?
I 'm sure they are ; but that alone is n't reason to dismiss the fact that OOXML is problematic and that we do n't need two standards ( any more than it is to dismiss OOXML just because it comes from Microsoft ) .
So please , admire OOXML for what it is : a step forward in documenting what historically has been one of the more pernicious sets of file formats we 've had to deal with ; but do n't mistake that for being a reason to make it an international standard which will only prolong the issues that are part and parcel of the Microsoft Office formats , even in this current version of the specification .
I know that having a bunch of people shit on you in public sucks major donkey nuts and certainly would put most rational people into a rather ungracious mood , but please think above that noise and consider with your intelligent mind exactly what you are promoting here by saying " it 'd be fine as an ISO standard " .
ODF is currently incomplete ( formulas , blah blah blah ) but has exactly the right foundations , the right momentum for support across the industry , and the missing parts are being filled in very nicely .
Properly , I might add .
Those are the attributes that people who care about Freedom should appreciate , respect and support .
In this case , that support means being willing to reject a competing specification that is not well suited for such international ratification .
And that , in a nutshell , is why this is precisely a " big deal " .
Excuse the language , but this is for historians , too , so it has to be accurate .

Oh look .
I did about 2 seconds of googling and came across a wonderful article describing all kinds of BIN files that Microsoft is embedding in 2007 " OOXML " documents : http://www.codeproject.com/cs/library/office2007bin.asp [ codeproject.com ]
BIN parts are of particular interest for the file format consumer or updater since the underlying file formats are undocumented ( at the time of writing , August 10 2006 ) and are several additional file formats to deal with .
Short of Microsoft providing the exact specs for the BIN serializers of every involved part , consumers and implementers of the file format will have to stick to replicating structures that cannot be understood because of a discrepancy between serializers .
It goes all the way up to guessing default values of the objects you work with , that 's why it 's such a big deal .
One of those well - known file format loopholes , the ones that can give a vendor a say in the format 's future as well as any interoperability scenario , across Windows and non-Windows platforms .
What good is a " standard " that is still impossible to implement in a method compatible with the leading office suite on the market ?
That 's certainly the right question .

You 're saying two things here that really shock me .
Please tell me I misunderstood .
1 ) You 're saying that people _will_ have patent problems - i.e. Moonlight " infringes " MS patents and does n't work around them .
Even though Novell promised never to ship code that infringes MS patents - but always avoid them one way or another .
2 ) You 're saying other distributors can't ship Moonlight legally ( in the US ) because of patent issues .
Making Moonlight effectively non- free ( as in freedom ) .
I hope it 's just a matter of you being too fast on the trigger and your answer missing some elaboration - if this is the case you should really choose your words more carefully when talking about patents in the future - unless you want to hurt Novell .
If you 're actually saying what it sounds like you 're saying ( see item # 1 and # 2 ) I can only say OMFG ...
Non free as in freedom , or in other words exactly the opposite of what Free Software is all about .
Is that not what rms just reportedly said ?
Was he wrong ?
Miguel responded to the question about downloading : First of all , am not aware of such Novell promise to " never ship code that infringes MS patents " .
You can not make such statement because for one , the patent system is broken .
Novell statements are wildly different , they are of the form " we do not believe that we infringe " and am sure they say something along the lines of " we dont plan on infringing , and we plan on removing infringing code " .
But I am not aware of all the promises Novell has made , and I can not comment on other parts of the organization .
If you want an official answer , my personal blog on politics and poor attempts at humor is not the place to get an official answer .
Contact Novell public relations for that .
But you might be referring to the policy that we use for Mono , and I will be happy to discuss those with you .
The policies are on our FAQ , so you might want to read that before you post in panic again .
Moonlight does not have the same policy that Mono does in terms of us working around to remove infringing code .
For one , we do not know what it could be ( that is how the patent system works ) and two we have agreed and have obtained permission from any patents that might exist in Moonlight to implement it .
So our policy with Moonlight is different from Mono because of the requirements of this task ( see mpegla.com for your own amusement ) .
That being said , in neither case are we aware of infringements .
But like with any software piece , every 100 lines of code infringe someone 's broken patent , there is just no way around that .
>2 ) You 're saying other distributors can't ship Moonlight legally ( in

Making Moonlight effectively non-
> free ( as in freedom ) .
Am not sure where you get the idea that the " US " is the only place where software patents exist .
Free software people are under the mistaken impression that software patents are only a US thing , while many of the stake holders are European companies .
The only difference is that in Europe your " software patent " is written to describe a machine .
Law firms will offer you a set of checkboxes to " port " your patent from the US - wording to any other nation wording .
And the patents are enforceable in most countries in the EU .
Not surprising , as the EU owns many of patents on the media space .
We are obtaining covenants ( from Microsoft ) and patent licenses ( from MPEGLA , the consortium of American , European and Asian companies that own the " media space " ) to be allowed to redistribute Moonlight with a minimal risk to the end user .
I say " minimal risk " and not " risk free " , because that is the nature of software patents , we could be infringing a patent from some guy in Latvia for walking a linked list .
So that is the approach that we are taking to distribute for commercial use Moonlight , a plugin that operates in the media space : a patent rich and incredibly profitable space for the patent holders .
The rights negotiated will give anyone patent coverage , as long as it is downloaded from Novell .
Although I would like to fix the patent system , am not the one going to do so .
It feels like boiling the ocean , and I have already done my share of ocean boiling , feel free to pick the good fight .

Well , it certainly merits an extended explanation .
I have tried to summarize some of the issues above media patents but the space is incredibly complicated and no amount of one - liners can precisely describe the problems , the limitations and all the special conditions attached to them .
The problem is that people think that the problem is as simple as " patents bad " and everyone wrapping his virtual kafia around his head and running to the streets yelling " death to patents " has no idea how complex the system is and how little effect yelling has on actually changing anything .
If you want to engage on a serious patent discussion , I would love to do so , but you are going to need some legal training and get a lot more depth before we can have a productive discussion .
> If you 're actually saying what it sounds like you 're saying ( see item

Well , I did not say that .
So you can put the Ventolin down and breathe .
Miguel .
So , there you are .
Miguel in his own words .
Now , Perlow made fun of Stallman for worrying about patents :
All of this tin-foil - hattering by Stallman and his devout FSF followers is pure speculation and paranoia , particularly given the Microsoft Community Promise that the company has now effectively written in the Google Cache equivalent of blood .
Microsoft has committed to this on pain of permanent pariah status , risking loss of customers that require cross- platform interoperability if it decides to use litigation to attack developers of Open Source interoperability software which uses their patented standards and protocols .
Could Microsoft suddenly change its mind and revert to some purist evil , litigious Open Source - hating form instead of the Kinder and Gentler Microsoft that it is trying to create now ?
Sure , it could .
But I seriously doubt it .
The genie is out of the bottle .
I hate to burst people 's bubbles , but it was just last week that Microsoft sold , or tried to sell , to patent trolls some 22 patents that could be used against Linux .
Caught with its pants down when OIN ended up with them instead and told the world all about it , Microsoft quickly announced the Codeplex Foundation , which Perlow calls an open source nonprofit but which actually could more accurately be called Microsoft 's Push - Mono - Down - Your - Throat foundation , now that Sam Ramji has announced that giving Mono more " credibility " is the goal .
This is the star to guide you if you wish to be " pragmatic " and " compromise " also .
I suggest you read Andy Updegrove 's understated but -- to me , hilarious -- analysis of the legal structure of the Codeplex Foundation .
I know .
But paralegals find humor in legal overreaching , and Andy reads the foundation 's bylaws as Microsoft 's Big Thumb on a foundation it is only pretending to be a community project .
If you wanted to set up a board that can do whatever it pleases , you could n't even as a joke come up with anything more extreme than the Codeplex bylaws and legal structure , I do n't think .
Seriously , if I was given a joke assignment at a firm to come up with bylaws for the worst , most controlling , most overreaching one - entity controlled foundation , this is what I 'd offer my boss , and we would be both rolling on the floor laughing at my creative outrageousness .
By the way , Jason got something else wrong .
Mono is n't totally covered by Microsoft 's promise not to sue , only the ECMA standards part , and that 's not everything by any stretch : Note : as Miguel says in his post , mono implements a whole bunch of .
Net technology above and beyond ECMA C# and CLI and those parts ( ASP .
Net ADO .
Net etc ) are n't currently covered by this promise .
According to Miguel , they 're working on " splitting the jumbo Mono source code that includes ECMA +
A lot more into two separate source code distributions . "
One will be the unencumbered ECMA parts , and the other will " contain our implementation of ASP .
NET , ADO.
NET , Winforms and others " , which are not covered by Microsoft 's Community Promise .
Good luck with interoperating with Microsoft with just the covered parts .
As for " interoperability " , since when is that Microsoft 's ultimate dream , anyway ?
They want your apps , they want you developers , but they want it all on Windows .
Ballmer said so .
Let the 22 patents inform you as to how much Microsoft actually plans on staying in an interoperability embrace with Open Source .
Do n't you remember what happens after the Embrace ?
It ends with Extinguish .
I do n't know why when people compromise , they always insist that you must too .
What good is ideology , they ask ?
It 's all about good code , that 's all .
You know what ideology is good for ?
I 'll tell you .
It gave birth to GNU / Linux , the very code that some now wish to pragmatically compromise .
Fusion with Microsoft is n't a FOSS goal .
If that were the goal , what is left to compromise ?
Ideology gave birth to the GPL , the license that ensures that vendors can't force the code to go proprietary .
The idea is this : how wonderful it is to have an operating system and all the applications you can dream of that you yourself can control , can modify any way you want and share freely with your family and friends , and not have to worry about paying any proprietary tolls for anybody 's alleged " intellectual property " .
What a phrase .
It 's code that you know is n't spying on you or reporting home to any marketers or worse .
You do n't have to worry the way you do with Microsoft 's code that you will be infected with a virus or get 0wned by some Eastern European criminal group and put into some botnet for their purposes .
It 's code that you can change to suit your own needs , instead of being locked into whatever a vendor thinks you should be allowed to do with its software .
How could proprietary software ever be better than that ?
If that personal dominion and freedom is what you value , using proprietary code is going backwards .
Let 's think about those 22 patents for a minute .
They are symbolic of something that matters in this discussion .
They tell me that Microsoft does n't care how open the code is , so long as it has patents plastered all over it .
That 's what the game is now .
Ask yourself this : does Open Source protect you from that ?
No .
Not in any way .
Does anything ?
Yes .
The GPL prevents vendors from using the code and then suing over patents .
They have to choose .
And they want the code .
Even more , they want the developers .
And the GPL makes certain they can't just rape and pillage the community .
See what ideology is good for ?
It makes you think deeply about how to accomplish a goal .
And when it works , and the GPL does work , it changes the world .
I guess you saw the GPL was just upheld in France ?
Richard Stallman is going down in history for what he accomplished .
He deserves to just for inventing the GPL , in my book .
None of the people now piling on criticism of him will go down in history the way he will .
None of them .
Maybe in a footnote , as examples of the venality that he has had to deal with .
And I have a question for those who tell us we have to compromise and use both proprietary Microsoft software and FOSS .
If the purpose of Open Source was nothing more than making money as a Microsoft partner , you tell me -- what was it all for ?
Why not just use Microsoft software , then , and call it good ?
No. Really .
What was FOSS developed for , if that is the end result , a Microsoft - FOSS fusion ?
Why even bother ?
The idea was to provide something better , an alternative , one that was totally free of proprietary restrictions , so that it would be you who control your own computer .
And that is exactly what Microsoft can't ever offer you .
Update : Jason Perlow has responded to this article in an audio discussion with Ken Hess .
They agree that I do not understand that Miguel has to feed his family and pay his mortgage .
I believe that is called the Yuppie Nuremberg Defense .
I will quote from Wikipedia :
In the Christopher Buckley novel Thank You for Smoking and its film adaptation , the main character Nick Naylor justifies his career to a reporter by telling her that " Everybody has a mortgage to pay , " and referring to his response as the " Yuppie Nuremberg Defense " .
The Internets are buzzing with the latest survey showing , among other things , Republicans are split on the Birther issue with only 47 per cent accepting the claim that Obama was born in the US .
That ’s almost exactly equal to the 48 per cent who agree that global warming exists – it ’s evident from the public debate that the overlap between Birthers and opponents of AGW is very high ) .
But I would n’t want to give the impression that over 50 per cent of Republicans are conspiracy theorists who believe in a secret plot to impose a Kenyan - socialist dictatorship as part of the UN / IPCC system of world government .
On the contrary , the proportion is only about 25 per cent ( more in the South ) .
As on the global warming issue , the balance of opinion within the Republican Party holds to the sensible “ sceptical ” position : the science is n’t settled , the birth records are unclear , sightings of black helicopters need further investigation and so on .
That ’s good to know .
Mr Blair has not publicly commented on whether he wants the job Tony Blair 's hopes of becoming president of the European Council are fading after his supporters failed to secure the backing of EU leaders .
Gordon Brown said Mr Blair would make an " excellent president " but there were " many candidates who may come forward " .
Meanwhile ratification of the Lisbon Treaty , which creates the post , moved closer after EU leaders struck a deal with the Czech president .
Mr Brown said they had cleared the way for the treaty to be ratified .
No 10 has signalled that a defeat for Mr Blair 's candidacy is now " a clear possibility " .
' Excellent president '
The former British PM has not declared himself a candidate but British ministers , including Mr Brown who is at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels , have been talking him up for days .
Speaking at the end of the summit , Mr Brown said : " I think I am right to say that Britain has someone in Tony Blair who would make an excellent president of the Council of the European Union .
" I think there are many people who are members of the council who accept that and believe that to be true . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But he added : " I recognise also that there are many candidates who may come forward , some have already indicated their intention to do so , but I do believe that Tony Blair will remain an excellent candidate . "
At the summit EU leaders agreed to grant the Czech Republic , the only EU state not to have signed up to the treaty , an opt - out from the EU 's Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Mr Brown said he believed that the meeting had " cleared the way " for the Czech Republic to ratify the Lisbon Treaty - should the country 's constitutional court rule in its favour next week .
Once that happened European member states would discuss the position of the presidency and the commissioners , he said .
' Slim ' chance
If it is ratified it will also increase pressure on the Conservatives - who oppose the treaty and say there should have been a referendum on it - to spell out what they will do if they win power and it has come into force .
Conservative leader David Cameron told the BBC : " If that comes to pass we 'll set out straight away what our approach to that important issue will be . "
The BBC's Jonny Dymond in Brussels said Mr Blair 's chances of becoming the first president of the European Council - a post created by the treaty - seemed " slimmer today than before " .
POSSIBLE PRESIDENTS ?
Tony Blair - former British prime minister Jean - Claude Juncker - Luxembourg 's prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende - Dutch prime minister Vaira Vike - Freiberga - former president of Latvia Wolfgang Schuessel - former chancellor of Austria Felipe Gonzalez - former Spanish prime minister John Bruton - former Irish prime minister
Names in the frame Gavin Hewitt on Blair 's prospects
Send us your comments A lack of support from European socialist leaders has served to undermine Mr Blair 's chances .
However the leaders failed to back any prospective candidate and have now set up a three - man team to decide on their position .
Austrian Chancellor Werner Fayman , who will be one of the three on the panel , expressed doubts about Mr Blair 's prospects .
Mr Fayman said : " My personal opinion is that the candidate ... should have an especially good relationship with ( President Barack ) Obama and not stand for a good working relationship with Bush . "
Spain 's Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero also failed to endorse Mr Blair .
Mr Zapatero said : " We have all heard names .
But the work to achieve a larger consensus , that is going to take some time . "
Mr Zapatero also raised the prospect that the socialists might instead decide to seek the post of high representative for foreign affairs .
This would leave the presidency open to a centre - right candidate , thereby ruling Mr Blair out .

Canadian bishop thwarted police investigation of abusive priest , judge finds
November 09 , 2009
A Canadian judge has determined that retired Bishop Gérard Dionne thwarted a 1983 police investigation into Father Bernard Cloutier ’s sexual abuse of five teenage boys .
Father Cloutier faces sentencing for his abuse today .
The judge sided with testimony by the father of one of the victims ; the father testified that he , his wife , and parents of another victim were meeting with police when Bishop Dionne and Father Cloutier arrived uninvited and the bishop took over the meeting .
Saying “ shut up ” whenever Father Cloutier attempted to speak , Bishop Dionne spoke with the boys privately , after which they said they did not wish to pursue charges .
Father Cloutier was sent away for therapy before ministering in another diocese ; Bishop Dionne , then a Sault Sainte Marie auxiliary , was soon promoted to Bishop of Edmundston .
He resigned in 1993 and is now 90 years old .

It 's ( apparently ) true .
I 'm not sure this can be directly extrapolated to playing videogames , mind , but this is a wonderful read : The Science of Fun .
But the best argument for fun and play happens when you take it away .
Deny play to young mammals and the consequences are colossal .
This has been demonstrated powerfully in rats , with some of the most significant new science coming out of Canada .
" What 's been shown repeatedly , " said University of Lethbridge neuroscientist Sergio Pellis , author of The Playful Brain , " if you prevent juvenile rats from engaging in rough and tumble play , you get animals who have cognitive problems , emotional problems and they 're socially incompetent . "
In short , stop rats from horsing around and you get socially - awkward , troubled , dumbo rats .
Worse still , male rats who never play become bad lovers .
Read on .
It gets better .
Fun is the brain 's workshop .
" If you look at countries with the lowest amount of recess time , and scholastic achievement , there 's almost an exact correlation , " says Pellis .
" The U.S. , which has the lowest recess rates , often does the worst " in scholastic achievement .
It might even be the brains of children grow more at recess than in the classroom .
I 'm not in the least bit surprised by that last bit !
Now I am actually really curious as to whether the brain can extrapolate out to fun like ( heh ) co-op L4D , or teamplay in MMOs .
Is it the physical interaction that counts more , or the social interaction - or both equally ?
Does physical interaction extend to " mirror neuron " stuff , so that what happens to your avatar is effectively also happening to you ?
So many questions .
I 'd better buy that book .

WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are wrestling with how their health - care bill will deal with abortion and immigration issues as they prepare to bring the bill to the floor as soon as Friday .
Democratic leaders in the House warned members that debate on the floor may stretch through the weekend and into next week so the House can vote on the bill before the Nov. 11 Veterans Day holiday .
After critics attacked an earlier draft of the health bill during the August recess , Democrats are wary of letting it languish during a break .

I was asked to reply to Karl Denninger 's Rebuttal To Mish On Fractional Reserve Lending .
Here goes : Denninger does not phrase my arguments correctly on points 2 - 5 , however he thinks they are immaterial so the points are somewhat moot .
The crux of the matter is not whether assets are backed by collateral as Denninger suggests , but rather whether the same money has been lent out multiple times .
Let 's follow through with a real life example .
Fannie Mae makes a loan of $ 1,000,000 .
Let 's be more than reasonably fair and assume Fannie Mae issued bonds for the entire amount , not borrowing a single cent into existence .
So far there is no fraud .
$ 1,000,000 goes to the home builder .
That home builder deposits $ 1,000,000 into a Bank of America checking account .
Ignoring sweeps that would allow Bank of America to loan out every cent , let 's assume BofA keeps 10 % in reserves and lends out $ 900,000 to a new furniture store on the corner strip mall .
The furniture store owner buys $ 900,000 of furniture from a wholesaler .
The wholesaler deposits $ 900,000 into a Citigroup checking account .
Again , ignoring the likelihood Citigroup sweeps the whole amount into a savings account thereby able to lend out the entire amount ( savings accounts have no reserve requirements ) , let 's assume that Citigroup keeps 10 % in reserves and lends out $ 810,000 to a High Roller who takes out a home equity loan on his house that is supposedly worth $ 3,000,000 .
High Roller buys a yacht from a boating manufacturer for $ 810,000 .
The yacht manufacturer deposits $ 810,000 in a checking account at Wells Fargo .
Following the same pattern , Wells Fargo keeps 10 % in reserves and lends out $ 729,000 to a plumbing supply company , because home sales are going gangbusters and the plumbing supplier needs more supplies .
I think you can see where this is headed .
On the original $ 1,000,000 this is what FRL allows to be lent out .
$ 900,000
$ 810,000
$ 729,000
$ 656,000
$ 590,000
$ 531,000
$ 478,000
$ 430,000
$ 387,000
....
See where this is going ?
I am going to arbitrarily stop the chain right there , but the total so far is $ 5,511,000 out of $ 1,000,000 was lent out .
Karl claims this is not fraudulent because " it 's all backed by assets " .
Well for starters the value of those assets backing the loans is questionable .
Clearly it does not take much of a decline in asset prices to cause some major writeoffs .
But let 's get to the crux of the matter with a simple example .
Imagine I had gold depository with $ 1,000,000 in gold and lent out receipts for $ 10,000,000 in gold for people to buy things .
Think that is not fraud whether or not those receipts were backed by pledges ( assets ) to pay back the gold ?
Of course it 's fraud , and so is lending out $ 5,511,000 when only $ 1,000,000 really exists .
By lending out more money or gold than exists , asset prices reach unsustainably high levels before they crash .
Sound familiar ?
This is where the Libertarian argument " it's OK if two people agree " falls flat .
It is not OK because it cheapens the dollar , thereby robbing everyone saving dollars via theft of inflation ( making those dollars worth less over time ) .
Greenspan compounded this already massive problem in 1994 by allowing banks to " sweep " checking accounts ( unknown to customers ) into savings accounts .
This made the problem worse because savings accounts have no reserve requirements at all .
Is it any wonder credit exploded ?

Michele Bachmann was on Glenn Beck 's show yesterday -- with Judge Andrew Napolitano sitting in for Beck , who came down with appendicitis after his candidate , Doug Hoffmann , lost in the NY - 23 race -- plumping her big Tea Party protest of the House health - care reform bill today on Capitol Hill -- which she calls " Super Bowl of Freedom " .
According to ThinkProgress , Bachmann is calling on protesters to “ scare ” members of Congress into killing health - care reform .
“ Republican organizers are planning for activists to go into the House office buildings and the U.S. Capitol and confront members directly . ”
You have to be a little concerned about the kinds of nutcases she 's calling upon to visit their Congresscritters .
After all , Bachmann herself is a promoter of far - flung " constitutionalist " conspiracy theories about replacing the American currency , youth re-education camps and Obama - ordered " concentration camps . "
Napolitano opened the segment with a clip of Bachmann grilling Tim Geithner with her otherworldly questions about the " constitutionality " of the stimulus package .
So of course , they could n't help but indulge in a fresh round of paranoia about security for today 's ' Tea Party ' :
Napolitano : I have to give you a little bit of a warning .
I have a friend in the American intelligence community who lives and works around Washington , D.C. , who told me : ' Watch out for Mrs. Pelosi making the security requirements almost impossible to get to this rally . '
You guys have to watch out for that , that she does n't do something to make it very difficult for the folks to come to this gathering at noon tomorrow .
Bachmann : Well , she controls the Capitol .
She 's a very powerful individual .
And she controls ingress and egress , and so , I think it would be a big mistake for Speaker Pelosi to prevent the American people from coming to their House .
This is their House , after all .
This is why we need to make this emergency ' House Call ' on Congress tomorrow .
One can only imagine some of these doofus teabaggers getting lost on the Metro and then blaming Nancy Pelosi for it .
The archive is meant to show Nelson Mandela as a person rather than an icon
Unseen writings of Nelson Mandela which are being sold this week show the anti-apartheid leader at his most candid .
The former South African president 's archive shows him chiding himself over a " grave error of judgement " when he proposed lowering the voting age to 14 .
He also talks about how he was " not a very bright student " at university .
The Nelson Mandela Foundation ( NMF ) is selling the rights to the 100,000 - word archive of notes , diaries and letters at the Frankfurt Book Fair .
I 've never heard of a living political leader giving up their entire archive
Literary agent Jonny Geller
On his way to becoming South African president in 1994 , it is hard to think that Mr Mandela put a foot wrong .
But the NMF's Verne Harris told the BBC the compilation , called Conversations With Myself , showed Mr Mandela " not as a saint or an icon , but as a person " .
The compilation of notebooks , diaries and notes from speeches and meetings contains scanned - in documents from Mr Mandela 's life stretching back to 1929 , when he was 11 years old .
" This resource is really a window into Nelson Mandela reflecting , he is not communicating to a particular audience it is him laying out his personal thoughts , " Mr Harris said .
' Without censorship ' Jonny Geller , of the Curtis Brown literary agency , has taken the archive to display at the Frankfurt Book Fair .
He says he has never seen a collection like it .
I had to go to prison in order to learn how to be a good student
Nelson Mandela
" I 've never heard of a living political leader giving up their entire archive , " he said .
" I can't think of any other political leader who has opened up their archive without any censorship . "
Examples of the candid insights include notes from a meeting during the 1994 election campaign , a few days after he had proposed lowering the voting age .
" He was in a meeting with members of the ANC [ African National Congress ] , " said Mr Harris .
" We see him writing down what everyone is saying - basically attacking him for what he said .
" He made an entry in the notebook where he said : ' I have made a grave error of judgement . '
" That is the man the world needs to know , a man who admitted his mistakes and reflected on them . "
Racism question Mr Harris cited another extract from an interview when Mr Mandela is asked about his poor academic record when he was a law student .
The interviewer says : " You did n't do well in your legal studies at Wits university , is this because you had a racist lecturer ? "
Mr Mandela replies : " Yes I did have a racist lecturer , but that is not why I did n't do well . "
Later in the interview , he comments : " I was not a very bright student , I failed all of my subjects at Wits .
I had to go to prison in order to learn how to be a good student . "
The royalties are to be divided between Mr Mandela and the Nelson Mandela Foundation .
Mr Mandela has already written a two - volume autobiography and authorised at least one other biography .
Among numerous other books about the former leader , there are collections of his speeches and many books charting his impact on global politics .

This is going to grab me no readers–after all , the results of this past Tuesday ’s election are already wrapping yesterday ’s fish .
Which is odd , considering the runup which made it seem like it was the most important election after the last election ( as Jon Stewart noted ) .
Yesterday we had 24 hours of “ Was this a referendum on Obama ? ” or “ Was it just local politics ? ”
Myself , I think it was a little bit of the former and a LOT of the latter .
But That is NUANCE .
And Cable TV
News does n’t do nuance .
Leaving aside Faux News as a propaganda machine , the other two 25/8 news networks would n’t know nuance if it grabbed a mallet from hammerspace and hit them over the head .
I mean , when Wolf Blitzer accidentally got a confession from Balloon Boy , someone had to whisper it in his earpiece before he even noticed what he ’d tripped over .
And over on MSNBC , Chris Matthews ’ idea of a debate resembles more a college wrestling match than any intellectual exchange –2 out of 3 throws .
But I should n’t take them to task–even the newspapers do n’t do nuance any more–and they wonder why they ’re being run out of business by the Internets .
Anyhow , to return to Tuesday ’s election , pretty much everything happened the way it could really be expected –no matter how much anyone hoped otherwise .
But the fun race of the day was Congressional District 23 of New York .
District 23 has gone Republican for the last 2000 years , and this year it promised no difference .
IF it had n’t been for the teabaggers who decided that the Republican candidate , Dierdre Scozzafava , was a closet lefty , planning to bring socialism down on the heads of her constituents .
After all , she supported abortion rights and gay marriage , the next thing you know , she would be demanding the re-distribution of wealth .
So they sent in their ringer , Doug Hoffman .
Hoffman , who had to be told where the 23rd District was , had no idea what its issues might be–he was being sent in to defend the country from Kenyan aliens masquerading as Hawaiians .
Soon Sarah Palin descended upon the 23rd District , tho ’ invited by none .
Along with Tim Pawlenty , governor of Minnesota , they supported the hell out of Dougie .
Now you know the deer in the headlights look .
Imagine that deer suddenly noticing a 16 - wheeler coming hellbent down the highway at 85 mph and you ’ll have a good idea of how Doug Hoffman started to look .
I mean seriously , I ’ve never seen a candidate with a more shell - shocked expression on his face –if he opened his eyes any wider , they would have exploded from the pressure differential .
Because of or in spite of Sarah ’s help , he started taking Scozzafava ’s voter base and Scozzafava dropped out –instructing her supporters to vote for the DEMOCRAT , Bill Owens , who was at least playing fair .
Despite that clue , Limbaugh , O’Reilly , Glenn Beck , and the rest , all fell over themselves predicting a landslide for the carpetbagger .
The entire MSM called it the most important race of all time because it would show how much support Obama had lost and how important the teabaggers had become .
Then Dougie lost .
The 23rd went Democrat for the first time in two millenia and … everyone switched gears and started discussing NJ and VA and THAT became the referendum on Obama .
And by Monday , no one will even remember if we had the most important off - off year election of the century last Tuesday .
Have a good weekend folks
In the chronicle of America ’s war against its marijuana users , conservative columnist George Will may have just earned credit for his own Walter Cronkite moment .
Appearing on ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos on Sunday , the Pulitzer - winning journalist and longtime icon of America ’s political right declared that with President Barack Obama ’s new policy which respects the states right to allow medical marijuana , the United States is “ probably in the process now of legalizing marijuana . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
He added that if there were to be a serious effort to fight the increasingly violent , powerful Mexican drug cartels , “ you ’d legalize marijuana , ” the sale of which provides the gangs the vast majority of their funding .
Will ’s comments come not even a week after a Gallup poll found record - breaking support across the United States for the legalization of marijuana , with nearly half of U.S. citizens in favor and a clear majority of support emerging among liberals , Democrats and moderates .
Will ’s proclamation , as a well - respected conservative thinker , is especially significant given that Gallup found the only two political groups in the U.S. that are still very strongly opposed to legalization are conservatives and Republicans .
Gallup tracking data also showed that from 2006 - 2009 , support for legalization grew more than at almost any time since the drug was banned , trending upward from 36 percent to 44 percent in just three years .
However , Will ’s estimation of America ’s shifting marijuana policies still posed a scenario that many conservatives would likely look upon with uneasiness .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Medical use can be marijuana to cure anxiety , to cure insomnia , all the rest , ” he said .
“ And you will have what you now have in California , where marijuana is essentially legalized .
We have legalized gambling in this country over two generations ; it used to be considered a sin and a crime .
We , with no national debate and no decision moment — we just did it — we legalized prostitution , as anyone who opens a telephone book and looks under ‘ escort ’ can tell you .
And we may be doing …
We ’re probably in the process now of legalizing marijuana . ”
John Podesta , who joined Will along with Laura Ingraham , Al Hunt and Cynthia Tucker on the program , suggested that the United States will not see a full legalization of marijuana until someone figures out that taxing the nation ’s top cash crop could pay for public health care .
“ That may be what drives it ! ” said host George Stephanopoulos .
ADVERTISEMENT
Will retorted : “ 80 percent of the Mexican cartels ’ revenue is from marijuana .
If you really want to go after the Mexican cartels — and I ’m not saying that ’s the only criteria for public policy — you ’d legalize marijuana . ”
Were that to happen , California would likely be the first state to do so .
Right now , several ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana for recreational use by adults appear likely to clear the hurdles required to be put up for state - wide vote .
Furthermore , a Field Research Corporation poll of Californians , taken in May , found 56 percent support legalizing the drug and levying a “ sin tax ” on purchases .
ADVERTISEMENT
California State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , of San Francisco , has repeatedly said that under legalization the state would quickly draw over $ 1.5 billion in marijuana taxes alone .
He added that advocacy agencies have credibly placed the annual value of marijuana sales in California at or above $ 14 billion .
One airport within Ammiano ’s assembly district — San Francisco International — even has a little - spoken policy of allowing properly - licensed passengers to travel with up to a half - pound of medical marijuana .
Oakland International airport shares a similar policy .
Last week over 3,000 federal , state and local law enforcement agents participated in a major operation against the La Familia cartel , which dominates the trade of methamphetamine in the United States .
Agents arrested 303 individuals allegedly linked to the cartel , with raids taking place in 38 U.S. cities .
Seventy - seven of the arrests took place in the Dallas - Fort Worth area of North Texas .
ADVERTISEMENT
Drug war violence has claimed the lives of over 15,000 Mexicans in the last three years , The Washington Post reported on Friday .
Those killed include women , children , police , soldiers , politicians and cartel members , among many others .
One Mexican city , Ciudad Juarez , has seen over 2,000 drug war - related killings in 2009 alone , making it “ the murder capital of the world . ”
By comparison , some 2,691 civilian and Iraqi security force members have suffered violent deaths so far in 2009 , according to the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count .
Another 131 coalition troops have been killed so far this year .
Furthermore , the Human Rights Unit of the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan noted in August that the first six months of 2009 have seen 1,013 civilian deaths , whereas the figure was lower during that same period of time during the last two years of the Bush administration .
The comments by George Will noted above may be heard in the final four minutes of this video , broadcast Sunday , Oct. 25 , 2009 .

Since the advent of colossal downforce through fat tires and wind - tunneled wings , racing drivers are faced with the unique problem of keeping their heads attached to their bodies .
With g- forces in modern Formula 1 cars reaching 8 times the gravity of the Earth on certain tracks , this is not a trivial issue .
The human head is a large , heavy spheroid attached to the rest of the body through the much lighter and thinner neck .
As you ’ll remember from our very educational How To Become a Formula One Driver in One Day video , even 3 g’s is a force to be reckoned with when applied laterally .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Atlanta rapper DeAndre Cortez Way , better known by his stage name Soulja Boy Tell ' Em or just Soulja Boy , was charged with obstruction after running from police despite an order to stop , a police spokesman said Friday .
Rapper Soulja Boy was arrested in Georgia after allegedly running from police .
The 19 - year - old singer was among a large group that had gathered at a home in Stockbridge , 20 miles south of Atlanta , said Henry County , Georgia , police Capt .
Jason Bolton .
Way was arrested Wednesday night along with another man , Bolton said .
Police said Way left jail Thursday after posting a $ 550 bond .
Bolton said officers responded to a complaint about a group of youths milling around the house , which appeared to be abandoned .
When police arrived , they saw about 40 people .
Half of them ran away , including Way , Bolton said .
The ones who remained told officers they were at the home to film a video .
Way was arrested when he returned to the house to get his car , Bolton said .
He said the house was dark inside and looked abandoned .
" He just ran from the police , and then he decided to come back , " according to Bolton .
The second man who returned for his vehicle was arrested after police found eight $ 100 counterfeit bills inside , according to the officer .
Way broke into the music scene two years ago with his hit " Crank That ( Soulja Boy ) . "
The rapper also describes himself as a producer and entrepreneur .

Of all the alternate worlds we 're dying to visit , the greatest is that mythical room containing every book that was never written .
Here are the dozen unfinished novels by science fiction 's greatest authors , that we wish we could read .

The Masks by Ray Bradbury
Masks , myths and metaphors " play an important part in much of Bradbury 's work , claim Jonathan Eller and William F. Touponce in their Bradbury study , The Life Of Fiction , and they believe Bradbury gets to the bottom of this obsession in his never - finished novel called The Masks .
Filled with images of carnivals , this 1940s novel would have been the purest distillation of Bradbury 's obsession with magicians and magic .

The Owl In Daylight by Philip K. Dick
When Dick died in 1982 , he was busy with The Owl in Daylight , which is reputed to be concerned with deaf aliens abducting a B - movie composer , artistic genius , new forms of sensory input , an amusement park , or a sci- fi reboot of The Divine Comedy , depending whom you ask .
Dick never outlined the plot , so it 's hard to say .
His wife Tessa published her interpretation of his concept in 2009 , but her version is largely her own work , and draws inspiration from Mozart 's The Magic Flute .

Irontown Blues by John Varley
We interviewed Varley back in March 2008 , and he told us :
One of these days I hope to write a third novel in the Steel Beach , Golden Globe trilogy , entitled Irontown Blues .
The reason I have n't written it is that I do n't yet know what 's going to happen .

People have been waiting for this novel forever , and little is known about Varley 's ideas so far .
Back in February , he said it 's " third in line , " after two other novels he 's working on .
" If I write it , it would be about a cop , " he told Xero magazine .

The Pressure of Time by Thomas M. Disch
A sequel to Camp Concentration , about the pursuits of a society of humans become immortal through genetic alterations caused by a plague that swept through the world .
A few regular mortals also survive , hiding out in enclaves .
Disch explained :
For various reasons , personal and impersonal , I never got back to work on " Pressure " , and now I see I wo n't , alas .
Since Camp Concentration ( which took 8 months to write ) I realise I can't afford to spend such a lot of time on a book that earns only a standards sf advance " .
The personal reasons included an intense affair with the poet Lee Harwood that lasted about six weeks .
After Harwood left him , Disch suffered several months of unrequited love .
Disch confessed that much of The Pressure of Time was " inspired by the pangs of despised loved " .
Disch travelled around , visiting Ireland and Turkey , but suffered writers block .
Unable to continue with his own work , he wrote novelisations of The Prisoner and Alfred the Great .

The other books in Octavia Butler 's Fledgling series .
Butler died after Fledgling came out , but the book 's ending left most people believing she intended to write at least one sequel , if not many .
I 've heard rumors she 'd made notes on a sequel , but can't find any confirmation of that online .
Butler also had started a third novel in her Parable series , called Parable Of The Trickster , but was unable to finish it due to a seven - year bout of writers ' block .
( Octavia Butler 's advice on dealing with writers ' block ?
" Fall in love .
Why not ?

Voyages D'Etudes by Jules Verne
Verne wrote 50 pages , and never finished the rest .
The book was rewritten by his son Michel as L'etonnante aventure de la mission Barsac , along with several other works inspired to greater or lesser degree by his father 's manuscripts .
Esperanto enthusiasts are particularly saddened that in so doing , Michel expunged all references to support for the nascent language , of which Jules was a proponent .

Azathoth by H.P. Lovecraft .
Ia !
Ia !
Lovecraft started this novel in June 1922 , but only wrote a small fragment , which was published afterh is death in the journal Leaves .
According to Wikipedia , he described it as " a weird Eastern tale in the 18th century manner " and as a " weird Vathek - like novel . "
( Vathek being an 18th century novel about Arabia . )
You can read the fragment that he actually wrote here .
It starts quite stirringly , bemoaning our gray , citified , un-magical existence .

A Sense Of Time by Henry James
Yes , that Henry James .
The " Turn Of The Screw " guy .
He started writing this romance , about a young man who discovers he can walk through portals into the past , in 1900 , but all the time - travel mechanics got too convoluted and gave him a headache .
He abandoned it , only to return to work on it in 1914 , writing another huge section .
In the novel , Ralph Pendrel travels back and takes the place of his own ancestor , but then the woman he loves realizes he 's a time - traveler and makes a great sacrifice to help him return to the present .

The Plant by Stephen King
This was King 's famous experiment , where he serialized a novel online , and you were supposed to pay him $ 1 every time you downloaded a chapter .
If the percentage of downloaders who paid $ 1 dropped below 75 percent , King threatened to stop posting the chapters .
And eventually , that 's what happened .
The already - posted chapters have been removed from King 's site .
The novel is about a paperback editor who receives weird letters ( and odd photographs ) from a magical weirdo .
The editor sics the cops on the magician , who sends him a strange plant in revenge .

The Dark Tower by C. S. Lewis
A story of interdimensional travel including the titular tower ( which turns out to be a far - future replica of the the bog-ugly Cambridge University Library ) , this was supposed to be the original sequel to Out of the Silent Planet .
It ends abruptly and some people have accused it of being a forgery .

The Splendor And Misery Of Bodies , Of Cities by Samuel R. Delany
This sequel to Stars In My Pocket Like Grains Of Sand may never actually see the light of day .
We asked Delany about it a while back and he explained :
I did write about 150 pages of it at some point .
But a number of things had come up to undercut it .
I 've explained it many , many times , and do n't mind explaining it again .
I was in a major relationship at that time , that kind of fueled the first volume , Stars In My Pocket Like Grains Of Sand .
And that relationship broke up , and that was the beginning of the Eighties , at the same time the AIDS situation came in .

And after that , Delany 's view of the gay community changed somewhat drastically .

The Salmon Of Doubt by Douglas Adams
Adams was working on this book , a Dirk Gently novel , when he died , but he 'd decided his ideas for it did n't work for Gently .
So he tried first turning it into a standalone novel , and then reworking it into a sixth Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy installment .
The version which appears in the book of the same name does star Gently , and involves a client who wants to hire him to find the back half of her cat .
According to Don't Panic , the book about Adams by Neil Gaiman ( with revisions and updates by Guy Adams ) , the fragment which appears in the book is actually from several different versions of Salmon which were on Adams ' various hard drives .
What we have is pieced together from three files — Chapters 2 , 8 , 10 and 11 are from one file , Chapter 1 is from an earlier draft , and Chapter 9 is Adams ' last known piece of writing .
It 's basically a mish - mash , and an assembly of working notes and fragmentary stuff .

Like the novels we 're discussing , this list is decidedly unfinished — what are the books that were never completed , for whatever reason , which you would dearly love to read ?

WHY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOSING THE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM DEBATE .
They 're O.D. 'd on dignity .
Little do they know benevolent bromides and honey - coated political promises are out .
The unexpected grabs attention and the unorthodox is the antidote to a world of mediocrity .
The need to use truth , humor , irony , exaggeration , or ridicule to expose and criticize people 's stupidity or vices , particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues is here and now .
The mighty bumper sticker / billboard , a form of mass communication in America and is still a powerful medium .
It ’s literally a message in a bottle , a social statement that people of every political stripe can comprehend .

A very fine bit of guerilla theater , indeed .
My only beef is that it makes my kitten flee the room in terror ( remind me never to take him to the opera ) .
These people are true heroes of democracy , and on top of that , they have a delightful sense of humor .
As a remote observer , I would recommend that they immediately replace the current administration , and that their friends take over the house and senate !
Five Stars !

Kucinich was on C Span Sunday morning and a caller mentioned the Schmidt / Kerkorkian case ( not Sibel by name ) .
Kuch said he had n't heard about it and would the caller please contact his office Monday with the specifics of the case .
Does anyone really think Dennis is unaware of this ?
BTW the caller did an excellent job of presenting it to him so he did n't get cut off halfway through , IMO .
It might be a good time for you to contact his office Monday about it .

Utopia , Part 3
Is nothing American sacred anymore ?
The largest mall in the world turns out not to be the famous Mall of America in Bloomington , Minn .
It ’s the South China Mall outside of Guangzhou , China .
Outdoing the techniques of American consumerism , South China Mall is Disneyland , Las Vegas and Mall of America rolled into one .
There are carnival rides , mini-parks , canals and lakes amid classic Western - style buildings with space for hundreds of shops .
But along with the glitz and glory of middle - class shopping , the mall ’s Chinese developers seem to have imported something else — a cautionary tale of capitalist hubris .
Alex
Hu , a local Guangzhou boy who made it big in international business , wanted South China Mall to be a hometown monument to his success — even though Guangzhou has no major airports or highways nearby .
And four years after its construction , the mall sits virtually empty of both shops and shoppers .
But the Chinese have imported yet another concept familiar to Americans — South China Mall is considered too big to fail .
So , employees line up for flag - raising ceremonies and pep talks about “ brand building ” before going off to maintain the deserted concourses meticulously .
If China is the future of the world economy , Utopia , Part 3 : The World ’s Largest Shopping Mall just may be a startling peek at whatâs to come .
You know how Maine ’s anti-gay camp is trying to convince voters that the Radical Homosexual Agenda wants to pass same - sex marriage legislation because it ’ll force teachers to school kids in butt sex ?
Well what about our fear that the bigots trying to rape us of our rights want to force teachers to school kids on how to quit homosexuality ?
The Rev. Bob Emrich — who is worthy of neither reverence or respect — is also a proponent of conversation therapy , notes Good As You ‘s Jeremy Hooper .
Emrich , a pastor at Emmanuel Baptist Church who ’s helping lead the “ Yes On 1 ” fight in Maine , has no problem promoting bunk science to his legions .
And yet he thinks the gays are trying to brainwash school children ?
Emrich , who says he “ feel[s ] good about the momentum ” on the “ Yes On 1 , ” has not had to answer equally ridiculous charges that his team wants to teach the possibility of conversion therapy in schools .
As we await tomorrow ’s results in Maine ( and Washington State ) , it ’s a reminder of what ’s at stake : Battling back against discrimination and granting gays and lesbians the right to marry , or buying into hocus pocus .
Yes , it really is this obvious :
It was the best of times , it was the worst of times .
O.K. , maybe not literally the worst , but definitely bad .
And the contrast between the immense good fortune of a few and the continuing suffering of all too many boded ill for the future .
I ’m talking , of course , about the state of the banks .
The lucky few garnered most of the headlines , as many reacted with fury to the spectacle of Goldman Sachs making record profits and paying huge bonuses even as the rest of America , the victim of a slump made on Wall Street , continues to bleed jobs .
But it ’s not a simple case of flourishing banks versus ailing workers : banks that are actually in the business of lending , as opposed to trading , are still in trouble .
Most notably , Citigroup and Bank of America , which silenced talk of nationalization earlier this year by claiming that they had returned to profitability , are now  you guessed it  back to reporting losses .
Ask the people at Goldman , and they ’ll tell you that it ’s nobody ’s business but their own how much they earn .
But as one critic recently put it : “ There is no financial institution that exists today that is not the direct or indirect beneficiary of trillions of dollars of taxpayer support for the financial system . ”
Indeed : Goldman has made a lot of money in its trading operations , but it was only able to stay in that game thanks to policies that put vast amounts of public money at risk , from the bailout of A.I.G. to the guarantees extended to many of Goldman ’s bonds .

Efforts like the X - 37B demonstrate that there is still some interest in RLV technology within the government .
( credit : NASA )
Is the RLV industry emerging from hibernation ?
The need for low - cost reliable access to space is greater than ever .
Yet since the 1990s the efforts of the US government and industry to build these systems has stalled .
The failed Lockheed Martin X - 33 program of the 1990s created a fear factor inside parts of the aerospace establishment that has not gone away .
It seems no one at NASA or in the Defense Department or the Congress is willing to gamble on making a multibillion - dollar investment in a new spaceplane program .
Since the failure of government programs the private sector has had the field to itself .
It ’s been about five years since the Air Force essentially shut down the American government ’s effort to build a reusable launch vehicle ( RLV ) .
The leaders decided that it would take a technological breakthrough on the order of the switch from piston engines to jets to build a successful system .
NASA efforts to put together a viable RLV program had lead to the X - 33 debacle and the 2nd Generation RLV programs were unable to gain technical , political , or budgetary traction .
Since then the private sector has had the field to itself .
Commercial suborbital rockets proved themselves when SpaceShipOne successfully won the Ansari X PRIZE .
The New Shepherd program by Blue Origin , financed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , seems to be making progress using ideas pioneered by Max Hunter and the DC - X program of the early 1990s .
In the purely suborbital field , Virgin Galactic ’s SpaceShipTwo , being built by Scaled Composites , should be rolling out fairly soon , and the XCOR Lynx rocketplane is also on track for a first flight sometime next year .
A healthy suborbital sector is attracting the attention of the scientific community .
Alan Stern and the Suborbital Research Applications Researchers Group explained in a recent editorial in Space News that a combination of low cost and frequent flights will give scientists and educators a new set of options .
This market will provide profits that can be recycled into the development of more powerful vehicles someday these could achieve orbit .
Since the DC - X last flew in 1996 , there has been enormous progress , particularly in materials .
The failure of the composite tanks that doomed the X - 33 program would probably not occur today .
Boeing and Airbus are both betting a lot on this technology for their next generation of airliners .
Advanced RLVs will be able to take advantage of the work done in the commercial aviation industry .
Of course , information technology is still moving ahead and the military need for ever - better Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) ensures that fight control systems are becoming more sophisticated and more reliable .
This is providing the RLV industry with an ever - expanding resource that can be adapted to its needs .
Recent advances in nanotechnology are also promising .
Access to space is essential for both US national security and for the nation ’s economic competitiveness .
Yet America is still stuck with systems whose essential technology has hardly changed in decades .
One sign that interest in RLV development is not simply confined to the NewSpace industry is the news that a subscale rocketplane was launched from a site at Spaceport America in New Mexico .
The 2.4 - meter - long test item may not seem like much , but the fact that Lockheed Martin carried out this test indicates that the major firms are taking another look at the potential of these vehicles .
Another sign is that next year the X - 37B will be launched into orbit on an Atlas 5 .
This spaceplane program may be controversial , but it shows that the Air Force has not given up entirely on reusability as a goal .
The need for RLVs is evident in the struggle over the future of human spaceflight .
The Ares 1 and the alternatives such as SpaceX ’s Falcon 9 and the Orbital Sciences ’ Taurus 2 , all use essentially the same old - fashioned technology .
It is true that the Ares and the Falcon both have elements that can be recovered , refurbished , and reused .
However , like the Shuttle ’s solid rocket boosters , this process is a long way from the airliner - type operations that will be needed if the industry is to make the dramatic cuts in cost per pound to orbit that is the long - term goal .
Access to space is essential for both US national security and for the nation ’s economic competitiveness .
Yet America is still stuck with systems whose essential technology has hardly changed in decades .
The reliability that has been achieved by the Delta 4 and the Atlas 5 can not be dismissed lightly .
The cost of failure is just too high .
Future vehicles show promise , but they are simply expensive stopgaps on the way to an operational RLV .
The US has the capability to develop such a system .
The question is , as always , a question of long - term political will .

Abstract
Fusing data generated by current research in social neuroscience , positive psychology , and advanced imaging techniques , the new brain science knowledge that results gives us tools for understanding and enhancing the ability of men and women to work together .
Taken together , this information is becoming known as gender intelligence and is being adopted by many progressive organizations .
Companies like Deloitte & Touche , IBM , and PriceWaterHouse Coopers have seen immediate financial results including increased retention of women by training their managers to use gender intelligence in the workplace .
Using the principles of brain science particularly with respect to gender differences can have a positive impact on Agile teams , corporate culture and organizational success .
What ’s All the Fuss About Anyway ?
It seems that everywhere we look these days , there are articles describing the implications of new research findings about the brain .
From the pages of the N.Y .
Times to Harvard Business Review to Fast Company , scientists are providing us with tantalizing new information that challenges much of what we thought we knew about what makes us tick and why we interact with others the ways we do .
A few years ago , Dr. Eric Kandel , the 2000 Nobel Prize winner for biochemistry said in a speech that this research is clearly the new frontier in medicine and science , likely to vastly alter and also improve our understanding of individuals and society .
We focus here on three of those research streams most relevant to people as members of organizational systems : social neuroscience , positive psychology , and imaging technology .
Briefly , we can describe these three areas in the following way :
Social neuroscience is the study of what happens in the brain when people interact .
Daniel Goleman , perhaps best - known for his work on emotional intelligence , has developed an idea he calls “ social intelligence “ .
Whereas emotional intelligence is primarily an intrapersonal process , social intelligence is an interpersonal one .
According to Goleman , people are “ wired to connect ” with the result that we are inexorably drawn into an intimate brain - to - brain linkup whenever we engage with another person .
That neural bridge lets us affect the brain — and therefore the body — of everyone we interact with , just as they do us .
This neurological dance stimulates our nervous systems , affecting hormones , heart rate , circulation , breathing and the immune system .
Goleman describes the relevant neural pathways , including the thalamus and amygdala , which together regulate sensory and arousal stimuli .
He speaks of spindle cells , which rapidly process social decisions ; of mirror neurons , which sense another ’s movements ; of dopamine neurons , which react to pleasure - inducing neurotransmitters that flow freely while two lovers gaze .
Positive psychology is a new branch of psychology focused on the study of well - being and the enrichment of human life .
Researchers such as Dr. Jonathan Haidt at the University of Virginia have been studying the chemical and hormonal responses generated by witnessing acts of moral courage and inspired behavior .
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson at the University of North Carolina has discovered that experiencing positive emotions in a 3 - to - 1 ratio with negative ones leads people to a tipping point beyond which they naturally become more resilient to adversity and can achieve what they once could only imagine .
Imaging technology is the world of functional MRI ’s ( fMRI ) , positron - emission tomography ( PET ) scans , SPECT scans , and other non-invasive brain - imaging technology that allows us to see inside the human brain in real time while it is solving a problem , experiencing emotion , or establishing trust with another person .
Differences between men and women have been clearly documented in structural , chemical / hormonal , and functional areas .
Researchers such as Daniel Amen , Michael Gurian and Barbara Amis have developed ideas commonly called “ gender intelligence ” to describe the likely impact of these differences on behavior .
Why Does “ Gender Intelligence ” Matter in Organizations ?
Women have succeeded now at every organizational level and currently occupy just over 50 % of the management and professional / tech roles according to 2007 data from Catalyst , a leading research and advocacy group for women in the workplace .
Despite that progress , at current rates it will take more than 47 years for women to achieve parity in executive level , or “ C - suite ” jobs .
Clearly , the idea touted in the 1970s that simply having talented women “ in the pipeline ” would lead to gender equity , has proved inadequate .
Numerous studies such as Harvard Business Review ’s recent The Athena Factor , report that many women leave organization life because of hostile work environments and extreme job pressures .
Ineffective communications , influenced in part by gender differences , can contribute to perceptions of discomfort that result in a decision to leave the organization .
As retention rates fall , recruitment and retraining costs rise .
After training its managers in brain - based gender differences , Deloitte & Touche saw such immediate improvement in retention rates that the company estimated it saved $ 250 million dollars .
In addition , numerous academic and industry studies have documented high exit rates for women from the IT arena contributing to difficulties in filling roughly 500,000 information technology jobs nationally .
Contrary to popular belief , there is now an ample supply of women graduating universities with degrees in the science , technology , and engineering ( SET ) fields .
With more than 50 % of the current US SET workforce approaching retirement age , organizations must examine strategies to address the workplace conditions that attract capable women and men , and increase the likelihood of their continued employment .
Gender intelligence is one key tool that we can utilize .
Why Does “ Gender Intelligence ” Matter for Agile Teams & Enterprises ?
Though no studies have been conducted , empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that the Agile emphases on quality of work life , including collaborative work environment , strong relationships , cross-functionality , and sustainable pace , attracts a greater number of women to Agile projects and teams .
Attendees comment on the greater proportion of women at Agile - focused conferences compared to general software conferences , “ where there ’s never a line in the ladies room . ”
Quality of work life may attract women to Agile .
Attracting women is one thing , keeping them is quite another .
Everyone wants to know his or her contributions to the work is valued by others on the team .
However , often the ways that women contribute does n’t receive recognition for the value it adds in the same way that men ’s contributions do .
Recently we heard a senior male developer comment , “ [ We look for ] strong leadership in practice … ”
In fact , he may hold high value for male - oriented practice leadership , such as thought leadership expressed through strenuously defending ideas that matter in blogs , writing and promoting books to assert thought leadership , or aggressively , even confrontationally , protecting high standards of craftsmanship .
This exists o the extent that some software communities have asked themselves the question , “ Why are we so mean ? ”
The developer and his colleagues may overlook or not see the value in other kinds of practice leadership , like being the organizational glue that holds conference planning teams together or co-authoring articles with a variety of colleagues — a different kind of servant leadership for the practice area .
In addition , members of male - dominated professions like software development , may consciously or unconsciously objectify female colleagues in ways that cross lines of courtesy and diminish the chance for effective work relationship .
This can lead to extreme examples like the web - based attacks on women bloggers or on women who dared to speak out against a conference keynote that relegated women to body parts .
The very existence of such situations can color interactions between male and female team members , so that women work in a “ field ” of hyper - vigilance not experienced by their male colleagues .
Efforts at keeping effective teams together will benefit from a broader understanding of gender intelligence among leaders and team members .
In addition , gender intelligence provides one more set of skills to increase the flow of communication and feedback – the lifeblood of Agile projects .
So , how are our brains different ?
Significant differences exist between male and female brains in three areas .
These are in actual structures of the brain , in the amount of neural blood flow , and in brain chemistry .
Here are some of the key findings about the ways in which men and women ’s brains differ :
IQ tests of general intelligence show no overall difference … the difference shows up in different kinds of intelligence .
Male brains show frequent rest periods i.e. , “ not thinking about anything ” .
This happens many times a day .
Women ’s brains do not do this except during sleep .
Women often interpret this difference incorrectly as “ withholding ” behavior or a desire not to share .
Male brains have 6.5X more gray matter .
Gray matter serves as information processing centers .
This localization drives focus , focus , focus .
Females have 10 x the amount of white matter , contributing to connectivity between the information centers , permitting more multi-tasking , more language facility , and faster emotional “ processing ” .
Males have more M ganglion in the retina allowing men to perceive objects moving in space more easily .
Women have more P ganglion allowing them to see color and fine detail .
The hippocampus in men is less active , contributing to less linkage between memory and the emotional / word centers of the brain .
Men will often not recall emotional discussions ( positive or negative ones ) whereas women will often have detailed recall .
The amygdala in men tends to be larger .
When angry , the verbal circuits in men tend to shut down with the amygdala driving towards more physical expression of the emotion rather than the verbal processing exhibited by females .
Men have 20X more testosterone and also have vasopressin .
Both decrease interest in talking and increase aggression , need for social power , competitiveness , and territoriality .
These hormones were essential in an agrarian society for successful hunting .
Testosterone rises and dips during the day , generally peaking at roughly 9 - 11 AM .
Some research studies of British financial traders have shown that the riskiest trades tend to occur during that time period .
Women have more oxytocin , sometimes called the “ tend and befriend ” hormone .
Oxytocin promotes the personal bonding useful for building community and raising children , which are inherently social tasks performed over extended periods of time .
In women ’s brains , language tends to occur in both the right and left hemispheres , whereas in men language tends to occur only in the left .
If you account for writing , speaking , and reading , women use significantly more words in a day than men .
The cerebellum in men tends to be larger than in a female brain .
The cerebellum is an action and physical movement center , contributing to the male ’s tendency to action and physicality .
Women have 20 % more blood flow throughout the brain .
In the limbic system , one of the consequences of this increased blood flow is that women are constantly assessing and reassessing context as well as facial expressions , tone of voice , etc .
Disorders that inhibit people from picking up on social nuance such as autism and Asperger ’s Syndrome are roughly 8X more common in males .
Baby girls have as much estrogen in the brain as an adult woman .
Estrogen is such a potent neurotransmitter that in the first three months of life , a baby girl increases eye contact and facial gazing skills 400 % more than boys .
This ability to read faces is an advantage females maintain over males throughout life .
LouAnn Brizendine , author of The Female Brain , refers to the female brain as “ a machine built for connection ” in part due to this ability .
Do we have to be A or B ?
Actually , one in seven men and one in five women have what we call “ bridge brains ” .
These are people who have somewhat more of the other sex ’s features in terms of their brain profile .
A bridge brain man for example might take fewer physical risks than many of his peers , he might avoid a highly competitive type of profession , he might be drawn to less aggressive types of sports , etc .
Cognitive science tells us the brain is capable of change via focus or what David Rock and Jeffrey Schwartz in their work on the neuroscience of leadership call “ attention density ” .
However , while the topic of plasticity in the brain has received a lot of attention recently , some aspects of brain functioning are not as amenable to change because they are hardwired .
Nowhere is this truer than in gender - based brain differences .
Nurture matters but it does not trump nature .
It ’s more useful to think in terms of the areas of the brain that have high versus low plasticity .
An example of high plasticity would be the number of languages you can learn to speak .
An example of low plasticity is the fact that women have more prolactin , which produces larger tear glands and in turn , more tears .
Organizational Implications
Once people understand some of the basic differences , they tend to look at everyday situations in organizations somewhat differently .
Women ( and some men ) who use a lot of words may become more attuned to that “ glazed - over ” look from men they are speaking to who think they have already gotten the point .
Men may begin to appreciate how women use their relational skills to build consensus and mend fences after controversy .
As an example , take a very difficult meeting between an architect and a lead developer that becomes quite heated .
The stress of conflict causes cortisol levels to rise , producing more testosterone in males and more aggressive , dominant behavior .
In females , the rise in cortisol produces more oxytocin , leading to more harmony - seeking behavior .
A “ winning ” strategy where both meeting participants feel good about the final decision will provide the best outcome , even if it takes longer to get there .
Managers , coaches and team members who understand some of the basic brain differences can adapt their style of interaction with members of the opposite sex as appropriate .
Let ’s say a female Agile coach has a very angry male developer in her office .
He is totally frustrated with other members of his team .
If the coach reacts the way a woman is more likely to react to another woman saying , “ I can see how frustrated you are .
Let ’s go get some coffee and tell me how you ’re feeling … , ” we should n’t be surprised if the fellow gets really upset and even more frustrated .
Instead , the “ gender intelligent ” female coach could offer action steps to the male developer like , “ Let ’s make a list of the things you ’ve already tried , then generate some alternatives you can implement right away ” .
Perhaps subsequently , the coach can pursue the developer ’s “ feelings ” about the situation .
However , not head on .
She could use a more effective approach like asking a question such as , “ What do you think is happening in the organization now that might be driving this behavior on the team ? ”
Leadership Implications
Another critical aspect of understanding brain differences is to understand that men and women tend to embody leadership somewhat differently .
While at the very highest levels of organization life , the social intelligence needed for outstanding leadership shows no difference by gender , in the general population and lower organization levels there do appear to be some differences in the ways men and women behave in leadership roles .
Recognizing these differences helps us to broaden , not narrow , the pool of prospective talent .
Simply put , we can summarize these differences as :
Male leaders tend to :
Bond in short bursts of connection
Downplay emotion
Focus on pattern thinking
Promote risk - taking & independence
Female leaders tend to :
Bond via extended conversations
Display more “ hands - on ” connection
Emphasize complex , multitasking activities
Look for methods of direct empathy
Be more willing to relinquish independence for “ interdependence ”
Summary
While biology is n’t destiny , we should not be afraid to acknowledge that there are influences on the brain that come from our gender as “ males ” or “ females ” .
Admitting this does not have to lead to inequality or to inequity .
Instead , we can use brain science to improve relationships and communication .
Understanding these areas of difference without stereotyping can enhance the ways we manage conflict , negotiate , do sales , run meetings , and lead and coach teams .
It can help us to build healthier environments where men and women can be authentically who they are and contribute their best .

[ Update ] Libertarian GOP Candidate Raises More Than $ 500,000 With Ron Paul - Endorsed ‘ Moneybomb ’
Created : August 07 , 2009 15:36 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
[ UPDATE : I misunderstood the parameters of this fundraiser , and over - stated how much was raised .
It 's been corrected . ]
Peter Schiff , the libertarian economist and investor who ’s launched a dark - horse bid for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , is raking in cash from a Ron Paul - endorsed , 2007 - style “ moneybomb . ”
As of 3:30 , Schiff supporters had raised more than $ 100,000 today for the candidate at Schiffathon.com , giving him more than $ 550,000 in campaign cash since entering the race in mid-July with the aim of raking in $ 750,000 by day ’s end .
By comparison , former Rep. Rob Simmons ( R - Conn . ) , the front - runner for the GOP nomination , raised $ 753,000 from April through June .
Earlier today Ron Paul emailed his Campaign for Liberty list with a special request to make a donation .
The full email :
Dear Supporter ,
Our good friend in Liberty , Peter Schiff , is planning a run for Senate in Connecticut against Chris Dodd .
The grassroots across the country are organizing a money bomb for him today to raise money and send a powerful message to the political elites that freedom is popular and that Liberty can .
Our contry needs Peter Schiff in Washington , and you can help today .
Please go to www.Schiffathon.com right now and make a contribution .
Together , we can help make history .
In Liberty ,
Ron Paul
This is an awfully good sign for Rand Paul , the Texas congressman ’s son , who is running for Senate in Kentucky .

Über die Schwierigkeiten der internationalen Kommunikation
Was ist peinlicher ?
Ein vielleicht - Außenminister mit lübkeesken Englischkenntnissen ?
Oder ein Auslandskorrespondent , der sich nicht der Sprache seines Gastlandes bedienen kann oder mag ?
Die Antwort ist eine Frage der Perspektive .
Der aufgeklärte Bürger , der von einem solchen Minister vertreten werden soll , ist sicherlich vor allem durch den Politiker peinlich berührt .
In einem zusammenwachsenden Europa , das de facto schon fast ein Bundesstaat ist , sollten doch zumindest die Regierenden in der Lage sein , miteinander ohne Dolmetscher zu kommunizieren .
Aus der Sicht des Medienkonsumenten fragt sich allerdings , was das für ein Journalist ist , der da aus Deutschland berichten soll ?
Unter den Auslandskorrespondenten mag er eher eine Ausnahme sein .
Vielleicht war er nur für die Wahlen eingeflogen , was nicht für den Sender spricht , aber einiges über den sich ausbreitenden Fast - Food - Journalismus verrät , der scheinbar nicht einmal vor einer Institution wie BBC Halt macht .
Allerdings ist die Mentalität , die sich dahinter verbirgt , keine neue .
Hierzulande gab es auch schon zu Zeiten , als es im Medienbetrieb noch gemächlicher und scheinbar seriöser zuging , Bestseller schreibende " Nahost - Experten " , die kein Wort Arabisch sprachen .
Und wenn deutsche Journalisten Vertreter der Bundesregierung zu internationalen Konferenzen wie etwa den UN - Klimagipfeln begleiten , dann sitzen sie dort vor allem in Pressekonferenzen der deutschen Regierung herum , die natürlich auf Deutsch abgehalten werden .
Auf die Idee , auch einmal bei Vertretern der afrikanischen Staaten oder denen anderer Entwicklungsländer vorbeizuschauen , kommen sie hingegen kaum .
Die deutschen Journalisten bilden damit leider keine Ausnahme , sondern entsprechen dem Durchschnitt .
Regierungspressekonferenzen werden bei solchen Gelegenheiten meist in den Landessprachen abgehalten – erfreuliche Ausnahmen bilden verschiedene asiatische Länder , darunter China – , sodass die Chancen für einen Austausch beschränkt sind .
Entsprechend findet sich in den Medien dann vor allem die Sicht der jeweiligen Regierungen inklusive deren Interpretation der Positionen der anderen Staaten .
Für die Bildung einer der realen Globalisierung entsprechenden Welt - oder auch nur EU - Gesellschaft sind das suboptimale Bedingungen .
Was folgt aus all dem ?
Zeit für eine wirkliche , für alle akzeptable Weltsprache ?
Vielleicht Malaiisch , das durch seine Einfachheit besticht ?

Unfortunately , I have to get out of the Miniatures Wargaming hobby .
Well , I 'll just leave it at that .

Scenic Magnetic Base
This weeks budget is going to be used to buy materials for a scenic magnetic display base .
There will also be plenty of material left over for terrain making in the future .
Most of the materials needed are self explanatory and can be bought at your local DIY store ( Home Depot or Lowe's . )
The first thing we need is pink or blue insulation foam .
Not just any foam , but extruded polystyrene .
This foam is very dense and not like the foam you find at hobby stores used for floral arrangements .
The blue type is made by DOW and the pink is made by Owens Corning .
This stuff can be difficult to find depending on where you live , I 've heard it 's almost impossible to find in California .
Luckily , in my neck of the woods , Lowe 's sells the blue stuff and Home Depot sells the pink .
It 's sold in 4 'x8 ' sheets , similar to plywood and can be found in the building materials section near the plywood in both stores .
I bought two sheets , one 2 " thick and one 1/2 " thick for $ 40 .
Next we 'll need something to cut the foam .
Actually , two items will be needed , a keyhole saw and a hot - wire cutter .
The hot - wire cutter cuts through the foam like a hot knife through butter and leaves a nice smooth cut .
However , due to it 's shape it's hard to cut a large piece of foam off the sheet with it .
To cut a chunk off the sheet , use the keyhole saw , cut it about 1/8 " bigger than you want off the sheet .
Then , using the hot - wire cutter , cut off the 1/8 " for a nice smooth cut .
The hot - wire cutter can be purchased at a big chain hobby store .
I got both the saw and cutter for $ 15 .
The rest of materials are as follows :
Wood Filler - $ 5
Wood Glue - $ 3
Foam Board - $ 6
1 " and 1 1/2 " Zinc plated washers - $ 6
1/4 " Dia x 3/32 " Thick NdFeB Disc Magnets ( Model # D094B at Amazing Magnets ) - $ 12
Flat Black Spray Paint - $ 4
Hot Glue Gun and Glue Sticks - $ 8
Styrene Sheets ( Plasticard ) - $ 7
This will leave plenty of materials to build a lot of terrain as well as a scenic base .
Project 1 - Magnetic Display Base
This project came out of No Quarter Magazine # 5 .
Your best bet is to get a copy of NQ # 5 if you can , but here are the very basic steps .
Cut out a block of 2 " foam big enough for your army .
Cut out smaller pieces of foam to create tiers .
Cut out foam board to match your base and tiers .
Cut out circles for where your model bases will go .
Glue all the pieces together .
Glue zinc plated washers inside of circles .
( Do n't forget to glue the magnets to your models base . )
Fill in all cracks with wood filler .
Place any rocks or other scenic items .
Splotch on a mix of wood filler and water , should be like mud .
Glue sand to each tier level .
Cut and glue plasticard around the outside of the bottom base .
Spray paint flat black .
( I 'm at this point so far )
Paint the base how you want and add static grass or any other scenery you like .
Project # 2 - Painting Legion of Everblight Hordes Army
As you can see above I 'm still working on it .
I decided to go with a different color scheme than normal for Everblight .
I 'm going with red / orange looking dragons and a dark color ( mechrite red / chaos black / liche purple 1:1:1 mix ) for the spines and elf armor .
It is similar to the bottom dragon pictured over here .
Project # 3 - Chaos Space Marines
Last but not least , I have n't forgotten about 40 k .
I 'm still working on my CSM squad .
I 'm painting them in a Purge color scheme .
I still need to highlight the green armor , then hit all the metallic bits .
I 'm still trying to figure out how I want to highlight the black armor .
It will probably be gray with a slight touch of green .
That 's it for now .
The total budget this week was $ 106 , looks like we went over a bit .
But , at least we have all the basics to build some terrain , as well as plenty of material left over .
There 's still a lot of work to be done ...

Clear Coat Finish , Modeling Putty and Sculpting Tool
At this point there 's only a few more things needed to complete the basics of painting and modeling supplies .
Really , a couple of these things may not be necessary at this point .
The modeling putty and sculpting tool may not be needed until you get some metal models .
Clear Coat Finish
You will really want to put a clear coat on your models if you plan on playing games with them .
A clear coat will protect your models and the paint job .
Testor 's Dullcote and Citadel Matte Varnish are a couple sprays you can use as a clear coat to finish off your models .
These two products I mentioned are matte , meaning they wo n't leave a shiny appearance .
If you want a particular part of your model to have a shiny appearance I 'd recommend picking up a bottle of gloss varnish and use a brush to apply it to the particular part after you have sprayed it with the matte varnish .
Most of the paint producers , Citadel , Vallejo , etc. make a gloss brush on varnish .
I do n't have a lot of experience with the two sprays above , but after doing a little reading on these items it seems the Citadel brand Matte Varnish spray is n't that good .
I picked up a bottle of Testor 's Dullcote for $ 4 .
This particular product is no longer available in Europe due to the EU banning a certain chemical that is used in it 's production .
I 've also heard that Krylon makes a good spray varnish and is probably the cheapest .
You can find it at most home improvement stores , but I think it 's only available in North America .
Modeling Putty and Sculpting Tool
Modeling putty , also called " green stuff , " comes as two separate strips of putty , a blue strip and a yellow strip .
Once the two are combined the magic begins to work , it turns green and begins to harden .
It takes about two hours to completely harden , which means you have two hours to do with it what you want .
It 's mostly used to fill in gaps on metal models , but you can sculpt a complete model out of the stuff .
It 's packaged and sold by GW for $ 8 for a small amount .
You can also get about four times the amount GW sells from Gale Force Nine for $ 18 .
I bought a package of GF9 putty .
A sculpting tool is used to spread and manipulate the modeling putty .
This keeps from leaving fingerprints and helps smooth the putty out .
GW sells a tool for $ 6 , GF9 sells a 3 piece tool set for $ 12 , and if you 're really into sculpting you can get this nice 12 piece set pretty cheap .
I picked up the Citadel tool , because that 's all I could find in my area .
You can check out this article for tips and tricks using green stuff and a sculpting tool .
Odds and Ends
You may also want to pick up a few more things for your work space such as shelving .
I had a local carpenter put together a simple shelf out of some scrap wood he had lying around .
It was only $ 6 , but something you could easily do if you have the tools yourself .
I also bought a couple of flatware trays at a flea market for $ 5 .
I had originally intended to store my paint on them , but that was before I decided to go with Vallejo paints , which did n't fit .
However , I will use it to put my infantry size models on it for display .
I picked up a cheap cork board as well for $ 10 .
I put a color wheel , mixing charts , and a Citadel to Vallejo equivalency chart on mine .
You could also use it for inspiration by putting pictures from magazines or the internet on there .
That does it for this budget , it came to $ 49 .
That pretty much does it for buying painting and modeling supplies , from here on out you will just need to replenish what you have or maybe pick up a few new colors of paint .
There will still be more budgets coming , we still have models to buy as well as gaming accessories .
A Note
As you can see , I changed the name of my blog from Warhammer 40 k on a Budget to Wargaming on a Budget .
The reason is , I 'm branching out .
It 's going to take me a while to buy all the models to make my 40 k army , but I 'm itching to play something .
I 've been checking out another game recently , Warmachine / Hordes by Privateer Press .
From what I 've seen it 's a fun game and pretty cheap to get into .
Most games are 500 point games , you can get a battle box of 350 points for only $ 50 and then build to 500 points for less than $ 100 total .
I had some credit at a game store I used to frequent and used that to buy a Legion of Everblight Hordes army .
The local store is starting up a WM / Hordes league next Tuesday that I hope to get in on .
I will try to get some pics up of those models as well as my Chaos Space Marine squad that 's about half way done .
Until then ...

SUICIDE , proclaimed Albert Camus in “ The Myth of Sisyphus ” , is the only serious philosophical problem .
In France at the moment it is also a serious management problem .
A spate of attempted and successful suicides at France Telecom — many of them explicitly prompted by troubles at work — has sparked a national debate about life in the modern corporation .
One man stabbed himself in the middle of a meeting ( he survived ) .
A woman leapt from a fourth - floor office window after sending a suicidal e-mail to her father : “ I have decided to kill myself tonight … I can't take the new reorganisation . ”
In all , 24 of the firm 's employees have taken their own lives since early 2008 — and this grisly tally follows similar episodes at other pillars of French industry including Renault , Peugeot and EDF ( see article ) .
There are some parochial reasons for this melancholy trend .
France Telecom is making the difficult transition from state monopoly to multinational company .
It has shed 22,000 jobs since 2006 , but two - thirds of the remaining workers enjoy civil - service - like job - security .
This is forcing it to pursue a toxic strategy : teaching old civil servants new tricks while at the same time putting new hires on short - term contracts .
Yet the problem is not confined to France .
America 's Bureau of Labour Statistics calculates that work - related suicides increased by 28 % between 2007 and 2008 , although the rate is lower than in Europe .
And suicide is only the tip of an iceberg of work - related unhappiness .
A survey by the Centre for Work - Life Policy , an American consultancy , found that between June 2007 and December 2008 the proportion of employees who professed loyalty to their employers slumped from 95 % to 39 % ; the number voicing trust in them fell from 79 % to 22 % .
A more recent survey by DDI , another American consultancy , found that more than half of respondents described their job as “ stagnant ” , meaning that they had nothing interesting to do and little hope of promotion .
Half of these “ stagnators ” planned to look for another job as soon as the economy improved .
People are both clinging on to their current jobs , however much they dislike them , and dreaming of moving when the economy improves .
This is taking a toll on both short - term productivity and long - term competitiveness : the people most likely to move when things look up are high - flyers who feel that their talents are being ignored .
The most obvious reason for the rise in unhappiness is the recession , which is destroying jobs at a startling rate and spreading anxiety throughout the workforce .
But the recession is also highlighting longer - term problems .
Unhappiness seems to be particularly common in car companies , which suffer from global overcapacity , and telecoms companies , which are being buffeted by a technological revolution .
In a survey of its workers in 2008 , France Telecom found that two - thirds of them reported being “ stressed out ” and a sixth reported being in “ distress ” .
A second source of misery is the drive to improve productivity , which is typically accompanied by an obsession with measuring performance .
Giant retailers use “ workforce management ” software to monitor how many seconds it takes to scan the goods in a grocery cart , and then reward the most diligent workers with prime working hours .
The public sector , particularly in Britain , is awash with inspectorates and performance targets .
Taylorism , which Charlie Chaplin lampooned so memorably in “ Modern Times ” , has spread from the industrial to the post - industrial economy .
In Japan some firms even monitor whether their employees smile frequently enough at customers .
A more subtle problem lies in the mixed messages that companies send about loyalty and commitment .
Many firms — particularly successful ones — demand extraordinary dedication from their employees .
( Microsoft , according to an old joke , offers flexitime : “ You can work any 18 - hour shift that you want . ” )
Some provide perks that are intended to make the office feel like a second home .
But companies also reserve the right to trim their workforce at the first sign of trouble .
Most employees understand that their firms do not feel much responsibility to protect jobs .
But they nevertheless find it wrenching to leave a post that has consumed so much of their lives .
Engineering joy
Can anything be done about this epidemic of unhappiness ?
There are some people , particularly in Europe , who think that it strengthens the case for expanding workers ' rights .
But doing so will not end the upheaval wrought by technological innovation in the telecoms sector or overcapacity in the car industry .
And the situation in France Telecom was exacerbated by the fact that so many workers were unsackable .
The solution to the problem , in so far as there is one , lies in the hands of managers and workers rather than governments .
Companies need to do more than pay lip service to the human side of management .
They also need to learn from the well - documented mistakes of others ( France Telecom has belatedly hired Technologia , a consultancy which helped Renault with its suicide problem ) .
Bob Sutton of Stanford University argues that companies need to do as much as possible to come clean with workers , even if that means confirming bad news .
He also warns that bosses need to be careful about the signals they send : in times of great stress ill thought - out turns of phrase can lead to a frenzy of anxiety and speculation .
As for the workers , the habit of battening down the hatches , which so irritates many companies , may be a sensible response to economic turmoil .
In the longer term workers can take comfort from the fact that history may be on their side : in the rich world , low birth rates , an impending surge in retirements and caps on immigration could reduce the number of people of working age by 20 - 40 % .
Today 's unhappy workers may one day be able to exercise the ultimate revenge , by taking their services elsewhere .

A while ago I wrote a post called 10 free dates that your wife will love that got a lot of attention .
Since these days so many people are looking for cheap date ideas that are actually fun , I decided to create a little list of a few .
Just as a disclaimer upfront , some of these are cheaper than others and some of them are more fun than others .
I am sure you will find some of the date ideas to be boring , but know that someone else is reading that same idea and thinking how fun it sounds .
So , hopefully you will be able to find a few to get you started .
As always feel free to add your own fun date ideas to the comments below .
Go Shopping
1. Thrift - store marathon
Basically you map out a bunch of thrift stores in your area and visit each one and look for bargains .
This is really fun when you have a specific treasure you have in mind .
For more detail check out the thrift store shopping tips article from a few months ago .
2. Garage sale shopping
Similar to the thrift - store marathon , you just spend a couple hours hitting up garage sales .
Set a $ 10 budget and see who can find the best treasure .
3. Visit Display Homes
I always love visiting new display homes and getting ideas for the next move !
4. Test Drive
Visit car dealerships and test drive some of your favorite cars .
Stay Inside
5. Movie Night
Head over to the library to pick up free movies for a movie marathon ( or find some free movies online ) .
For ideas , find some classics that you have n’t seen from the top 100 movies of all - time .
Complete it with a blanket , popcorn , and your favorite beverages .
6. Get Cooking
One of you make the other ’s favorite meal , and the other one make the other ’s favorite dessert .
Then enjoy them both together .
7. Re-arrange !
Give the rooms in your house a fresh look by re-arranging the furniture in each of the rooms in your house .
Go Outside
8 . See the great outdoors
Head over to backpacker.com and find a great hiking trail near you .
This is a great outdoor date that often facilitates great conversation .
9. Biking
If you already have them , you can just start riding .
If you do n’t many places rent them by the hour .
10 . Stargazing
If it is a cloudless night , you could head to the library and find some astronomy books .
Find out which constellations are showing and look for them in the sky .
Grab a cozy blanket and enjoy laying under the stars together .
11 . Got snow ?
Go pick up a couple sleds and ride the slopes to your hearts ’ content .
Go Somewhere
12 . Sip coffee together
Go to a local coffee shop and sip and converse .
For whatever reason my wife and I tend to have great conversations while we are sitting in coffee shops .
13 . Roller - skating
I have n’t done this in probably 20 years , this would definitely be a fun date !
14 . Ice-skating
How about ice - skating ?
Bonus :
Find an outdoor rink !
15 . Bowling
Make it more fun by changing the rules .
16 . Driving range
This can be particularly fun if you are terrible golfers .
Most driving ranges have clubs you can use if you do n’t have any .
17 .
Have a photo shoot
Grab your phone or point and shoot digital camera and start driving .
Find interesting places and take pictures of each other .

Chandler , an open - source personal information manager ( PIM ) , has reached its first public release milestone , version 0.6 , and is now available for download .
Chandler is the brainchild of Andy Hertzfeld , the first programmer hired by Steve Jobs to work in the Macintosh System Group .
Hertzfeld was responsible for writing much of the user interface and system code for what would become Mac System 1.0 in 1984 , and although he left Apple shortly afterwards , he went on to write the code for the Switcher , the Mac 's first task - switching utility , on contract .
After his Apple experience , he co-founded three companies : Radius , which made monitors and peripherals for the Mac market ; General Magic , which made handheld digital assistants ; and Eazel , which wrote open - source software and developed the Nautilus file manager that is still used in the GNOME desktop environment today .
Eazel made a big splash in the heady days of the dotcom boom , but it failed to secure its second round of investment funding and the company went bankrupt in May 2001 .
Not willing to give up on the idea of open - source application development , Andy joined the Open Source Applications Foundation ( OSAF ) as a volunteer and one of its earliest contributors .
The OSAF was founded by Mitch Kapor , the creator of Lotus , in the summer of 2001 .
It received financial contributions from Kapor himself ( US$ 5 million ) , the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation ( US $ 1.5 million ) and the Common Solutions Group ( US $ 1.25 million )
All this money has allowed the Chandler project , the prototype of which was written by Hertzfeld , to grow into a large project with as many as 23 full - time programmers working on it .
Chandler , which used to be called Vista when it was still a prototype but has grown much larger in scope , aims to do for PIMs and calendaring applications what Firefox did for web browsers .
Available for Windows ( tested only with XP ) , OSX and Linux , the application binary is a 60 MB download ( the Linux binary comes bundled as an RPM and is only 23 MB ) .
The user interface bears more than a slight resemblance to Apple 's own iCal product , with each task on the calendar highlighted with a rounded , colorful overlay .
As to be expected , there are significant gaps in functionality in the 0.6 product , and a few rough edges with the user interface .
It was easy to create new events in the calendar by dragging and dropping , but it was not immediately obvious how to create new categories of event that are represented by different colors , which is a simple process in iCal .
However , the external resemblance to iCal belies the internal flexibility of the program .
It is designed as a collaboration tool , where users in a workgroup can share their calendars and appointments on a central server .
The development goal is to have a product that can duplicate much of the calendaring functionality of Microsoft Exchange in small workgroups , academic collaboration and even corporate environments .
Already , it seems slightly more featured than Sunbird , the standalone open - source calendaring application that is part of the Mozilla suite .
However , there are still many missing pieces to the puzzle .
There is a mail function included in Chandler , but so far it is extremely rudimentary and only works for people in the Chandler workgroup , although the design goals are to be a fully - fledged IMAP and SMTP email client .
Will this program develop into a legitimate Exchange competitor ?
At present it seems unlikely , but so was the formation of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 and the Macintosh when those projects first started .
