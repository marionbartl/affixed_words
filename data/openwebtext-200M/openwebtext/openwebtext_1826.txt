In what animal welfare advocates are describing as a “ historic advance , ” Burger King , the world ’s second - largest hamburger chain , said yesterday that it would begin buying eggs and pork from suppliers that did not confine their animals in cages and crates .
The company said that it would also favor suppliers of chickens that use gas , or “ controlled - atmospheric stunning , ” rather than electric shocks to knock birds unconscious before slaughter .
It is considered a more humane method , though only a handful of slaughterhouses use it .
The goal for the next few months , Burger King said is for 2 percent of its eggs to be “ cage free , ” and for 10 percent of its pork to come from farms that allow sows to move around inside pens , rather than being confined to crates .
The company said those percentages would rise as more farmers shift to these methods and more competitively priced supplies become available .
The cage - free eggs and crate - free pork will cost more , although it is not clear how much because Burger King is still negotiating prices , Steven Grover , vice president for food safety , quality assurance and regulatory compliance , said .
Prices of food at the chain ’s restaurants will not be increased as a result .
A California company has figured out how to use two simple materials – water and salt – to create a solution that wipes out single - celled organisms , and which appears to speed healing of burns , wounds and diabetic ulcers .
The solution looks , smells and tastes like water , but carries an ion imbalance that makes short work of bacteria , viruses and even hard - to - kill spores .
Developed by Oculus Innovative Sciences in Petaluma , the super - oxygenated water is claimed to be as effective a disinfectant as chlorine bleach , but is harmless to people , animals and plants .
If accidentally ingested by a child , the likely impact is a bad case of clean teeth .
Oculus said the solution , called Microcyn , may prove effective in the fight against superbugs , crossover viruses like bird flu and Ebola , and bioterrorism threats such as anthrax .
The company has just been granted approval in the United States to test the solution in the treatment of wounds , and already has government approval in Europe , Canada and Mexico for diverse uses , from disinfectant to wound irrigation .
Doctors conducting trials in Mexico and India are recounting stories at international conferences of their surprise at another feature of the solution :
It speeds the healing of severe burns and diabetic ulcers .
According to Hoji Alimi , founder and president of Oculus , the ion-hungry water creates an osmotic potential that ruptures the cell walls of single - celled organisms , and out leaks the cell 's cytoplasm .
Because multicellular organisms – people , animals , plants – are tightly bound , the water is prevented from surrounding the cells , and there is no negative impact .
While super - oxygenated water is nothing new – Microcyn has its roots in efforts to decontaminate nuclear reactors ' cooling pipes , according to Alimi – it is typically effective for only a few hours after it is formulated .
To keep it handy , hospitals and labs must invest in extremely expensive machines costing $ 100,000 or more .
Oculus has developed a new formula with a shelf life of at least a year , which opens up an array of potential applications .
And unlike prior formulations of super - oxygenated water , Microcyn is pH-neutral , so it wo n't damage healthy tissue .
This has prompted successful experiments in the treatment of challenging wounds like diabetic ulcers .
Physicians in Mexico using Microcyn observed rapid healing of burns and ulcers that the body could not repair for a decade or more because of infections , said Dr. Andres Gutierrez , head of the cell - therapy unit at the National Institute of Rehabilitation in Mexico City and an adviser to Oculus .
" Mexico was early to obtain the technology and give regulatory approval , " he said .
" Doctors using the product noticed the horrific smell of diabetic wounds was gone . "
The smell came from bacteria .
Dr. Amar Pal Singh Suri of the Diabetic Foot Care Clinic in Delhi , India , began experimenting with Microcyn after learning of it last fall in Germany .
Trying it on a severe necrotic wound of a patient whose only remaining option was amputation , Suri said he was surprised to see rapid improvement and the growth of healthy skin tissue .
" I shifted my other patients onto Microcyn treatment and we are now treating more than 50 , with very good results , " said Suri .
India leads the world in diabetes , with 37 million people affected .
" Every year , diabetics in my country suffer a million foot or lower - leg amputations , " said Suri .
Personal tragedy aside , " saving a foot is a fourth the cost of amputation and an artificial limb , " he said .
Chronic wound care is a multibillion - dollar market worldwide .
The solution will be available to U.S. physicians in June , said Alimi .
Trials are being organized for preoperative disinfectant , dental applications and burn and diabetic treatments , he said .
The company is keen to explore other applications , like tools to combat bioterrorism and user - friendly antiseptics and disinfectants to battle superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics and vaccines .
Alimi says he 's giving serious thought to a misting device that could sterilize the air of hospital wards in the grip of epidemics .
The solution also might be used as a hospital hand wash – a user - friendly , non-caustic disinfectant would benefit patients if it enabled medical workers to wash their hands more often , he said .
Pointing to his computer screen , Maj. Gen. Timothy Ghormley sounds more like a Peace Corps volunteer showing off holiday photos than the shaven - headed US Marine entrusted with defeating Al Qaeda in East Africa .
" That 's what it 's about right there , " he says , stabbing his eyeglasses at the pictures of African children celebrating as water gushes from a new well .
" Look at those kids .
They 're gonna remember this .
In 25 years they 'll say , ' I remember the West - they were good . ' "
In 2002 , more than 1,500 US troops were sent to this former French colony in East Africa to hunt followers of Al Qaeda throughout the region .
Now , under General Ghormley , their mission has evolved to preempt the broader growth of Islamic militancy among the area 's largely Muslim population .
" We are trying to dry up the recruiting pool for Al Qaeda by showing people the way ahead .
We are doing this one village , one person at a time , " says Ghormley , commander of the joint task force based in Djibouti .
" We 're waging peace just as hard as we can . "
Previously East Africa has hosted an array of Islamic militant groups .
In 1998 , Al Qaeda bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , killing more than 220 people .
The group has also tried to shoot down an Israeli airliner in Mombasa , Kenya , and sink oil tankers and US navy vessels in the Red Sea .
Now many analysts worry that trouble is again brewing as rising poverty combines with the anti-Western ideologies of hard - line Islamic missionaries in a region already dogged by porous borders , plentiful weapons , and poor governance .
" There are n't actually that many groups or individuals involved , " says Matt Bryden , director of the Horn of Africa project for International Crisis Watch .
" But there 's a danger that if these groups are not contained it is just a matter of time before they strike at Western targets in Somalia or start reaching out to the region again . "
" Some of them did have links with Al Qaeda but for the most part there does n't seem to be an active Al Qaeda or even an Al Qaeda franchise , " says Mr. Bryden .
" But the US has discovered that there are actually much fewer targets than they expected . "
No targets but hearts and minds
Unable to find or strike at any visible Al Qaeda members , US forces based in Camp Lemonier - Djibouti's former French Foreign Legion base - have instead begun to work to tackle the factors that might contribute to the growth of extremism in the future .
Ghormley 's men have so far built more than 30 schools and 25 clinics , as well as new wells and bridges .
They are focusing particularly on the mainly Muslim areas close to the porous Somali border where poverty and dissatisfaction with pro-Western central governments might make many receptive to extremist teachings .
" Ungoverned spaces are vulnerable .
The forces of law and order do n't exist there , " says Lt. Col.
Richard Baillon , of Britain 's Parachute Regiment .
A small contingent of British troops are working with US forces in a coalition effort .
" The people in these areas are n't getting government support . "
Planners in Camp Lemonier say that their long - term strategy is to gradually move deeper into these poor and ungoverned areas .
" We 're not likely to go where we 're not wanted or where there 's open hostility , " says Baillon , tapping a wall - map like a schoolmaster .
" But it 's about pushing the boundaries of where we are wanted . "
The Coalition 's planners hope that by tackling localized dissatisfaction now , they can create long - term goodwill toward the US in the region .
" A lot of times when we first show up there 's a mixed reaction , " says Sgt. Richard Crandall of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion .
" One place we went to they considered the US to be warmongers .
But we built a school and when we left they said they considered us friends . "
The military is taking time to adapt to its new humanitarian mission too - and this means that there have been some mistakes made along the way .
For example , the task force 's military budget only covers the cost of constructing and renovating school buildings .
Before the schools can open , soldiers have to pester nongovernmental organizations , charities , and friends back home for donated textbooks .
In other cases there has been poor communication between the US and local people .
Some villages , thinking that the Americans could only build schools , requested a new school when they needed wells and bridges instead .
The mistake was realized too late .
Meanwhile , the US increasingly depends on local governments to use their cultural and linguistic knowledge to track and tackle Islamic extremists .
" The information sharing is not ideal ; not up to the point that we would like , " admits Nabeel Khoury , deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Sanaa , Yemen .
And although there are handfuls of up - armored Humvees parked alongside rusting French artillery pieces throughout Camp Lemonier , the US increasingly seeks to delegate its military operations .
" We 're doing military - to - military training with five countries in the region , " says Col. Doug Carroll , director of operations for the Horn of Africa task force .
The US has trained Yemeni special forces in counter - terrorism while officers from Mauritius and the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean have been taught how to train their own soldiers once they return home .
" In Ethiopia we 've taught border security , we 've taught basic counter - terrorism , what they call advanced map reading and also defensive operations , " says Carroll , who denies that the training will upset the region 's delicate balance of power .
" We 're not teaching them anything that would be applicable to the Ethiopian - Eritrean border war , " he says of the training of Ethiopian border guards , while also denying that US - trained troops have been used to crush recent uprisings in Yemen .
Somalia remains a clear blind spot
But although the lack of recent Al Qaeda attacks in the region points to the mission 's success so far , there remains a clear blind spot at the heart of the US deployment .
" It 's a bit of a paradox , " says Bryden .
" The threat that the US perceives in the region comes from Somalia , but that is the only place where they can't operate . "
Senior officers in Djibouti refuse to even discuss Somalia , although one officer privately admitted having contact with high - level members of the government of Somaliland - a breakaway republic in the north of the war - torn country that recently arrested one Al Qaeda team linked to extremist groups in Mogadishu .
" The US has had to develop a much more nuanced approach and it shows that they are dealing with the problem , " says Bryden .
" They 've had to discover the difference between terrorism and a domestic insurgency . "
As the US gradually increases its understanding of the region there is no sign of the mission winding down .
Instead , as more British troops also prepare to deploy to the region , the operation seems to have become entirely open - ended .
" It 's important that we share what we have to allow all nations to advance , " says General Ghormley .
" We did n't earn being born in America - the Good Lord put us there and with that came responsibility . "
An area five times larger than Iraq
Standing in his office , Ghormley , surrounded by maps where arrow - straight borders drawn by European colonialists cut across mountains , deserts , and complex ethnic groups , provides more than an echo of a Victorian soldier - missionary .
" You can win a heart and mind today and lose it tomorrow , " Ghormley continues .
" We see no spread of radical ideology .
We see a lot of people who would like it to spread . "
But with Camp Lemonier boasting less than 1 percent of the troops currently deployed in Iraq and responsible for an area five times larger , Ghormley is aware that there is a limit to what the US can achieve in the region .
" I could use more money , more people , but I 've got the resources I need to carry on , " he says , taking a last look at the pictures on his computer screen .
" They 're good people and it breaks your heart that you can't do more for them . "
DARK energy and dark matter , two of the greatest mysteries confronting physicists , may be two sides of the same coin .
A new and as yet undiscovered kind of star could explain both phenomena and , in turn , remove black holes from the lexicon of cosmology .
The audacious idea comes from George Chapline , a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , and Nobel laureate Robert Laughlin of Stanford University and their colleagues .
Last week at the 22nd Pacific Coast Gravity Meeting in Santa Barbara , California , Chapline suggested that the objects that till now have been thought of as black holes could …

cryptogon.com news – analysis – conspiracies
March 22nd , 2007
WARNING : The following is not a recommendation to buy , sell or hold any financial instrument .
Trading stocks , currencies and options involves serious risks .
For years , I ’ve kept this information to myself , waiting for a chance to look at it again more seriously and systematically .
Unfortunately , I do n’t really see myself being able to allocate the time to research this stuff further .
I know that several Cryptogon readers are traders and / or otherwise involved with the financial markets .
Others of you are good at writing software .
There are several neuroscientists out there and at least one rocket scientist - type guy or gal !
HA .
Seriously , it ’s true .
Three INTJs have written in , in response to the INTJ reference I made in a previous post .
These are the types of people who can nail this stuff to the wall , to the extent that it can be nailed to the wall .
I thought that some of you might take a look at this information and have the skills and tenacity to take it further than I was able to .
Maybe figure something out … and share it with the rest of us .
Anyway , here goes .
STOCKS : INSIDER CRIMES AND THE ACCUMULATION PHASE
From around 1998 to 2003 , I looked for a way out of having a day job through trading , stocks mostly .
I learned a lot of things the hard way , but at least I learned .
My goal was n’t to get rich .
All I wanted to do was make small profits consistently .
Fifty bucks a day was actually my goal .
I managed to do this , and orders of magnitude better , on occasion , for a while , but it was hard , time consuming and incredibly stressful .
Was trading ( intraday ) worth it ?
For me , not really , but it was better than showing up to some office .
Was it gambling ?
In a word , yes , but I did n’t know that at the time .
I thought that the tools and systems I used were working .
Actually , they were n’t working .
How did I know they were n’t really working ?
Because I started to lose money !
They had just appeared to be working .
I stopped trading as soon as I lost confidence in the tools .
( Maybe the tools actually worked for a while , but then stopped working ?
That ’s possible , I suppose , but not likely . )
I had always assumed the entire business of the markets to be a massive criminal enterprise that allowed public participation simply because it made a few people extremely wealthy .
But , I wondered , when do the fewest people make the most money in the shortest period of time ?
During gaps .
A gap is a sudden , violent change in the price of a stock , future , bond , etc .
Gaps are caused by some event that temporarily creates a state of disequilibrium in order flows .
Gaps on stocks started to draw my attention because I just knew that insiders ( and others ) were pre-positioning themselves to profit from those moves .
I noticed that , quite regularly , unknown , crappy little companies would go up 25 % , 50 % , 100 % , 200 % or more in a single session .
You see them almost every day on the top percent gainers board .
For years , I looked at those and shrugged .
“ Yep .
People hit the lotto too , ” I ’d say to myself .
I watched another one pop , then , finally , I thought : “ This is the scene of a crime for sure . ”
I ’m not talking about legal insider trading by corporate officers that the financial press follows .
I ’m talking about the mistresses of executives and $ 2000 per hour prostitutes who heard something over pillow talk , friends at country clubs who get a tip during the golfcart ride to the 18th hole , industrial espionage operators ( former spooks ) who have these idiots under surveillance , low level IT staff who read the executives ’ email , not for fun , but for profit , etc. etc .
The point is that LOTS of people who are n’t corporate insiders know the news before the market does .
They buy before the news comes out .
This happens every day .
Thousands of symbols .
Every couple of days at least one of them goes up by 25 % or more .
How would I go about finding them ?
Assume maximum criminal behavior and find stocks where the signal to noise ratio is very high .
I came up with a system where I doubled a few times ; I made nearly 3 x once .
No losses .
I could never bring myself to allocate large amounts of capital to hold overnight on these “ Risk of ruin ” bets because I did n’t believe this was really working , even when I was hitting .
( All stock bets are , in my opinion , risk of ruin . )
Was it luck each time ?
Possibly .
Whatever it was , here ’s what I did :
I looked for cheap stocks that were flatlining or trading in a narrow range near their 52 week lows .
Then I looked for increases in volume and churn .
Churn is increasing volume with prices staying flat , or increasing slightly .
Under churn , prices stay relatively flat because the buying is accompanied with selling to keep the price from running away .
There is , however , a net inflow of capital .
This is the critical part :
The activity had to be happening in the absence of any news .
I ’d read about Dow theory , so the minute I started to notice these volume increases , without news , it made sense .
What I was seeing was the accumulation phase on these stocks , where people with inside information were buying ahead of the good news .
I never looked at earnings .
The company ’s products or services did n’t matter .
All I was looking for was that very specific pattern .
The trick was finding stocks with a high enough signal to noise ratio to spot the criminal insider buying .
This nonsense happens on all stocks , I ’m sure , but it ’s too difficult to see most of the time .
That ’s why the flatliners and narrow rangers are nice .
I picked stocks near their 52 week lows because , well , for some reason they stopped there before .
Think of this as an up or out proposition .
Oh yeah , it could go to zero and you could lose your money .
Do n’t use stops on these bets .
These are all or nothing gambles .
Why ?
Because market makers will often drive down the price before the big move up .
These stocks are very simple to manipulate .
Just before a big move , they might run the stops , just under where you ’ve drawn your support line , to scoop up a bunch of shares at a discount .
( This just happened on one today , as a matter of fact . )
Double and triple bottoms are built on the skulls of people who thought there were being smart by setting stops down near a 52 week low .
If you ’re reckless enough to buy a crap company near a 52 week low and are worried about it dropping more , forget this method .
You ’ll get stopped out , and minutes , hours or days later , the thing could suddenly double .
Company bought out .
Drug approved .
Government contract awarded .
Whatever .
Why not wait for the fake dip before the big move up ?
Sometimes there is no dip at all .
Sometimes there is .
Again , nobody said it was going to be easy .
Why not use a screen that only looks for double bottoms AND a follow - on positive slope OBV on no news ?
* scratch whiskers *
Every time I think I ’ve beaten this crap to death , there ’s always another weird path to take .
I ’m no longer in a position to do 20 hour research binges on this stuff , but some of you young whipper snappers should try it .
The way to play this is with small bets on multiple setups with capital that you assume will be lost .
As soon as you get a pop on any of them , sell immediately into the “ dumb money ” players who show up to chase the news , which might just be some kind of criminal press release .
Do n’t try to parse the news .
Do n’t even look at it .
Get to battlestations .
Lock and load .
How much you take off the table is up to you .
I would typically dump it all in one shot .
But you might consider selling 1 / 2 or 3 / 4 of what you started with and set a trailing stop on the rest .
You might also draw a trend line connecting the bottoms of an on balance volume ( OBV ) study to better plan your exit .
Upward slope ?
Let it ride .
Cross down ?
Dump it .
I liked watching this on one and three minute charts .
You just need some way of seeing that more dumb money is flowing into the thing than insiders are pulling out .
There was no way to know what would happen an hour , a day or a week later .
Sometimes they would go higher or much higher , sometimes they would crash back down .
Once you get out , though , do n’t even think about looking at the thing again .
Spend your time looking for the next one , trading sideways , near its 52 week low , with anomalous volume on no news .
Ca n’t find any ?
Ask your significant other to duct tape your hands to the desk so you do n’t make any stupid , undisciplined trades .
Actually , if you have the time to dedicate to this type of work , you probably do n’t have a significant other , or a company has provided you with a padded room and just slides food and coffee under the door .
If you have access to Trade Station or some other scriptable tool , a screen could be written to automate the search .
[ I have no reciprocal relationship with the TradeStation Group . ]
FYI : TradeStation is not a toy .
It is the most sophisticated strategy testing and trading platform available to the public .
Any strategy can be coded and tested using that software .
When I was doing this , I was doing it manually , individually inspecting hundreds of charts .
A note on volume : Screen for stocks with an average daily volume of at least 25,000 shares .
Many crap stocks barely trade at all , so any activity will skew your volume studies and could give you false positives .
But if you see a dead one with volume picking up out of nowhere ( no news ) , with the price holding steady ( churn ) , keep an eye on it .
Read about OBV .
Then read about it again .
I was doing this on NASDAQ listed stocks in the $ 1 to $ 3 dollar range ; stocks colloquially referred to as dog food .
I do n’t see why this technique could n’t work on the serious pink sheet garbage penny stocks as well .
I mean , what ’s the difference between a $ 2.25 NASDAQ stock and a penny stock ?
About two bucks .
Another note on volume :
Your volume studies are the key to this .
If you can apply two moving averages to daily volume , that will spot the weirdness .
Make your long MA something like 13 periods and your short ( trigger ) MA something like 5 or 3 periods .
If you get a fast period MA cross on the volume , ON NO NEWS , that might be something .
You ’re looking for sustained , anomalous volume .
One day spikes may or may not be something .
There ’s no way to know on those .
But when that average daily volume starts breaking out , that ’s interesting .
Up sloping OBV on no news is interesting .
What period ?
Screen using daily closes .
There ’s no need to gear up for an intraday - style gun battle during the screening process .
( TR and I tried to do it in real time using TradeStation ’s incredible Radar , but we failed .
We could n’t filter the cranks from the real moves .
Our tools were finding real moves and cranks .
Sadly , for us , they looked the same in fog of war .
We progressed to the Magic Mystery Dot , which was very interesting and weird , but did n’t quite work .
It kinda worked , but I nearly pissed myself trading based on its signals . )
You can quietly sit back , look at the daily data and pick these out very carefully .
The criminals need to take their time on accumulation .
They ca n’t do it too fast or the price will go up , or smarty pants people with their volume studies on their radar screens might spot it .
The setups are usually slow and steady , they happen over days or weeks .
Once you ’re in , just set price alarms using some tool and do n’t think about them again .
Initially , set your alarms somewhere above the top of recent ranges that the stocks have been oscillating in , or just above the flatline if it ’s really just trading sideways .
If the price breaks out on no news , continue to hold ; this could just be a temporary crank that will fade fast .
If the breakout occurs on the news , dump it , even if you ’re only making cigarette butts and bottle caps .
A weak pop on news just means that there are n’t enough suckers willing to take the bait .
How do you know it ’s a weak pop ?
What ’s the slope like on your one and three minute OBV charts after the news ?
Flat to down ?
Buddy , you ’re juggling hand grenades with the pins pulled at that stage .
Also , because these moves may involve very serious criminal activity you want to get clear of the pig before the exchange halts trading and the SEC gets in on the act .
By the time the authorities are parsing the news and taking note of the order flow , you want to be outside in your hammock , sipping a cold beer .
Again , nobody said it was going to be easy .
Note :
The above strategy should work on the short side too , in theory , but I have only ever worked the long angle .
Why ?
To play this short , there will be more noise , you ’ll have to play with more expensive stocks and to not use stops when short could result in unthinkable disaster .
You could potentially lose more than your initial bet .
CURRENCIES : FOREX FUNNY MONEY
FOREX is the best pure gamble now , for intraday action , but you have to sit there for hours and just be able to react to momentum / panic moves on news .
FOREX is for people who have the temperament of a sniper .
Most of it is boring to the point of being unbearable .
Finally , unexpectedly , you ’ll get window of opportunity , lasting seconds , to take one shot .
That ’s FOREX .
I ’ve only used a realtime simulator for FOREX and never traded with real money .
I tried all of my old daytrading tricks ( multi period stochastics , MAs , Ichimoku , trend following , etc. ) and none of it seemed to work for me .
What looked good , though , was a straddle of USD / CHF and EUR / USD just before news .
USD / CHF and EUR / USD move in opposite directions almost all of the time .
Get in long ( or short - I do n’t think it matters ) on both sets of pairs , just before news .
Once scheduled economic news hits the market , there could be a violent reaction one way of the other .
Immediately dump the position that ’s losing and let the winning pair ride for some number of PIPs .
Were talking seconds to minutes .
Get out .
Turn off your computer .
You ’re done for the day .
FOREX is probably the best venue for news driven action .
You will make or lose the most money on FOREX .
It ’s easily the noisiest , whip sawing fake out thing I ’ve ever seen , but sometimes , those pairs just run and keep on running one way .
Outside of news , though , that thing is a crap shoot .
You can experiment with a decent real time trading platform at fxcm.com .
[ I have no reciprocal relationship with fxcm . ]
You just run the thing with a practice account that is loaded with 50,000 pretend dollars .
It ’s totally free .
OPTIONS RACKETS : EXPIRATION ANTICS
I actually wrote this as part of a comment .
I ’ll just reproduce it here .
I initially named the market maker , but I ’m removing it now .
It does n’t matter who it was .
Why ?
Well , that firm frightens me .
There ’s no way to know what they ’re capable of doing .
I ’ll just call them Big Firm .
One day , things were looking good long on Amazon .
We got a bit of a pullback during a multilane uptrend , lots of support .
I got in heavy , 1000 shares .
It wobbled around a bit , then the futures took off .
Up and away .
I thought , “ Wooo hoooo ! ” this is going to be a good one .
Buyers pouring in !
Wait .
What ’s this ?
Big Firm is on the ask .
HAHA Big Firm is up to his old tricks , that guy !
Not going to fool me !
* hands quivering at that point *
Futures rising .
The Nasdaq 100 is climbing .
It ’s ok .
It ’s ok .
Stand fast .
Stand fast .
( I was viewing the battlespace on three displays . )
Big Firm is selling AMZN .
He ’s keeping the lid on Amazon right now .
Is he just trying to front load shares for himself before the pop ???
What the ???
Actually , the price is dropping .
The support on the bid side , outside the spread , started to disappear on Level 2 .
“ F*ck this shit , man . ” I sent a sell limit order outside the spread .
( This is a way to jump the line that forms at the exits when the theater is on fire . )
I was lucky , someone took it at the market for a loss of only ten cents or $ 100 on that 1000 shares .
Seconds later , the long red candles started dripping down my multiperiod charts .
Time sales cascaded red with large block sales .
* my hair is standing on end even now remembering this , I nearly got decapitated on this one *
The idiots in the chat room spat out things like :
AMZN REVERSE IT SHORT !!!
WHAT THE HELL ??
HOLY CRAP
OMG
Etc .
Big Firm single handedly moved Amazon down nearly $ 2 in a couple of minutes , through hourly and daily supports .
Well , not single handedly .
They just used their deep pockets to frighten lots of traders into dumping .
And the move took on a life of its own .
I just sat back and watched it happen , in awe .
Why did They do it ?
Someone told the chatroom I was in that it was about options expiration , and that Big Firm had obviously bought a bunch of out of the money puts that were about to expire worthless .
But guess what ?
Instead of expiring worthless , Big Firm just drove the price of the stock down until those options were in the money !
I watched this happen .
Amazon did that move on its own , without follow through from the futures or other tier 1 stocks .
As usual , do n’t take my word for it :
Stock Price Clustering on Option Expiration Dates
This paper presents striking evidence that option trading changes the prices of underlying stocks .
In particular , we show that on expiration dates the closing prices of stocks with listed options cluster at option strike prices .
On each expiration date , the returns of optionable stocks are altered by an average of at least 16.5 basis points , which translates into aggregate market capitalization shifts on the order of $ 9 billion .
We provide evidence that hedge re-balancing by option market - makers and stock price manipulation by firm proprietary traders contribute to the clustering .
That was it for me .
I could think of better things to do than dog paddling in a shark tank .
But ….
Maybe this could be visualized in a way ( heat chart ) that would show where the largest clusters of out of the money options were sitting .
This would have to be a real time screen of the NASDAQ 100 .
( Forget it on smaller stocks . )
You ’re looking for stocks that have large pools of options that are out of the money and for stocks that begin to move toward those option clusters IN OPPOSITION TO THE FUTURES .
How do you play ?
If a large cluster of options is below the market price , the futures are rising , and the tier one stock is wobbling or starting to fall , buy puts somewhere down there .
If the large cluster of options is above the market price , the futures are dropping , and the stock price is wobbling or starting to rise , buy calls .
The fact that the stock starts moving toward those options in opposition to the futures shows you that a powerful market maker or two might be refusing to let their options expire worthless .
If you knew where the options cluster was , and , therefore , the motivation behind the bullshit crank of a move , I suppose you could play the stock directly .
Of the three dangerous trading schemes above , this last one would be the most difficult to program .
It might also be the most profitable .
Well , guys , that ’s it .

They Thought You'd Say This : Unlikely phrases from real phrasebooks
I 've always been fascinated by phrasebooks ; my parents like to tell the story of my trying to talk to an Italian couple in Syracuse at the age of seven , using nothing but Berlitz Italian .
Phrasebooks offer the seductive illusion of mastering a language at little cost — flip the pages and handle any situation , from booking a room to going on a date to setting a broken leg .
Mostly they are little marvels of pragmatic compression .
But for that very reason , I like to find the occasional oddity — sentences you can hardly conceive of ever using , little tidbits of inexplicability in an otherwise ruthlessly disciplined little work .
All the following sentences are culled from real phrasebooks .
( As opposed to a fake phrasebook . )

Call her the Awful Poo Lady , call her Dr Gillian McKeith PhD : she is an empire , a multi-millionaire , a phenomenon , a prime - time TV celebrity , a bestselling author .
She has her own range of foods and mysterious powders , she has pills to give you an erection , and her face is in every health food store in the country .
Scottish Conservative politicians want her to advise the government .
The Soil Association gave her a prize for educating the public .
And yet , to anyone who knows the slightest bit about science , this woman is a bad joke .
One of those angry nerds took her down this week .
A regular from my website badscience .
net - I can barely contain my pride - took McKeith to the Advertising Standards Authority , complaining about her using the title " doctor " on the basis of a qualification gained by correspondence course from a non-accredited American college .
He won .
She may have sidestepped the publication of a damning ASA draft adjudication at the last minute by accepting - " voluntarily " - not to call herself " doctor " in her advertising any more .
But would you know it , a copy of that draft adjudication has fallen into our laps , and it concludes that " the claim ' Dr ' was likely to mislead " .
The advert allegedly breached two clauses of the Committee of Advertising Practice code : " substantiation " and " truthfulness " .
Is it petty to take pleasure in this ?
No. McKeith is a menace to the public understanding of science .
She seems to misunderstand not nuances , but the most basic aspects of biology - things that a 14 - year - old could put her straight on .
She talks endlessly about chlorophyll , for example : how it 's " high in oxygen " and will " oxygenate your blood " - but chlorophyll will only make oxygen in the presence of light .
It 's dark in your intestines , and even if you stuck a searchlight up your bum to prove a point , you probably would n't absorb much oxygen in there , because you do n't have gills in your gut .
In fact , neither do fish .
In fact , forgive me , but I do n't think you really want oxygen up there , because methane fart gas mixed with oxygen is a potentially explosive combination .
Future generations will look back on this phenomenon with astonishment .
Channel 4 , let 's not forget , branded her very strongly , from the start , as a " clinical nutritionist " .
She was Dr Gillian McKeith PhD , appearing on television every week , interpreting blood tests , and examining patients who had earlier had irrigation equipment stuck right up into their rectums .
She was " Dr McKeith " , " the diet doctor " , giving diagnoses , talking knowledgeably about treatment , with complex scientific terminology , and all the authority her white coat and laboratory setting could muster .
So back to the science .
She says DNA is an anti-ageing constituent : if you " do not have enough RNA / DNA " , in fact , you " may ultimately age prematurely " .
Stress can deplete your DNA , but algae will increase it : and she reckons it 's only present in growing cells .
Is my semen growing ?
Is a virus growing ?
Is chicken liver pate growing ?
All of these contain plenty of DNA .
She says that " each sprouting seed is packed with the nutritional energy needed to create a full - grown , healthy plant " .
Does a banana plant have the same amount of calories as a banana seed ?
The ridiculousness is endless .
In fact , I do n't care what kind of squabbles McKeith wants to engage in over the technicalities of whether a non-accredited correspondence - course PhD from the US entitles you , by the strictest letter of the law , to call yourself " doctor " : to me , nobody can be said to have a meaningful qualification in any biology - related subject if they make the same kind of basic mistakes made by McKeith .
And the scholarliness of her work is a thing to behold : she produces lengthy documents that have an air of " referenciness " , with nice little superscript numbers , which talk about trials , and studies , and research , and papers ... but when you follow the numbers , and check the references , it 's shocking how often they are n't what she claimed them to be in the main body of the text .
Or they refer to funny little magazines and books , such as Delicious , Creative Living , Healthy Eating , and my favourite , Spiritual Nutrition and the Rainbow Diet , rather than proper academic journals .
She even does this in the book Miracle Superfood , which , we are told , is the published form of her PhD .
" In laboratory experiments with anaemic animals , red - blood cell counts have returned to normal within four or five days when chlorophyll was given , " she says .
Her reference for this experimental data is a magazine called Health Store News .
" In the heart , " she explains , " chlorophyll aids in the transmission of nerve impulses that control contraction . "
A statement that is referenced to the second issue of a magazine called Earthletter .
To me this is cargo cult science , as the great Professor Richard Feynman described Melanesian religious activities 30 years ago : " During the war they saw aeroplanes with lots of good materials , and they want the same thing to happen now .
So they 've arranged to make things like runways , to put fires along the sides of the runways , to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in , with two wooden pieces on his head as headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas - he's the controller - and they wait for the aeroplanes to land .
They 're doing everything right .
The form is perfect .
It looks exactly the way it looked before .
But it does n't work .
No aeroplanes land . "
McKeith 's pseudo - academic work is like the rituals of the cargo cult : the form is superficially right , the superscript numbers are there , the technical words are scattered about , she talks about research and trials and findings , but the substance is lacking .
I actually do n't find this bit very funny .
It makes me quite depressed to think about her , sitting up , perhaps alone , studiously and earnestly typing this stuff out .
One window into her world is the extraordinary way she responds to criticism : with legal threats and blatantly , outrageously misleading statements , emitted with such regularity that it 's reasonable to assume she will do the same thing with this current kerfuffle over her use of the title " doctor " .
So that you know how to approach the rebuttals to come , let 's look at McKeith 's rebuttals of the recent past .
Three months ago she was censured by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) for illegally selling a rather tragic range of herbal sex pills called Fast Formula Horny Goat Weed Complex , advertised as shown by a " controlled study " to promote sexual satisfaction , and sold with explicit medicinal claims .
She was ordered to remove the products from sale immediately .
She complied - the alternative would have been prosecution - but in response , McKeith 's website announced that the sex pills had been withdrawn because of " the new EU licensing laws regarding herbal products " .
She engaged in Europhobic banter with the Scottish Herald newspaper : " EU bureaucrats are clearly concerned that people in the UK are having too much good sex , " she explained .
Rubbish .
I contacted the MHRA , and they said : " This has nothing to do with new EU regulations .
The information on the McKeith website is incorrect . "
Was it a mistake ?
" Ms McKeith 's organisation had already been made aware of the requirements of medicines legislation in previous years ; there was no reason at all for all the products not to be compliant with the law . "
They go on .
" The Wild Pink Yam and Horny Goat Weed products marketed by McKeith Research Ltd were never legal for sale in the UK . "
Now , once would be unfortunate , but this is an enduring pattern .
When McKeith was first caught out on the ridiculous and erroneous claims of her CV - she claimed , for example , to have a PhD from the reputable American College of Nutrition - her representatives suggested that this was a mistake , made by a Spanish work experience kid , who posted the wrong CV .
Except the very same claim about the American College of Nutrition was also in one of her books from several years previously .
That 's a long work experience stint .
She even sneaked one into this very newspaper , during a profile on her : " Doubt has also been cast on the value of McKeith 's certified membership of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants , especially since Guardian journalist Ben Goldacre managed to buy the same membership online for his dead cat for $ 60 .
McKeith 's spokeswoman says of this membership : " Gillian has ' professional membership ' , which is membership designed for practising nutritional and dietary professionals , and is distinct from ' associate membership ' , which is open to all individuals .
To gain professional membership Gillian provided proof of her degree and three professional references . "
Well .
My dead cat Hettie is also a " certified professional member " of the AANC .
I have the certificate hanging in my loo .
Perhaps it did n't even occur to the journalist that McKeith could be wrong .
More likely , of course , in the tradition of nervous journalists , I suspect she was hurried , on deadline , and felt she had to get McKeith 's " right of reply " in , even if it cast doubts on - I 'll admit my beef here - my own hard - won investigative revelations about my dead cat .
I mean , I do n't sign my dead cat up to bogus professional organisations for the good of my health , you know .
But those who criticise McKeith have reason to worry .
McKeith goes after people , and nastily .
She has a libel case against the Sun over comments they made in 2004 that has still not seen much movement .
But the Sun is a large , wealthy institution , and it can protect itself with a large and well - remunerated legal team .
Others can't .
A charming but - forgive me - obscure blogger called PhDiva made some relatively innocent comments about nutritionists , mentioning McKeith , and received a letter threatening costly legal action from Atkins Solicitors , " the reputation and brand - management specialists " .
Google received a threatening legal letter simply for linking to - forgive me - a fairly obscure webpage on McKeith .
She has also made legal threats to a fantastically funny website called Eclectech for hosting a silly animation of McKeith singing a silly song , at around the time she was on Fame Academy .
Most of these legal tussles revolve around the issue of her qualifications , though these things should n't be difficult or complicated .
If anyone wanted to check my degrees , memberships , or affiliations , then they could call up the institutions , and get instant confirmation : job done .
If you said I was n't a doctor , I would n't sue you ; I 'd roar with laughter .
If you contact the Australasian College of Health Sciences ( Portland , US ) where McKeith has a " pending diploma in herbal medicine " , they say they can't tell you anything about their students .
When you contact Clayton College of Natural Health to ask where you can read her PhD , they say you can't .
What kind of organisations are these ?
If I said I had a PhD from Cambridge , US or UK ( I have neither ) , it would only take you a day to find it .
But McKeith 's most heinous abuse of legal chill is exemplified by a nasty little story from 2000 , when she threatened a retired professor of nutritional medicine for questioning her ideas .
Shortly after the publication of McKeith 's book Living Food for Health , before she was famous , John Garrow wrote an article about some of the rather bizarre scientific claims she was making .
He was struck by the strength with which she presented her credentials as a scientist ( " I continue every day to research , test and write furiously so that you may benefit ... " etc ) .
In fact , he has since said that he assumed - like many others - that she was a proper doctor .
Sorry : a medical doctor .
Sorry : a qualified conventional medical doctor who attended an accredited medical school .
Anyway , in this book , McKeith promised to explain how you can " boost your energy , heal your organs and cells , detoxify your body , strengthen your kidneys , improve your digestion , strengthen your immune system , reduce cholesterol and high blood pressure , break down fat , cellulose and starch , activate the enzyme energies of your body , strengthen your spleen and liver function , increase mental and physical endurance , regulate your blood sugar , and lessen hunger cravings and lose weight . "
These are not modest goals , but her thesis was that it was all possible with a diet rich in enzymes from " live " raw food - fruit , vegetables , seeds , nuts , and especially live sprouts , which " are the food sources of digestive enzymes " .
McKeith even offered " combination living food powder for clinical purposes " in case people did n't want to change their diet , and she used this for " clinical trials " with patients at her clinic .
Garrow was sceptical of her claims .
Apart from anything else , as emeritus professor of human nutrition at the University of London , he knew that human animals have their own digestive enzymes , and a plant enzyme you eat is likely to be digested like any other protein .
As any professor of nutrition , and indeed many GCSE biology students , could happily tell you .
Garrow read the book closely , as have I .
These " clinical trials " seemed to be a few anecdotes in her book about how incredibly well McKeith 's patients felt after seeing her .
No controls , no placebo , no attempt to quantify or measure improvements .
So Garrow made a modest proposal , and I am quoting it in its entirety , partly because it is a rather elegantly written exposition of the scientific method by an extremely eminent academic authority on the science of nutrition , but mainly because I want you to see how politely he stated his case .
" I also am a clinical nutritionist , " began Professor Garrow , " and I believe that many of the statements in this book are wrong .
My hypothesis is that any benefits which Dr McKeith has observed in her patients who take her living food powder have nothing to do with their enzyme content .
If I am correct , then patients given powder which has been heated above 118 F for 20 minutes will do just as well as patients given the active powder .
This amount of heat would destroy all enzymes , but make little change to other nutrients apart from vitamin C , so both groups of patients should receive a small supplement of vitamin C ( say 60 mg / day ) .
However , if Dr McKeith is correct , it should be easy to deduce from the boosting of energy , etc , which patients received the active powder and which the inactivated one .
" Here , then , is a testable hypothesis by which nutritional science might be advanced .
I hope that Dr McKeith 's instincts , as a fellow - scientist , will impel her to accept this challenge .
As a further inducement I suggest we each post , say , £ 1,000 , with an independent stakeholder .
If we carry out the test , and I am proved wrong , she will , of course , collect my stake , and I will publish a fulsome apology in this newsletter .
If the results show that she is wrong I will donate her stake to HealthWatch [ a medical campaigning group ] , and suggest that she should tell the 1,500 patients on her waiting list that further research has shown that the claimed benefits of her diet have not been observed under controlled conditions .
We scientists have a noble tradition of formally withdrawing our publications if subsequent research shows the results are not reproducible - do n't we ? "
This was published in an obscure medical newsletter .
Sadly , McKeith - who , to the best of my knowledge , has never published in a proper " Pubmed - listed " peer - reviewed academic journal - did not take up this offer to collaborate on a piece of research with a professor of nutrition .
Instead , Garrow received a call from McKeith 's lawyer husband , Howard Magaziner , accusing him of defamation and promising legal action .
Garrow , an immensely affable and relaxed old academic , shrugged this off with style .
He told me .
" I said , ' Sue me . '
I 'm still waiting . "
His offer of £ 1,000 still stands ; I 'll make it £ 2,000 .
But , to me , it 's tempting to dismiss the question of whether or not McKeith should call herself " doctor " as a red herring , a distraction , an unnecessary ad hominem squabble .
Because despite her litigiousness , her illegal medicinal products , her ropey qualifications , her abusiveness , despite her making the wounded and obese cry on television , despite her apparently misunderstanding some of the most basic aspects of GCSE biology , while doling out " scientific " advice in a white coat , despite her farcical " academic " work , despite the unpleasantness of the food she endorses , there are still many who will claim : " You can say what you like about McKeith , but she has improved the nation 's diet . "
Let me be very clear .
Anyone who tells you to eat your greens is all right by me .
If that was the end of it , I 'd be McKeith 's biggest fan , because I 'm all in favour of " evidence - based interventions to improve the nation 's health " , as they used to say to us in medical school .
But let 's look at the evidence .
Diet has been studied very extensively , and there are some things that we know with a fair degree of certainty : there is convincing evidence that diets rich in fresh fruit and vegetables , with natural sources of dietary fibre , avoiding obesity , moderate alcohol , and physical exercise , are protective against things such as cancer and heart disease .
But nutritionists do n't stop there , because they can't : they have to manufacture complication , to justify the existence of their profession .
And what an extraordinary new profession it is .
They 've appeared out of nowhere , with a strong new - age bent , but dressing themselves up in the cloak of scientific authority .
Because there is , of course , a genuine body of research about nutrition and health , to which these new " nutritionists " are spectacularly unreliable witnesses .
You do n't get sober professors from the Medical Research Council 's Human Nutrition Research
Unit on telly talking about the evidence on food and health ; you get the media nutritionists .
It 's like the difference between astrology and astronomy .
These new nutritionists have a major commercial problem with evidence .
There 's nothing very professional or proprietary about " eat your greens " , so they have had to push things further : but unfortunately for the nutritionists , the technical , confusing , overcomplicated , tinkering interventions that they promote are very frequently not supported by convincing evidence .
And that 's not for lack of looking .
This is not about the medical hegemony neglecting to address the holistic needs of the people .
In many cases , the research has been done , and we know that the more specific claims of nutritionists are actively wrong .
I 've got too much sense to subject you to reams of scientific detail - I 've learned from McKeith that you need theatrical abuse to hold the public 's attention - but we can easily do one representative example .
The antioxidant story is one of the most ubiquitous health claims of the nutritionists .
Antioxidants mop up free radicals , so in theory , looking at metabolism flow charts in biochemistry textbooks , having more of them might be beneficial to health .
High blood levels of antioxidants were associated , in the 1980s , with longer life .
Fruit and vegetables have lots of antioxidants , and fruit and veg really are good for you .
So it all made sense .
But when you do compare people taking antioxidant supplement tablets with people on placebo , there 's no benefit ; if anything , the antioxidant pills are harmful .
Fruit and veg are still good for you , but as you can see , it looks as if it 's complicated and it might not just be about the extra antioxidants .
It 's a surprising finding , but that 's science all over : the results are often counterintuitive .
And that 's exactly why you do scientific research , to check your assumptions .
Otherwise it would n't be called " science " , it would be called " assuming " , or " guessing " , or " making it up as you go along " .
But do n't get distracted .
Basic , sensible dietary advice , that we all know - be honest - still stands .
It 's the unjustified , self - serving and unnecessary overcomplication of this basic sensible dietary advice that is , to my mind , one of the greatest crimes of the nutritionist movement .
I do n't think it 's excessive to talk about consumers paralysed with confusion in supermarkets .
Although it 's just as likely that they will be paralysed with fear , because McKeith 's stock in trade is abuse , on a scale that would have any doctor struck off : making people cry for the television cameras , I assume deliberately , and using fear and bullying to get them to change their lifestyles .
As a posture it is seductive , it has a sense of generating movement , but if you drag yourself away from the theatricality of souped - up recipe and lifestyle shows on telly , the evidence shows that scare campaigns tend not to get people changing their behaviour in the long term .
So what can you do ?
There 's the rub .
In reality , again , away from the cameras , the most significant " lifestyle " cause of death and disease is social class .
Here 's a perfect example .
I rent a flat in London 's Kentish Town on my modest junior doctor 's salary ( do n't believe what you read in the papers about doctors ' wages , either ) .
This is a very poor working - class area , and the male life expectancy is about 70 years .
Two miles away in Hampstead , meanwhile , where the millionaire Dr Gillian McKeith PhD owns a very large property , surrounded by other wealthy middle - class people , male life expectancy is almost 80 years .
I know this because I have the Annual Public Health Report for Camden open on the table right now .
This phenomenal disparity in life expectancy - the difference between a lengthy and rich retirement , and a very truncated one indeed - is not because the people in Hampstead are careful to eat a handful of Brazil nuts every day , to make sure they 're not deficient in selenium , as per nutritionists ' advice .
And that 's the most sinister feature of the whole nutritionist project , graphically exemplified by McKeith : it 's a manifesto of rightwing individualism - you are what you eat , and people die young because they deserve it .
They choose death , through ignorance and laziness , but you choose life , fresh fish , olive oil , and that 's why you 're healthy .
You 're going to see 78 .
You deserve it .
Not like them .
How can I be sure that this phenomenal difference in life expectancy between rich and poor is n't due to the difference in diet ?
Because I 've read the dietary intervention studies : when you intervene and make a huge effort to change people 's diets , and get them eating more fruit and veg , you find the benefits , where they are positive at all , are actually very modest .
Nothing like 10 years .
But genuine public health interventions to address the real social and lifestyle causes of disease are far less lucrative , and far less of a spectacle , than anything a food crank or a TV producer would ever dream of dipping into .
What prime - time TV series looks at food deserts created by giant supermarket chains , the very companies with which stellar media nutritionists so often have lucrative commercial contracts ?
What show deals with social inequality driving health inequality ?
Where 's the human interest in prohibiting the promotion of bad foods ; facilitating access to nutrient - rich foods with taxation ; or maintaining a clear labelling system ?
Where is the spectacle in " enabling environments " that naturally promote exercise , or urban planning that prioritises cyclists , pedestrians and public transport over the car ?
Or reducing the ever - increasing inequality between senior executive and shop - floor pay ?
This is serious stuff .
We do n't need any more stupid ideas about health in the world .
We have a president of South Africa who has denied that HIV exists , we have mumps and measles on the rise , we have quackery in the ascendant like never before , and whatever Tony Blair might have to say about homoeopathy being a fight not worth fighting for scientists , we cannot indulge portions of pseudoscientific ludicrousness as if they do n't have wider ramifications for society , and for the public misunderstanding of science .
I am writing this article , sneakily , late , at the back of the room , in the Royal College of Physicians , at a conference discussing how to free up access to medical academic knowledge for the public .
At the front , as I type , Sir Muir Gray , director of the NHS National Electronic Library For Health , is speaking : " Ignorance is like cholera , " he says .
" It can not be controlled by the individual alone : it requires the organised efforts of society . "
He 's right : in the 19th and 20th centuries , we made huge advances through the provision of clean , clear water ; and in the 21st century , clean , clear information will produce those same advances .
Gillian McKeith has nothing to contribute : and Channel 4 , which bent over backwards to dress her up in the cloak of scientific authority , should be ashamed of itself .
' With all due respect , you 're wrong ' :
When McKeith put a cabbie in his place
Here is a bizarre story , which McKeith is evidently proud of , because not only does she recount it in her book , she has also recounted it in other published articles .
She is in a cab , and the cab driver has spotted her , and tries to spark up a conversation :
" As I sat down to enjoy the ride and sighed a sense of relief in honour of some quiet time , I barely heard some mumbling from Harry to break a much cherished silence .
Ignoring it to soak in the rapidly moving scenery , I heard it again ... ' You know , fish has more omegas than flax , ' he stated .
' I beg your pardon , ' I said .
' I said that fish has more omegas than flax seeds , ' he re-stated .
The only thing I could think of was : ' Why was this invasive , somewhat jovial , but truly kind man , talking about flax ...'
' In all due respect , you 're wrong , Harry .
Flax seeds contain far greater levels of the healthy oils ( omega - 3 and omega - 6 ) in a properly balanced and assimilable form , ' I explained .
' No , I disagree , ' he argued .
' What do you mean , you disagree ?
Have you spent years conducting clinical research , working with patients , lecturing , teaching , studying the omega oils in flax , obtaining worldwide data , compiling one of the largest private health libraries on the planet , and writing extensively on the topic ? '
I asked .
Not to mention writing this very article on this very day .
' No , ' Harry feebly replied .
I wondered , ' Are you a scientist , a biochemist , a botanist , or have you spent a lifetime studying food and biochemistry as I have done ? '
' No , ' he again replied .
' So , where do you get such stuff ?
Where is your scientific authority ? '
I demanded .
Harry proudly announced : ' Oh , my wife is a doctor - a gynaecologist - by the way . '
' Is she a food specialist or nutritional biochemist as well ? '
I quickly retorted .
' Um , ah , well , no , but she is a doctor , ' he offered . "
Charming .
But flax seeds contain oestrogenic compounds , and fibre , so they 're not very " assimilable " unless you crush them , in which case they taste foul , and they 're sold as a laxative in doses of 15g .
And you will need a lot of them .
When you account for the poor conversion in the body from plant - form omega oils to the animal forms that are most beneficial ( called DHA and EPA ) then flax seeds and fish contain roughly the same amounts .
But in the real world , rather than the raw figures , it 's very easy to eat 100g of mackerel , whereas it 's tricky to get a tablespoon of flax seed into you .
( Similarly , parsley is a rich source of vitamin C , but you 're not going to eat an orange sized lump of it . )
As for " properly balanced " , I do n't know if she means spiritually or biologically , but fish is much higher in omega - 3 , which most people would say is better .
When it comes to vacation , Netflix has a simple policy : take as much as you ’d like .
Just make sure your work is done .
Employees at the online movie retailer often leave for three , four , even five weeks at a time and never clock in or out .
Vacation limits and face - time requirements , says Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings , are “ a relic of the industrial age . ”
“ The worst thing is for a manager to come in and tell me : ` Let ’s give Susie a huge raise because she ’s always in the office . ’
What do I care ?
I want managers to come to me and say : ` Let ’s give a really big raise to Sally because she ’s getting a lot done ’ – not because she ’s chained to her desk . ”
Across America , executives are searching for ways to keep experienced Baby Boomers at their companies and attract younger workers , many of whom are used to controlling which songs they listen to and where they get their news .
Netflix ’s time off rules – or lack thereof – are part of a broad culture of employee autonomy instilled in the company when Hastings founded it a decade ago .
The executives trust staffers to make their own decisions on everything – from whether to bring their dog to the office to how much of their salary they want in cash and how much in stock options .
Workers are treated , as Chief Talent Officer Patty McCord likes to say , as adults .
“ We want our employees to have great freedom – freedom to be brilliant or freedom to make mistakes , ” Hastings said .
That might sound like executive blather , but to hear employees tell it , on the way to almost $ 1 billion in sales last year , Netflix has made good on its promises to workers .
“ There ’s an inverse relationship between how often a company talks about its values and how much those values are actually reflected in the workplace , ” said Heather McIlhany , a Netflix online marketing manager who took a three - week vacation to South Africa in November , just nine months after joining the company .
“ At Netflix … the freedom is inherent in how we work , ” McIlhany said .
Though cultural change is hard to measure , some of America ’s largest businesses are experimenting with unconventional time off rules and benefits .
New Brunswick , N.J. , healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson has an ever - expanding stable of work - life balance programs , including an extra week ’s paid vacation for new moms and dads , and for parents adopting .
Retailer Best Buy is implementing a plan to allow employees at corporate headquarters in Richfield , Minn. , ( and soon , for many in retail stores ) to set their own hours and work outside the office .
Flexible schedules are now available to 28 percent of full - time U.S. workers , almost twice the number in 1991 , according to the non-profit advocacy group Corporate Voices for Working Families .
“ Companies are trying to give people more responsibility , more freedom and more flexibility , ” said Carol Sladek , a principal at Lincolnshire , Ill. , human resources consulting firm Hewitt Associates .
“ If you have more control , your life feels better . ”
To be sure , Netflix ’s time off policy is rare , and only applies to its 300 - plus salaried workers , not the much larger hourly workforce .
Experts said it ’s hard to imagine a bigger Fortune 500 company adopting the idea .
As one Yahoo spokeswoman scoffed : “ We ’re a grown - up company , with over 12,000 employees , and you have to have some semblance of process and procedure . ”
But even in perk - heavy Silicon Valley , what ’s happening inside Netflix ’s Tuscanvilla - style Los Gatos headquarters may be unprecedented .
American workers get a median of 10 vacation days after one year on the job and 15 days after five years of work , according to Hewitt .
One in three Americans does n’t use all their vacation , and barely one in 10 takes a break for two weeks straight , according to the non-profit research firm Families and Work Institute .
But at Netflix , it ’s estimated that most employees take off about 25 to 30 days per year , using the time to stay at home with the kids , travel to Cambodia , or visit relatives in India .
It ’s “ estimated ” because Netflix does not record vacation time , said McCord .
“ I ’ve never terminated a salaried employee for being tardy or being absent , ” McCord said .
“ There have been issues when people did n’t come to work – but the issue is the work , it ’s not the time off . ”
Among half a dozen corporate HR experts nationwide , none could name a company with such a widespread and successful unlimited vacation policy .
Microsoft tried with executives in the 1990 ’s , but few managers used more than a few weeks .
The roots of the Netflix culture grew partly from difficulties at Hastings ’ first startup , Pure Software ( now part of IBM ) , where McCord served as director of HR .
He made tens of millions at the company , but along the way , Pure lost its spark .
“ We had this great early culture , but after we went public we had a lot more normal rules , ” Hastings said .
“ You did n’t need a bathroom pass to go to the bathroom , but it kind of felt like that sometimes . ”
In 1998 , Hastings lured McCord away from a four - day - a - week consulting gig to join Netflix , persuading her with a vision of “ the company we always dreamed of . ”
They ’ve since created a billion - dollar corporation that retains the feel of a family business , where the CEO knows the majority of the 200 or so workers at headquarters by name , partly because he and McCord hold small group meetings with all recent hires .
At one such gathering a few years ago , an employee argued that it did n’t make sense for Netflix to track vacation days .
“ You ’re not measuring my daily hours , so why are you measuring the number of days I work ? ” he asked .
Hastings and McCord agreed , but the company ’s attorneys took some convincing .
As remarkable as the rules might sound , Netflix employees were n’t surprised .
“ We do n’t think of it as a perk – it ’s just emblematic of the way we work here , ” said John Ciancutti , a director of engineering who is traveling for several weeks in the Galapagos Islands with his mother this spring .
The company ’s work - hard / play - outside - the - office culture is one reason McCord believes Netflix avoided the post- public offering exodus that plagues many technology companies .
Five years after the IPO in 2002 , six of its seven top executives are still with Netflix .
The worker - oriented rules aid retention in the lower ranks , too ; Ciancutti joined as a junior engineer in 1999 .
And the culture allows the company to hire independent , creative types like Director of Product Management Todd Yellin , who spent much of his first several months on the job traveling to Los Angeles to complete work on an independent film .
Yet open - minded treatment of workers is n’t without its challenges .
Chief among the problems at similar programs , according to Sladek , is that managers are inconsistent .
Some might grant their team two months vacation and two days working at home per week , while others choose two weeks and no telecommuting .
At Netflix , roughly 340 employees in Los Gatos and Beverly Hills manage the company , write the computer code , design the Web site and strike deals with Hollywood studios .
The other 1,000 are hourly workers at a customer service center in Hillsboro , Ore. , and at DVD mailing hubs around the country .
Those workers receive a free Netflix membership and DVD player after three months on the job , and the same healthcare benefits as salaried workers .
But they have a fixed amount of paid time off .
Employees schedule time off within the rhythm of their jobs : finance managers stick around in early January to close the year ’s books ; McIlhany front - loaded her work during the first week of November before she left for South Africa ; Aroon Ramadoss , an engineering manager who spent five weeks in Europe last summer , took little vacation in 2005 .
Still , few executives seem as ready as Hastings to buck conventional wisdom on how we work .
“ We ’re the nation that takes the least amount of time off in the world .
We have more rules and regulations that tie people to a clock than a lot of other nations , ” Sladek said .
“ [ Netflix is ] where a lot of companies would like to be going .
But in practice , they ’re still few and far between . ”

O'Reilly claims that the left wing loons took his vile rant against Shawn Hornbeck out of context .
It 's a typical response from a man who claims he protects children , but actually attacked an abused one and has no way left to defend himself .
There are over 1000 comments on Oprah 's message bd now .
Bill , you 're the despicable one and I 'll go on your show any day and debate you about your original segment on Shawn .
I will be contacting The Factor .
Yea , I know ... It 's pointless ..

Media Matters :
Bill , loved you on Oprah , but you got hammered on some chat boards .
They say you owe Shawn Hornbeck an apology for insinuating he wanted to stay with his abductor .
What say you ? "
Well , Heather , I say the far - left loons who took my analysis out of context are despicable .
These people have n't done a single thing to protect kids from danger in this country .
Our reporting on the Hornbeck case has been dead - on accurate .
We have introduced Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome to a world that badly needs to understand that concept .
These vile individuals who have attacked us are doing so for political reasons , and I condemn them in the strongest terms .
Here 's the video of what he actually said that was so offensive .
It was soooo disgraceful that he got cancelled out of speaking at the National Center for Missing Kids dinner .
Are they left wing loons too ?
I 've made several calls to the producers of Oprah 's show to ask them about O'Reilly 's appearance .
So far they have n't returned my calls ..
Have you ever noticed that all the A - players at any organization tend to be doing different things , in different ways ?
These people have shared character traits , but what they do in their job could be anything .
Some top developers write more code , others design more algorithms , others lead and organize teams .
In marketing , some people specialize in writing , others do art , others do quantitative studies , others do primary research , etc .
They do different mixes of these things .
So who are the A - players ?
It 's simple : 1 ) A - players are smart people .
The best organizations will make this a pillar of their hiring .
2 ) A - players are interested people .
A top source of value in any employee is how much they purely think about the company .
When it comes time for a person to act on the company 's behalf , they will make far better decisions if they are interested in their company , work , and industry .
3 ) A - players are active people .
Hire employees who do lots of work , who have families and pets , and who pursue lots of interests and passions .
And then enthuse them to take some of that energy and spend it on your business .
I think the culture at my company SureLogic embraces these ideas , Google too .
Car engines that consume less energy and can keep running on low oil , lead - free plumbing fixtures , and tanks that are light enough to be airlifted , but are just as rugged as the much heavier varieties .
They sound futuristic , but these products are already realities thanks to materials that stretch the limits of performance .
Called cast metal matrix composites ( MMCs ) , they are cheaper , lighter and stronger than their original alloys .
In fact , an aluminum - based MMC developed at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee ( UWM ) can replace iron - based alloys .
" These composites have many applications in the transportation , small engines , aerospace and computer industries , " says Pradeep Rohatgi , a Wisconsin Distinguished Professor of Engineering who pioneered cost - effective methods of manufacturing these composites .
Now more than a 100 - million - a- year industry themselves , MMCs have been used in components for train brakes , thermal management devices in computers , and even the space shuttle and the Hubble Space Telescope .
MMCs are engineered by combining metal with a totally different class of material , such as ceramics and recycled waste .
Incorporating the two materials - the matrix and the reinforcement materials - result in amazing structural and physical properties not available in the natural world .
But MMCs would not have risen so far so fast without the research of Rohatgi , who currently is developing innovations such as composites embedded with nanoparticles that can deliver qualities such as self - lubrication , abrasion - resistance and energy - absorbing capabilities .
He is also creating a robust " metallic syntactic foam . "
" One thing that has surprised me over the years is how easy it was to make these materials , " he says .
It was Rohatgi 's adaptation of a conventional foundry process to synthesize aluminum and graphite that slashed the cost of mass - producing MMCs and allowed for more complex shapes to be made .
Since then , his laboratory has done extensive work in reinforcing aluminum with elements such as graphite and silicon carbide particles ( ceramics ) to form materials that are 20 to 40 percent stronger .
The aluminum embedded with graphite also self - lubricates , making it particularly valuable for use in engines .
Standard aluminum pistons and cylinders can stick together during a cold - engine startup or when an engine needs oil , he says .
But if the parts are made from an aluminum - graphite composite , the engine is partially protected from seizing .
This year , his lab received a half million dollars in federal money to develop lighter , heavy - duty materials to meet the U.S. Army 's need for vehicles that can be airlifted and operate for prolonged periods without refueling .
For all the work he has done with major car companies and Wisconsin partners like Oshkosh Truck Corp. , Rohatgi says the largest users of MMCs have not been in transportation , but in the computer industry .
Computer applications require smaller volumes and they often have the money to invest in new technologies , he says .
" You look for the big bang in one area and it happens in another . "
The newest class of MMCs that his lab is developing fortifies aluminum with nanoparticles to produce materials that can withstand enormous amounts of stress , are exceptionally hard , but are also lightweight .
Nanoparticles are smaller than 100 nanometers ( about the size of a baseball shrunk to one - millionth of its original size ) that sometimes behave differently than larger particles .
A nanostructured aluminum can be 10 times stronger than conventional aluminum alloys .
A third kind of MMC Rohatgi is working on turns metals into foam .
Unlike Styrofoam , in which air is pumped into a plastic matrix , syntactic ( metallic ) foam is filled with hollow micro-balloons set into a metal base .
The tiny balloons are made from recycled " fly - ash " -- waste materials generated by coal - burning power plants - and they house either various gases or are a vacuum inside .
" The cells are smaller and more regular than air bubbles , which make them better at energy absorption , in the case of a car crash , and also useful at sound dampening , " he says .
" They are also very light and there may be an interest in aluminum foam in homeland security issues .
It can make buildings , including bomb shelters , more blast - proof and fire - resistant . "
Now in his 20th year at UWM , Rohatgi continues to help foundries , such Eck Industries in Manitowoc , diversify their business with MMC casting , giving them a defense against competition from other countries where labor is cheaper .
His lab is researching techniques that will enable industries to manufacture composite components with increased speed - and the new technology will taking the process out of the factory , making on - site manufacture of parts possible .
The U.S. military also is interested in developing the capability of quickly producing replacement parts for vehicles while on the battlefield .
Rapid manufacturing technologies can be expanded to include lightweight materials for bone replacement implants and tissue scaffolds , says Rohatgi , improving the treatment of wounded soldiers in mobile environments .
" The only way to keep foundries viable is to help them develop fast - track technologies to manufacture components from advanced lightweight materials , " Rohatgi says .
" It gives old - line manufacturing the means to producing high - tech products . "

Le blackjack est un jeu bien connu , qui a été popularisé par le casino physique mais aussi par ...
I heard of this story from a friend of mine who has been caught up in the “ Suerte hostage crisis ” for a few weeks now .
At first I thought it was silly .
How can you get addicted to watching a pregnant horse standing around in a stall all day ?
Well , it seems now I ’m hooked too …
Thanks Beth !
I think the fact that she is SO pregnant has something to do with it .
Not to mention the fact that Suerte likes to play with our minds and lay down , moving about restlessly , immitating labor …
Thousands of people are following the pregnancy of Suerte , a 21 - year - old chestnut Trakehner , and calling or e-mailing their support and concerns .
The intense interest began after horse breeder Genevieve Ghilotti installed cameras to upload live video stream from the stalls at Glenhill Farm in west Petaluma to allow her clients to keep an eye on expectant mares and witness the births of their babies .
Ghilotti said she has received calls around the clock from Germany , England , Canada and Africa and nearly every state in America .
That even includes Africam , a camera set up at a watering hole in Africa where news of Suerte is posted on a bulletin board , Ghilotti said .
The Web hosting company , Mare Stare , has logged 55 pages of discussion about Suerte .
Ghilotti has received more than 1,000 e-mails .
Join the insanity and check out Suerte ’s web cam …
It has to happen soon right ?
We have already covered no cost ways to reduce energy use in your home , so now that you are have all this extra money you are not spending on your utility bills burning a hole in your pocket , its time to start thinking about spending some of that money on ways to reduce energy use .
This list was compiled by Larry Harmon , from Air Barrier Solutions , and Peter Talmage , from PE Energy and Design .
Both men are very knowledgeable about home energy use and they put on a great talk about easy ways to reduce home energy use at this years NESEA Building Green 07 .
Most energy efficiency improvements pay for themselves in savings very quickly .
You can also get some tax breaks to help you pay for them .
So here in no particular order are the top ten ways to reduce energy use in your home .
1. Start with diagnostics :
You need to establish a baseline for your home .
This lets you see how far you have come , as well as expose the trouble areas that need to be tackled first .
There is no point in replacing the insulation in the attic if you already have enough .
There are three types of diagnostics that you should make sure are done .
Blower Door Testing Infrared Scan Combustion Safety Testing
Blower door testing :
When you preform a blower door test you set up a large fan in a door ( hence the name ) and you pressurize the home using a known volume of air .
Blower door testing determines several things .
It can tell you where your building is leaking air .
This is important because if air is leaking out , so is heat / cold , conversely if air is leaking in so is cold / heat .
A blower door test will also tell you if your home is sealed up too tight .
Some areas of the home need to be properly vented .
Bathrooms for instance need proper venting to prevent mold .
The blower door
test is also a good tool to see if that guy you paid to seal up your attic really did his job or not .
Infrared scanning :
Infrared scanning relies upon very cool and very expensive infrared cameras , that can give the operator the ability to “ see ” exactly where your home is leaking air .
The test is dependent on the operators skill and the kind of interior finishes you have in your home ( foil back insulation and other kinds of finishing can interfere with the camera ) .
Infrared scanning should be done in conjunction with a blower door test for maximum effect .
Combustion safety testing :
Some combustion appliances ( gas stoves , gas water heaters , oil and gas furnaces etc ) require the correct pressure inside and outside your home in order for them to vent properly .
They rely on chimneys to take the combustion fumes out to the outside .
If you change the air flow patterns of your home you may create negative pressure and cause these appliances to vent into the home .
This is obviously not good .
This test needs to be preformed before AND after you make changes to the home .
2. Install a programmable thermostat :
If you reduce your hose temperature from 70 degrees to 60 degrees for 8 hours each day you can reduce your heating load by 10 % .
On average using a programmable thermostat can save you $ 150 + a year .
At an average cost of 20 dollars to purchase one , this is a no brainer .
Not all heating systems work well with a programmable thermostat .
Oil and gas furnaces will see the best result , radiant floor heating should be set at a constant temperature and left at that temperature only changing the settings gradually .
3. Air Seal Your Home !!!:
Air sealing simply means closing all the gaps , cracks , and leaks .
There are a plethora of reasons to have your home sealed up it can , stop drafts and reduces noise , eliminate pests such as cluster flies and ladybugs and can reduce the size requirements of your heating / cooling system to name a few .
Some tips for air sealing .
Seal the top of your home and bottom of your home first , then move towards the walls .
High density cellulose blown into side walls also helps dramatically .
Always air seal before insulating attics , if you do n’t you can have very bad moisture problems .
Remember SEAL FIRST , INSULATE SECOND .
Your diagnostic tests can help you determine where the gaps cracks and leaks are , and what your potential savings are .
4 . Change your lights :
Compact fluorescent lamps use 1/4th of the electricity of an incandescent lamp of the same light output and last ten times as long .
There are sizes and shapes to fit almost any existing light fixture .
A $.75 , 14 watt CFL that is used for 6 hours a day will save you about $ 15 a year over a 60 watt incandescent lamp .
That is a risk free return of over 2000 % !
5 . Insulate the exposed portion of the foundation :
If you have an exposed portion of foundation it is constantly , slowly , leaking .
It is allowing heat to escape all winter , and heat to get in all summer .
Adding 2 inches of XPS foam to the top 24 inches of an uninsulated 36X24 foot foundation heated at 55 degrees can save 52 gallons of heating oil per year in the Boston area .
At $ 2 + a gallon for heating oil this improvement will pay for itself in the first winter .
6 . Install high efficiency domestic hot water :
New hot water heaters can have efficiency ratings above 90 % .
It is very likely that the home you live in has a rather old , rather inefficient hot water heater .
There are lots of options , from storage from a HE boiler , to Instantaneous heaters , to solar thermal options .
If you live in a warm climate you can meet almost all of your domestic hot water needs with a simple and cheap solar thermal system .
If you live in a cold climate you can meet 80 % + of your DHW needs with that same simple and cheap system .
7. Insulate your walls :
Insulating your walls can save you hundreds of dollars on heating and cooling costs each year .
Blown in high density cellulose insulation can easily be added to existing walls .
8. Insulate your attic :
Open attics are easy to insulate .
Remember always air seal first !
Cellulose insulation can be blown in directly over existing attic structures and provides a very cost effective way to add a large amount of insulation fast .
Insulating the attic will help people in both warm and cool climates save money because you will not be spending more money to heat / cool that attic space as well .
9 . Switch to high efficiency heating :
High efficiency condensing boilers can operate at up to 95 % efficiency .
Their sealed combustion system ensures easy and safe installation .
With circulators and expansion tanks included they can replace an existing boiler with little modification of the existing heating structure .
An average installed cost would be around $ 5,000 .
Solar thermal systems can also be used to supplement or even replace most heating systems .
10 .
Get new appliances :
Replacing old appliances with units that have the energy star label means less energy use .
Typically they also run quieter and last longer .
Energy star appliances can include , refrigerators and freezers , light fixtures , dish washers , clothes washers , room air conditioners , dehumidifiers , ceiling fans , computers and heating devices .
Spending an extra $ 50 – $ 100 dollars can save you thousands over the life time of the appliance .
If you replace your old refrigerator you can often save 70 % of more energy .
These ten changes will radically reduce your energy usage .
So what about windows ?
Replacing old windows may not be the most cost effective way to save energy use in your home .
Often air sealing existing windows will have a a greater payback .
You will need to find replacement windows for about $ 250 per window in order to to have a payback period that makes it worth purchasing the new windows .
If you do find them cheap enough , poor installation can make new windows worse than old ones .
Single pane windows with a storm window are almost the efficiency equivalent of much more expensive thermopane windows .
So in a nutshell your diagnostic tests will tell you if your windows only need a little more sealing , or if they need to be replaced .
Finally remember you can always go solar !
After you have improved the efficiency of your home it becomes much more cost effective to use clean solar technologies .
For every dollar you spend on efficiency measures you will lower the cost of your solar system by 3 to 5 dollars ( because of reduction in the size system you will need ) .
You will want to consider passive solar options , like sun spaces , and thermosyphon hot air heaters .
Active solar devices like solar hot air heaters , solar DHW heating and solar thermal heating of the home are also very efficient .
Finally solar electric systems can help offset large amounts of your average electricity bill .
In the Boston area every square yard of hot air collector can offset an average of 1.5 gallons of heating oil per month .
A set of four 3 ′ by 7 ′ collectors will supply the energy equivalent of about 21 gallons of heating oil per month .
And a 2 kw solar electric array will produce about 180 kwh per month .
Credits and incentives can reduce the cost of an $ 18,000 to as little as $ 5,000 ( in Massachusetts ) .
With net metering and the value of green tags the electricity generates is presently worth about $ 42 per month .
Good luck , and have fun saving all that extra money !
But other estimates suggest the sums involved could be far higher .
The oil ministry in Baghdad , for example , estimated earlier this year that 10 percent to 30 percent of the $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion in fuel imported for public consumption in 2005 was smuggled back out of the country for resale .
At that time , the finance minister estimated that close to half of all smuggling profits was going to insurgents .
If true , that would be $ 200 million or more from fuel smuggling alone .
For Washington , the report ’s most dismaying finding may be that the insurgency now survives off money generated from activities inside Iraq , and no longer depends on sums Mr. Hussein and his associates seized as his government collapsed .
American officials said that as American troops entered Baghdad , Mr. Hussein ’s oldest son , Qusay , took more than $ 1 billion in cash from the Central Bank of Iraq and stashed it in steel trunks aboard a flatbed truck .
Large sums of cash were found in Mr. Hussein ’s briefcase when he was captured in December 2003 .
But the report says Mr. Hussein ’s loyalists “ are no longer a major source of funding for terrorist or insurgent groups in Iraq . ”
Part of the reason , the report says , is that an American - led international effort has frozen $ 3.6 billion in “ former regime assets . ”
Another reason , it says , is that Mr. Hussein ’s erstwhile loyalists , realizing that “ it is increasingly obvious that a Baathist regime will not regain power in Iraq , ” have turned increasingly to spending the money on their own living expenses .
The trail to these assets “ has grown cold , ” the report adds .
The document says the pattern of insurgent financing changed after the first 18 months of the war , from the Hussein loyalists who financed it in 2003 to “ foreign fighters and couriers ” smuggling cash in bulk across Iraq ’s porous borders in 2004 , to the present reliance on a complex array of indigenous sources .
“ Currently , we assess that these groups garner most of their funding from petroleum - related criminal activity , kidnapping and other criminal pursuits within Iraq , ” the report concludes .

One section of the report is dedicated to the role played by “ sympathetic donors , ” including Islamic charities and nongovernmental organizations .
It says that “ intelligence reporting ” indicates that only 10 to 15 of the 4,000 nongovernmental groups support terrorist and insurgent groups , but that those few take advantage of lax Iraqi regulation to divert funds to insurgent and other armed groups and , in some cases , “ to provide cover for insurgent recruitment and the transport of weapons and personnel . ”
The possibility that Iraq - based terrorist groups could finance attacks outside Iraq appeared to echo Bush administration assertions that prevailing in the war here is essential to preventing Iraq from becoming a terrorist haven , as Afghanistan became under the Taliban .
But that suggestion was one of several aspects of the report that drew criticism from Western terrorism and counterinsurgency experts working outside the government who were given the outline of the findings .
There was violence after J Jayalalitha was jailed for corruption
The girls died when a mob , allegedly comprising AIADMK party workers , set fire to a bus after their leader J Jayalalitha was jailed for corruption .
Jayalalitha maintains the violence was organised to discredit her party .
Twenty - eight men were found guilty of involvement in the incident , which happened in Dharmapuri district .
The court on Friday sentenced the other 25 men to seven years in prison for breaching peace and damaging public property .
Cases were filed against 31 men altogether .
Two of them were acquitted while one man died during the trial .
Controversial
Jayalalitha , the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu , is one of India 's most colourful and controversial politicians .
A former actress , she has ruled the state as chief minister for several years and has been feted over the last 10 years by various Indian prime ministers requiring her political support to remain in power .
Her admirers say she has played a key role in the development of Tamil Nadu as one of India 's most economically influential states .
The 58 - year - old briefly spent time in prison prior to her conviction for corruption in October 2000 .
Stories about her extravagance are legendary , and many of her worshipping followers are known to profess their loyalty through acts such as walking on hot coals or drawing her portrait with their blood .
Her ministers have on occasions been reported to prostrate themselves at her feet .
5 Reasons We 're Not In A Tech Boom
From smaller VC funding to your paycheck , there are good reasons not to get carried away with today 's pockets of tech success .
Bob Williams sure looks like someone out of the last Internet bubble .
He 's a general partner at Bay Partners , where four of the five companies the venture capital firm invested in last quarter are Internet - based .
Last week , his firm backed a Microsoft spin - off called Wallop , hitching on to the online social networking craze that brought MySpace.com a $ 580 million buyout .
" There are glimmers of activity that remind me of the early days of what 's now known as the Internet bubble , " Williams says .
Glimmers , he calls them , tempered by his decades of experience in the Valley .
But many others seem to be scrambling to declare this the next tech boom .
Certainly , the Internet is back in favor , and with good reason .
We now have a high - speed Internet that works , whether it's to connect gossipy teens , deliver software as a service to businesses , or allow truly global IT operations , including large - scale outsourcing .
That helps explain why about half of all VC deals last quarter involved Internet companies .
With stocks rising -- the tech - heavy Nasdaq is up 22 % over the past 12 months , the broader S&P 500 up 15 % -- there 's exuberance in the wind .
But this is n't your father 's -- er , older brother 's -- tech boom .
VC investment in Internet companies last quarter amounted to a mere 15 % of what investors plunked down in the typical quarter in 2000 .
Total tech and internet - related venture investing is less than one - quarter what it was in 2000 , and there are one - fifth as many IT venture deals .
There were 23 % fewer acquisitions of venture - backed tech companies last year than in 2000 , with 85 % less money changing hands .
Sure , stock prices , business tech spending , and IT salaries are up , but nowhere near euphoric levels .
Whether or not you wish it were 2000 all over , here are five reasons things are different this time around .
1. No Blank Checks
It was n't just the venture - backed companies that went wild in 2000 .
Business IT buyers did , too .
Consider :
At the start of 2001 , 72 % of companies surveyed by InformationWeek Research planned to increase IT spending , and just 5 % thought they 'd decrease it .
That was n't a strategy shift ; it was a thundering herd .
Starting this year , only 46 % of companies planned to increase IT spending , 33 % were holding tight , and 15 % planned to decrease it , according to our annual survey .
There 's strategic , growth - oriented IT spending happening , but it must clear a high hurdle .
That 's not to say business tech spending is moribund .
Compared with recent quarters , fewer companies are canceling IT projects because of short - term spending freezes , says Credit Suisse software analyst Jason Maynard , who 's the most bullish he 's been on the software industry since 2000 .
Companies will increase IT spending by an average 5.5 % this year , according to an Accenture survey of 300 business and IT managers in March .
Forrester strikes a more cautious tone , finding that companies plan to increase IT spending 3.2 % , down from 3.9 % a year ago .
Still , growth is on companies ' minds :
The largest percentage , 21 % , in the Accenture survey picked new business initiatives as the most important reason for the spending , though nearly 20 % also cited upgrading legacy systems and adopting new technologies .
The prospect of growth and the recognition of IT 's role in driving it justify some optimism .
Unlike 2000 , however , even the coolest tech tools are a tough sell .
Vladimir Eskin , whose Russian business intelligence company , Prognoz , set up a U.S. office this year , puts it this way : " While most technology buyers in the U.S. realize that their companies are behind what is available in terms of BI applications , in their decision making , pricing clearly dominates functionality . "
2. VC Money Is n't Everywhere
In 2000 , at the peak of the Internet bubble , nearly eight of 10 VC deals involved Internet - related companies .
Back then , VCs pumped more than $ 77 billion into Internet companies , or about $ 19.4 billion a quarter , according to Dow Jones / VentureOne .
Last quarter , about half of VC deals involved Internet companies , with the amount invested topping $ 2.9 billion .
VCs , on average , invest less in each venture than they did in 2000 - - nearly $ 14.8 million in first quarter 2000 versus $ 5.9 million last quarter .
But the Big Deal is back .
It was rare in the bubble days for a company to receive funding of more than $ 75 million , says Joe Muscat , director of Ernst & Young 's global VC practice .
Last quarter , Amp'd Mobile , a provider of wireless mobile entertainment services , received $ 150 million , and ITA Software , a developer of pricing and connectivity software for the travel industry , nabbed $ 100 million .
Solid startups in hot markets still can find money .
WiQuest Communications , a maker of ultrawideband chips for wireless devices , has raised $ 31 million , including $ 18 million in late March .
" The availability of money has improved and is coming back from the dark days of the second half of 2001 to 2003 , " says Alun Roberts , a WiQuest marketing VP .
VC money 's tighter , and that 's a good thing .
With money going to companies with real business models and promising technology , the emerging technology coming out of those startups is more likely to be relevant to businesses .

The killings have shocked the nation
Hans van
Themsche shot a pregnant black nanny from Mali and a two - year - old white girl in her care , before himself being shot and injured by police .
Mr Van Themsche , 18 , also shot and injured a woman of Turkish descent .
" He obviously was in search of people of foreign origin to shoot them down .
That 's what he declared himself , " a public prosecution spokeswoman said .
The spokeswoman , Dominique Reyniers , added that the suspect was questioned on Friday and was due to appear in court after his recovery in hospital .
We have to avoid our society being sucked into a spiral of violence
Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt
Far - right fears highlighted
Police say Mr Van Themsche 's father helped found the now defunct anti-immigration party Vlaams Blok , and his aunt is an MP for its successor , Vlaams Belang .
The then Vlaams Blok scored 24 % in regional elections in Flanders in June 2004 .
But it has been kept out of government by a coalition of all the other parties in the Flemish assembly .
The Belgian government has strongly condemned the shootings , describing them as an extreme form of racism .
Hundreds of people marched in Antwerp on Friday to condemn the attacks .
Calls for calm
The shooting spree began on Thursday , after Mr Van Themsche bought a hunting rifle in a shop in Antwerp .
He walked to the city centre and shot the woman of Turkish descent in the chest , as she sat reading a book on a bench .
The woman was badly injured but survived the attack .
The teenager than shot two more people - the pregnant woman from Mali and the white toddler in her care - killing them both .
Police later intercepted Mr Van Themsche , and shot and wounded him in the stomach after he refused to put down his gun .
Mr Van Themsche - an agricultural college student - was reportedly asked to leave boarding school just days earlier for smoking .
He also reportedly left a farewell letter .
Following the shootings , Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt called for calm .
" We have to avoid our society being sucked into a spiral of violence , " he said .
" The police and the judicial system will do all that is needed for justice to be done . "
The killings follow an attack last Saturday in the city of Bruges , in which a black Frenchman was left in a coma after being beaten up by a group of skinheads .

( PopSci.com ) --
If you 're ever lucky enough to fly a Quiet Supersonic Transport between New York and Los Angeles , you 'll have just enough time to get through a movie -- a short one .
Instead of the usual six hours , it will be a 1,100 miles per hour , two - hour hop .
The QSST , as the proposed luxury private jet is known , could be the first civilian supersonic plane approved for overland routes , thanks to aerodynamics designed to muzzle its sonic boom .
Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works has been developing the project for six years under a $ 25 - million contract from Supersonic Aerospace International ( SAI ) , founded by Michael Paulson , son of Gulfstream founder Allen Paulson .
The 12 - passenger QSST would fly at between 47,000 and 57,000 feet with a range of 4,600 miles ( Chicago to Rome , for example ) , and it does n't need an extended runway .
Configured with 12 club chairs , a spacious bathroom and a sweet A/V system , the QSST is aimed at diplomats or executives with plenty of money -- but little time to spare .
Designed to fly between Mach 1.6 and 1.8 ( 1,056 to 1,188 miles per hour ) , the two - engine gull - wing aircraft would leave a sonic wake that 's only one hundredth the strength of the Mach 2 - capable Concorde , the 100 - seat speed demon that wound up permanently grounded following a fatal accident in 2000 .
( High maintenance costs for the aging fleet and a struggling airline industry also contributed to its demise . )
Eliminating bone - rattling sonic booms is a major feat of aerodynamic hocus - pocus .
When an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound , it creates pressure waves in the air that collide with one another faster than they can dissipate , resulting in a loud crack , or sonic boom .
The QSST , though it shares its general shape with the Concorde is less than half the size and uses fine - tuned aerodynamics to control the pressure generated as the plane displaces air at supersonic speeds .
With air disturbances along the craft evened out , the QSST generates more shockwaves of smaller magnitude rather than two explosive reports .
Tom Hartmann , the program manager at Lockheed , expects the boom to be imperceptible -- quieter than a kite flying overhead .
Another key to quiet flight is its broad distribution of lift - generating surfaces .
The QSST 's canards -- the small wings near the front of the fuselage -- and swept - V tail provide substantial lift , preventing the sharp , loud - boom - generating pressure change typical of larger , wider wings .
Hartmann says the QSST is so sleek that it can fly 10 percent farther on its fuel supply supersonically than it can at subsonic speeds .
" We could easily design a low - sonic - boom aircraft if it did n't have to fly anywhere , " he says -- that is , if the design did n't have to take fuel efficiency into consideration .
" The challenge is to fly a long way .
The hard part of this was to develop a low - drag design . "
The inverted - V tail also allows the two engines to be mounted far aft -- a design feature that further separates the pressure waves and keeps them from crashing into one another .
Normally , this engine placement would require extra material to support the cantilevered weight , but the inherent strength of the V tail 's truss shape compensates .
The Federal Aviation Administration restricted the Concorde to transoceanic flights because that craft created sonic booms strong enough to rattle dishes on the ground below .
Paulson says the QSST will meet the FAA 's stringent new noise regulations , which took effect at the beginning of 2006 , and he 's hopeful that the quiet design will prompt a lifting of the ban on overland supersonic flights .
SAI is evaluating engine designs from General Electric , Pratt & Whitney and Rolls - Royce for a unit that produces 33,000 pounds of thrust ( on par with a midsize airliner ) , for 66,000 pounds of total thrust from two engines .
Paulson plans to settle on a design in the next year , assemble an international consortium to manufacture the jet , and put it on the market by 2014 for about $ 80 million .
He 'd like to roll out a fleet of 300 to 400 in the next 20 years .
" The Concorde was a magnificent aircraft , " Paulson says , " but basically , it was 1960s technology .
This is an idea whose time is overdue . "

新年度を迎え、各社とも新入社員を迎える時期となった。会社によっては研修期間があり、実際に現場の部署へ配属されるのはもう少し後かもしれないが、社会人にとっては「新しい新人は（当たり前か）使えるのか？」という期待と不安と面倒くささに胸膨らむシーズンなのである。
実は筆者も毎年この時期になると、NHK研修センターにてNHKスタッフの研修を行なう、臨時の先生となる。NHKスタッフとはNHKの職員ではないが、NHK各地方局で現地採用する、番組制作のスタッフである。
採用される職種は多岐に渡る。ライトマン、カメラマン、ディレクター、編集者、アナウンサー、リポーター等々。それぞれのコースに応じて、各職種のOBや現役が指導に当たる。筆者はこのうち、編集コースを任されている。
NHK スタッフとは、雇用形態としてはアルバイトと変わらない。3年で契約満了となり、同じ職場には再登録できないという、厳しい条件が付いている。だが応募してくる人には、大学新卒者もいれば、いったん別の仕事に就いていた人なども多い。
地元での仕事の中では、例えアルバイトであっても最も面白い職種と言えるかもしれない。また誰でも即現場に入って映像制作が学べると言うことで、就職浪人した人や進むべき道をやり直したい人のため、人生の敗者復活戦を支援する役割も果たしている。
全滅からしか学べない仕事
毎年3月の研修にやってくるスタッフは、すでに1年目2年目の経験者2割、残りは初心者という構成である。経験者は多少のことはわかるようになっているが、我々本物のプロから見れば、まだシロウトと大差ない。
だが本人達に取ってみれば、放送機材が扱えるかどうかだけでも、大きな開きがあると思っている。だがVTRにしても編集機にしても、所詮はツールにしか過ぎない。もちろん初心者には使い方をある程度指導するが、機材の使い方など実戦でいじって自分で困れば、それなりに使えるようになるものだ。それを使って「何をどう作るか」を教えるのが、講師の役目である。
ビデオ編集という職種は、テレビ関係の仕事の中では、おそらく照明に次いで人に教えにくい仕事ではないかと思う。基本はほんの少ししかなく、あとはだいたいケースバイケースなのである。天才や職人と呼ばれる人が数多く存在し、その人達が作るものは、大抵基本から全然外れている。でも、イイのだ。良いものを見て、何が良いのかを解析して、自分なりのセオリーを組み立てていくしか、成長の道はない。
こういう職種の場合、あまりにもレベルが高すぎる人は、初心者を教えられない。教えられるほうも、何を言っているのか理解できない。講師はまあ、ある程度レベルが近い方が教えることがあるものである。
例えばFINAL FANTASY シリーズで 、 Level 1のキャラ にLevel 100のキャラが付いてきても、そりゃ確かに経験値は貰えるかもしれないが、戦闘が一瞬で終わってしまって何が起こったのか理解できまい。きっとあのぐらいのレベルになればわかるのかも、ぐらいのことがボンヤリわかる程度である。
映像業界では、結 構Level100にくっついてたレベル不明の人間が幅をきかせているケースが散見される。元クロサワの助監だったとか、そういうフレコミの人間は要注意だ。Level100のキャラとパーティを組んでいたキャラが、Level100とは限らないのである。
筆者が編集の講師としてわざわざ外部から呼ばれるのも、筆者のLevelが50ぐらいだから丁度いいというところはあるだろう。なにせNHKの編集OBといったら、筆者が教わらなければおかしいぐらい、あまりにも巨匠すぎるのである。NHKスタッフはこれから毎日、「シルクロード」を編集するわけではないのだ。
筆者の講義は、大半が実習である。そして、敢えて失敗させ、ほかの人と比較し、悪いところを発見させる。編集とは、こういう失敗の体験を蓄積していくという、「全滅覚悟ダンジョン探索型」でしか教えることができない。
そもそも今どきの若手は、全滅、玉砕の経験がない。筆者の講義はある意味非常に自尊心を傷つけられて辛いことだろう。だがここでくじけるようであれば、どのみち3年のアルバイトで終わるだけである。
チャンスを生かすも殺すも自分次第で、誰も助けてくれないということを、覚えて貰わなければならない。

An Italian fathers ' rights activist says he tried unsuccessfully to self - immolate on live television to call attention to dads unable to see their kids .
The ANSA news service reported Saturday that Nicola De Martino , who was recently re-united with his son after a 12 - year separation , tried to set himself on fire Thursday night while appearing as a guest on the current affairs show , " Dieci Minute , " or " Ten Minutes " on state television station RAI .
ANSA said that the show 's host , along with the distraught man 's 18 - year - old son " looked on in horror " as De Martino doused himself with gasoline and then threatened to light a match .
Host Maurizio Martinelli and the studio crew frantically managed to wrest the lit match from De Martino 's hands .
He was then led away from the stage .

Tequila makes me violent and vodka sneaks up on me like an evil assassin of drunkenness .
Gin , on the other hand , turns me mean .
We are convinced that different drinks produce different effects yet , so far , science has failed to prove this .
" A lot of this is folk memories and cultural hangovers , " says Dr Paul Clayton , pharmacologist and president of the forum on food and health at the Royal Society of Medicine .
" A lot of it depends on what mood you were in when you started drinking and the social context .
The idea that gin makes you unhappy probably comes from its nickname " mother 's ruin " - the idea that it makes women depressed , which is a cultural idea .
But fundamentally , alcohol is alcohol whichever way you slice it . "
Can the effects just be psychological ?
" I associate gin and tonic with a real pick - me - up , end - of - the - day reward drink , " says Victoria Moore , the Guardian 's wine writer .
" Because it 's not wine , it 's not ' work ' and I do n't feel obliged to write notes , and so it never fails to make me feel buoyant and great .
Personally , I find whisky the weirdest thing - it makes me feel solemn , lucid and sober .
Even when I 'm clearly not . "
" The effects of alcohol are similar , whichever form they come in , " says Dr Guy Ratcliffe , medical director of the Medical Council on Alcohol .
" Any difference is dependent on the rate at which it is drunk and the amount .
Alcohol is a simple molecule that is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream .
So if you drink a few shorts - spirits are generally 40 % ABV [ alcohol by volume ] - quickly , you 'll get a rapid increase in your blood alcohol level . "
Wine is usually enjoyed leisurely with meals .
Tequila slammers , however , are usually done after a heavy drinking session .
Similarly , says Moore , " I strongly refute the idea that port gives you worse hangovers .
Think about it : when do you drink port except after a four - course meal and about 10 bottles of wine ?
And then everyone blames the last drink . "
Champagne gets me stumbling around quickly but this is likely to be because I only ever drink it at parties without eating properly .
" And , says Dr Ratcliffe , " there is some evidence that because of the bubbles you can actually inhale the ' fumes ' as you sip . "
It is also believed to be absorbed more quickly because it is carbonated .
Mixers make a difference too .
All alcohol is a depressant and a sedative but drinking vodka with Red Bull or Coca - Cola ( loaded with sugar and caffeine ) will obviously have a different effect than drinking it neat .
" Alcohol is a disinhibitor , it switches off the nerves in the frontal cortex - which tells us not to be an idiot or try to chat up the boss 's wife at the Christmas party , " says Dr Clayton .
" It 's activating , arousing , energising .
Drinking alcohol with caffeine will be more of a stimulant .
Until the alcohol knocks you sideways . "
Guinness , on the other hand , is supposed to be good for you - a 1920s ad campaign said so .
English hospitals fed it to patients after operations and blood donors were encouraged to drink it because it was thought to be high in iron .
Even pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers were advised to drink it - advice that has since been withdrawn .
In fact it only contains around 1.1 mg of iron per pint ( the recommended daily allowance for women is 14mg ) .
One study , however , at Wisconsin University , found that Guinness contains antioxidants which help prevent blood clotting , so a pint a day - at mealtimes - may be as effective as aspirin at lowering the risk of heart attacks .
The " Tequila worm " is said to have aphrodisiac and hallucinogenic qualities and has been added to some bottles of mescal ( tequila is a type of mescal ) as a marketing gimmick since the 1950s ...
It is a mariposa worm , which feeds on the agave plant , which is what tequila is made from .
Although it can soak up a little of the alcohol , it has no noticeable effect on people .
It seems that the myth that eating the worm induces a druggy trip comes from confusing mescal with mescaline , a hallucinogenic drug .
Absinth has also enjoyed a dangerous and hallucinogenic reputation .
It contains thujone , a toxic chemical once thought to share qualities with THC , the psychoactive element in cannabis , although this has now been discredited .
In any case the amount is too minimal in absinth to have any noticeable effect .
Absinth is , however , 70 % alcohol and will make you dangerously drunk .
Whether it makes you mean , or happy , or clever , or violent , well there 's no saying .
Five ways to beat a hangover
According to a systematic review published in the British Medical Journal last year , no compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating hangovers .
The worst symptoms are caused by the liver breaking down the products of alcohol .
Alcohol is also a diuretic so speeds up water loss from your body causing dehydration ( hence the dry mouth , headache , dizziness ) .
It also irritates the stomach lining ( causing nausea and stomach cramps ) .
1 Line your stomach : alcohol is absorbed more rapidly into the blood stream and will irritate the stomach lining more if your stomach is empty .
Before going out , eat a meal containing fat , which is digested slowly and therefore protects your stomach , slowing the rate at which alcohol enters your body .
A glass of milk has a similar effect .
2 Choose light - coloured drinks : congeners , found primarily in darker alcoholic drinks , may affect blood vessels directly , producing migraine - like effects ( spasm and / or dilation of blood vessels ) and intensifying a hangover .
As a rule , the lighter the colour , the fewer congeners it is likely to contain ( ie , vodka is better than whisky ) .
Drinking one glass of water for every glass of alcohol will counter the dehydration .
3 Wrap up warmly : Alcohol dilates the blood vessels near the skin , causing us to lose body heat , but feel warmer - drunkenness followed by hypothermia is a leading cause of death in Russia .
3 Before bed :
Along with drinking plenty of water , a slow - burning snack such as granary toast will help avoid low - blood - sugar on waking .
4 The morning after : Water !
And take antacid for your stomach and paracetamol for your head ( aspirin is too harsh on your stomach ) .
A single cup of coffee may help as caffeine is a vasoconstrictor , so eases the dilated blood vessels , but go easy as it is also diuretic .
Liquids rich in minerals and salts ( eg , broth or bouillon ) , or sports drinks can help to rehydrate you .
According to Prof Sir Colin Berry , professor emeritus of pathology at Queen Mary , University of London , that old favourite , vitamin C , will do nothing for your symptoms , while " hair of the dog " merely postpones the agony .
And as for alternative remedies , the BMJ review found that commonly used dietary supplements ( borage , artichoke and prickly pear ) have zero effect .

LogoWatch Brussels Airlines recently found itself in some unexpected turbluence when superstitious passengers complained about its spiffing logo .
The airline 's stylised ' b ' ruffled a few feathers since it comprised 13 dots .
The company said it was " taken aback by the strength of feeling " , the BBC reports .
Spokesman Geert Sciot admitted : " They [ passengers ] said they were not pleased with an aircraft with a logo with 13 balls because they think it brings them bad luck .
We are never surprised by reactions - but that it was that bad ?
It really took us aback . "
Accordingly , Brussels Airlines has now added a fourteenth dot to its b , as you can see .
Expect favourable flying weather for the foreseeable future . ®
1. Less Money
Times have changed .
All other people ’s money gets you these days is into debt .
And that ’s not a great place to start anything from .
You do n’t need money for hardware — hardware is cheap .
You do n’t need money for software — software is free .
You do n’t need money for marketing — there are a variety of ways get your message out online to a huge audience for next to free .
Money does n’t buy you time and money does n’t buy you passion ( and passion is something you need a boatload of ) .
All money buys you are salaries .
And salaries buy you people .
2. Less People
For companies trying to build new web - based businesses and web - apps , all you need to start is three people .
Three people to launch a product .
A programmer , a designer , and a “ sweeper ” — someone who can move between the worlds and also gets common sense business and marketing .
Do n’t scale up your headcount to match your proposed feature set and vision , instead scale down your feature set and initial vision to match your headcount .
The less people you have the less time you have .
3. Less Time
Your competitors have 10 people at 40 hours a week ( 400 hours ) .
You have 3 people at 40 hours a week ( 120 hours ) .
Sounds like a disadvantage , right ?
Nope .
It ’s a huge advantage .
The majority of time you spend working is wasted time .
Too many meetings , too much planning , too much thinking , too much writing official documents .
The more time you have the more time you have to waste — and it ’s likely you ’ll waste more than you use .
When you have less time , you ’ll spend it more wisely .
Think about time as money :
If you only have $ 500 in the bank , you ’re not going to spend $ 400 on a TV .
You ’re going to be careful about spending your money .
If you have 40 hours instead of 400 , you ’re going to spend that time more wisely .
More value per hour for your less time .
Further , people are often wishing there were more hours in the day , more days in the week , and more weeks in the month .
You do n’t need more time , you need less time .
In fact , instead of working 40 , 50 , or 60 hours a week , consider capping your time on your core development to 20 or 30 hours a week .
You ’ll likely get more real work done .
4. Less Abstractions
The best way to deal with less time is to do less paper work , less busy work , less abstracted work .
This means do less stuff that is n’t real .
Less boxes and arrows .
Less charts .
Less documentation .
Less stuff that is abstracted from the real thing — the real product your actual customers will see .
And the # 1 abstraction to do away with is the functional spec .
I wo n’t repeat myself — just read Getting Real : No functional spec .
5. Less Software
All this less stuff leads to one key point : Less Software .
When you have less money , less people , less time , and less abstractions , you ’re going to be forced into developing Less Software .
And that ’s a great thing .
Less Software allows you to distribute your time and energy across less features .
More attention to less stuff will make that less stuff better .
100 % of your time across 20 things via 100 % of your time across 10 things will result in a very strong 10 things .
And that ’s the kind of software that is satisfying to build , and satisfying to use : simple , focused , useful software that ’s really polished .
And that ’s how you win these days .
6. More Constraints
I said I ’d discuss five things you need less of , but there is one thing you need more of : Constraints .
All this less is really about more constraints .
That ’s where you ’re forced to be creative .
That ’s where you ’re squeezed to make better use of your money , your people , your time .
And out of this squeeze will come better software , more satisfying software , and simpler solutions .
The truth is this :
There are a million simple problems that need to be solved before you should even consider trying to solve the complex ones .
Less software solves simpler problems .
Let your competitors kill themselves trying to solve the big complex problems .
Solving those problems are really hard , really expensive , and riddled with bad odds .
Stay simple , build simple , and solve simple .
UPDATE : Notes from my talk from Robert Kaye and an article from ZDnet .
Copycats
It ’s called “ splash - and - grab , ” and it ’s a new way to rob convenience stores .
Two guys walk into a store , and one comes up to the counter with a cup of hot coffee or cocoa .
He pays for it , and when the clerk opens the cash drawer , he throws the coffee in the clerk ’s face .
The other one grabs the cash drawer , and they both run .
Crimes never change , but tactics do .
This tactic is new ; someone just invented it .
But now that it ’s in the news , copycats are repeating the trick .
There have been at least 19 such robberies in Delaware , Pennsylvania and New Jersey .
( Some arrests have been made since then . )
Here ’s another example : On Nov. 24 , 1971 , someone with the alias Dan Cooper invented a new way to hijack an aircraft .
Claiming he had a bomb , he forced a plane to land and then exchanged the passengers and flight attendants for $ 200,000 and four parachutes .
( I leave it as an exercise for the reader to explain why asking for more than one parachute is critical to the plan ’s success . )
Taking off again , he told the pilots to fly to 10,000 feet .
He then lowered the plane ’s back stairs and parachuted away .
He was never caught , and the FBI still does n’t know who he is or whether he survived .
After this story hit the press , there was an epidemic of copycat attacks .
In 31 hijackings the following year , half of the hijackers demanded parachutes .
It got so bad that the FAA required Boeing to install a special latch — the Cooper Vane — on the back staircases of its 727s so they could n’t be lowered in the air .
The internet is filled with copycats .
Green - card lawyers invented spam ; now everyone does it .
Other people invented phishing , pharming , spear phishing .
The virus , the worm , the Trojan :
It ’s hard to believe that these ubiquitous internet attack tactics were , until comparatively recently , tactics that no one had thought of .
Most attackers are copycats .
They are n’t clever enough to invent a new way to rob a convenience store , use the web to steal money , or hijack an airplane .
They try the same attacks again and again , or read about a new attack in the newspaper and decide they can try it , too .
In combating threats , it makes sense to focus on copycats when there is a population of people already willing to commit the crime , who will migrate to a new tactic once it has been demonstrated to be successful .
In instances where there are n’t many attacks or attackers , and they ’re smarter — al - Qaida - style terrorism comes to mind — focusing on copycats is less effective because the bad guys will respond by modifying their attacks accordingly .
Compare that to suicide bombings in Israel , which are mostly copycat attacks .
The authorities basically know what a suicide bombing looks like , and do a pretty good job defending against the particular tactics they tend to see again and again .
It ’s still an arms race , but there is a lot of security gained by defending against copycats .
But even so , it ’s important to understand which aspect of the crime will be adopted by copycats .
Splash - and - grab crimes have nothing to do with convenience stores ; copycats can target any store where hot coffee is easily available and there is only one clerk on duty .
And the tactic does n’t necessarily need coffee ; one copycat used bleach .
The new idea is to throw something painful and damaging in a clerk ’s face , grab the valuables and run .
Similarly , when a suicide bomber blows up a restaurant in Israel , the authorities do n’t automatically assume the copycats will attack other restaurants .
They focus on the particulars of the bomb , the triggering mechanism and the way the bomber arrived at his target .
Those are the tactics that copycats will repeat .
The next target may be a theater or a hotel or any other crowded location .
The lesson for counterterrorism in America : Stay flexible .
We ’re not threatened by a bunch of copycats , so we ’re best off expending effort on security measures that will work regardless of the tactics or the targets : intelligence , investigation and emergency response .
By focusing too much on specifics — what the terrorists did last time — we ’re wasting valuable resources that could be used to keep us safer .

Humane Rat Removal
An analysis of inhumane glue traps for rats
There are various approaches to dispose of rodents , whether they are little mice or even rats , you must try to do it in the most ideal way possible , so that they will not continue to mess up your life with their presence .
Numerous individuals even today go straight for one of the cruelest methods for rodent catching strategies , and that is not the use of poison , but instead the glue traps .
The best thing about these traps is that they are inexpensive ; actually , you do n’t need anything but a piece of a cardboard with some paste and a little bit of bait in the center of the trap .
In any case once in a while you consider what those poor creatures are experiencing once they get into one of these unpleasant entanglements .
They are one of the cruelest approaches to use in an exertion against rats or mice .
This is because of the way that the creatures got in one of the glue traps will attempt steadily to free themselves , and they will endure all through the entire procedure .
The glue traps that you purchase in the store have guidelines on how you will use them to prevent killing the rat along the way , but if you will let the rat stay there for quite some time without checking , it might free itself or it may die because of starvation .
That will be a painful passing to this little creature .
However , you do take pity and still attempt to free the rat from the trap , you will gravely harm the poor animal in any event , gambling to break its appendages and tear of its hide .
One of the best responsibilities of the glue traps is that they do n’t pick their objectives , along these lines , significantly bigger creatures can get stuck in them too .
There were cases that even felines got in these traps and since , they are great hard to evacuate , as a rule the result of the cases would be alarming .
Also other animals may be trapped in the glue traps and then they will try hard to get out of it , which is not your goal in the first place .
At long last , regardless of the possibility that you utilize this strategy to manage your rodents , you ought to be watchful , since you will not just catch rats but other animals too , the caught rats will exhaust their guts if they stay in the paste for a developed timeframe and interacting with it can represent a wellbeing danger of exchanging unsafe illnesses , some of which can be deadly , as hantavirus .
In this way , deliberately consider the choices and the arrangements if you experience comparable issues later on , and stay away from the paste traps , since they are terrible in terms of catching rats .

Strasheela by Leonid Vladimirsky
Strasheela is a highly expressive constraint - based music composition system .
The Strasheela user declaratively states a music theory and the computer generates music which complies with this theory .
A theory is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem ( CSP ) by a set of rules ( constraints ) applied to a music representation in which some aspects are expressed by variables ( unknowns ) .
Music constraint programming is style - independent and is well - suited for highly complex theories ( e.g. a fully - fledged theory of harmony ) .
User - interface is the programming language Oz .
The results can be output into various formats including MIDI , Csound , and Lilypond .
News
For the lates changes check the development at GitHub .
14 April 2013 : Mozart ( and thus Strasheela ) does not start on MacOS Mountain Lion .
Snow Leopard works fine ( Lion was not tested ) .
We are investigating how to address this matter .
BTW : Mozart 2 will soon be released , but Strasheela would first need to be ported to that completely rewritten platform .
31 May 2012 : Strasheela development moved from SourceForge to GitHub ( and is now using Git instead of Subversion ) .
Nevertheless , other things stay at SourceForge ( e.g. , the website , mailing lists , releases ) .
30 April 2012 : Strasheela 0.10.1 released
This is the first release within the last three years .
Several important extensions have been added .
For example , constraints are available that control the rhythmic accent of notes ( their rhythmic weight ) depending on a wide range of musical features , including differences in duration , pitch intervals , presence of an anacrusis etc .
The metric position of notes can depend on their accent in various ways .
Texture constraints control whether a musical section is , say , homophonic , quasi - homophonic , homo - directional etc .
Arbitrary regular temperaments including extended just intonation are now supported .
Many further features were added , and bug fixes have been made as well ( see Changes ) .

Or , how to optimize MapReduce , and when folds are faster than loops
Purely functional programming might actually be worth the pain , if you care about large - scale optimization .
Lately , I 've been studying how to speed up parallel algorithms .
Many parallel algorithms , such as Google 's MapReduce , have two parts :
First , you transform the data by mapping one or more functions over each value .
Next , you repeatedly merge the transformed data , " reducing " it down to a final result .
Unfortunately , there 's a couple of nasty performance problems lurking here .
We really want to combine all those steps into a single pass , so that we can eliminate temporary working data .
But we do n't always want to do this optimization by hand --- it would be better if the compiler could do it for us .
As it turns out , Haskell is an amazing testbed for this kind of optimization .
Let 's build a simple model , show where it breaks , and then crank the performance way up .
Trees , and the performance problems they cause
We 'll use single - threaded trees for our testbed .
They 're simple enough to demonstrate the basic idea , and they can be generalized to parallel systems .
( If you want know how , check out the papers at the end of this article . )
A tree is either empty , or it is a node with a left child , a value and a right child :
data Tree a = Empty | Node ( Tree a ) a ( Tree a ) deriving ( Show )
Here 's a sample tree containing three values :
tree = ( Node left 2 right ) where left = ( Node Empty 1 Empty ) right = ( Node Empty 3 Empty )
We can use treeMap to apply a function to every value in a tree , creating a new tree :
treeMap :: ( a -> b ) ->
Tree a ->
Tree b treeMap f Empty = Empty treeMap f ( Node l x r ) = Node ( treeMap f l ) ( f x ) ( treeMap f r )
Using treeMap , we can build various functions that manipulate trees :
-- Double each value in a tree .
treeDouble tree = treeMap ( * 2 ) tree --
Add one to each value in a tree .
treeIncr tree = treeMap ( + 1 ) tree
What if we want to add up all the values in a tree ?
Well , we could write a simple recursive sum function :
treeSum Empty = 0 treeSum ( Node l x r ) = treeSum l + x + treeSum r
But for reasons that will soon become clear , it 's much better to refactor the recursive part of treeSum into a reusable treeFold function ( " fold " is Haskell 's name for " reduce " ) :
treeFold f b Empty = b treeFold f b ( Node l x r ) = f ( treeFold f b l ) x ( treeFold f b r ) treeSum t = treeFold ( \ l x r -> l + x + r ) 0 t
Now we can double all the values in a tree , add 1 to each , and sum up the result :
treeSum ( treeIncr ( treeDouble tree ) )
But there 's a very serious problem with this code .
Imagine that we 're working with a million - node tree .
The two calls to treeMap ( buried inside treeIncr and treeDouble ) will each create a new million - node tree .
Obviously , this will kill our performance , and it will make our garbage collector cry .
Fortunately , we can do a lot better than this , thanks to some funky GHC extensions .
Getting rid of the intermediate trees
So how do we get rid of those intermediate trees ?
Well , we could merge :
treeSum ( treeIncr ( treeDouble tree ) )
... into a single recursive call :
treeSumIncrDouble Empty = 0 treeSumIncrDouble ( Node l x r ) = treeSumIncrDouble l + ( x * 2 + 1 ) + treeSumIncrDouble r
But that 's ugly , because it breaks the encapsulation of treeSum , etc .
Worse , it requires us to manually intervene and write code every time we hit a bottleneck .
Now , here 's where the GHC magic comes in .
First , we add the following line to the top of our source file :
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -O -fglasgow - exts - ddump-simpl-stats #-}
This turns on optimization , enables certain GHC - specific extensions , and tells GHC to summarize the work of the optimizer .
( Also , we need to make sure that profiling is turned off , because it blocks certain optimizations . )
Next , let 's walk through the first optimization we want the compiler to perform --- merging two calls to treeMap into one :
treeIncr ( treeDouble tree ) -- Inline treeIncr , treeDouble treeMap ( + 1 ) ( treeMap ( * 2 ) tree ) --
Combine into a single pass treeMap (( + 1 ) . ( * 2 ) ) tree
Here 's the magic part .
We can use the RULES pragma to explain this optimization to the compiler :
{-# RULES " treeMap/ treeMap " forall f g t. treeMap f ( treeMap g t ) = treeMap ( f . g ) t #-}
Note that this is only valid in a pure functional language like Haskell !
If we were working in ML or Lisp , then f and g might have side effects , and we could n't safely combine the two passes without doing a lot more work . *
We can similarly merge an adjacent treeFold / treeMap pair into a single pass :
{-# RULES " treeFold / treeMap " forall f b g t. treeFold f b ( treeMap g t ) = treeFold ( \l x r -> f l ( g x ) r ) b t #-}
Using just these two rules , I saw a 225 % increase in the number of nodes processed per second .
Under the right circumstances , GHC can even outperform C code by applying these kinds of inter-procedural optimizations .
Where to learn more
Rewrite rules are documented in the GHC manual and on the Haskell Wiki .
Don Stewart also suggests using QuickCheck to verify the correctness of rewrite rules .
There 's also a lot of good papers on this subject .
Here are a few :
Enjoy !
( Special thanks to Don Stewart , who helped me get all this working .
See also his insanely optimized tree code for further performance ideas . )
After spending some time last month trying to develop alternate graphic presentations for kinematic ratios in winged flight , I decided to try to answer one of the timeless questions of science : just what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow ?
Since the range of the South African Swallow extends only as far north as Zaire , 2 I felt fairly confident that this was the non-migratory African species referred to in previous discussions of the comparative and cooperative weight - bearing capabilities of African and European swallows .
3
Although 47 of the 74 worldwide swallow species are found in Africa , 1 only two species are named after the continent : the West African Swallow ( Hirundo domicella ) and the South African Swallow ( Hirundo spilodera ) , also known as the South African Cave Swallow .
Kinematic data for both African species was difficult to find , but the Barn or European Swallow ( Hirundo rustica ) has been studied intensively , and kinematic data for that species was readily available .
It ’s a simple question of weight ratios
A 54 - year survey of 26,285 European Swallows captured and released by the Avian Demography Unit of the University of Capetown finds that the average adult European swallow has a wing length of 12.2 cm and a body mass of 20.3 grams .
4
Because wing beat frequency and wing amplitude both scale with body mass , 5 and flight kinematic data is available for at least 22 other bird species , 6 it should be possible to estimate the frequency ( f ) and amplitude ( A ) of the European Swallow by a comparison with similar species .
With those two numbers , it will be possible to estimate airspeed ( U ) .
In order to maintain airspeed velocity , a swallow needs to beat its wings forty - three times every second , right ?
Actually , wrong .
By comparing the European Swallow with bird species of similar body mass , we can estimate that the swallow beats its wings 18 times a second with an amplitude of 18 cm :
Species Body mass Frequency Amplitude Zebra Finch 13 g 27 Hz 11 cm European Swallow 20 g ≈ 18 Hz? ≈ 18 cm ? Downy Woodpecker 27 g 14 Hz 29 cm Budgerigar 34 g 14 Hz 15 cm
Note that even the tiny Zebra Finch flaps its wings no more than 27 times a second while cruising .
If we ignore body mass and look only at bird species with a similar wingspan , we can estimate an average frequency of 14 beats per second and an amplitude of 23 cm :
Species Wingspan Frequency Amplitude Budgerigar 27 cm 14 Hz 15 cm European Swallow ≈ 28–30 cm ≈ 14 Hz? ≈ 23 cm? Downy Woodpecker 31 cm 14 Hz 29 cm European Starling 35 cm 14 Hz 26 cm
By averaging all 6 values , we can estimate that an average European Swallow flies at cruising speed with a frequency of roughly 15 beats per second , and an amplitude of roughly 22 cm .
Skip a bit , Brother
Last month ’s article on The Strouhal Number in Cruising Flight showed how simplified flight waveforms that graph amplitude versus wavelength can be useful for visualizing the Strouhal ratio ( fA/U ) , a dimensionless parameter that tends to fall in the range of 0.2 –0.4 during efficient cruising flight .
For a European Swallow flying with our estimated wingbeat amplitude of 24 cm , the predicted pattern of cruising flight ranges from a Strouhal number ( St ) of 0.2 :
... to a less efficient 0.4 :
If the first diagram ( St = 0.2 ) is accurate , then the cruising speed of the European Swallow would be roughly 16 meters per second ( 15 beats per second * 1.1 meters per beat ) .
If the second diagram ( St = 0.4 ) is accurate , then the cruising speed of the European Swallow would be closer to 8 meters per second ( 15 beats per second * 0.55 meters per beat ) .
If we settle on an intermediate Strouhal value of 0.3 :
We can estimate the airspeed of the European Swallow to be roughly 11 meters per second ( 15 beats per second * 0.73 meters per beat ) .
Three shall be the number thou shalt count
Airspeed can also be predicted using a published formula .
By inverting this midpoint Strouhal ratio of 0.3 ( fA/ U ≈ 0.3 ) , Graham K. Taylor et al .
show that as a rule of thumb , the speed of a flying animal is roughly 3 times frequency times amplitude ( U ≈ 3 fA ) .
5
We now need only plug in the numbers :
U ≈ 3 fA
f ≈ 15 ( beats per second )
A ≈ 0.22 ( meters per beat )
U ≈ 3*15*0.22 ≈ 9.9
... to estimate that the airspeed velocity of an unladen European Swallow is 10 meters per second .
Oh , yeah , I agree with that
With some further study , it became clear that these estimates are accurate , though perhaps coincidental .
An actual study of two European Swallows flying in a low - turbulence wind tunnel in Lund , Sweden , shows that swallows flap their wings much slower than my estimate , at only 7 –9 beats per second :
“ Compared with other species of similar size , the swallow has quite low wingbeat frequency and relatively long wings . ”
7
The maximum speed the birds could maintain was 13 – 14 meters per second , and although the Lund study does not discuss cruising flight in particular , the most efficient flapping ( 7 beats per second ) occurred at an airspeed in the range of 8 – 11 meters per second , with an amplitude of 90 – 100° ( 17–19 cm ) .
And there was much rejoicing
Averaging the above numbers and plugging them in to the Strouhal equation for cruising flight ( fA / U = 7 beats per second * 0.18 meters per beat / 9.5 meters per second ) yields a Strouhal number of roughly 0.13 :
... indicating a surprisingly efficient flight pattern falling well below the expected range of 0.2 –0.4 .
Although a definitive answer would of course require further measurements , published species - wide averages of wing length and body mass , initial Strouhal estimates based on those averages and cross-species comparisons , the Lund wind tunnel study of birds flying at a range of speeds , and revised Strouhal numbers based on that study all lead me to estimate that the average cruising airspeed velocity of an unladen European Swallow is roughly 11 meters per second , or 24 miles an hour .

Here 's some tax trivia for you :
What is this year 's deadline for filing your taxes ?
If you answered April 15 , do n't feel bad .
In fact , over three quarters of 1,000 people polled in a recent survey failed to answer correctly .
Since Tax
Day deadline falls on a Sunday this year and because that Monday is a legal holiday in the District of Columbia , this year 's tax deadline is April 17 .
Granted keeping Tax Day straight is one thing , but other results from the survey , conducted by H&R Block , suggest a much bigger problem : Americans are pretty clueless when it comes to their taxes .
" The need to educate and inform our taxpayers about key issues is greater than ever , " said H&R Block tax professional Jackie Perlman .
Take this year 's telephone tax refund .
It 's a one - time refund available to anyone who has paid taxes on a land line , cell phone , fax or Internet phone service from March 2003 to July of last year , with the refund ranging between $ 30 to $ 60 .
It 's not a lot of cash , but according to H&R Block 's survey , only about 40 percent of taxpayers know about it .
There are even some taxpayers who are - incorrectly - seeking thousands of dollars from the telephone tax refund , according to the IRS .
Even not - so - new tax items were still foreign to a number of Americans , according to the survey .
Almost two - thirds of taxpayers did not know how much the Child Tax Credit is worth ( it 's $ 1,000 , which is available to parents with dependent children .
And less than half said they were familiar with the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) , which is affecting a growing number of Americans .
While ignorance can be bliss for those Americans that rely on a tax professional or tax preparation software like TurboTax , a lack of tax knowledge can be quite painful for a lot of Americans .
By not staying on top of changes to the tax law , Americans who handle their own return cannot take steps to minimize their tax bill , or they could miss out on a number of deductions .
Worse than that , they could get a bill from the IRS stating that they owe more money , or worse , face an audit .
Take the AMT for example .
A lot of Americans who put together their own return are assuming that it does not affect them .
As a result , said Tom Ochsenschlager , vice president of taxation at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants , people will get a notice from the IRS , stating that they still owe money .
" There are going to be some rude surprises coming to people who did n't think they were filing for AMT , " said Ochsenschlager .
So who 's to blame ?
In all fairness , the tax code is extremely complex , so it's hard to expect the average American without any formal training not to feel frustrated when filing out their annual return .
But it does n't help that Congress is constantly patching and changing the tax laws .
" Twenty years ago I do n't think it was quite as often , " explained Bob Scharin , a RIA senior tax analyst from Thomson Tax & Accounting .
" And that makes it hard to disseminate the latest info . "
AMT : Middle - class more at risk than millionaires

It ’s finally official : Ruby on Rails will ship with the next version of OS X ( see “ Internet and Web ” ) .
Both server and client ( on the developer DVD ) .
We ’ve been working with Apple for quite a while to make this happen and its great to finally be able to share it with the world .
The love for Ruby has definitely spread inside Apple and we ’ve been thrilled to see the level of interest they ’ve taken to get OS X to be a premiere development and deployment platform for Rails .
The developer seed that was distributed today at WWDC contains Ruby 1.8.4 and Rails 1.1.2 , but we fully expect to have Rails 1.2. x along with Mongrel , SQLite bindings , and lots of other Ruby goodies on the final gold master when it goes out in spring .
It ’s been no secret that Apple is held in very high regard by the Rails community .
Every single Rails Core contributer is running on Apple and the vast majority of Rails developers are too .
To see Apple acknowledge this and return the favor is very rewarding .
Thanks so much to Ernest Prabhakar , Jordan Hubbard , and Dave Morin for making this happen .

Sunnis believe that the security forces are carrying out sectarian reprisals , in part to combat the insurgency , but also in revenge for years of repression at the hands of Saddam Hussein 's government .
Ayad Allawi , a prominent Iraqi politician who is close to the Sunni community , charged in an interview published Sunday in The London Observer that the Iraqi government -- and the Ministry of Interior in particular -- was condoning torture and running death squads .
The allegations raise the possibility of the war being fought here by a set of far messier rules , as the Americans push more responsibility for fighting it onto the Iraqis .
One worry , expressed repeatedly by Americans and Iraqis here , is that an abrupt pullout of American troops could clear the way for a sectarian war .
One Sunni group taking testimony from families in Baghdad said it had documented the death or disappearance of 700 Sunni civilians in the past four months .
An investigator for the human rights organization said it had not been able to determine the number of executions carried out by the Iraqi security forces .
So far , the investigator said , the evidence was anecdotal , but substantial .
" There is no question that bodies are turning up , " said the investigator , who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity , citing safety concerns .
" Quite a few have been handcuffed and shot in the back of the head . "
As an example , the human rights investigator said that the group had been able to verify that a number of Sunni men taken from the Baghdad neighborhood of Huriya and shot to death last August .
Relatives of the dead told the group that more than 30 men had been taken from their homes by the Iraqi police in what appeared to be a roundup of Sunni males .

Previously mentioned on LtU , and now available ...
When the book was announced , Ehud said :
Authored by two of my favorites , Dan Friedman and Oleg , I have such high expectations , that however great the book is going to be , I am sure to be disappointed ...
After working through the first five chapters ( and sneaking a look at the implementation at the end ) , I 'm pleased to announce that no one is likely to be disappointed ...
It 's a real tour de force .
As expected , the focus this time is logic programming , in the form of a new set of primitives elegantly implemented around a backtracking monad in Scheme .
Of course the format is familiar and comfortable , and of course it 's charmingly illustrated by Duane Bibby .
So , get your copy today , and congratulations to the authors on a job well done !
Ground zero has gone through its own kind of war fatigue .
With every step forward in the reconstruction process , New Yorkers were asked to buy into the rhetoric of renewal , only to be confronted by images that reflect a city still in a state of turmoil and delusion .
Perhaps if we close our eyes , one might wishfully imagine , it will all just go away .
But the widely anticipated announcement that Gov. Eliot Spitzer will support the construction of the Freedom Tower may signal an end to any hope that a broad vision — or even a level of sanity — can be restored to a project tainted by personal hubris and political expediency .
The most recent debate over the tower has centered narrowly on real estate values .
With the developer Larry Silverstein set to build six million square feet of office space in three buildings just alongside the Freedom Tower , some have questioned whether it will be possible to lease enough of the $ 3 billion project at a high enough rate to make it profitable .
The tower ’s symbolism alone is likely to scare off tenants who will see it as a potential targets for terrorists .
The suggestion that we simply pack the building with government offices is almost perversely Strangelove -ian .
Yet the problem is not simply whether enough bureaucrats can be coerced into working there one day ; it ’s also what the building expresses as a work of architecture .
Governor Spitzer may recall the looming presence of the twin towers on the downtown skyline , at once proud and intimidating ; the Freedom Tower will have an equally powerful effect on the daily lives of New Yorkers as well as on the city ’s image throughout the world .
Yet its message will be very different from the old towers .

Procrastination can drive most of us into a spiral of shame that ’s as mundane as it is painfully personal .
We know what we should be doing , but some invisible hang - up keeps us on the line .
Unfortunately , the guaranteed consequence of procrastination is growth in the scale of the task you ’ve been putting off — as well as the anxiety that it creates .
All the time you ’re putting something off , your problem ’s getting bigger — both in reality and in your head , where your colorful imagination is liable to turn even the most trivial item into an unsolvable juggernaut that threatens to overwhelm you .
And that means extra stress , more procrastination , and the music goes round .
My favorite tonic for procrastination — which I have mentioned in passing previously — is what I call a dash , which is simply a short burst of focused activity during which you force yourself to do nothing but work on the procrastinated item for a very short period of time — perhaps as little as just one minute .
By breaking a few tiny pebbles off of your perceived monolith , you end up psyching yourself out of your stupor , as well as making much - needed progress on your overdue project .
Neat , huh ?
Why the Heck Should This Work ?
By making even the most modest bit of progress on your hated task , you ’ve done what once seemed impossible : you got started .
When you realize how much of the anxiety you ’d experienced was created in your head , you ’ll experience huge relief and give yourself the jolt needed to get back on track .
You can do a dash any time and for virtually any kind of project .
The task has not been conceived that cannot be made smaller and more dash - able .
Three kinds of dashes
Try using a kitchen timer
to run your time - based dash .
Plan your dash based on whatever works best for both your project and the particular block that 's hanging you up .
The key is to pick a goal that 's laughably modest .
Seriously , this is not the place for extravagant predictions and overly ambitious goals ( that 's probably what helped land you here , right ? ) .
Time - based dash - Most jobs lend themselves to a time - based dash , so pick up a kitchen timer at your local drugstore .
Choose an amount of time that gives you enough room to do something but that 's brief enough to seem completely unintimidating .
For some reason , eight minutes seems to work well for most of my own dashes .

For some reason , eight minutes seems to work well for most of my own dashes .
Unit - based dash - Alternatively , depending on the tasks you 've been avoiding , you could go with a unit - based dash , during which you agree to plow through an arbitrary number of pieces associated with your project ( such as pages to read , words to write , glasses to wash , etc. ) .
- Alternatively , depending on the tasks you 've been avoiding , you could go with a , during which you agree to plow through an arbitrary number of pieces associated with your project ( such as pages to read , words to write , glasses to wash , etc. ) .
Combination dash -
In many cases , the best solution is a combination dash , in which you get to stop the hated work whenever you reach either the time or unit goal first .
Above all , remember that this is all about doing something , so pick a goal at which you can't possibly fail .
Some Sample Dashes
Here are a few ideas to get you started , although dashes can work for virtually any project you 've procrastinated -- no matter how monolithic .
Messy garage - Goal : 10 minutes or 1 full garbage bag .

Two Dartmouth researchers have learned more about how the human brain interprets the actions and intentions of others .
Scott Grafton , professor of psychological and brain sciences , and Antonia Hamilton , a post - doctoral fellow , have learned that the brain 's parietal cortex handles how we understand the goals of other people 's actions .
Their study was published on January 25 by The Journal of Neuroscience .
" We were able to find the part of the brain involved in interpreting the goal of another person , even if no words are spoken , " says Hamilton .
" When you see another person reach for an object that they want , like a cookie , a bit of brain called the anterior intraparietal sulcus , which is found in the parietal lobe , is strongly activated . "
She explains that their result is surprising because many would have predicted that the frontal cortex , normally associated with language and understanding , would be activated in this situation , not the parietal cortex , usually thought to be involved with space and movement .
Also , Hamilton says that with this study , they have shown it 's possible to localize abstract things , like goals , in the brain .
" So , as we learn more about how the brain responds to seeing other people do things , we can start to understand the neural basis of human social interactions .
This may help us understand what goes wrong in impaired social interactions , like in children with autism , who sometimes fail to interpret actions correctly . "
The study involved twenty participants who watched a series of short movies , shown in a random order , while their brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The movies depicted a hand reaching , grasping , and taking one of two objects .
For example , a hand takes a cookie or takes a computer disk .
The participants then answered yes or no questions that elicited their understanding of the goals involved of the actions represented in movies .
The study was funded by the James S. McDonnell Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .

Punish Him !
Punish Him !
He broke the regulations !
A fireman is facing disciplinary action after plunging into a river to rescue a drowning woman .
Tam Brown , 42 , is the subject of an internal investigation by Tayside Fire and Rescue because he breached safety rules during the rescue in the River Tay in Perth .
...
Mr Brown , who has 15 years ’ experience as a fireman , was hailed as a hero by the young woman ’s family but Tayside Fire and Rescue said that he had broken the brigade ’s “ standing instructions ” on safety procedures .
...
Mr Brown said : “ We had seconds to act .
The girl was losing consciousness .
We had one harness , so I put that on and went down 20ft on a safety line , grabbed her and held her out of the water .
My colleagues tried to pull us towards steps , but the current was so bad and the rope was pulled so hard it snapped .
“ My own life hung in the balance as I swam for the steps with her in my arms .
But we got there and were pulled out .
I was in the water for eight minutes and it was heart - stoppingly cold , but we saved her . ”
...
The brigade ’s rules state : “ Personnel should not enter the water . ”
The fire crew should instead have tried to haul the woman out using poles and ropes .
Stephen Hunter , chief fire officer of Tayside Fire and Rescue , admitted that fire engines in Perth were not equipped with the correct poles and ropes , but insisted that Mr Brown had broken the rules .
He said : “ Firefighter safety is of paramount importance to us .
Although our duties include rescues from flooding , there is no statutory obligation to carry out rescues from moving water .
There was a time when we gave medals , signs of our social approval , of those who risked their lives to save others .
Now , we discipline them because they breach the regulations .
Note that " no statutory obligation " .
Weasel words , vile .
Anyone know where I can purchase a job lot of tumbrils ?

When the chief fire officer cares more about the risk of being sued by an employee over a breach of H&S than a member of the public coming to harm due to inaction by those employees , it 's time for him to go & find another career ...

One has to wonder if the Fire Chief is capable of providing appropriate leadership to his officers .
I would suggest not .
In addition , he certainly does not appear to understand his responsibilities vis-a - vis the public .

We 're terribly sorry about the death of your loved one , and I can assure you my men are all deeply traumatised at having to stand by and watch it happen , I should n't wonder if the entire crew is n't on stress leave for the next couple of years .
Anyhow , as I was saying , we 're terribly sorry but we are under no statutory obligation to carry out rescues from moving water , as this helpful leaflet will explain to you .
Now had your loved one had the presence of mind to fall into static water we'd have been only too happy to help .
Is there anything else I can help you with , inspect your home for fire safety , develop an escape plan ?
If there 's anything we can do , just ask , we 're here to help after all .
Pall bearers at the funeral ?
Ah , well , heavy lifting and we 're under no statutory obligation to carry coffins , plus there 's the chance of further traumatisation .
Why do n't I just give you this non -toxic fridge magnet , it 's got our number on it so you 'll always know what number to call if you need us ?

While I agree that Mr Hunter is clearly a disgrace , I wonder if his concern about statutory responsibilities may be inspired by the Brigade 's insurance cover in case Mr Brown had been injured or even killed in the course of his heroic rescue .
I mean , if the insurance policy covers only death or injuries sustained during the course of the fireman carrying out his lawful duties and someone 's advised the brigade that this may be construed as duties imposed by statutory obligation , then presumably he 's worried the insurers might refuse to settle claim .
Then we get into very nasty territory about who , if anyone , should pay the fireman 's grieving family the death benefits to which they thought they were entitled .
I do n't know if the policy could thus be construed ( presumably we'd have to have someone who knows about such things look at the precise wording ) but , in my experience , it 's usually insurance companies , who obviously do n't want to give away the shareholder 's money unlawfully , and public bodies who 're trying to be prudent with public money by purchasing the least expensive ( and , therefore , usually the most restrictive ) cover who 're behind this sort of ' health and safety nonsense ' story .

My father was a fireman and retired from that profession .
I can still remember how he smelled when he came home , especially after a very bad day " at the office " .
I remember hearing him cry because another human being could not be saved .
It did n't matter how old , what color , race etc .
My father 's job was to save lives and he did .
He even did it off duty and received many awards .
What is wrong with society that another human being could be disciplined for saving anothers life ?
I do n't care what the rules are .
It is everyones job , duty , responsibility to do the right thing if a situation is presented .
Too many people find it too convenient to look the other way .
One day each and every one of us will need someone to " look our way " and help .
This article is pure b.s. and Stephen Hunter is a coward .
He should be standing up for his " brother " instead of being a pussy .

This firefighter was extremely lucky .
The article we read could have been about how a firefighter went in after a woman , they drowned , his friends went in to try to help him and they all drowned as well .
I occationally read articles about how more than one member of a family has died because they all went in one after another to try to help .
As an ex-lifeguard and EMT , our training tells us first and foremost NOT to endanger ourselves .
Adding ourselves to the list of those who need to be rescued does n't make any situation better .
If this story had taken that tragic turn , we all would have been complaining about the stupidity of those who do n't follow their training .

" If this story had taken that tragic turn , we all would have been complaining about the stupidity of those who do n't follow their training . "
I think not .
I 've seen plenty of stories like this one and never once thought that in my entire life .
The only thought that has crossed my mind when seeing situations such as that is , " That 's exactly what I would have done . "
I do n't know about the rest of everyone else , but I 'd rather die early then live on knowing I just stood by and watched others die .

As pointed out earlier , if this were true , you 'd be no use whatsoever .
If firemen 's training was first and foremost not to endanger themselves , they 'd never go into burning buildings ; if lifeguards ' training was first and foremost not to endanger themselves , they 'd never try to swim through choppy water while carrying a half - drowned man .

My real problem here is this :
" Stephen Hunter , chief fire officer of Tayside Fire and Rescue , admitted that fire engines in Perth were not equipped with the correct poles and ropes , but insisted that Mr Brown had broken the rules . "
... So this guy 's getting disciplined for improvising because the department had n't provided the right equipment for the job ?
I 'd like Stephen Hunter disciplined for putting his staff in unnecessary danger like this .
How is he responsible ?
because , as Not Saussure eloquently demonstrates , the kind of person who becomes a firefighter is the kind of person who _will not_ walk away from someone in need .
So , Isabeau , What was his choice ?
Stand and watch a death , or improvise with what was to hand ?
Which would you choose ?
... and remember , you have to sleep tonight knowing what you chose .

I think most of you are missing the point .
" Disciplanary action " is mandatory in a situation like this .
At no point did the Chief say anything about being disappointed in the rescuer , or anything of the sort .
The rules are in place , at least in my opinion , for 1 reason .
Its beyond the point of rational risk .
The Firefighter risked his own life beyond a reasonable point when he dove into the water .
Yes , he 's a hero , and was victorious , but he just as easily could have been swept away and both would have died .
Consider another situation .
A Firefighter charges into an inferno despite the fact that all predictions point to the fact that the building wont last another minute without collapsing .
he emerges with a child in his arms moments before the building collapses .
Is he a hero ?
Yes .
Should he disciplined ?
Yes .
Why ?
Because he broke protocol and entered a situation where chance of rescue was very slim , and his life was in very real , very imminent danger .
If everyone acted like this we'd have alot less firefighters .
Thats why Rules are in place .
No one likes to hear statistics applied to humans lives , but its necessary .
If the odds are overwhelmingly negative , the end result will be 2 dead people instead of 1 .
I had some trouble phrasing this correctly , Hope it was clear to everyone .

Spanners is right on the button .
If you have seen a FF die or been to a FF funeral you know these " rules " are there to protect .
As manchester if they would turn the clock back and prevent one of our own from entering the water .
Ask other brigades that have had to break the news to the family .
Ask yourself - could you do that bit .
In 32 years I have broken lots of rules and by chance got away with it .
I have been to too many funerals in the country where my mates have paid the price

Scientists in the United States have come up with a breath test which can detect lung cancer in patients even when it is in the early stages of the disease .
By means of a simple colour test which shows up unique chemical changes in the breath of people with lung cancer , the disease was accurately detected in just under three out of four people with the disease .
By using a sensor just slightly bigger than a coin , which is relatively cheap and easy to use , unique chemical changes in the breath of people with lung cancer could be seen with a series of coloured dots .
After breathing into the device for 12 minutes the hues of a series of 36 dots provide a gas fingerprint for lung cancer .
This is not a new concept as experts have known for many years that the chemical composition of a person 's breath changes when they develop lung cancer .
Dogs with their keen sense of smell , have been shown to be able to distinguish the breath of patients with lung cancer from that of healthy people .
In 2006 , researchers found dogs could be trained to smell cancer on the breath of patients with 99 percent accuracy .
The scientists from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio say this is because lung cancer cells give off chemicals , called volatile organic compounds or VOCs , which are then breathed out .
The test could save tens of thousands of lives a year in the United States alone and revolutionise the way cancer is detected .
A type of X - ray called spiral computed tomography or CT can find lung cancer early , but it is expensive and also finds non-cancerous lesions that are expensive and risky to test .
The machines are expensive to use and require specially trained experts to interpret the results .
The researchers say in contrast , the colour sensor is cheap and easy to read as the spots on the sensor change colour according to the chemicals with which they come into contact .
The researchers used the colour sensor to test the breath of 143 people , some with various types of lung cancer , some with other lung diseases such as emphysema and some healthy .
It was able to accurately predict the presence of cancer in just under three out of four of those with lung cancer , including very early tumours .
This is significant because lung cancer is often silent in its early stages and difficult to diagnose which is the stage when it could be treated effectively .
Lead researcher Dr. Peter Mazzone and his team say the research could lead to an inexpensive , non-invasive screening or diagnostic test for lung cancer .
Other experts agree that there is a desperate need to diagnose the disease earlier as currently the onus is on people coming forward with symptoms , or a suspect chest x-ray picked up purely by chance .
At present in the UK the five - year survival for lung cancer is only seven out of 100 and within one year from diagnosis almost 80 % are dead because people are picked up when the disease is advanced .
Last year lung cancer was diagnosed in more than 174,000 Americans and killed more than 160,000 .
The disease kills 1.3 million people globally every year .
Arabic - language media have an unprecedented chance to take over as the world 's premier news source because trust in their US counterparts plummeted following their " shameful coverage " of the war in Iraq , a conference heard today .
The US media reached an " all - time low " in failing to reflect public opinion and Americans ' desire for trusted information , instead acting as a " cheerleader " for war , said Amy Goodman , the executive producer and host of US TV and radio news show Democracy Now ! , at a news forum organised by al - Jazeera .
Newsweek 's Paris bureau chief , Christopher Dickey , said the US media were dying because of cutbacks and were n't interested in covering the world outside America .
But other delegates questioned whether Arabic media were up to the challenge .
" The US media have done a shameful job of reporting on the Arab world .
With the rise of al - Jazeera and independent media there is a chance for the Arab media to react back , but instead what we get is a clash , " said Ethan Zuckerman , the co-founder of Global Voices Online and research fellow at the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School .
" I would urge everyone involved with new Arabic media not just to report on this [ Arabic ] world more fairly and accurately , but to report on the whole world more fairly and accurately .
I challenge al - Jazeera and the new Arabic media players to do a better job that the US in covering the rest of the world , " he said .
Ms Goodman said in the run-up to the Iraq war a study of NBC , CBS , ABC and PBS newscasts over a fortnight recorded 393 interviews on the conflict , of which only three reported the anti-war movement .
" This is a media cheerleading for war and does not represent mainstream opinion in the US , " she added .
Ms Goodman said she believed the policy of embedding reporters with coalition forces was " a total failure for independent journalism ... western audiences need to see the other side of the story - from communities and hospitals " .
" If people in the US had a true picture of war - dead babies , women with their legs blown off , dead and dying soldiers - they would say ' no ' , " she said .
" There is nothing more important than the media - it is more powerful than any bomb or missile and we have to take it back ... we need a media that is independent and honestly showing us the images , the hell , ugliness and brutality of war , not selling us war . "
Mr Dickey , the Middle East regional editor and Paris bureau chief at Newsweek magazine , said US media were " dying " .
" After 25 years as a foreign correspondent I know what the US wants from the rest of the world : to forget about it . "
" There 's this idea that the US media is controlling the agenda .
In fact the US media is dying .
Resources , money and staff are being cut back .
Twenty years ago Newsweek had 25 staff in Paris , today it has one : me , " said Mr Dickey .
He added that the gap between what the US and Arabic media reports was widening .
with American reports being " all about victory and the Arabic being all about victims " .
Faisal al - Kasim , host of al - Jazeera 's The Opposite Direction show , said that as a result of a perceived failure of western media to reflect the full picture more people were turning to Arabic media .
" Even Arabs who live in the west are giving up watching western networks and tuning to Arabic networks instead , " Mr al - Kasim said .
However , concerns were aired at today 's conference about the ability of the Arabic media to operate independently .
Lawrence Pintak , a director of the Adham Centre for Electronic Journalism and a former CBS foreign correspondent , urged delegates against thinking that Arabic media were allowed the freedoms to which western journalists were accustomed .
" I am concerned that someone from the US or Europe who does n't know the Arabic world will think that all is goodness and light when we know that is not the case , " he said , citing the beating of journalists during the Egyptian elections and the detention of journalists in Yemen and Morocco .
However , Mr Pintak there was a " great sense of possibility " about journalism in the Arabic world , likening it to the interest in the profession in the US following Watergate .
Concerns were also aired about the ability of al - Jazeera 's soon - to - launch English language station , al - Jazeera International , to reproduce the success of its main Arabic network across the world .
" We might as well buy a new channel in the US , " Mahmud Shammam , the bureau chief for the Dar Al Watan newspaper and Newsweek Arabic .
" [ Al - Jazeera International ] will not have Arabic characteristics and that 's a big challenge . "
Hugh Miles , a journalist and United Nations media consultant , said al - Jazeera was massively popular in north Africa but because conspiracy theories about its agenda were rife , the new English - language channel would be watched very carefully .
" If al - Jazeera International is perceived to be biased or insensitive to Islam - on the Danish cartoon issues for example - there will be a loss of faith in the al - Jazeera brand , " he said .
" The Arabic service has done a tremendous job in establishing al - Jazeera as a trusted name .
It would be a terrible shame to see that image jeopardised . "
But the director of al - Jazeera 's research centre , Mostefa Souag , attempted to allay fears about the new channel , saying the network 's managing director , Wadah Khanfar , has confirmed its editorial stance " will not be far away " from its sister station .

So if the military trusts you with some of the most deadly and destructive weapons known to man , the logical thought would be that they would also trust you to handle yourself around alcohol , right ?
Wrong .
“ For all other 2ID Soldiers who choose to consume alcohol , they must do so responsibly at all times .
Specifically , they will moderate their alcohol consumption and not consume alcohol to the extent that their blood alcohol content ( BAC ) is above .10 . ”
Yes , you heard correctly .
The Army ’s 2nd Infantry Division ( responsible for most of the U.S. Army personnel in South Korea ) has mandated that no one under its command will have a BAC above .10 % .
Ever .
What is the reason given for this drastic action ?
“ All 2ID Soldiers must be in a high state of readiness and must be able to respond immediately and decisively in order to perform their armistice and wartime fighting mission .
Irresponsible alcohol consumption is harmful to that readiness and detracts from training .
Furthermore , alcohol - related incidents by 2ID Soldiers can have strategic consequences and can jeopardize the important relationships we maintain with the Republic of Korea .
Furthermore , there has been shown to be a direct correlation between alcohol abuse and misconduct ( e.g. , sexual assault offenses ) .
Therefore , we must ensure that irresponsible alcohol consumption does not deter 2ID from accomplishing its armistice training or wartime fighting mission , and does not endanger the lives and well - being of 2ID Soldiers and others .
We must also establish and maintain a Warrior ethos that deglamoratizes alcohol and promotes early identification and treatment of abusers . ”
Makes perfect sense to me .
Actually , if you dig a little deeper you ’ll find that this policy is an attempt to help cut down on the number of underage drinkers .
Of course , this raises the question of why we have the idiotic 21 year old age limit on alcohol in the first place , but that ’s a battle for a different day .
The bottom line is that the 2ID has decided that the solution to underage drinking is to punish everyone and try to control soldiers ’ behavior when they are off duty .
I wonder how many otherwise good soldiers careers are going to be adversely affected when they blow a .11 % BAC ?
In any case , this is just the latest in a series of actions by the U.S. military to increasingly control the off - duty lives of its personnel .
My favorite is the USAF ’s “ Culture of Responsible Choices . ”
It ’s a sad commentary on our culture that even the military has been affected this deeply by nannyism .
Mr. Carter 's opponents mounted a rhetorically brilliant attack on his proposal , arguing that because consumers would get back every cent they paid in gasoline taxes , they could , and would , buy just as much gasoline as before .
Many found this argument compelling , and in the end , President Carter 's proposal won just 35 votes in the House of Representatives .
The experience appears to have left an indelible imprint on political decision makers .
To this day , many seem persuaded that tax - cum - rebate proposals do not make economic sense .
But it is the argument advanced by Mr. Carter 's critics that makes no sense .
It betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how such a program would alter people 's opportunities and incentives .
Some examples help to illustrate how the program would work .
On average , a family of four currently consumes almost 2,000 gallons of gasoline annually .
If all families continued to consume gasoline at the same rate after the imposition of a $ 2 - a - gallon gasoline tax , the average family would pay $ 4,000 in additional gasoline taxes annually .
A representative family with two earners would then receive an annual payroll tax refund of $ 4,000 .
So , if all other families continued to buy as much gasoline as before , then , this family 's tax rebate would enable it to do so as well , just as Mr. Carter 's critics claimed .
But that is not how things would play out .
Suppose , for example , that the family was about to replace its aging Ford Explorer , which gets 15 miles per gallon .
It could buy another Explorer .
Or it could buy Ford 's new Focus wagon , which has almost as much cargo capacity and gets more than 30 miles per gallon .
The latter choice would save a whopping $ 2,000 annually at the pump .
Not all families would switch , of course , but many would .
From the experience of the 1970's , we know that consumers respond to higher gasoline prices not just by buying more efficient cars , but also by taking fewer trips , forming carpools and moving closer to work .
If families overall bought half as much gasoline as before , the rebate would be not $ 2,000 per earner , but only $ 1,000 .
In that case , our representative two - earner family could not buy just as much gasoline as before unless it spent $ 2,000 less on everything else .
So , contrary to Mr. Carter 's critics , the tax - cum - rebate program would profoundly alter not only our incentives but also our opportunities .

Nine north - eastern states are poised to sign an agreement setting Kyoto - style legal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power stations .
California is hoping to cut emissions from cars by 30 %
And in California , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is forging ahead with legislation to cut emissions from cars by 30 % within a decade .
This could transform the motor industry .
Meanwhile , 187 mayors from US towns and cities , representing 40 million people , have pledged to adopt Kyoto targets for reducing greenhouse gases .
Some leading American transnational firms are also demanding mandatory cuts in CO2 so that they are not isolated as the developed world moves towards a low - carbon economy .
It is all happening despite President Bush 's outright rejection of the Kyoto climate protocol , which he said would cost American jobs .
' Intensity '
The Bush administration does now acknowledge that global warming is a problem , and that it is partly caused by human activity .
Its strategy is to cut greenhouse gas " intensity " - jargon for cutting the amount of harmful gases produced for every unit of US economic output .
Some big industrial companies want a tougher line on greenhouse gases
Not good enough , say the north - eastern states .
That is because under Mr Bush 's plan , as the economy grows , the amount of greenhouse gases will grow too , albeit more slowly .
Their Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ( Reggie ) gives power stations binding targets for cutting their CO2 emissions .
They can either do that by installing new cleaner technology , or by buying CO2 allowances from other companies who have cut their CO2 beyond the target .
Carbon allowances thus become a tradable commodity , and there is money to be made for firms that clean up their act .
Economy
The states admit it will increase energy prices slightly at a bad time for consumers .
And President Bush fears that putting a price on carbon will damage the economy .
But the emissions trading system invented by the US to control sulphur has been used successfully for 15 years without great cost .
No -one is pretending that Reggie will quickly solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions - its initial timetable and targets are modest .
But like Kyoto itself , the aim is to put a mechanism in place that can be built upon in the future .
In California they think they can be bolder .
Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to force vehicle manufacturers to cut greenhouse gas emissions from their products by a third within a decade - not so much guiding the market as holding it in an arm -lock .
If the legislation survives legal challenges , other US states will follow California 's lead , along with Japan and perhaps even China .
No car manufacturer in the world will be able to ignore the requirement for lower CO2 emissions .
The " gas muzzlers " really will have made their point .

I 've been enjoying Eric Kidd 's articles on probability theory with Haskell .
So I thought I 'd follow them up with two things : ( 1 ) finding the underlying algebraic structure and ( 2 ) showing how it 's general enough to do more than just probability .
Firstly , Eric found a really neat factoring of the probability monad as a ' product ' of two monads : themonad and themonad .
This factoring can be interpreted algebraically .
monoid is defined to be a set m with a binary operator ( typically written as abuttal , ie .
the product of a and b is ab ) that is associative , and with an element , 1 , that is an identity for the binary operator .
Themonad gives rise to the monoid freely generated by a set , in other words it defines the smallest monoid containing the set and with no extra relationships between the elements that do n't come from the definition of a monoid .
The binary operator foris calledand we embed the original set in the monoid using the function , otherwise known asis the identity .
It 's not hard to see that we have asociativity as .
If we useinstead ofthen we get the free commutative monoid instead , ie .
one where a +b=b+a. ( Eh ?
Where 's my paragraph on m-sets .
Do n't tell me I have to format all those HTML subscripts again !
I hate it when computers do that .
I wrote a paragraph and it just vanished .
Oh well , maybe version 2.0 will be better .
But without subscripts this time ... )
If m is a monoid then an m - set is a set s with an action of m on it .
An action of a monoid on a set is a scheme that converts each element of the monoid , say g , into a map g:S→S so that 1is the identity map and g=( gh ) .
The typecorresponds to pairs in s×m but this also doubles as the free m-set .
We simply define f( x , g ) =( x , fg ) .
It 's free because we never get f( x , f' ) =g ( x ' , g ' ) unless x=x ' , so we never get any surprising equalities that are n't inherent in the definition of an m-set. , which is actually a pseudonym for , defines an - set , whereis the monoid of reals under multiplication .
In an earlier post I showed how you could layer up algebraic structures .
There I showed that you could combine a commutative monoid structure with a monoid structure to get a semiring .
So what happens if we layer up a commutative monoid and an m-set ?
We 'll get something that has a commutative binary operator but that can also be acted on my elements of m .
Specialise to the case when m is a field like the real or complex numbers .
Does this sound like a familiar structure ?
I hope so , it 's a description of a vector space .
What Eric Kidd has shown is that we can build a vector space monad by applying an m -set monad transformer ( with m a field ) to a commutative monoid monad .
( This is n't a completely trivial fact and it depends on the fact that the definition ofhandles distributivity correctly . )
I think that 's pretty neat .
But I 'm getting slightly ahead of myself here as I have n't shown what Eric 's stuff has to do with vector spaces .
A probability distribution can be thought of as a vector with outcomes forming a basis .
Any distribution attaches a probability ' weight ' to each possible outcome in the same way that a vector can be written as a weighted sum of basis elements .
Each time we have a probabilistic transition , we 're effectively multiplying our distribution vector by a stochastic matrix .
Eric ( and others ) 's monad allows you to write these matrix multiplications in a very natural way .
A vector space forms a monad in a straightforward way .
If V( B ) is the vector space generated by basis B , and V( C ) is another vector space , then any function B→V ( C ) can be lifted to a linear map V ( B ) →V ( C ) .
This lift is clearly of type ( B→V ( C ) ) → ( V( B ) →V ( C ) ) .
With a little flip we get V ( B ) →( B→V ( C ) ) →V( C ) .
This is the main step in showing V to be a monad .
And what the probability monad allows us to do is write our stochastic matrices in terms of what happens to the individual basis elements ( ie. outcomes ) instead of having to write out the entire matrix .
Anyway , this is all just waffle and it really needs some code to make it more concrete .
I have an ulterior motive here .
It 's not just probability theory that is described by vector spaces .
So is quantum mechanics .
And I plan to work my way up to defining quantum computers and implementing a bunch of well known quantum algorithms in Haskell .
In the next installment I expect to get at least as far as writing the code to play with the square root of NOT operator .
PS
This idea of layering up algebraic structures is one I have n't found in the textbooks yet .
I 'm guessing it's in Mac Lane , but I have n't yet justified the cost of that book to myself .
But I do n't actually have a clue what a category theorist would call a monad transformer and do n't recall reading about them in any texts that were n't specifically about computer science .
Maybe someone else can fill me in .
I do know that it 's absolutely standard to get free algebraic structures from monads .
Errata :
As notfancy points out , I should really be talking about multisets rather than sets , otherwise we have a +a=a .
As programmers often use lists to represent both sets and multisets it can sometimes get confusing .

MySpace is launching a news aggregator called MySpace News in the second quarter of 2007 .
It 'll rely on both algorithms and user rating - basically a combination of Google News and Digg .
You 'll remember that Fox acquired the news aggregator NewRoo about a year ago , so it 's taken them a long time to get to the product stage .
The feature list , via Terry Heaton :
* MySpace News takes News to a whole new level by dynamically aggregating real - time news and blogs from top sites around the Web
* Creates focused , topical news pages that users can interact and engage with throughout their day
* MySpace is making the news social , allowing users to :
- Rate and comment on every news item that comes through the system
- Submit stories they think are cool and even author pieces from their MySpace blog
* MySpace users previously had to leave the site to find comprehensive news , gossip , sporting news , etc. With MySpace News , we bring the news to them !
It 's kind of obvious when you think about it : a news company launching a news site .
Not many details yet , but you can't deny this will be a game changer .
Like Google News , they 'll be aggregating news sources from around the web - that could raise the same issues that YouTube and MySpace video are facing : do the other newspapers really want News Corp to package their news ?
Of course they do n't .
It 'll also be interesting to see what the MySpace demographic selects as the most important news of the day : just like Digg users focus on Apple , the RIAA , Google and how awesome Digg is , we can probably expect MySpace users to talk about celebrity news and other mainstream , lowest common denominator stuff .
I call this a win for the celebrity blogs , if they can seek inclusion .
Perhaps MySpace news will succeed where NooZ failed - NooZ , you 'll remember , tried to build a " Digg for MySpace users " , but failed to target the content to that demographic .
I wonder if we 'll also be seeing MySpace News Widgets to post to your profile , " MySpace This " buttons , and the " MySpace effect " .
Interesting development .

インドの経済は好調で、その状況はウェブ市場にも反映されている。インドは11億人の人口を抱えており、国民の平均年齢は24.9歳と若い。インドのGDP成長率は8％以上であり、長年、農産業の比重が高かったが、今ではサービス産業がGDPの50％以上を占めるようになった。インドが1年あたり35万人の新しいエンジニアを生み出していながら、この高いGCP成長率が要求する大学卒業者の求人を満たしきれない状況であるのは、このサービス産業の伸びが好調である証だろう（出典 : LA Times）。
インターネット利 用
インドのインターネットユーザー数は、4500万人から5000万人と推定されている。インターネットユーザー数では、インドは世界第4位に位置している。ユーザー数でインドを上回るのは、米国、中国、日本だけだ。ただし、インドは人口が多いことから、インターネット普及率は4.5％に過ぎず、これは世界最低の水準だ。それに加え、ユーザーのうちオンラインで商品を購入するほどのヘビーユーザーは1000万人に過ぎないと見積もられている。インド市場は成長の余地が大きいように見えるが、contentSutraに引用された最近の報告書によると「クリティカルマスを確保する道のりはまだ遠い」とされている。別の問題として、インドでは主要なものだけでも23の言語が話されているということがある。
インドでポピュラーなウェブアプリケーション
注意：インドのすべてのウェブアプリケーションを扱うことはとてもできない。ぜひコメント欄で他のインドのウェブアプリケーションを紹介してほしい。
インドのeBay
4Bazee.com（ヒンディ語で「賭け金」を示す）がeBayに買収された時点では、このサイトがインドで最初にこの市場に乗り出したものだったと思われる。このサイトはインドで非常に成功しており、今も成長している。
結婚紹介サイ ト
インドには結婚紹介サイトが多くある。完全なリストは、http://indiaupcoming.com/tag/matrimonialで参照できる。その中でも、Shaddi.comとBharatMatrimony.comの2つが最も成功しているサイトだろう。両方とも、地方言語への対応を広げる計画である。
旅行サイ ト
オンラインの旅行関連産業はインドの旅行関連市場の2.2％を占めるに過ぎないが、高い成長の可能性を持っており、この分野は競争が激化している。なかでも、MakeMyTrip.comが大変成功しているが、このサイトはYatra.comやArzoo.comなどの他の有名なサイトとの激しい競争に直面している。ArzooはHotmailの共同創業者であるSabeer Bhatia氏によって設立されていることにも触れておくべきだろう。
Quantifying Soft Factors
The role that soft , human - oriented factors play in software effectiveness sometimes gets lost in discussions of best practices , process models , and other more complex topics .
Limited Importance of Process Maturity
One of the articles in this issue , Brad Clark ’s “ Quantifying the Effect of Process Improvement , ” has a perhaps startling message for more process - oriented readers : a one - CMM - level improvement by itself accounts for only an 11 % increase in productivity .
1
In comparing medium - size projects ( 100,000 lines of code ) , the one with the worst process will require 1.43 times as much effort as the one with the best process , all other things being equal .
In other words , the maximum influence of process maturity on a project ’s productivity is 1.43 .
What Clark does n’t emphasize is that for a program of 100,000 lines of code , several human - oriented factors influence productivity more than process does .
According to the regression studies performed to calibrate the Cocomo II estimation model , analyst experience ( AEXP in Cocomo II ) exerts an influence of 1.51 .
Communications factors ( SITE , which refers to colocation of personnel and communication support such as e-mail and networks ) exert an influence of 1.52 .
Personnel continuity ( PCON ) has an influence of 1.59 .
Programmer capability ( PCAP ) has an influence of 1.77 , and the capability of the requirements analysts ( ACAP ) has an influence of 2.00 .
Language and tool experience ( LTEX ) exert the same influence as process maturity ( 1.43 ) , and , trailing only slightly , programmer experience ( PEXP ) exerts an influence of 1.40 .
The effect of process maturity varies with project size ; it has less influence in small projects .
For a project of 10,000 lines of code , process maturity affects productivity less than any of the other factors mentioned .
The seniority - oriented factors alone ( AEXP , LTEX , PEXP ) exert an influence of 3.02 .
The seven personnel - oriented factors collectively ( ACAP , AEXP , LTEX , PCAP , PCON , PEXP , and SITE ) exert a staggering influence range of 25.8 !
This simple fact accounts for much of the reason that non-process - oriented organizations such as Microsoft , Amazon.com , and other entrepreneurial powerhouses can experience industry - leading productivity while seemingly shortchanging process .
Physical Environment
One soft factor that the Cocomo II analysis does n’t quantify is the effect of the office environment .
Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister sponsored a now - famous programming competition in which 166 developers competed on the basis of quality and speed .
2
The competitors provided information on the characteristics of their physical work environments , and it turned out that the developers who performed in the top 25 % had bigger , quieter , more private offices and fewer interruptions from people and phone calls than the other 75 % .
The differences in physical space were n’t especially dramatic .
The top 25 % of performers had an average of 78 square feet of dedicated floor space ; the bottom 25 % had 46 square feet .
The differences in productivity were more dramatic .
Developers in the top quartile had productivity 2.6 times better than developers in the bottom quartile .
In Cocomo II terms , the influence of office environment is 2.6 , which is significantly greater than that of process maturity .
Motivation
Motivation is usually thought to be the greatest influence on how well people perform , and most productivity studies agree .
3
Whatever else its critics might say about Microsoft , everyone agrees that it has succeeded in motivating its developers to an extraordinary degree .
Stories of 12- , 14 - , even 18 - hour days are common , as are stories of people who live in their offices for weeks at a time .
I know of one developer who had a Murphy bed custom - made to fit his office .
Locally , Microsoft is known as “ The Velvet Sweatshop , ” which suggests that , if anything , the company might be doing too good a job of motivating its employees .
Microsoft ’s approach to achieving this high level of motivation is simple .
It focuses explicitly on morale .
Each work group has a morale budget it can use for anything it wants .
Some groups buy movie - theater style popcorn poppers , some go skiing or bowling or have a cookout , and some make T - shirts .
Some groups rent a whole movie theater for a private screening of their favorite movie .
Microsoft also uses nonmonetary rewards extensively .
I spent a year at Microsoft working on Windows 3.1 .
During that time , I received three team T - shirts , a team rugby shirt , a team beach towel , and a team mouse pad .
I also took part in a team train ride , a nice dinner on the local “ Dinner Train , ” and another dinner at a nice restaurant .
If I had been an employee , I also would have received a few more shirts , a Microsoft watch , a plaque for participating in the project , and a big Lucite “ Ship - It ” award for shipping the product .
This stuff ’s total value is probably only $ 300 or $ 400 , but its psychological value is much greater .
Microsoft does n’t ignore developers ’ personal lives , either .
During the time I was there , the developer whose office was next to mine had his 10 - year - old daughter come by every day after school .
She did her homework quietly in his office while he worked .
No one at the company even raised an eyebrow .
In addition to providing explicit support for morale , Microsoft gladly trades other factors to keep morale high , sometimes in ways that would make other companies shudder .
I ’ve seen them trade methodological purity , programming discipline , control over the product specification , control over the schedule , management visibility — almost anything to benefit morale .
Regardless of the other effects , the motivational efficacy of this approach speaks for itself .
Staff Seniority
Falling in line with Cocomo ’s emphasis on staff seniority , many leading organizations recognize the importance of senior staff .
Many years ago , Microsoft ’s director of development pointed out to me that he had identified senior personnel as a critical success factor .
He said that one of the keys to success of a product such as Microsoft Excel was to have at least two senior staff members continue over from the product ’s previous release .
In a study of runaway projects in the UK , managers identified “ insufficient senior staff ” as a contributing cause of difficulties in approximately 40 % of the projects that significantly overran their schedules or budgets .
4
Even organizations that focus strongly on software processes recognize the important role of human factors .
The NASA Software Engineering Laboratory was the first organization to win the IEEE Computer Society ’s award for software process achievement .
In their “ Recommended Approach to Software Development , Revision 3 , ” one of their top nine recommendations is “ Do start the project with a small , senior staff . ”
5
The Bottom Line
It turns out that trading process sophistication for staff continuity , business domain experience , private offices , and other human - oriented factors is a sound economic tradeoff .
Of course , the best organizations achieve high motivation and process sophistication at the same time , 6 and that is the key challenge for any leading software organization .

A panel of experts convened by the National Academies , the nation 's leading science advisory group , called yesterday for an urgent and wide - ranging effort to strengthen scientific competitiveness .
The 20 - member panel , reporting at the request of a bipartisan group in Congress , said that without such an effort the United States " could soon lose its privileged position . "
It cited many examples of emerging scientific and industrial power abroad and listed 20 steps the United States should take to maintain its global lead .
" Decisive action is needed now , " the report warned , adding that the nation 's old advantages " are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength . "
The proposed actions include creating scholarships to attract 10,000 top students a year to careers in teaching math and science , and 30,000 scholarships for college - level study of science , math and engineering ; expanding the nation 's investment in basic research by 10 percent a year for seven years ; and making broadband access available nationwide at low cost .
Many CMSs ( content management systems ) come with some kind of visual editor that allow editors to create and format content without knowing the markup involved .
I evaluated some of these WYSISYG - editors back in March and found most of them lacking in features for semantic markup .
One of the more commonly found problems is that they have a lot of features for visual formatting like font selection , font color , indentation etc .
In most CMSs these are features you would like to avoid ( ask your corporate communication department if they would like to have features that allow editors to go crazy with colors on the website … ) .
Som of you will argue that one should never use a WYSIWYG editor and instead deploy a wiki - style editing syntax like e.g. Markdown .
This typically solves the problem , but in reality this type of syntax is very difficult for content editors to learn and becomes increasingly difficult if you want to do more advanced editing .
WYMeditor to the rescue
I was planning to start working on my own inline editor by forking TinyMCE and correcting what I thought was wrong with it when I found this comment from Jean - FranÃ§ois :
[ …]
Iâ€™d like to present WYMeditor : WYMeditor is a web - based XHTML editor , not WYSIWYG , but WYSIWYM : the end - user can concentrate on rich content , while layout and design are handled via style - sheets .
This sounded almost too good to be true .
WYSIWYM ( What You See Is What You Mean ) is of course how content for the web should be edited .
WYMeditor is in an early stage of development , but after playing with it for a while it looks very promising .
If it guarantees well formed XHTML it is an easy task to convert it to HTML 4.01 or any other representation you can think of .
Currently it works in Internet Explorer and Gecko - based browsers such as Firefox .
You can try an online demo of WYMeditor here .
If content management systems were to use editors like WYMeditor web accessibility would get and instant boost .
There are some issues that hopefully will be solved soon :
icons for strong emphasis and emphasis look like bold and italics ,
heading levels can be mixed in a non-logical way ( like inserting h5 after h1 )
support for som elements like acronym , abbreviation and definition lists , are missing
But , if I was developing a CMS I would definitely monitor the progress of WYMeditor .
Could WYMeditor make content editors aware of semantics in a way currently impossible in other inline editors ?
Will this type of inline editing merge with visual presentation Ã la XStandard ?

In the early ' 70s the research lab of Xerox at Palo Alto has developed the so called " WIMP user interface " : Windows , Icons , Menu and Pointer .
It took almost 15 years until Apple started to integrate such functionalities in the first Macintosh , and couple of years later Microsoft 's Windows started to use the same metaphors .
still use thewhich is based on the ideas already .
But computer resources are growing exponentially -- could n't we use this extra computing power for a better desktop experience ?
We could .
The following projects are such initiatives , and their eye candy demo videos are definitely worth watching .
Novell started a project called XGL in late 2004 .
Their goal is to create an X server architecture for Linux , which allows fancier , more intuitive user interaction .
XGL puts different desktops on the sides of a cube .
Switching between the desktop happens through rotating this cube .
The other features stay in the realm of 2D , but include nice effects : windowswhen one moves them around ; transparency of windows can be fine - tuned , etc .
Check out this video for a short demo , or burn a kororaa live CD to try it out yourself .
Now , XGL does not bring revolutionary things , but it enhances current GUI which starts to behave much more physics based , and it is a bit less abstract .
A similar project was started by Sun , as well .
Not surprisingly , Project Looking Glass is based on Java Technology , and its aim is to enrich the desktop experience with 3D elements .
One can , for example , tilt windows and put them on the side .
A neat function is that one can .
Some other features include : a jukebox - like music browser , control over the translucency of windows .
You can view the video of Jonathan Schwartz presenting a short demo of Project Looking Glass here .
Again , we did not see fundamental innovations how we interact with the computer , but mostly neat enhancements were introduced to improve the user experience .
Research communitieswhich collide and behave exactly as one expects in real life .
After organizing icons into piles you can lay them on a regular grid , browse through them with a fisheye function or leaf through the pile exactly like you would with a real life book .
Dozens of otherare available , but what is the most important is that all of them .
He has a very thorough video presenting the features of BumpTop .
Moreover , according to his website , he is planning to build a full blown desktop replacement that can be installed on any machine .
But it does not take teams of research and state - of - the art physics engines to enrich the desktop environment .
Kristian Høgsberg implemented a small and simple physics engine , Akamaru and created afor Gnome .
This short video demonstrates what acan do with a bit of programming time invested .
All the projects presented above have at least one thing in common : .
They use simulation of real - life world in order to bring something to the user which is less abstract and it is closer to the world we are used to .
The question is : Innovating user interfaces is not an easy task .
Users do n't want to learn a lot of new things in order to use the computer , so there will be always a resistance toward new GUIs .
One way to go around this problem is by not making drastic changes ( like XGL and Project Glass ) , thus allowing an easier transition .
Microsoft has learned this the hard way , through Microsoft Bob .
So , this time the Redmond - based company takes smaller steps with the upcoming Vista operating system : Windows Aero .
According to this demo video , they introduce smooth transitions , improved switching between windows , but nothing too radical .
Even if one makes a bigger leap ( like BumpTop ) the first and foremost criteria for success is that the new system should offer improved usability .
Joel Spolsky defined usability in a single sentence :
Something is usable if it behaves exactly as expected .
But what could look more natural than the physics of the world we live in ?
So , if we accept this definition , definitelyto get closer of tomorrow 's mainstream desktop environment .
I predict that there is a still long way ahead of us , but maybe in a couple of years Microsoft or Apple makes the step , just like in the ' 80s Steve Jobs went to Xerox 's research center and came back with a new user interface .--- Thanks to Gabor Cselle for reviewing drafts of this .

The FDA may soon take that cliché to a whole new level .
Act now if you do n't want to be eating cloned meat or consuming dairy products from cloned animals by the end of this year .
The FDA has a public comment period open only until April 2 , so do n't delay .
Spread the word .
On December 28 , 2006 the FDA announced its tentative approval to allow meat and dairy from cloned animals based on their draft assessment of hundreds of peer - reviewed publications .
Also read the FDA 's risk management plan .
Pending actual approval , the products could be on our grocery store shelves by the end of this year .
There are a number of concerns involved with cloned meat .
Considering the high rate of birth abnormalities in clones including intestinal blockages , squashed faces , weak immune systems , high rates of late - term spontaneous abortion , extremely oversized babies and more , cloning animals commercially is nothing short of animal cruelty ( I 'm not even touching all the issues involved with mass - produced meat in general ) .
The mother 's are given huge amounts of hormones to make the pregnancy possible , and , due to the birth defects already mentioned , calves are given huge amounts of antibiotics , further increasing their levels in our food supply .
There is also the fear of narrowing the gene pool .
Variety is a part of the natural world ; it is how things survive .
Rowan
Wolf explains :
Despite the fact that the meat and milk from these animals has been scientifically proven to have the same constitution as non-cloned animal meat and milk , I fear that we do not know how our bodies will treat this " food " .
What would eating the same protein over and over again do to our bodies ?
We need variety .
As I said earlier , life can not survive without variety .
We , the public , are being asked to participate in a massive experiment on our bodies , which we can not avoid taking part in if these products are not labeled .
We have the right to know what we are consuming .
As of now , we will be able to choose to buy organic products in order to avoid this , but biotech industry did try to attempt to allow clones to be defined as organic .
On February 8 , legislation was introduced to prevent this from happening , thankfully .
But why should we not be allowed to know whether or not ALL food on our shelves is cloned ?
It seems like this knowledge about a basic need ( food ) should be considered a very basic freedom .
Write to the FDA right now .
Talk about this issue with your friends and family and encourage them to write .
Let me know what you think , too .
Americans who want to invest in hedge funds will need personal wealth of at least $ 2.5 m ( £ 1.3 m ) , rather than the present $ 1 m , under a tightening of rules proposed last night by financial regulators in Washington .
The dramatic growth of the hedge fund industry , together with a handful of high - profile failures , has prompted the securities and exchange commission to act .
Its chairman , Christopher Cox , said commissioners would vote on the proposal to more than double the minimum threshold at a scheduled meeting today .
" We are going to be lifting the accredited investor standard from where it has been since 1982 at $ 1 m of net worth to $ 2.5 m , " he told reporters .
There are an estimated 8,800 hedge funds in America , managing $ 1.2 trillion in assets - which represents growth of 3,000 % in 16 years .
Politicians in Congress have become increasingly vocal in calling for greater scrutiny of the industry .
In June , a US court struck down a rule requiring hedge funds to register with regulators .
However , this could be replaced with a degree of international oversight - the European Central Bank this week proposed a system of registration spanning London , Washington and other financial capitals to provide greater transparency of the flow of money .
Concern peaked following the collapse of Connecticut - based Amaranth Advisers in September .
Amaranth lost $ 6bn in a week as it placed disastrous bets that the price of natural gas would rise .
Amaranth was the biggest hedge fund failure since the demise of Long Term Capital Management , which haemorrhaged $ 4bn in five weeks during 1998 .
Mr Cox has been anxious for greater power for some time .
In July , he told the Senate banking committee that the present wealth threshold for investing in notoriously risky hedge funds was " not only out of date , but wholly inadequate to protect unsophisticated investors from the complex risks of investment in most hedge funds " .
Most funds maintain that they only market themselves to sophisticated investors .
Some have stringent investment criteria requiring stakes of at least $ 1 m .
In Britain , the Financial Services Authority has been consulting over how hedge funds are regulated and has expressed unease about their potential to create a disorderly market .
The majority of hedge fund investors will still qualify under the SEC 's higher wealth threshold .

Our editors have compiled a list of seven computer mice you ca n’t buy , or at least anytime soon .
If we happened to miss any , please leave us a comment .
“ Continue reading ” for the list .
The Minty Optical Mouse
To make your own “ Minty Mouse ” , you ’ll need one Altoids tin , an optical mouse , dremel tools , epoxy glue , a mini- hack saw , and around 4 hours of free time .

Glove Mouse
A group of college students — Brian Eng , Andy Homar , Matteo Mannino , and Saad Sam — designed and created this nifty PowerGlove - like mouse for Purdue ECE477 .
This is not merely a hack job like other glove mice found on youtube that simply use an off the shelf gyration mouse .
Custom PCB ’s for the base station and glove module were designed by us and fabricated .
Everything was built from the ground up
LCD Mouse
Modder Jani ‘ Japala ’ Pönkkö added an LCD display ( Nokia 6610 ) into a Logitech G5 laser mouse .
Full instructions here .
The controller requires adding three more wires to the mouse .
These are connected to a parallel port .
The screen can only show about 1 frame per second , but that is fast enough for general statistics or showing photos .
It ’s a really clean build .
A clever trick was using a piece of plastic from the blister pack to cover the screen since it was already the same shape as the mouse

Nokia 6230i Bluetooth Mouse
Pyrofer ‘s nifty “ Nokia 6230 i Bluetooth Mouse ” functions as both a computer input device and cell phone .
After giving up on the idea of a proper mouse HID I used the bluetooth to just link the phone as normal and send the data over the Nokia driver to a special driver on the PC again , this isnt as convenient as the original plan as it needs software on the PC as well as the phone

Stone Mouse
File this under : “ Strange Computer Mice ” A Russian designer has created the world ’s first functional computer mouse made of stone .
… looks like the stone parts are polished / cut and glued to the mouse .
The beige scroll wheel and cable ruin the appeal slightly …

Soap – The Mid-Air Mouse
Soap puts a new twist on tradional optical mice by adding mid-air functionality .
This technology is “ based on hardware found in a mouse ” and “ consists of an optical sensor device moving freely inside a hull made of fabric . ”
As the user applies pressure from the outside , the optical sensor moves independent from the hull .
The optical sensor perceives this relative motion and reports it as position input .
Soap offers many of the benefits of optical mice , such as high - accuracy sensing
3D Wireless Mouse
Students at UC Santa Cruz have developed “ FRE3SPACE “ , a wireless mouse “ that could operate in three dimensions . ”
In other words , while holding the mouse in the air you could move your arm left or right , up and down , towards and away , in relation to your computer .
Our system would detect the 3D position of the mouse and give this information to the PC to be used by other applications

It could be the plot of a horror film , but in two towns on opposite sides of the world the mysterious phenomenon of thousands of dead birds dropping out of the sky is all too real .
Officials are baffled by the unexplained deaths which have affected Australia and the U.S .
Three weeks ago thousands of crows , pigeons , wattles and honeyeaters fell out of the sky in Esperance , Western Australia .
Then last week dozens of grackles , sparrows and pigeons dropped dead on two streets in Austin , Texas .
As birds continue to die in Esperance and the town 's dawn chorus remains eerily silent , vets in both countries have been unable to establish a cause of death - despite carrying out a large number of autopsies on the birds .
Wildlife officials from Western Australia 's Department of Environment and Conservation said they were baffled by the " catastrophic event " but emphasised the deaths had nothing to do with a severe storm which recently struck the area , as the birds had started dying before then .
District nature conservation coordinator Mike Fitzgerald said : " It 's very substantial .
" We estimate several thousand birds are dead , although we do n't have a clear number because of the large areas of bushland . "
Birds Australia , the country 's largest bird conservation group , said it had not heard of a similar occurrence .
" You 'd have to call it a most unusual event and one that we'd all have to be concerned about , " said chief executive Graeme Hamilton .
Dr Fiona Sunderman , chief veterinary officer of the Department of Agriculture and Food , suspects the cause of death is some form of toxic poisoning .
Esperance resident Michelle Crisp , who normally sees hundreds of birds roosting in her garden , counted 80 dead ones in one day .
" It went to the point where we had nothing , not a single bird , " she said .
" It was like a moonscape - just horrible . "
In Texas , officials are also working on the toxic poisoning theory .
Adolfo Valadez , medical director for Austin and Travis County Health and Human Services , said it might be weeks before any conclusive results were known .
Such was the concern that the birds suffered deliberate toxic poisoning that several streets were closed in Austin while police and fire crews checked the area for any substance that might be of harm to humans .
" This was a precautionary measure .
We certainly take these kinds of thing seriously , especially following 9/11 , " said Mr Valadez .
" It may be a matter of time before we know what happened and why it happened .
There is no threat to public health . "
Federal officials in Washington said they were monitoring the situation , but a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said : " There is no credible intelligence to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or Austin at this time . "
As the US pilot who attacked the convoy shortly after the invasion of Iraq nearly four years ago was named for the first time , it became clear that the conclusions of the British board of inquiry were very different from the official investigation carried out by the US military authorities .
The pilot of the A10 aircraft who twice attacked the British patrol was named by the Sun as Colonel Gus " Skeeter " Kohntopp .
He was a lieutenant colonel reservist in the Idaho Air National Guard when he attacked the convoy in his first combat mission .
He is also a commercial pilot .
The British board of inquiry criticised the pilots of the two A10 aircraft for ignoring basic procedures .
" Without having been authorised by Manila Hotel , [ their US forward ground controller ] , " the pilots " engaged the UK recce patrol believing it to be hostile " , the report said .
Col Kohntopp 's call sign was Popov 36 , and his wingman 's was Popov 35 .
Manila
Hotel twice told the pilots they were " well clear " of friendly forces .
The board says that " the ground situation information given by Manila Hotel to Popov section [ the two pilots ] was scant [ and ] insufficient friendly positional information and control measures were passed or requested " .
It adds that " neither target description nor location of the final target was passed by Popov 35 to Manila Hotel " .
It continues : " The aircrew did not receive clear authority from the GFAC [ ground forward air controller ] for Popov 36 to engage . "
The board 's report goes on : " At no stage was Manila Hotel advised of the new target ... Popov was not clear to engage . "
It said that British psychologists noted that Popov 36 showed a " single - minded pursuit of the UK vehicles " .
He was " not sensitive " to the workload of his wingman , a major .
The problem was compounded , it suggests , by the wingman 's exaggerated respect for his senior colleague , Lt Col Kohntopp .
The inquiry also points to some British failings .
It says that luminous orange panels attached to the armoured vehicles may have contributed to the confusion - the US pilots mistook them for " orange rockets " .
It says that some UK liaison personnel , as well as American , suffered from lack of training .
Its report contrasts markedly with the US inquiry into the disaster .
America's own investigation concluded the pilots " followed the procedures and processes for engaging targets " , a Pentagon spokesman , Bryan Whitman , said this week .
Neither was disciplined .
The inquest into Lance Corporal Hull 's death is due to resume on March 12 .
Last week a phony grand compromise on health insurance coverage was announced , led by the for profit insurance industry , but ostensibly including some good - guy organization such as Families USA .
A major component of this so called compromise was tax credits to buy private insurance .
A few days later , this past Saturday , Bush announced " his " plan to help things along by treating health insurance more like home ownership and mortgages , by providing ... surprise ... tax credits to buy private insurance .
Hooray for compromise when only one side gives up something .
Hooray for compromise at the beginning of a negotiation .
Hooray for compromise to get a seat at the table and then be ignored .
Hooray for ignoring the plan that provides universal high quality care and cost control .
The Bush plan according to Reuters would :
for the first time allow people to take a tax deduction -- similar to the one used by homeowners for their mortgage costs -- when they buy health coverage on their own instead of through an employer .
Currently , employees who receive health coverage through their jobs do not pay taxes on the benefit .
Bush would cap the amount of coverage that would be considered tax - free .
Anything above that would be taxed as income .
The limit for deductions would be $ 15,000 for families and $ 7,500 for individuals .
The average cost of family health coverage is $ 11,500 .
While some people would get hit with higher taxes , there would be a windfall for those who opted for low - cost plans .
For example , a family who bought a $ 10,000 plan could still take the full $ 15,000 deduction and pocket the extra money .
But it is , as Princeton economist and single payer advocate Paul Krugman comments today from behind the NY Times select firewall just " gold - plated indifference " :
Going without health insurance is n’t like deciding to rent an apartment instead of buying a house .
The uninsured do n’t need an " incentive " to buy insurance ; they need something that makes getting insurance possible .
Most people without health insurance have low incomes , and just ca n’t afford the premiums .
And making premiums tax - deductible is almost worthless to workers whose income puts them in a low tax bracket .
Of those uninsured who are n’t low - income , many ca n’t get coverage because of pre-existing conditions ...
Again , tax deductions wo n’t solve their problem .
The only people the Bush plan might move out of the ranks of the uninsured are the people we ’re least concerned about — affluent , healthy Americans who choose voluntarily not to be insured .
At most , the Bush plan might induce some of those people to buy insurance , while in the process — whaddya know — giving many other high - income individuals yet another tax break .
While proposing this high - end tax break , Mr. Bush is also proposing a tax increase — not on the wealthy , but on workers who , he thinks , have too much health insurance .
The tax code , he said , " unwisely encourages workers to choose overly expensive , gold - plated plans .
The result is that insurance premiums rise , and many Americans cannot afford the coverage they need . "
No economic analysis I ’m aware of says that when Peter chooses a good health plan , he raises Paul ’s premiums .
And look at the condescension .
Will all those who think they have " gold plated " health coverage please raise their hands ?
According to press reports , the actual plan is to penalize workers with relatively generous insurance coverage .
Just to be clear , we ’re not talking about the wealthy ; we ’re talking about ordinary workers who have managed to negotiate better - than - average health plans .
That means this is an attack on the few remaining strong labor unions .
Gee another surprise .
What ’s driving all this is the theory , popular in conservative circles but utterly at odds with the evidence , that the big problem with U.S. health care is that people have too much insurance — that there would be large cost savings if people were forced to pay more of their medical expenses out of pocket .
Let see ... ideologically driven but fact - free phony - academic conservative think tank plans ... where have we heard this before ?
The administration also believes , for some reason , that people should be pushed out of employment - based health insurance — admittedly a deeply flawed system — into the individual insurance market , which is a disaster on all fronts .
Insurance companies try to avoid selling policies to people who are likely to use them , so a large fraction of premiums in the individual market goes not to paying medical bills but to bureaucracies dedicated to weeding out " high risk " applicants — and keeping them uninsured .
Once again , like the health saving accounts idea , this is the opposite of what the underlying princile of what insurance is supposed to do .
Instead of spreading and sharing risk to largest pool , it would create millions of one - person insurance pools .
Mr. Bush , on the other hand , is still peddling the fantasy that the free market , with a little help from tax cuts , solves all problems .
Every independent analysis has shown that tax credits do n't work .
I will go into greater detail in a separate diary , but briefly tax credits simply launder public money through wasteful private insurance system that takes a one - third cut of every dollar .
With the cost of private insurance policies skyrocketing ( $ 10,000 + for family coverage ) , the size of tax credits would have to be substantial to help the uninsured get coverage .
Moreover , studies have shown that offering these credits barely makes a dent in the number of uninsured because it gives employers the incentive to drop coverage for their employees .
Now does anybody in the real world think that the White House and AHIP did not coordinate on this before hand ?
Families USA says that they are " a national nonprofit , non-partisan organization dedicated to the achievement of high - quality , affordable health care for all Americans . " and that they " have earned a national reputation as an effective voice for health care consumers for over 20 years . "
But their signing onto this one sided " compromise " that achieves nothing smacks at worst of inside the beltway staff and lobbyists getting together for a groupthink projecct against the wishes and interests of their constituents ; or at best an overly pessimistic ( circa 1994 ) view of what is doable and a need to capitulate to have a seat at the table .
With friends like these ...
Even if one wants to compromise this early in the game , and give up on the single - payer , there are already somewhat more serious compromises , still mediocre with severe drawbacks , that at least offer some potential of universality such as from the Economic Policy Institute recent forum ( Hacker - care ) .
That folks like Families USA ( and AARP , APHA , AAFP ) chose not to sign on to EPI 's plan as their already mediocre compromise is pathetic ... both as policy and as strategy .
No , they had to go for less than EPI - Hacker , for less than Senator Wyden 's least awful version of Mandated care .
Nice opening move .
Would not want them to endorse anything like Conyers / Kennedy HR - 676 ( ( however you can ! ) ... after any plan sponsored by senior committee - chair congressmen is too far out there .
Here is an action we can take : Families USA are having their annual national grassroote meeting , Health Action 2007 , conference in Washington DC this week , January 25 - 27 .
Maybe we should ask them to denounce the Bush plan and to repudiate the AHIP phony compromise , and get back to advocating for real universal coverage for the people .
I suggest contacting Families USA now , before the meeting at their E - Mail : info@familiesusa.org or Tel : 202-628-3030 or Fax : 202-347-2417
Meanwhile , my starting point is not a phony compromise or a plan that inherently does not work ...
I am holding out for the only plan that acutally make conservative economic sense conservative economic sense and provides high quality health care for all .
Update from Don McCanne 's quote of the day listserv :
Bowel cancer kills around 14,000 each year
The tests will identify those who may have the disease , the second largest cause of cancer death in the UK .
By 2009 , everyone aged 60 - 69 will be asked to self - test every two years .
The government hopes the privacy and dignity of the home testing kits will overcome people 's natural reluctance to talk about symptoms .
Because of the nature of the disease , people can feel uncomfortable talking about it , let alone coping with the symptoms
Health minister Rosie Winterton
People taking part in the scheme will send stool samples to a laboratory , where they will be analysed for the presence of blood .
The programme , promised in the 2000 NHS Plan and which will cost £ 37.5 m in its first two years , is to be phased in from April 2006 .
Around 25 % of England , or 300,000 people , will be covered in the first year of the programme .
By 2009 , the aim is for two million to receive the kits annually .
Five centres , which will include testing laboratories , are to be set up around the UK to analyse the kits .
Strategic Health Authorities are being invited to bid to provide a first wave of local screening centres .
' Positive step '
Bowel cancer kills 50 people a day in the UK .
Lung cancer is the only form of the disease which kills more people .
Ministers believe a screening programme could cut the death rate by 15 % .
Launching the programme , health minister Rosie Winterton said : " Although bowel cancer affects more than one in 20 people in their lifetime , of those who get the disease 90 % survive if it is caught early .
" Because of the nature of the disease , people can feel uncomfortable talking about it , let alone coping with the symptoms .
" That is why the privacy and dignity that the home testing kits afford will help us better tackle the disease . "
Jerry McMahon , of Kingsbury in Middlesex , was called in for screening under a pilot scheme at Northwick Park Hospital .
Mr Mahon , now 62 , had no symptoms to suggest anything was wrong .
But a colonoscopy found two polyps in his colon , one of which was found to be cancerous .
He said : " The test was a life - saver .
I 've nothing but praise for the doctors at Northwick Park .
I feel better now than I did at 25 . "
' I survived '
Hilary Whittaker , chief executive of the national charity Beating Bowel Cancer , said : " We believe that the screening programme will be a positive step in reducing the number of deaths from this cancer . "
Neil Brookes , chief executive of Colon Cancer Concern , said : " At a stroke , the screening programme will raise the profile of the disease and encourage people to be much more active in seeking to prevent it . "
TV presenter Lynn Faulds - Wood , of Lynn 's Bowel Cancer Campaign and chairman of the European Cancer Patient Coalition , said : " I survived advanced bowel cancer and I 've been investigating how to help save lives from bowel cancer for years .
Screening , in my opinion , is the best way . "
Professor Elwyn Elias , president of the British Society of Gastroenterology , welcomed the programme , but said the NHS would have to be able to cope with the people flagged up as needing further checks .
" If this is going to go national , which is obviously the aim , it will need a lot of investment and doctors will need a lot of training . "
“ If we really believe that there are fundamental structural problems in the venture industry , should we raise our fund and just hope that the problems will get better ? ” the firm wrote .
The answer was no .
Many venture capitalists have voiced similar concerns for some time .
And over the last few years , many firms have turned away far more money than they raised .
But investors , perhaps hoping for a repeat of the eye - popping returns of the late 1990 ’s , have continued to put money into venture firms .
At the end of 2005 , venture capitalists had a combined $ 261 billion under management , more than at any time in the industry ’s history , though some of it was raised in the Internet boom .
Venture capitalists have given back money to investors before , most significantly after the Internet bubble burst and the appetite for investing in risky technology start - up companies nearly vanished .
But experts say this is the first time that a top - tier firm has decided to scrap a sizable fund that was nearly complete .
“ I do n’t know of any other firm that has gone through that process , ” said Mark Heesen , president of the National Venture Capital Association , an industry group .
In many ways , Sevin Rosen ’s decision is based not on where the market for public offerings and acquisitions is today , but on where the partners in the firm think it will be in five or more years , the typical life of a venture fund .
While Sevin Rosen has concluded that things are unlikely to change , many others disagree , Mr. Heesen said .
“ That ’s where the real debate is , and I can see V.C. ’s on both sides of that debate , ” he said .
Indeed , even as they say they wish there was less money in the business , and hence less competition for deals , many venture capitalists say they remain confident about their ability to make money for their investors .
Edward Hall :
The perfect group size = 8 - 12 Matt 20 comments Latest by Kenny Moore
Edward Hall ’s “ Beyond Culture , ” a fascinating read , draws upon his experiences as a psychoanalyst and cross-cultural anthropologist to examine how things like language , time , brain structure , and education condition our views of the world .
Some of the passages touch on themes we ’ve addressed here at SvN ( e.g. reality vs. plans , small groups , bureaucracy , etc. ) so I ’ll post a few excerpts over the next couple of days .
Let ’s start with Hall ’s conclusion on the perfect group size : 8 - 12 people .
If a group that size ca n’t get it done , then it ’s time to break down the task .
Fortunately , something is known both empirically and scientifically about the influence exerted by size on groups and the effect of size on how the groups perform .
Research with business groups , athletic teams , and even armies around the world has revealed there is an ideal size for a working group .
This ideal size is between eight and twelve individuals .
This is natural , because man evolved as a primate while living in small groups …
Eight to 12 persons can know each other well enough to maximize their talents .
In groups beyond this size , the possible combinations of communication between individuals get too complex to handle ; people are lumped into categories and begin the process of ceasing to exist as individuals .
Tasks than ca n’t be handled by a group of eight to 12 are probably too complex and should be broken down further .
Participation and commitment fall off in larger groups — mobility suffers ; leadership does n’t develop naturally but is manipulative and political .
One morning , I rang up a spammer to complain about the emails he kept sending me .
His name was Dave Mustachi ; and as I was calling from London at about 9 am and he lived in Florida , then five hours behind , I was delighted to catch him groggy and tired from being roused by his telephone .
" Your emails , " I said to him , " are really annoying me because I 've never asked for them .
I have emailed you to ask to be removed from your mailing list .
If you do n't , I 'm going to keep calling you randomly at this sort of time . "
" Um , OK , " he said , still half asleep , but awake enough to realise he did n't want to hear any more .
" What 's your email ? "
I gave it to him and never received another spam I could trace back to him .
This was , however , about 10 years ago .
Such an approach could n't work now , for a number of reasons : there 's much more spam , from different people ; they tend not to do it on their own account ; and they do n't leave their phone numbers in the details that describe which domains they own .
Mustachi owned one called loveofmoney.com , which is appropriate enough ; there 's no other reason for spamming , since it wo n't win you any friends .
I began musing on this point when I realised over the new year that I have long since ceased to worry about email spam .
I think there are two reasons .
First , there are multiple spam filters between me and the outside world : some at the companies that forward my email ( Google Mail does a very good job ) , some on my machine , some in the email programs I use .
I therefore get perhaps two spams a day - from an average of 200 predominantly generated outside my workplace .
More importantly , I have come to accept spam as part of the internet landscape , like graffiti .
With spam , though , you can wipe it away instantly .
I certainly would n't waste time trying to track down a spammer now .
Yet the amount of spam seems to be declining .
Postini ( www.postini.com) keeps real - time data on the amount of spam it stops .
A few years ago , it said spam made up around 80 % of all the email circulating .
When I looked last week the figure was about 60 % .
While it is premature to suggest that spam is cooked , I think more people have , like me , begun to ignore it .
Spam is n't the surprise it once was .
Emails offering the usual three Ps - pills , pornography and poker - are n't going to find an amazed western audience , because many of the people who would want such things went online in the past few years .
Instead , the three Ps are being replaced by two others : phishing and penny stocks .
But unlike the other Ps , which rely on desire , these rely on credulousness , which has a finite supply .
If you do n't have an eBay account but get an email saying it 's been suspended , you should naturally feel suspicious .
Similarly , common sense suggests that unheard - of stock probably wo n't boom ; and I think that after the stock market deceptions of the 1990s , people wo n't get fooled again .
( The volume of spam touting stocks does n't necessarily indicate that people are buying them - only that people trying to pump them have hired a spammer to spread the word . )
The other fascinating thing about this change is that it has , to some extent , fulfilled Bill Gates 's prediction of January 2004 that " Two years from now , spam will be solved " ( http://tinyurl.com/9bgrk).
He thought it would be done by instituting tiny charges per email , or by making an email sender solve a small cryptographic puzzle , or by using a simpler system that would automatically confirm the identity of the sender .
Instead , ad - hoc filters , plus education , have done the job .
While it was a nice dream that we would all install cryptographic programs to send our email , or implement a method to identify ourselves , the internet is above all about pragmatism , not idealism .
It does what it can because it 's a human - built object , with all the flaws that implies .
Spam has n't been solved .
But I think our attitude to it could be .
And that 's easier to do .
Then we can all - even Dave Mustachi , wherever he is - sleep easy .

Microsoft's Xbox 360 is finished and in production
In just a few weeks ' time , it will unleash its great white hope of gaming , the Xbox 360 , across the world .
But rolling out a next generation games console in the US , Europe and Japan virtually simultaneously is proving to be a greater challenge than anyone imagined .
" There 's a reason no - one has done this before and we are figuring that out , " said Xbox marketing boss Peter Moore .
" If we knew what we were getting into , we might not have done it , " he admitted at a recent Xbox event in Amsterdam .
In the past console makers have staggered the release of a new machine , like Sony did with the PlayStation Portable .
The device first saw the light of day in Japan , three months later in the US and almost a year later in Europe .
Booking 747s
Microsoft is trying to do something its rivals have never done and it has 2,500 people working hard to ensure the global launch goes according to plan .
We are going to have some disappointment with retailers and consumers
J Allard , Xbox
By making sure its new Xbox 360 is out months ahead of Sony 's PlayStation 3 , Microsoft is hoping to win over the wallets and thumbs of gamers .
The downside has been a rush to get the console , the games and the online support ready for the 22 November launch in the US , and in Europe for 2 December and Japan for 10 December .
" We 're going to ship all around the world ; how we 're going to do that , I do n't know , " said Mr Moore .
" We 're going to rent every 747 we can find . "
The Xbox team admit that despite their best efforts , there will be some logistic issues around getting enough machines into the shops .
" No matter how big the number is , we are going to sell out , " said Xbox supremo J Allard .
" We are going to have some disappointment with retailers and consumers . "
Shooting , racing and sports
Still , a games console is only as good as the games available for it .
The sci - fi shooter Halo became the reason to buy the original Xbox and the PlayStation 2 was largely helped by the exclusive Grand Theft Auto series of games .
Project Gotham Racing 3 promises photo- realistic graphics
At the X05 showcase event last week , Microsoft showed off some of the games coming for the 360 , including its three flagship titles , Perfect Dark Zero , Project Gotham Racing 3 and Kameo .
But as the launch deadline nears , the Xbox team cannot guarantee that these key games will be in the shops on the day the 360 goes on sale .
" I 'm hoping it will happen , " said Mr Allard .
" If something 's not ready we 'll hold it back .
" These games are not far from being done , and if they 're three weeks after the launch or they 're on launch day I do n't think it makes a significant difference . "
Certifying games
The problem for Microsoft is that some of the big names in the business are reluctant to rush out a game as they do not want to damage a franchise with a product that does not live up to expectations .
Fifa 06 for the 360 is due out for Christmas
Microsoft can draw some consolation from the support of games giant Electronic Arts which has promised five games for the holiday season , including versions of its best - selling Fifa , Burnout and Madden games .
The next few weeks will be crucial , as the new games are tested to see if they are ready to go .
" Games will arrive with a thousand bugs and get into the certification process , " explained Mr Moore .
" They make it or they do n't .
It 's no big deal if a game takes another week .
The consumer will get a strong line - up . "

Despite their shrinking numbers , Zoroastrians — who follow the Prophet Zarathustra ( Zoroaster in Greek ) — are divided over whether to accept intermarried families and converts and what defines a Zoroastrian .
An effort to create a global organizing body fell apart two years ago after some priests accused the organizers of embracing “ fake converts ” and diluting traditions .
Image Zoroastrians gathered for an annual fire ceremony last month in Burr Ridge , Ill .
A portrait of the Prophet Zarathustra is in the background .

“ They feel that the religion is not universal and is ethnic in nature , and that it should be kept within the tribe , ” said Jehan Bagli , a retired chemist in Toronto who is a priest , or mobed , and president of the North American Mobed Council , which includes about 100 priests .
“ This is a tendency that to me sometimes appears suicidal .
And they are prepared to make that sacrifice . ”
In South Africa , the last Zoroastrian priest recently died , and there is no one left to officiate at ceremonies , said Rohinton Rivetna , a Zoroastrian leader in Chicago who , with his wife , Roshan , was a principal mover behind the failed effort to organize a global body .
But they have not given up .
“ We have to be working together if we are going to survive , ” Mr. Rivetna said .
Although the collective picture is bleak , most individual Zoroastrians appear to be thriving .
They are well - educated and well - traveled professionals , earning incomes that place them in the middle and upper classes of the countries where they or their families settled after leaving their homelands in Iran and India .
About 11,000 Zoroastrians live in the United States , 6,000 in Canada , 5,000 in England , 2,700 in Australia and 2,200 in the Persian Gulf nations , according to the Fezana Journal survey .
This is the second major exodus in Zoroastrian history .
In Iran , after Muslims rose to power in the seventh century A.D. , historians say the Zoroastrian population was decimated by massacres , persecution and conversions to Islam .
Seven boatloads of Zoroastrian refugees fled Iran and landed on the coast of India in 936 .
Their descendants , known as Parsis , built Mumbai , formerly Bombay , into the world capital of Zoroastrianism .
The Zoroastrian magazine Parsiana publishes charts each month tracking births , deaths and marriages .
Leaders fret over the reports from Mumbai , where deaths outnumber births six to one .
The intermarriage rate there has risen to about one in three .
The picture in North America is more hopeful : about 1.5 births for one death .
But the intermarriage rate in North America is now nearly 50 percent .

After releasing it 's English version of an interview with US Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Karen Hughes , SPIEGEL ONLINE today released its German version of the same interview .
At least it was supposed to be the same interview ...
SPIEGEL ONLINE : Another Translation Train Wreck
Unfortunately , as has been the case so often in the past , the German version was noticeably different from the English version .
What you see is not always what you get at SPIEGEL ONLINE .
Here is a summary of serious discrepancies :
In her response to the second question on the recent release of Abu Ghraib photos , Hughes says : " We do n't want to be defined by those pictures , any more than the people of Germany would want your country to be defined by pictures of crimes . "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted from the German version .
. "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted from the German version .
In a response on Guantanamo , Hughes states in the English version : " I hope that the people of Germany would be able to recognize that we should not allow a difference over how we handle 490 terrorists who have pledged to kill Americans and others to divide our two countries and our historic friendship . "
The segments in bold ( emphasis ours ) are omitted from the German version .
we should not allow a difference over how we handle 490 terrorists to divide our two countries . "
The segments in bold ( emphasis ours ) are omitted from the German version .
In the English version , Hughes ' final line is : " I think all of us should take a breath and be a little bit more charitable about how we view each other . "
The entire sentence is omitted from the German version , leaving this line at the very end : " Die Menschen liegen ihm am Herzen , er ist ein wunderbarer Führer . " ( emphasis ours )
. " ( emphasis ours )
In the English version , Hughes speaks of the possible use of force against Iran : " We hope that we are able to resolve this diplomatically -- that is our fervent hope . "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted from the German version .
. "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted from the German version .
In the second question , the German version refers to Guantanamo as follows : " Und ein Bericht der Vereinten Nationen verlangt die Schließung des Lagers von Guantanamo - das sei ein Gefängnis in rechtsfreiem Raum . "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) does not appear in the English version .
The English translation of the segment in bold ( which refers to Guantanamo ) is : " - that is a prison in a space free from legal jursidiction . "
" The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) does not appear in the English version .
The English translation of the segment in bold ( which refers to Guantanamo ) is : " - that is a prison in a space free from legal jursidiction . "
The third question in the German version : " Sie hatten ihre Gründe dafür . " does not appear in the English version .
Translated that means : " They had their reasons for that . "
In another line of question , Hughes is asked : " So what do you hear in the Muslim world ?
Why is there so much hatred against America ? "
She replies : " That 's not an accurate depiction . "
The German translation of her reply is given as : " Hass ist nicht das richtige Wort . "
The German translated : " Hate is not the right word . "
That 's not what she said .
In the English version , Hughes says of Angela Merkel : " She , as someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain , understands the importance of freedom , and we view Germany as an important partner in helping foster democracy that we believe will lead , ultimately to a safer world . "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted in the German version .
. "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted in the German version .
In the next question on Merkel in the English version , SPIEGEL states : " But even such a close friend as Angela Merkel is criticizing Guantanamo . "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted in the German version .
Angela Merkel is criticizing Guantanamo . "
The segment in bold ( emphasis ours ) is omitted in the German version .
In the German version , Hughes is asked : " Und Sie schicken Ihre namhaftesten Muslime nun als Botschafter rund um die Welt ? "
This question does not appear in the English version .
Translated it means : " And now you send your best - known Muslims around the world as ambassadors ? "
Two questions and answers in the English version ( on the cartoon issue and the cartoons in the American press ) are completely omitted from the German version .
The German version contains a second photo caption featuring SPIEGEL 's inflammatory new “ America ’s Shame ” cover complete with multiple links .
The English version does not contain the caption .
In the English version , Hughes says of her job ( towards the end of the interview ) : " I view my job as engaging people . "
The entire sentence is omitted from the German version .
In the English version , Hughes refers to the " secretary of state " in a response on " polling before September 11th . "
There is no mention of the secretary of state in the German version .
The German version specifically refers to " Public Diplomacy " in the first question , the English version does not .
SPIEGEL does not identify the individual (s ) responsible for translating the interview .
But that 's not all .
The German version 's photo caption is also quite striking :
German photo caption ( compare to English version ) :
" Bush friend Hughes : " A wonderful Führer " "
What a flattering choice of words for the German - language caption .
George W. Bush is " Ein wunderbarer Führer . "
How convenient that SPIEGEL ONLINE cut the entire last sentence for the desired ending with the desired connotation .
And the lesson is this :
If you lop off enough sentences and references to friendship , hope and understanding , any interview can fit your distorted worldview .
In this case , a perfectly amicable interview has been twisted into a public relations nightmare by disingenuous journalists with an ideological axe to grind .
So much for reaching out to the German " friends . "
Perhaps Undersecretary Hughes ( and other members of the Bush administration ) should think long and hard the next time a SPIEGEL journalist comes along asking for an interview .
This sort of hatchet job has become the rule and not the exception .
Just look at SPIEGEL's " fair and balanced " reporting on the USA over the past few years Madame Secretary :
Sad but true ... and there 's even more here and here and here .

SNOOP Dogg was banned for life yesterday by British Airways over his minders ' brawl with Heathrow police .
Seven officers were hurt - one of whom broke a hand - when some of his boozy 30 - strong entourage forced their way into a VIP lounge .
The gangsta rapper , 34 , and five pals were yesterday freed on bail after spending the night in cells .
But an airline spokesman fumed yesterday : " This kind of behaviour is not tolerated .
" We are making sure none of this group will be allowed to travel with BA ever again .
They are banned from now on . "
The louts later ran amok in a duty - free shop , looting cigarettes and booze and smashing bottles .
Police sources likened the ugly scenes to " a mini-riot " .
At one stage riot police needed pepper spray to subdue the louts .
Violence erupted when the group - flying from Los Angeles to South Africa via London - tried to enter a first - class lounge despite many having economy tickets .
When British Airways staff refused them entry , some threatened them and simply barged past .
Police with dogs were attacked as they arrived to eject them .
Further clashes broke out at the Terminal 1 duty - free store .
A police source revealed yesterday : " A number of the group appeared to have got off the LA flight the worse for drink .
" They tried to intimidate their way into the lounge and when they were refused they turned ugly .
" When we arrived there was a mini-riot .
Several of the mob went berserk , ran into a duty - free shop and started smashing it up .
" Others were said to have stolen bottles of spirits and other stuff .
" As we tried to calm things down and make arrests , several officers were kicked , punched and threatened with bottles .
" Some suffered bruises and one constable suffered a broken hand . "
The hip - hop star - once cleared of murder 13 years ago - and his pals were led away in handcuffs .
They were taken to two different stations and quizzed on a range of alleged crimes including assaulting police , criminal damage and theft .
A witness who saw Wednesday evening 's fracas confirmed : " It was a mini-riot .
People were going berserk , smashing bottles , threatening airline staff and grappling with cops .
There was smashed glass everywhere .
" Police drew their sticks to deal with them .
Officers were there very quickly but a full - scale punch - up broke out .
It was very frightening . "
None of the group were allowed to board the British Airways to Johannesburg , where Snoop is due to play three charity gigs .
The arrests mean he missed the first , in Johannesburg last night .
Snoop - real name Calvin Broadus - left Heathrow police station in a people carrier shortly after 5 pm yesterday .
He headed to a London hotel while his staff made new arrangements for him to fly to South Africa where he has further gigs on Saturday and Monday .
The star and his friends must return to Britain next month , when they could face charges .
Scotland Yard confirmed : " Snoop Dogg has been freed on bail as have the five others .
" They have been told to return in May to find out the outcome of the investigation . "

See them floundering after their cherished possessions , like fish flopping in a river starved of water .
Sutta Nipata 777 ( From What Would Buddha Do? ( 1999 ) ) .
A friend of mine recently returned from an extended trip to Egypt .
He found it striking that the 18 million residents of Cairo lived in tightly packed conditions and that they owned so very few possessions .
Based on his own observations , the average resident of Cairo owned about 10 % of the property owned by the average American family .
My friend ’s estimate was about on the mark .
Most Americans would certainly describe most residents of Cairo to be “ poor . ”
Amidst this material “ poverty , ” though , my friend noticed numerous signs of family togetherness and harmony that he does n’t often see in the U.S. Parents and children were spending time with each other , smiling at each other , playing together and apparently enjoying each others ’ company .
How could this be , that people appeared to be so happy when they owned so little ?
As my friend described what he saw , I could n’t imagine Americans getting along that well if someone took away 90 % of our possessions .
In fact , we ’d become embittered and we ’d be at each other ’s throats .
My friend ’s comments caused me to think of the enormous amount of material possessions that Americans have and crave .
We have shameful amounts of material possessions .
We have many times more stuff than we need .
Yet we work very hard to have ever more .
We are afflicted with the all - consuming epidemic “ affluenza , ” according to authors of the 2002 book of that title .
What is affluenza ?
“ A painful , contagious , socially - transmitted condition of overload , debt , anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more . ”
The authors quote T.S. Eliot : “ We are the hollow men / We are the stuffed men . ”
Here ’s an excerpt from a review of Affluenza from Amazon.com :
Americans each spend more than $ 21,000 per year on consumer goods , our average rate of saving has fallen from about 10 percent of our income in 1980 to zero in 2000 , our credit card indebtedness tripled in the 1990s , more people are filing for bankruptcy each year than graduate from college , and we spend more for trash bags than 90 of the world ’s 210 countries spend for everything .
“ To live , we buy , ” explain the authors–everything from food and good sex to religion and recreation–all the while squelching our intrinsic curiosity , self - motivation , and creativity .
Do our leaders warn us of our materialistic excesses ?
They used to .
Consider Jimmy Carter ’s televised “ Crisis of Confidence ” Speech delivered on July 15 , 1979 .
In a nation that was proud of hard work , strong families , close - knit communities , and our faith in God , too many of us now tend to worship self - indulgence and consumption .
Human identity is no longer defined by what one does , but by what one owns .
But we ’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning .
We ’ve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose .
We do n’t hear speeches like that anymore .
Not from politicians or even from most religious leaders .
Most politicians and preachers who might dare to suggest that Americans were shallow - minded materialists would get the boot .
In fact , everything was so amazingly peachy within a couple months after 9/11 , that George W. Bush commended us for our shopping :
In the face of this great tragedy , Americans are refusing to give terrorists the power .
Our people have responded with courage and compassion , calm and reason , resolve and fierce determination .
We have refused to live in a state of panic or a state of denial .
There is a difference between being alert and being intimidated , and this great nation will never be intimidated .
People are going about their daily lives , working and shopping and playing . . .
That ’s how bad it ’s gotten .
We ’ve responded to 9/11 by shopping courageously .
Bush ’s statement was n’t an aberration .
Check out the responses of other leaders following 9/11 :
“ People in this country ask what should they do at a time like this , ” Mr. Blair said .
“ The answer is that they should go about their daily lives : to work , to live , to travel and to shop — to do things in the same way as they did before Sept. 11 . ” Rudolph Giuliani , the Mayor of New York , has said that his battered city needs “ the best shoppers in the world ” to return to restaurants , Broadway shows and shops .
“ Go out and contribute to the economy , ” Alex Penelas , the Miami - Dade County Mayor , said at a news conference yesterday .
“ As my wife said , it has never been more patriotic to go shopping . ”
There is obviously a downside to owning as much stuff as we own .
Our stuff fills our garages and basements to bursting .
Most of us do n’t even know what we own , because we simply accumulate more stuff than we can possibly keep track of .
Our stuff clogs up our residence hallways like cholesterol clogs our bodies , keeping us from making use of the enormous spaces in which we live .
How enormous ?
We work long hours away from our families –families that are allegedly the most important part of our lives –to afford huge houses .
Houses so big that we do n’t any longer need to choose carefully when we buy things with which we will fill the houses ; we just buy lots of stuff , much of it not durable , and we toss it into our castles .
According to Affluenza , the master bedroom in the 1950 ’s was about 130 square feet .
Nowadays , moderately priced homes include master bedrooms measuring 300 square feet .
Right after WWII , the average new house was 750 square feet .
Now , it ’s almost 2,500 square feet .
Not only are these huge houses sterile depositories for our stuff .
They offer many of us the opportunity of not interacting with those families we allegedly love .
See , for example , this story from NPR :
The big house represents the atomizing of the American family , ” he says .
“ Each person not only has his or her own television — each person has his or her own bathroom .
Some of these houses are literally designed with three playrooms for two children .
This way , the family members rarely have to interact .
Michael Frisby says having lots of room is a good thing .
. . .
“ I always wanted a house big enough that my kids could be in their room screaming , and my wife could be in a room screaming , and I could be somewhere else and not hear any of them , ” he says .
“ And I think I have accomplished this with this house , because this house is so big that everyone has their own space . ”
How many times have I heard the complaints that people need bigger houses because they are going to have a first or second child when , 50 years ago , that same house provided ample room for a family with five or six children ?
Not only do we all crave lots of stuff .
We claim we have the right to be treated like royalty .
We insist on a basic right to eat often in restaurants — to have other people prepare our food for us .
Plain food is n’t good enough for many of us , certainly not in public settings .
Executives bringing brown bag lunches to important meetings would be laughed at .
Refusing to eat the food poorer folks eat is more a statement of status than nutrition .
We insist that we have the inalienable right to eat fruits and vegetables out of season .
The average item of food travels more than 1,000 miles from the point of production to your plate .
Our stuff constantly distracts us .
Our things suck our life energy from us with their needs to be maintained , repaired , protected , insured and guarded .
In Walden , Thoreau noted that our many empty distractions can take over our souls :
Our life is frittered away by detail .
An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers , or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes , and lump the rest .
Simplicity , simplicity , simplicity !
I say let your affairs be as two or three , and not a hundred or a thousand ; and keep your accounts on your thumbnail …
The nation itself , with all its so called internal improvements , which , by the way , are all external and superficial , is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment , cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps , ruined by luxury and heedless expense , by want of calculation and a worthy aim , as the million households in the land .
Professionals have sprung up to help us to declare war on our stuff .
For example , check out Flylady.com and Lifeorganizers.com
I have yet to meet anyone who denies that most Americans own absurd amounts of ostentatious and frivolous material goods .
So what should we do about it ?
The obvious thing would be to give away the things that might have value to someone else and throw away the useless things .
Certainly , we need to stop buying so much useless stuff .
Flylady.com advises that if you ’re not going to treasure it or use it , do n’t buy it .
As obvious as it is that we do n’t need most of all we on , most Americans would scream if you told them they had to give up even a fourth of what they own , much less 99 % .
After all , this stuff is why most Americans work so hard .
I do n’t know where this topic leads .
It might not have a meaningful wind - up , much less a solution .
Maybe our environment is so incredibly toxic that we are all destined to wallow in it for the rest of our distracted and shallow - minded lives .
Maybe it ’s like we are all alcoholics trying to live sober lives in taverns .
Certainly , our constant rampant craving of non-essential things is expensive and time consuming .
That it is done in all affluent societies suggests that having such things satisfies a deep evolutionary craving .
I would suggest , then , that there might not be any such thing as nonfunctional luxuries .
As Zahavi has noted , to be reliable , signals must be expensive .
Our expensive ( but ostentatious ) stuff sends powerful and reliable signals that one possesses the resources to provide well for a mate ; owning expensive useless stuff is thus reliable advertising for potential mates .
This much is common sense , too : Driving away from one ’s expensive house in an expensive car , eating expensive food and wearing expensive clothing attract mates .
Having and craving lots of stuff is highly contagious — it erupts into an arms race .
Rampant ownership of ostentation stuff becomes widespread because good mates are relatively rare .
It ’s another example of the “ red Queen principle , ” the need to run faster simply to stay even .
Whatever it is that makes us this way , it distracts us from spending time with people we allegedly care about and it distracts us from activities that we claim are far more important than working hard to buy more stuff .
[ Note : this is a companion piece to the recent post on the damage caused by ubiquitous advertising . ]
Altman was one of Hollywood 's legendary figures
The Hollywood maverick , renowned for his improvisational style , died in a Los Angeles hospital on Monday .
He was a five - time Academy Awards best director nominee , but never won the movie industry 's top honour .
However , he was given an honorary Oscar this year for " a career that has repeatedly reinvented the art form " .
He was a giant of the industry ... who kept the energy of a youthful rebel
Julian Fellowes
' An extraordinary character ' Working with a Hollywood legend
Actor Kevin Spacey , director of the Old Vic , said he had been " privileged " to work with him .
" Robert Altman was a truly unique director and an extraordinary man , " he said .
" We are all saddened by this news and send our condolences to his wife Kathryn and family . "
Actor and author Julian Fellowes , who wrote the screenplay for Altman 's 2001 film Gosford Park , called him " an extraordinary character " .
" He was a giant of the industry ... who kept the energy of a youthful rebel until his 81st year , " he told BBC News 24 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We 've lost one of the truly great directors .
A genuine pioneer

His other films included the " revisionist " Western movie McCabe and Mrs Miller and comic strip adaptation Popeye .
His last film , A Prairie Home Companion , was released in the US earlier this year .
The cause of his death was not disclosed .
" No other film - maker has gotten a better shake than I have , " he said while accepting his honorary Oscar in March .
" I 'm very fortunate in my career .
" I 've never had to direct a film I did n't choose or develop .
My love for film - making has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition . "

Description :
Pacific Ocean with portions of North America , South America , Asia , and East Indies .
I found myself reading Herman Hesse ’s famous novel Siddhartha over my holiday break .
The story follows the man Siddhartha as he goes along his quest for truth , stumbles into confusion and despair but eventually finds wisdom .
There is one particular passage at the end of the novel where Siddhartha is trying to give his friend , Godvinda , wisdom while he nears the end of his life .
Godvinda had long sought teachings from many wise men but had failed to find wisdom himself .
Siddhartha explains to his friend that wisdom cannot be taught , only knowledge can .
That for every truth , the opposite is equally true as well .
That by teaching something you must leave something behind .
It is easy to make someone out as your guru when you are learning something new .
Their teachings can help you make new strides in understanding .
But teachings cannot ever be complete or perfect .
In explaining the world you have to cut off part of the truth .
Only through experience can you receive that missing half .
A partial version of the truth can be better than nothing , that is why listening to teachings is important .
But in order for you to fully understand , you have to experience things for yourself .
See what parts are true and where it does n’t fit .
Some speakers have told me that if you want to commit to something , burning your ships before moving on can ensure that you actually carry it out .
But others have also said that keeping a safe path as well can keep you from unnecessary risk .
Who is right ?
Probably both are .
They are both truths , if only partial ones .
So how can you learn anything from a teacher where partial truths are all that is available and the opposite of a profound truth is just another profound truth ?
The answer to this difficult question is to understand that teachings may be part truth , part lie , but what really matters is the effect they have .
If I tell you to get in shape , this may be a bad move if you have a medical problem .
For enough people I am telling them the truth they need to hear even if the partial lie gets rushed in as well .
The teacher in any field is always trying to give you the truth they feel will be helpful , while hoping the lie that gets attached wo n’t be damaging .
This is no excuse for not finding your own complete truths in life , but it can help you until you do .
Do n’t hero worship .
If you like an author , great .
That person is just communicating a more helpful truth than a damaging lie .
Learn from as many different teachers as possible .
Everyone who gives you advice will give you this mixed package of truths and lies .
Learn from a variety to prevent getting stuck in a dogma when the lie that is given hurts more than the truth can help .
There is no profound wisdom .
Nothing I ever write is going to be wisdom .
What little wisdom I have ( and I assure you it is a lot smaller than I often get credit for ) cannot possibly be communicated though words .
I ’ll try to give you some truths and some lies and hope that the truths help and the lies do n’t hurt much .
That ’s all I can do .
Go out and get the full truth for yourself .
Do n’t live in a self - help book or an audio tape .
Find your own wisdom through experience .
You are the only guru out there .
Seek the truths and understandings that are unteachable .
You are the only one who can offer wisdom that ’s profound .
P.S. In case you were wondering this post is n’t a complete truth either , so take it with a grain of salt …
Q : What ’s missing from this story ?
A 69 - year - old woman who was shocked with a stun gun after she honked her car horn at a police cruiser has been convicted of resisting arrest for sparking a quarrel with officers .
A Circuit Court jury refused to send Louise Jones to jail , fining her $ 650 instead .
Jonesâ€™ attorney , Basil North , said he might appeal .
â€œWe donâ€™t think she should have been convicted of anything , â€  he said .
On June 15 , 2004 , police officers Cory Le Moine and Ryan VanDeusen responded to a domestic disturbance call near Jonesâ€™ home .
The officers were cruising the street slowly , watching for trouble .
Jones was in her car behind the police vehicle when she honked her horn and pulled into her driveway .
Police , spooked by the horn , parked and questioned Jones , leading to a scuffle after they threatened to write her a ticket .
The stun gun of one of the officers discharged during the altercation , according to testimony .

You have to stretch your neck and spin your head around to even try to grasp Brendan Miniter ‘s reasoning in his Wall Street Journal column of yesterday .
Miniter writes that there is a connection between gay marriage and the rise in out - of - wedlock births in the U.S .
What ?
Okay , Miniter has an explanation for this assertion , right ?
Wrong .
He claims that “ Although advocates of same - sex marriage will deny there is any connection … ” between gay marriage and increased out - of - wedlock births , he does not utter a word about why there would be such a connection .
Miniter says that , according to reports from the National Center for Health Statistics , teen pregnancy is down , but more unmarried women in their 20s and 30s are having children .
The only possible related explanation , of course , is that those women are lesbians and that they are in gay marriages .
However , very , very few gay Americans are married , since gay marriage is rarely permitted .
And lesbians and gay men who want children have children , regardless of whether they are fortunate enough to be married ( if that is what they choose ) .
So add to marriage to family members and children and marriage to dogs and cats , an increase in out - of - wedlock births if gay marriage is permitted .
And I ’ll add some : divorce , spousal abuse , child abuse , and infidelity .
Oh , wait …we already have those .
JERUSALEM , Oct. 18 — Israeli troops uncovered five smuggling tunnels today as the forces advanced along the Gaza Strip ’s southern border with Egypt , and four Palestinians were killed in overnight clashes , according to the Israeli military and Palestinian security officials .
Over the past week , the Israeli forces have staged almost daily raids in Gaza , and more than 25 Palestinians , most of them Hamas militants , have been killed .
“ We have no intention of going back and controlling Gaza , ” the Israeli defense minister , Amir Peretz said in Parliament .
“ But we are obligated to provide security for the citizens of Israel .
We will not make a policy of closing our eyes to the smuggling . ”
The Palestinian Authority denounced the Israeli military action , calling it a “ criminal escalation that is reaching all cities and villages . ”
This Photoshop full tutorial illustrates painting , and artistic , effects to create these Abstract Planetary Rings — you ’ll be creating abstract planetary rings on Earth to give it a supernatural feel .
It is also a good tutorial in using Filter effects …
In this tutorial we will create abstract planetary rings on Earth to give it a supernatural feel .
It is also a good tutorial in using Filter effects …
Before we begin , let ’s take a look at the image we ’re creating
Step 1
First of all create a new square document and fill it with black .
Reset your background and foregrounds colors by pressing D. Go to Filter > Render > Lens Flare .
Use the settings in the image below
Step 2
Go to Filter > Distort >
Twirl and set a big angle
Step 3
Go to Filter > Sketch >
Chrome and use these settings
Step 4
Now we will add color to our image .
Press Ctrl - U to open the Hue / Saturation box , adjust its color as you like
Step 5
We will make its color more vivid .
Press Ctrl - J to duplicate the current layer and change its blending mode to Screen
Press Ctrl - E to merge down this layer
Step 6
Go to Filter > Distort >
Twirl and use the settings in the image ( same as step 2 )
Now , to get going , we ’ll need our planet image , and then conduct a number of other steps to finish up …
Continue with Step 7 , next page
Step 7
We need a planet image .
You can use the image above
Cut it out and paste on our document , resize it to a smaller size
Step 8
Choose the Background layer and press Ctrl - J to duplicate it .
Go to Edit > Transform >
Perspective and scale it down
( Leave this mode by selecting Move Tool and click Apply when the dialog box appears )
Step 9
With the Move Tool selected , click on the Show Transform Controls checkbox to turn it on .
Rotate the image a bit
Leave this mode , hide the Background layer by clicking on the Eye icon near it .
Your image will look like this
Step 10
Move Layer 2 ( the Earth layer ) under Background copy layer
Step 11
Change the Blending Mode of the Background copy Layer to Screen and move the Earth to the center
Step 12
Create a new layer ( Layer 3 ) under Layer 2 and fill it with black ( left below )
Now we have a broader outer space !
Step 13
Make a selection on the planet .
The easiest way to do it is press Ctrl and left click on Layer 2 ( right above )
Select the Elliptical Marquee Tool and set a big feather with Subtract from Selection option and make a big selection area to exclude it out
Press Delete to clear it .
Here is our image after this step
Now the main idea is finished .
Next we will decorate the image with a starry sky !
Step 14
Select the Brush Tool and set a Brush size of 3 pixels
Select the Brushes on the right toolbar and click on Scattering checkbox , use the settings below
Now create a new layer and draw as you like .
We will have a nice background soon !
Step 15
Double click on the current layer to open up the Layer Style box , we just need to use Outer Glow effect
That ’s it !
This tutorial produces a stunning effect when coupled with a starry background .
However the best thing is that it shows a few things we can do with Filters – and in my opinion one of the best features in Photoshop !

Fireworks.js
A javascript animation experiment
What 's this all about ?
( AKA , " Holy pointless lightshow , Batman ! " )
Fireworks.js is a bit of Javascript that creates starburst - type explosions in a web document ; in short , it 's a fireworks effect someone could theoretically use on their site .
And come on , who does n't want something like that ?
As far as appropriateness is concerned , this effect could be compared to the dripping - blood - line , skull and fireball animated .GIF images so popular on the web in 1997 .
Exploding firework animations are hot , the new black , the script equivalent of the blink tag .
Mmm , blink tag .
Nonetheless , Fireworks has been published here for fun , experimenting a bit with simple trigonometry and math , and those who are perhaps interested in javascript animation , object - oriented code or script - driven sound .
It also serves as a dirty browser performance test of sorts , as a large number of elements are dynamically created , moved and destroyed on this page as the script runs .
Demo Controls
Why explain through reading when you can demonstrate by example ?
Try playing around with the sliders below for a wide range of visual effects .
Not all combinations will look good , but the idea is to experiment .
Drag the sliders ( or click a point on the bar ) to set the various parameters available such as blast radius and the number of particles per explosion , then click " fire " to see the results .

And so it begins .
Universal Music Group exec Doug Morris told the Reuters Media Summit that his company is interested in receiving a cut of the profits from each iPod sold .
" It would be a nice idea .
We have a negotiation coming up not too far .
I do n't see why we would n't do that ... but maybe not in the same way , " Morris said .
His " same way " comment is a reference to the Zune , which Universal already gets $ 1 from after signing a deal with Microsoft .
Universal believes that much of the music on portable players is illegal , and the company argues that it deserves a share of the profits from such devices in order to make up for the money lost in album sales .
Microsoft 's decision to cut a deal seems to have been driven by its need to launch with a large music store for the Zune — and Universal is one of the biggest players in the game .
The Microsoft deal will clearly set a precedent for other music labels , who will no doubt try to squeeze cash from both Microsoft and Apple in the coming years .
From one perspective , this looks like an obviously bad thing for consumers , who are being " taxed " even if their music collections are fully legal .
But looked at from another way , this could also be seen as a positive move that could open the door to the sort of levy that could legalize file - swapping in the US .
Sure , it 's not going to happen anytime soon , but it does show that the labels understand the concept of being paid a flat fee to cover file - swapping .
How great would it be to pay an extra $ 50 for an iPod , but be able to legally download all the music you want ?
Economists and activists have both suggested such a system be implanted on a national scale in order to solve the " file - swapping problem , " but the music industry will probably resist a full - blown levy , and neither Apple nor Microsoft would be too excited about it .
By making it legal to swap music , a levy would also remove the need for most DRM and the need to use one company 's music store .
It 's nice to dream about the possibilities , but the reality is that the music labels now want both things .
They want a levy on each player sold , but still want the long arm of US law to reach out and pluck thousands of dollars from file - swappers ' pockets .

escargo 8 Mar 2006 - If lines of code is really an important metric to you , the three set commands could be replaced with the foreach idiom to do multiple assignments :
if 0 { foreach {:: server :: chan ::me} {irc.freenode.org #tcl $ tcl_platform ( user ) } break }
That would cut the number of lines by two .
- RS : Well , yes , but no ... and you 'd need a list anyway , since you refer to tcl_platform ...
My major metrics is not lines of code , but of course I try to remove all redundancies - KISS .
But I do prefer scripts with < 72 lines , just because in printout they fit on a single page :-)
I also noticed the expressions in the if commands were unbraced .
Is that right ?
Is that good style ?
- RS : I have the rule for myself that an if condition that consists of a single function call ( typically returning 0 or 1 ) can be unbraced - I consider the time needed to parse the strings " 0 " resp .
" 1 " small enough that I rather spare myself the visual clutter of {[...]}.
Matter of taste , of course .

There are a few things about this code that I dont understand .

picoIRC 0.3 is a more elaborate version by SS .
MJ - added handling of the PING request .
Perhaps its just me , but that ping handler is sending some nastyness into the running of the script

We ’ve all seen the PC vs Mac ads by Apple , there are plenty of them .
But now it ’s time for the PC to counterattack , with the help of director Laurie McGuinness , who created four small hilarious clips , with the same character personalities ( the PC being older , “ boring ” , and the Mac being younger and cooler ) , but this time the Mac does n’t get the spotlight .
What I liked about the clips is that they ’re not made in order to harm the Mac , and they do n’t deny the qualities portraied in the Mac ads , but they observe the PC ’s own qualities , without denying the Mac’s .
So , without more description , here are the clips :

From time to time , programmers sail into uncharted waters - the business and clients agree to give them some time to build a prototype and evaluate a new technology , or explore ways to get something done .
A month or so later , after a software scaffolding is built to show how something can be done , one of the worst examples of corporate insanity happens - almost certainly .
Some brilliant mind thinks of a way to save money or deliver earlier by patching up and shipping the prototype .
I have never seen that produce any good - not once .
By ‘ good ’ , I mean a better product , delivered faster than if the prototype was thrown away .
Yet , no amount of convincing or logic seems to be effective against the promise of earlier delivery .
The whole idea of prototyping is to test potential solutions , which means that a lot of them will turn out to be wrong .
Prototype code is typically inconsistent , as it reflects experiments and trials , and evolves with gained knowledge .
But , as the prototype is not meant for delivery , the changes do not propagate to parts already written unless absolutely necessary - so most prototype code will not be re-factored and re-tested .
Prototypes simply contain too much hacks and problematic code to be used as a foundation for production software - so asking me to build something on that reminds me of the Python quote ‘ Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp , but I built it all the same , just to show ‘ em .
It sank into the swamp ’ .
My only consolation , so far , has been that this insanity also affects others , and is even recorded in The inmates are running the Asylum .
Sometimes , I get away by just agreeing to patch the prototype and then re-write the software properly .
But this can backfire badly if the ‘ brilliant ’ minds find out ( and they are typically in power ) .
A recent post Do n’t make the demo look done on Creating Passionate Users attacks this problem from a different angle - suggesting to handicap the prototype intentionally .
However , this can also backfire - as customers may be unsatisfied with the results .
I think that I finally discovered a good solution - one that does not require any politics , long arguments or smuggling the re-write as ‘ work on cleaning features ’ .
I tried it a few months ago and got away with it , without any complaints .
Write the prototype in an obscure language
Do the prototype so that it can not be shipped .
Choose an obscure language or platform .
When someone suggests that the prototype should be patched up and shipped - the answer is simple : ‘ OK , but it is written in [ insert obscure language here ] , so we need a month to re-write it in [ insert production language here ] , and then ship it ’.
No arguments , no politics .
They all agreed to pay for the prototyping in the first place , so there is no additional cost - just a missed ‘ chance to save some money and time ’ .
I did mine this time in Python and on Linux , because the target platform for the final version was Windows and C# .
Do n’t take this wrong - it ’s not that I do not consider Python / Linux as a production platform ( I have delivered Python / Linux software to several other clients , with great success ) , but Python / Linux combination was completely unusable for production in this case .
It would cost clients much more to introduce a new platform than the amount they would ‘ save ’ by cutting the development instead of proper prototype re-write , as they would have to train their IT staff and support .
There are quite a few choices today - Python , Ruby , Groovy , JavaScript .
Even if the target platform is one of them , the prototype can be written in some other .
On the beginning , everyone knows that the prototype is not going to be production - quality code , so no one should complain about some ‘ obscure ’ technology , since the software is not written to be shipped to the market .
The prototype will actually be written much faster in a dynamic language then in Java , C# or other similar languages - which will help in convincing stakeholders to approve it .
When our latest prototype was done , there was even no attempt to patch it up - which surprised me .
In any case , this was a win / win situation - writing the prototype in Python allowed us to start a web server and open an interactive console to re-wire it and perform live brain - surgery while the server is running .
I cannot imagine doing that in Java or C# .
In a month , we wrote the functional equivalent of at least 4 - 5 months of C# code .
On the end , the prototype was thrown away , and everything was re-written , discarding half - developed solutions and throwing away ideas that turned out to be wrong .

Along with various Seattle business and community leaders , city planners and politicians , a large group of scientists from the University of Washington got a chance to preview the new film , An Inconvenient Truth , last week .
The film is about Al Gore ’s efforts to educate the public about global warming , with the goal of creating the political will necessary for the United States to take the lead in efforts to lower global carbon emissions .
It is an inspiring film , and is decidedly non-partisan in its outlook ( though there are a few subtle references to the Bush administration ’s lack of leadership on this and other environmental issues ) .
Since Gore is rumored to be a fan of RealClimate , we thought it appropriate to give our first impressions .
Much of the footage in Inconvenient Truth is of Al Gore giving a slideshow on the science of global warming .
Sound boring ?
Well , yes , a little .
But it is a very good slide show , in the vein of Carl Sagan ( lots of beautiful imagery , and some very slick graphics and digital animation ) .
And it is interspersed with personal reflections from Gore that add a very nice human element .
Gore in the classroom in 1968 , listening to the great geochemist Roger Revelle describe the first few years of data on carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere .
Gore on the family farm , talking about his father ’s tobacco business , and how he shut it down when his daughter ( Al Gore ’s sister ) got lung cancer .
Gore on the campaign trail , and his disappointment at the Supreme Court decision .
This is n’t the “ wooden ” Gore of the 2000 campgain ; he is clearly in his element here , talking about something he has cared deeply about for over 30 years .
How well does the film handle the science ?
Admirably , I thought .
It is remarkably up to date , with reference to some of the very latest research .
Discussion of recent changes in Antarctica and Greenland are expertly laid out .
He also does a very good job in talking about the relationship between sea surface temperature and hurricane intensity .
As one might expect , he uses the Katrina disaster to underscore the point that climate change may have serious impacts on society , but he does n’t highlight the connection any more than is appropriate ( see our post on this , here ) .
There are a few scientific errors that are important in the film .
At one point Gore claims that you can see the aerosol concentrations in Antarctic ice cores change “ in just two years ” , due to the U.S. Clean Air Act .
You ca n’t see dust and aerosols at all in Antarctic cores — not with the naked eye — and I ’m skeptical you can definitively point to the influence of the Clean Air Act .
I was left wondering whether Gore got this notion , and I hope he ’ll correct it in future versions of his slideshow .
Another complaint is the juxtaposition of an image relating to CO 2 emissions and an image illustrating invasive plant species .
This is misleading ; the problem of invasive species is predominantly due to land use change and importation , not to “ global warming ” .
Still , these are rather minor errors .
It is true that the effect of reduced leaded gasoline use in the U.S. does clearly show up in Greenland ice cores ; and it is also certainly true that climate change could exacerbate the problem of invasive species .
Several of my colleagues complained that a more significant error is Gore ’s use of the long ice core records of CO 2 and temperature ( from oxygen isotope measurements ) in Antarctic ice cores to illustrate the correlation between the two .
The complaint is that the correlation is somewhat misleading , because a number of other climate forcings besides CO 2 contribute to the change in Antarctic temperature between glacial and interglacial climate .
Simply extrapolating this correlation forward in time puts the temperature in 2100 A.D. somewhere upwards of 10 C warmer than present — rather at the extreme end of the vast majority of projections ( as we have discussed here ) .
However , I do n’t really agree with my colleagues ’ criticism on this point .
Gore is careful not to state what the temperature / CO 2 scaling is .
He is making a qualitative point , which is entirely accurate .
The fact is that it would be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO 2 changes ( as we have discussed here ) .
In that sense , the ice core CO 2 - temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO 2 on climate .
For the most part , I think Gore gets the science right , just as he did in Earth in the Balance .
The small errors do n’t detract from Gore ’s main point , which is that we in the United States have the technological and institutional ability to have a significant impact on the future trajectory of climate change .
This is not entirely a scientific issue — indeed , Gore repeatedly makes the point that it is a moral issue — but Gore draws heavily on Pacala and Socolow ’s recent work to show that the technology is there ( see Science 305 , p. 968 Stabilization Wedges : Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies ) .
I ’ll admit that I have been a bit of a skeptic about our ability to take any substantive action , especially here in the U.S .
Gore ’s aim is to change that viewpoint , and the colleagues I saw the movie with all seem to agree that he is successful .
In short : this film is worth seeing .
It opens in early June .
Mr. Chomsky said that he would not choose to use the same harsh oratory , but added that the Venezuelan leader was simply expressing the views of many in the world .
And he said Mr. Chávez ’s anger was understandable .

“ The Bush administration backed a coup to overthrow his government , ” he said .
“ Suppose Venezuela supported a military coup that overthrew the government of the United States ?
Would we think it was a joke ? ”
Proving that he was still up for a lively debate , Mr. Chomsky then went on to talk about income inequality in Latin America , the history of the United Nations , Iraq , Iran , Fidel Castro and , finally , the man who so fervently admires him , Mr. Chávez .
“ I have been quite interested in his policies , ” Mr. Chomsky said .
“ Personally , I think many of them are quite constructive . ”
Most important , he said , Mr. Chávez seems to have the overwhelming support of the people in his country .
“ He has gone through six closely supervised elections , ” he said .
So would Mr. Chomsky oblige Mr. Chávez ’s wish for a meeting , helping ensure that the South American leader will not have that regret to live with anymore ?
“ I would be happy to meet him , ” Mr. Chomsky said .
But that encounter may have to wait : Mr. Chávez was to return to Venezuela as soon as today .
Editors ’ Note : Oct. 6 , 2006
An article on Sept. 21 about criticism of President Bush at the United Nations by President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran reported that Mr. Chavez praised a book by Noam Chomsky , the linguist and social critic .
It reported that later , at a news conference , Mr. Chavez said that he regretted not having met Mr. Chomsky before he died .
The article noted that in fact , Mr. Chomsky is alive .
The assertion that Mr. Chavez had made this misstatement was repeated in a Times interview with Mr. Chomsky the next day .
The officers - combat veterans who are experts in counter - insurgency - are charged with implementing the " new way forward " strategy announced by George Bush on January 10 .
The plan includes a controversial " surge " of 21,500 additional American troops to establish security in the Iraqi capital and Anbar province .
But the team , known as the " Baghdad brains trust " and ensconced in the heavily fortified Green Zone , is struggling to overcome a range of entrenched problems in what has become a race against time , according to a former senior administration official familiar with their deliberations .
" They know they are operating under a clock .
They know they are going to hear a lot more talk in Washington about ' Plan B ' by the autumn - meaning withdrawal .
They know the next six - month period is their opportunity .
And they say it 's getting harder every day , " he said .
By improving security , the plan 's short - term aim is to create time and space for the Iraqi government to bring rival Shia , Sunni and Kurd factions together in a process of national reconciliation , American officials say .
If that works within the stipulated timeframe , longer term schemes for rebuilding Iraq under the so - called " go long " strategy will be set in motion .
But the next six months are make - or - break for the US military and the Iraqi government .
The main obstacles confronting Gen Petraeus 's team are :
· Insufficient troops on the ground
· A " disintegrating " international coalition
· An anticipated increase in violence in the south as the British leave
· Morale problems as casualties rise
· A failure of political will in Washington and / or Baghdad .
" The scene is very tense , " the former official said .
" They are working round the clock .
Endless cups of tea with the Iraqis .
But they 're still trying to figure out what 's the plan .
The president is expecting progress .
But they 're thinking , what does he mean ?
The plan is changing every minute , as all plans do . "
The team is an unusual mix of combat experience and academic achievement .
It includes Colonel Peter Mansoor , a former armoured division commander with a PhD in the history of infantry ; Colonel HR McMaster , author of a well - known critique of Vietnam and a seasoned counter - insurgency operations chief ; Lt - Col David Kilcullen , a seconded Australian officer and expert on Islamism ; and Colonel Michael Meese , son of the former US attorney - general Edwin Meese , who was a member of the ill - fated Iraq Study Group .
Their biggest headache was insufficient troops on the ground despite the increase ordered by President Bush , the former official said .
" We do n't have the numbers for the counter - insurgency job even with the surge .
The word ' surge ' is a misnomer .
Strategically , tactically , it 's not a surge , " an American officer said .
According to the US military 's revised counter - insurgency field manual , FM 3 - 24 , written by Gen Petraeus , the optimum " troop - to - task " ratio for Baghdad requires 120,000 US and allied troops in the city alone .
Current totals , even including often unreliable Iraqi units , fall short and the deficit is even greater in conflict areas outside Baghdad .
" Additional troops are essential if we are to win , " said Lt - Col John Nagel , co-author of the manual , in an address at the US Naval Institute in San Diego last month .
One soldier for every 50 civilians in the most intense conflict areas was key to successful counter - insurgency work .
Compounding the manpower problems is an apparently insurmountable shortage of civilian volunteers from the Pentagon , state department and treasury .
They are needed to staff the additional provincial reconstruction teams and other aid projects promised by Mr Bush .
The cut in British troops in southern Iraq , coupled with the actual or anticipated departure of other allies , has heightened the Petraeus team 's worries that the international coalition is " disintegrating " even as the US strives to regain the initiative in Iraq , the former official said .
Increased violence in the south is expected , caused in part by the " displacement " of Shia militias forced out of Baghdad by the US crackdown .
American and Iraq forces entered the militant Shia stronghold of Sadr City on Tuesday for the first time since the surge began .
No other major operation has yet been attempted there but " we or the Iraqis are going to have to fight them " , one US officer said .
According to a British source , plans are in hand for the possible southwards deployment of 6,000 US troops to compensate for Britain 's phased withdrawal and any upsurge in unrest .
Morale is another concern in the Green Zone headquarters : American forces are preparing for a rise in casualties as the crackdown gathers pace .
In a message to the troops after he assumed overall command last month , Gen Petraeus praised their sacrifices while warning of more " difficult times " to come .
" We serve in Iraq at a critical time ... A decisive moment approaches .
Shoulder to shoulder with our Iraqi comrades we will conduct a pivotal campaign to improve security for the Iraqi people .
The stakes could not be higher , " Gen Petraeus said .
" It 's amazing how well morale has held up so far , " the former official said .
" But the guys know what 's being said back home .
There is no question morale is gradually being sapped by political debates . "
The advisers are also said to be struggling to prevent the " politicisation " of the surge by the Shia - dominated government .
The fear is that any security advances may be exploited to further weaken the position of Baghdad 's Sunni minority .
Despite progress this week on a new law sharing Iraq 's oil wealth , the Petraeus team believes the government is failing to work hard enough to meet other national reconciliation " benchmarks " set by Mr Bush .
Yet it is accepted that the US is asking the prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , to do what most politicians in normal circumstances would refuse to contemplate .
" What we 're doing is asking Maliki to confront his own powerbase , " one officer said .
Possibly the biggest longer term concern of Gen Petraeus 's team is that political will in Washington may collapse just as the military is on the point of making a counter - insurgency breakthrough .
According to a senior administration official , speaking this week , this is precisely what happened in the final year of the Vietnam war .
Steven Simon , the national security council 's senior director for transnational threats during the Clinton administration , said a final meltdown in political and public backing was likely if the new strategy was not seen to be working quickly .
" The implosion of domestic support for the war will compel the disengagement of US forces .
It is now just a matter of time , " Mr Simon said in a paper written for the Council on Foreign Relations .
" Better to withdraw as a coherent and at least somewhat volitional act than withdraw later in hectic response to public opposition ... or to a series of unexpectedly sharp reverses on the ground , " he said .
" If it gets really tough in the next few months , it will throw fuel on the fire in Washington , " the former official said .
" Congress will be emboldened in direct proportion to the trouble in Iraq . "
If the policy was not judged to be working by Labor Day ( the first Monday in September which marks the start of the new political year ) , Mr Bush could lose control of the policy to Congress and be forced to begin a phased pull - out , he suggested .
A senior Pentagon official said this week that it was too early to gauge the strategy 's chances of success - but preliminary reports were encouraging .
" There are some promising signs .
There is a new overall Iraqi commander in Baghdad .
A number of joint operations have just begun .
The number of political murders has fallen .
Iraqi forces are showing up as promised , admittedly a little bit under strength , and are taking up some of the responsibilities that Maliki said he would , " he said .
" We have to be realistic .
We 're not going to stop the suicide bombers and the roadside explosive devices for some time .
And the military alone are certainly not going to solve the problem .
Maliki has to meet the benchmarks .
A civilian surge is needed , too .
The Iraqis have to do it themselves . "
US officials say they also have rising hopes of a breakthrough in Sunni - dominated Anbar province where tribal chiefs are increasingly hostile to al - Qaida and foreign fighters - and are looking to build bridges with moderate Shias .
But this week 's US decision to join talks on Iraq with Iran and Syria , after previously refusing to do so , is nevertheless seen as an indication of the administration 's growing alarm at the possibility of a historic strategic failure .

Cultivate the habit of " boiling matters down " to the simplest terms .
An elevator speech is the best way .
Do n't get excited in engineering emergencies .
Keep your feet on the ground .
Cultivate the habit of making quick , clean - cut decisions .
When making decisions , the pros are much easier to deal with than the cons .
Your boss wants to see the cons also .
Do n't ever lose your sense of humor .
Have fun at what you do .
It will reflect in your work .
No one likes a grump except another grump .
Taken from here ( also , recently mentioned in Business 2.0 magazine as referenced by Tom Peter 's very useful TP Wire Service ) .
The Business 2.0 article requires a subscription , but includes an explanatory comment from Swanson on each one .
It also omits some rules from the list above , while adding others .
Update ( 06/27 ) - this post is getting a lot of traffic today , so I thought I would add the " extra " rules from the Business 2.0 article ( the parentheticals are mine ) .
You can't polish a sneaker .
( notice when something has n't got any real substance )
You remember 1/ 3 of what you read , 1 / 2 of what people tell you , but 100 percent of what you feel .
( leaders generate emotions that move people in the desired direction )
Treat your company name as if it were your own ( possibly the same as # 19 above )
When faced with decisions , try to look at them as if you were one level up in the organization .
Your perspective will change quickly .
( your boss has to weigh more considerations than you do in making a decision ) A person who is nice to you but rude to the watiter is not a nice person .
When facing issues or problems that are becoming drawn out , " short them to ground . " ( solve problems instead of talking about solving problems ) .
Lists like these are reassuring .
But the real trick is to put them into practice when you 're in the thick of the fray .
What ever your rule set , it 's application has to be internalized and almost reflexive to be effective .
Maybe a better example would have been something like market success or how one can dispel things like “ I hate this game and its basically broken and everyone who likes it is dumb ” .
Wisdom of the Crowds sort of says if millions of people like something , then maybe there ’s something there to like .
— Darniaq , on his blog
I ’ve been meaning to write broadly on the subject of “ the future of content ” for a while now .
And a huge part of that topic is tied in with the question of “ what is popularity , and what does it mean , anyway ? ”
Darniaq ’s throwaway comment , along with this post on the Long Tail blog gives me an excuse to dig a little bit at that .
Darniaq is referencing , in part , this earlier post of mine in which I discuss The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki .
My immediate reaction is that the wisdom of crowds is n’t everything .
Let ’s look at examples …
Let us consider the case of Eleanor Hodgeman Porter .
You probably do n’t know who she was .
She lived from 1868 to 1920 , and wrote a lot of books .
Books that cumulatively sold millions of copies , such as Miss Billy , her first bestseller .
Her big hit , however , was Pollyanna .
Published in a first edition in 1913 , it had sold a million copies by 1919 or so , and it ’s still in print today .
It had its first stage production on Broadway in 1915 , and it ’s been filmed a few times , both as silent movies and as a Disney movie starring Hayley Mills .
As of right now , my book is outselling Pollyanna on Amazon , by quite a lot .
In fact , my book actually has a higher average review .
Now , this does n’t mean much , to my mind .
Is my book better than Pollyanna ?
Will it be read longer ?
Somehow , I doubt it .
Pollyanna opened big , and AToF did not .
On the other hand , what has been the lasting contribution to culture from Pollyanna ?
Not to be too down on old Eleanor , but the major lasting effect of the book seems to have been the coinage of the word “ pollyanna , ” which is a derogatory term for people who do what the heroine of the book does : look optimistically at the world .
What we have here is a classic whose central worldview is derided so much that it has entered the language meaning the opposite of the author ’s intention !
What does the widsom of crowds tell us about Pollyanna ?
Is it possible that this enduring classic of children ’s literature is in fact “ broken ” in Darniaq ’s terms ?
Which aspect of the wisdom of crowds do we trust — the ongoing sales and impressive lifetime record the title has racked up , or the popular conception of the work that has such a firm hold on the collective cultural brain ?
Of course , one might say that the teen years of last century were simply a sunnier time ( at least , prior to the Great War ) , and we have grown more cynical since then .
That the wisdom of crowds effectively changes over time .
What does this mean for popularity ?
Consider the saga of poor Percy Marks ’ book The Plastic Age , which is n’t even available on Amazon anymore .
It was the # 2 fiction bestseller of 1924 and was filmed in 1925 .
Then , it basically vanished .
In 1980 it reappears as part of a book series entitled “ Lost American Fiction . ”
Here we have an author whose papers were considered important enough that they are held by Yale , who wrote 17 books and was published by Harper ’s and The Saturday Evening Post .
The Plastic
Age was in fact the # 5 most - purchased book of fiction by libraries in its year of publication .
But it was Britney Spears .
The “ college novel ” was undergoing a boom , and Marks ’ book was sexually explicit , for the day .
None of the reviews cited literary quality .
The book had no “ legs . ”
One of the interesting things about how popularity works is the “ open big ” phenomenon .
It ’s best illustrated by a curve that looks like this :
This curve is incredibly familiar these days : it ’s the curve showing number of moviegoers over time to a film release , the number of games sold per day of release , the number of hits to a website after a major PR push , and so on and on and on .
What this curve is showing is that in a hit - driven world , you get most of your folks checking you out on the first day , certainly in the first week .
And after that , you slowly slide down the radar until you ’re in niche - land .
Your status as a “ bestseller ” essentially depends on how slowly the slide happens .
What ’s your “ legs ” ?
If the curve looks familiar from other contexts , it ’s probably because it looks like the Long Tail .
And indeed , on the sidebar of that wonderful blog , we find an excerpt from this New York Times article saying ,
In most cases , nearly half of a movie ’s total audience turns out in the first week of release , which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience .
In other words , many people go to a movie without any real information about it – without even reading a review .
Or , put most cynically :
Most of the time , there is no relationship between how good a film is , and how many people turn out to see it .
What is the wisdom of crowds telling us then ?
That we ’re suckers for a marketing campaign ?
Ah , but it ’s not that simple .
If you look at books on word - of - mouth marketing or even books on network graph theory or books on the psychology of influence you ’ll see just how vulnerable we are to what gets called everything from “ preferential link attachment ” to “ being a lemming ” — to wit , the fact that we tend to do what others do .
Over and over again , market research has shown that marketing itself is really low on the list of reasons to buy something .
Usually , the reason you buy something is because a friend tells you to because they are an active user of the product — and the reason they have for having bought it may be no better .
This means that large products tend to get larger , as long as users do n’t expire out quickly .
Over time , this can lead to market stagnation , as one dominant product locks in users and acquires a monopoly .
A first - mover advantage can be significant here .
The classic word - of - mouth adoption curve looks very different from the “ open big ” curve .
A book that was the # 1 bestseller for two solid years in the early 1970 ’s had this sort of curve : Jonathan Livingston Seagull .
Richard Bach ’s book is , in fact , outselling my book even to this day , even though it was rejected by over 20 publishers before seeing the light of day , was greeted by derisive reviews ( Publisher ’s Weekly commented that it was “ a mite too icky poo ” ) , and had basically no advertising budget .
We ’re actually seeing a few games in the online space today that are following J- curves : Runescape , Second Life , Eve Online … games with legs , that did n’t open big , but are spreading virally .
What does all this add up to ?
Well , in my opinion , it adds up to the notion that just because millions of people like something does n’t mean that it is n’t broken , or that people are n’t dumb for liking it .
And conversely , there may be things that everyone agrees are great , but that do n’t have popularity .
In a hit - driven world , popularity is ephemeral and means very little .
The real questions come over the long haul , and maybe it ’s there that the wisdom of crowds can emerge .
But on short spans of time , the wisdom of crowds is just as vulnerable to lemming - like behavior as anything else .
The trifecta is something that opens fairly well , builds via word of mouth , and retains interest over a long enough span of time that it “ stays in print ” and continues to draw an audience year after year after year .
This aligns nicely with the ideal business growth of an MMO , I think .
This is running long enough , and I am way way late for dinner , so I ’ll stop here .
But at some point I want to cycle back and talk about whether the gradual demise of hit - driven culture means that the ephemerality of entertainment is going to get worse rather than better .
In a world of niche - only entertainment , are cultural artifacts increasingly disposable ?
What does that mean for the content creators ?
This post would n’t have been possible without this wonderful resource .
Six cool things you can build with OpenID
I ’ve posted the slides from my Future of Web Apps talk on OpenID , minus the demo videos .
I ’m planning to put together a video that combines the slides , demos and audio once the official podcasts have been published .
Apart from explaining what OpenID is and how it works , the key point I was trying to get across in the talk was that OpenID is a simple piece of infrastructure on which smart applications can be built — applications that may not have been possible prior to the adoption of OpenID .
This is due to two important characteristics of OpenID .
The first is that OpenID significantly lowers the effort needed in creating an account , to the point that people might sign up for accounts with services that they otherwise would not have used .
The second is that OpenID provides a globally unique identifier that can be used to correlate information across multiple services .
Light - weight accounts
Vanilla OpenID gives almost no useful information about a user and provides no defence against spammers ; for many applications it makes sense to couple OpenID logins to a one - time account creation process , requesting additional details and using e-mail verification and CAPTCHAs to deter automated scripts .
There are plenty of services for which this is not an issue .
One neat use - case for OpenID is as a simple tool for extending the lifetime of session cookies , or sharing those sessions between different machines .
If your site offers simple customisation features that are only of interest to the user ( and hence have no value to spammers ) you can use OpenID to persist their preferences .
All you need is a way for a user to prove that they ’re still the same person they were yesterday .
Pre-approved accounts
OpenID lets you create accounts for people without e-mailing them a password , or even talking to them before you sign them up .
There are lots of useful things you can do with this ability :
Let your trusted friends delete spam comments from your blog , or fix your typos .
Invite a selected group of people to contribute to your new collaborative weblog , without having to create new accounts for it or deal with yet another password .
Invite friends to view a private document or photo gallery , pre-approving their public OpenIDs as able to authenticate with your site .
Restricted SSO
Once more of the popular open - source applications start supporting OpenID , I can see it really taking off as a simple SSO standard behind the corporate firewall .
Create an OpenID for everyone in your organisation of the form username.internal.example.org , then configure your internal applications ( MediaWiki , phpBB , WordPress etc ) to only accept OpenIDs that match that format .
Site - specific hacks
Lots of sites are setting themselves up as OpenID providers , leading to many users having multiple OpenIDs ; I have OpenIDs from Vox , LiveJournal and AOL , all of which were created as a side - effect of me using those services .
I do n’t see this as being a problem .
As a user , I can pick which is my “ primary ” OpenID ( and use delegation so I can switch providers if I change my mind ) .
Those other OpenIDs can still be useful though , because they let us build functionality that takes the providing site in to account .
Here are a few examples :
“ Log in with your LiveJournal OpenID and we ’ll import your LJ contacts using your FOAF file ” ( doxory.com does something along these lines ) .
“ Log in with your AOL OpenID and we ’ll send you status updates over AIM . ”
“ Log in with your Last . fm OpenID and we ’ll add events from bands you like to your calendar . ”
Sites that offer APIs should start thinking about how they can use OpenID as a simple vector for pushing data out to third party applications .
Social whitelists
I ’ve talked about these previously ; Tom Coates has further thoughts .
By sharing whitelists we can use OpenID to build a simple trust network .
A similar concept is that of publishing groups .
Jyte offers a simple API to export the members of a Jyte group .
Not only does this make groups portable to other services , it also lets you build an authentication mechanism for a site that only allows members of a specific published group to log in to a service .
Decentralised social networks
The problem with social networks is that you end up with profiles scattered across multiple different sites , and friend relationships that are duplicated in multiple places .
The globally unique identifier offered by OpenID offers the basis for a decentralised social network , with profiles tied together across multiple sites and relationships easily portable between services .
Hopefully the above ideas explain why I am personally excited about OpenID , and why I ’m dedicating so much time to encouraging its adoption .
The more people there are that understand and use OpenID , the more interesting applications we can build with it .
The praise of professional critics hardly matters to the book - reviewing readers at Amazon.com .
A compilation of the best of the worst … about the best .
The following are excerpts from actual one - star Amazon.com reviews of books from Time ’s list of the 100 best novels from 1923 to the present .
Some entries have been edited .
Beloved by Toni Morrison ( 1987 )
“ Morrison ’s obviously a good writer , but truly , her subject matter leaves a LOT to be desired in this book .
It ’s raunchy beyond belief .
People do things with farm animals that they should n’t .
I could n’t get through the first two chapters without vomiting .
Some things you just should n’t put in your head . ”
The Bridge of San Luis Rey by Thornton Wilder ( 1927 )
“ Basically all that happens is five people die on a small bridge and then the author goes on to discuss these people ’s lives .
What a BORE .
Unless you ’re some philosophical nerd , you will not enjoy this book at ALL .
If I was the author of this book I ’d tell myself to get a grip on the real world . ”
Catch - 22 by Joseph Heller ( 1961 )
“ Obviously , a lot people were smoking a lot of weed in the ’60s to think this thing is worth reading . ”
The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger ( 1951 )
“ So many other good books … do n’t waste your time on this one .
J.D. Salinger went into hiding because he was embarrassed . ”
A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess ( 1963 )
“ In the first 20 pages , Alex and his lackies beat a guy senseless and rob him ; they steal a car and trash it , they get into a vicious gang fight ; they attack a couple at their home , destroy the husband ’s life work ( his book , A Clockwork Orange ) , beat him and his wife senseless , and rape the wife .
This really ticked me off . ”
The Confessions of Nat Turner by William Styron ( 1967 )
“ My great - great - grandfather is not gay !
I do n’t know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great - great - grandfather .
Needless to say I am a descendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting .
I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he did n’t like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a descendant of that union !
Other than that idiotic portrayal the book was good . ”
Go Tell it on the Mountain by James Baldwin ( 1953 )
“ Go tell it on the mountain was an extremely frustrating book .
While the themes and some of the events were good ( i.e. , racism , abuse , religion ) , the way it was written made the book unenjoyable for me .
I found that the way the book was written made it this way for others as well .
I do n’t think this is just a coincidence .
If the book was written differently I probably would have found it enjoyable . ”
Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell ( 1936 )
“ Well , it ’s a girl ’s world .
The world of Gloria Steinem and the popular feminism , as distilled on TV ( including CBC shows , not all fundamentalist Hollywood garbage ) of my youth is GONE .
Now the girls run the show .
You ’re not allowed to call them sluts .
And it ’s impossible to call them virgins .
They ’re all doing Rhett Butler .
So what are they ?
Idiots …
Hope you like the Gangstas .
It ’s what you deserve . ”
The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck ( 1939 )
“ While the story did have a great moral to go along with it , it was about dirt !
Dirt and migrating .
Dirt and migrating and more dirt . ”
Gravity ’s Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon ( 1973 )
“ When one contrasts Vonnegut ’s Slaughterhouse - Five with this book , it ’s like comparing an Olympic sprinter with an obese man running for the bus with a hot dog in one hand and a soda in the other . ”
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald ( 1925 )
“ It grieves me deeply that we Americans should take as our classic a book that is no more than a lengthy description of the doings of fops . ”
The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis ( 1950 )
“ I bought these books to have something nice to read to my grandkids .
I had to stop , however , because the books are nothing more than advertisements for “ Turkish Delight , ” a candy popular in the U.K .
The whole point of buying books for my grandkids was to give them a break from advertising , and here ( throughout ) are ads for this “ Turkish Delight ” !
How much money is this Mr. Lewis getting from the Cadbury ’s chocolate company anyway ?
This man must be laughing to the bank . ”
Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov ( 1955 )
“1) I ’m bored .
2 ) He uses too many allusions to other novels , so that if you ’re not well read , this book makes no sense .
3 ) Most American readers are not fluent in French , so to have conversations or interjections in French with no translation is plain dumb .
4 ) Did I mention I was bored ?
5 ) As with another reviewer , I agree , he uses a lot of huge words that just slow a person down .
And it ’s not for theatrics either , it ’s just huge words mid-sentence when describing something simple .
Nothing in the sense of imagery is gained .
6 ) Also , to sum it up , it ’s a story about a pedophile . ”
Lord of the Flies by William Golding ( 1955 )
“ I am obsessed with Survivor , so I thought it would be fun .
WRONG !!!
It is incredibly boring and disgusting .
I was very much disturbed when I found young children killing each other .
I think that anyone with a conscience would agree with me . ”
The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien ( 1954 )
“ The book is not readable because of the overuse of adverbs . ”
Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf ( 1925 )
“ The only good thing to say about this “ literary ” drivel is that the person responsible , Virginia Woolf , has been dead for quite some time now .
Let us pray to God she stays that way . ”
Naked Lunch by William Burroughs ( 1959 )
“ I ’m a Steely Dan fan so naturally I wanted to read the book they thought compelling enough to name their band after an element of . ”
Native Son by Richard Wright ( 1940 )
“ Well … someone who murders anyone … out of panic ( which is a really stupid , irrational reason ) does not deserve any sympathy .
I felt the book was mainly about black people hating white people …as usual .
Now , tell me anyone … if there was a book about a white person facing discrimination in Africa … or being killed because stones are thrown at them , then everyone would look down on them .
Poorly written . ”
1984 by George Orwell ( 1948 )
“ Do n’t listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between “ serious ” works of literature like this one and allegedly “ lesser ” novels .
The distinction is entirely illusory , because no novels are “ better ” than any others , and the concept of a “ great novel ” is an intellectual hoax .
This book is n’t as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion , and no one can refute me .
Tastes are relative ! ”
On the Road by Jack Kerouac ( 1957 )
“ This book gets my nomination for the most overrated book in American Literature .
It is trite , saccharine and false .
The themes and insights it contains are not even good enough to be third rate .
Moreover , as a prose stylist , Kerouac was probably fourth rate .
In short , I despise this piece of [ garbage ] and would advise all of its hipster doofus fans to lose the tie - dye clothes and throw away their bongs .
Maybe then they will read something good for a change . ”
One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest by Ken Kesey ( 1962 )
“ I guess if you were interested in crazy people this is the book for you . ”
Slaughterhouse - Five by Kurt Vonnegut ( 1969 )
“ In the novel , they often speak of a planet called Tralfamadore , where he was displayed in a zoo with a former movie star by the name of Montana Wildhack .
I thought that the very concept of a man who was kidnapped by aliens was truly unbelievable and a tad ludicrous .
I did not find the idea of aliens kidnapping a human and putting them in a zoo very plausible .
While some of the Tralfamadorians ’ concept of death and living in a moment would be comforting for a war veteran , I found it relatively odd .
I do not believe that an alien can kidnap someone and house them in a zoo for years at a time , while it is only a microsecond on earth .
I also do not believe that a person has seven parents . ”
The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner ( 1929 )
“ This book is like an ungrateful girlfriend .
You do your best to understand her and get nothing back in return . ”
The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway ( 1926 )
“ Here ’s the first half of the book : ‘ We had dinner and a few drinks .
We went to a cafe and talked and had some drinks .
We ate dinner and had a few drinks .
Dinner .
Drinks .
More dinner .
More drinks .
We took a cab here ( or there ) in Paris and had some drinks , and maybe we danced and flirted and talked sh*t about somebody .
More dinner .
More drinks .
I love you , I hate you , maybe you should come up to my room , no you ca n ’t ’…
I flipped through the second half of the book a day or two later and saw the words ‘ dinner ’ and ‘ drinks ’ on nearly every page and figured it was n’t worth the risk . ”
To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee ( 1960 )
“ I do n’t see why this book is so fabulous .
I would give it a zero .
I find no point in writing a book about segregation , there ’s no way of making it into an enjoyable book .
And yes I am totally against segregation . ”
Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller ( 1934 )
“ This book is one of the worst books I have ever read .
I got to about page 3 - 4 . ”

In the comments to Doug ’s last post , and in the comments on Reddit , people seem shocked that Doug would advocate a military coup to overthrow Chavez .
They ’re shocked , of course , because a site called the Liberty Papers would suggest that a military coup to overthrow a quasi - democratically elected president .
The key , of course , is that they equate liberty and democracy .
Only they ’re not equal .
Chavez ’ propensity to nationalize sectors of his economy and his desire to destroy personal wealth through monetary inflation make him a distinct threat to liberty .
To me , it does n’t matter if he was democratically elected or not .
You see , there are two definitions of democracy .
One is the correct definition , and that is rule through elections .
However , that definition is not in common parlance .
The second definition is a state where many of the levers of power are controlled through a democratic manner , in a state which also protects individual rights through the rule of law .
The first definition leads , quite commonly , to tyranny .
The second definition is generally a pretty liberty - friendly society .
You see , here at The Liberty Papers , we have little love for democracy for democracy ’s sake .
We are interested in outcomes which support liberty .
The first definition of democracy does n’t usually do so , as Chavez and Venezuela are pointing out .
The second definition of democracy usually does support liberty , but Chavez has been ruling by decree , not by law , nationalizing the economy , and destroying the currency , so Venezuela does n’t meet the second definition .
Whether Chavez was elected democratically or not , he is acting as a dictator in ways to fundamentally destroy the liberties of the people of Venezuela .
Thus , it is my position that he should be removed from power , for the good of the Venezuelan people .
Now , I ’m not advocating that this be something the United States get involved with .
After all , while Chavez is a loudmouth , he does n’t threaten the United States .
However , should he be overthrown from within by forces who will restore the liberties of the Venezuelan people , I ’ll be raising my glass in support .
UPDATE : It appears that commenter “ lifeofliberty ” is willing to allow anyone who is democratically elected to do whatever they like .
I would assume , then , that he supports President Bush choosing what portions of laws he will or will not enforce through “ signing statements ” ?
I would assume he would n’t have a problem with our Congress giving him near - dictatorial power for 18 months ?
I would assume he ’s in favor of domestic wiretapping , and the suspension of habeas corpus , and Guantanamo bay ?
Because even though Bush was democratically elected , I find those things deplorable and think they are anti-liberty .
I guess “ lifeofliberty ” believes that because “ the people ” voted for Bush , all these things are just fine ?
It happened on the toilet .
I was reading a copy of the free magazine Sky send to all their subscribers .
Visually inhaling crap at one end , rectally exhaling it at the other ; my corporeal self a mere conduit for the elemental crapforce that binds the universe together .
I have all the spirituality of a doorframe .
This is as close as I get to a religious experience .
Anyway .
The Sky magazine is one of those Heat - a - like graphical holocausts where every millimetre of the page is plastered with rowdy colours and exclamation marks that crane their necks to squeal at you .
I say I was " reading " it , but in reality you do n't " read " magazines like that .
There is too much visual noise , so instead you simply " look at " them , having first disengaged your temporal lobe so you do n't feel like you are being stabbed in the mind by an over - zealous Christmas lighting display .
Even though that is precisely what is happening .
And I was dumbly gazing at the bit that tells you which films are coming up on the movie channels , when I noticed that at the bottom of each synopsis sat a group of tiny faces .
Celebrity faces .
Nestling at the end of the paragraph , like part of the typography , as though the editors had done some research and discovered their readers had devolved to the point where their brains can no longer parse text unless it is broken up with miniature photos of their famous imaginary friends grinning back at them .
I slapped myself awake and tried to make sense of what I was seeing .
Slowly it dawned on me : this was a rating system .
I flipped back a few pages , and sure enough , there was the key : a brightly - coloured box full of little celebrity faces , accompanied by a brief description of what they stood for .
" It 's fast , easy , and practical , " lied the subhead .
This is what each face meant :
· Brad Pitt - " Eye Candy "
· Peter Kay - " Laugh Out Loud "
· Michael Jackson - " Thriller "
· Sarah Jessica Parker - " Get the Girls Round "
· Christopher Lee - " Scary "
· Victoria Beckham - " Star Spotting "
· Chico - " Guilty Pleasure "
· Ant and Dec - " Family Fun "
· Vicky Pollard - " Real - Life Shocker "
Sure , it would insult the intelligence of a cod .
Under this system , Schindler 's List = Vicky Pollard .
But I knew it was worse than that .
I just did n't know why , not yet .
So I looked at it again .
Somewhere in my head , a camel 's back splintered beneath a straw .
And I understood : this is madness .
Genuinely : this is madness .
Concepts replaced by faces .
Grinning faces .
It is not evidence of " dumbing down " .
It is the disjointed thought process of madness .
That this is even vaguely acceptable is the most dizzying madness of all .
I wanted to run into the street , without even pausing to wipe , and hurl myself , boggle - eyed , at passers - by , flapping the magazine around , screaming : " HELP !
WE'VE LOST OUR MINDS !
I HAVE PROOF ! I HAVE PROOF . "
But I did n't .
I stayed put ; pooing and afraid .
And I thought :
Our leaders lie , and we know they have lied , and there is war in our name , and the world kicks and boils itself to death and we do nothing but stare into the tiny grinning faces of people we do n't even know ; faces that are , apparently , more " fast , easy and practical " than language itself .
I give us six years , tops .

Celebrity
( Requested by reader Louise Allen )
A celebrity is a fellow human being who is better than you because lots of people know who they are .
Everyone loves celebrities .
Even people who claim to despise celebrities would , if they were honest , prefer to share a drizzly afternoon picnic with Kate Thornton than spend one more second in your revolting non-celebrity company .
If George Clooney called a globally televised press conference , then plucked out two of his eyelashes and announced he would donate them free of charge to the first viewer to turn round and murder their entire family , thousands would perish .
Read that again .
It is a fact .
Celebrities themselves are rarely evil .
Several have talent worth celebrating .
Curiously , this is rarely discussed in media coverage , which instead concentrates on how fat their thighs are in order to make regular people , driven to the brink of despair by their adulation of celebrities , feel momentarily better about themselves , and sufficiently robust to stave off suicide long enough to digest further celebrity coverage .
Any member of the public who voluntarily pays to read magazines stuffed with candid photographs of celebrities walking down the street clutching shopping bags is suffering from an acute form of mental illness that has n't been diagnosed yet , but surely will if there is an atom of hope left in the world , because a civilian flipping through Heat in their lunch break is the human equivalent of a cow being stunned by a captive bolt pistol prior to slaughter - except the cow , at least , dies for a purpose .

It is now a 136 page document that builds down into 1458 bytes .
Many little things have been added , and the task switching code has been formulated , although it might not work ....
I have n't written exec or kill yet . ;)
<< Tue Aug 5 2003 - 16:28:07 EDT >>
As of last night ,
The following functions are also completed : putstr - Draw text to anywhere on the screen

The demo build is now up to 1406 bytes , but that includes quite a bit of test code and stubs .
Up next to write : Task switcher
Task Exec core
Task Kill core
puthex - draw a hex ( base - 16 ) value on the screen
putbcd - draw a decimal integer ( bcd ) value on the screen
putint - draw a decimal integer ( base - 10 ) value on the screen Oh , and apparantly , Alpaca was mentioned on July 28 on the weblog at / dev/null .
Cool !
<< Fri Aug 1 2003 - 11:41:42 EDT >>
The demo build is now 1162 bytes .
This includes the following utility functions : memset - set a chunk of ram to a certain value
clear screen - clears the screen
sine - sine of a value ( using a lookup table )
cosine - cosine of a value ( using sine )
rand - very pserdorandom number generator
xy2offs - convert XY to video / color ram offset ( using a lookup table )
sleep - timer - based wait mechanism ( seperate from the task switcher )
But it does not include yet : working semaphores
task switching

a proper ' sleep ' I also was vaguely looking in to porting to Bally - Midway MCR / 1,2,3 hardware .
This would enable the OS to run on Tron , Satan 's Hollow , Spy Hunter , Tapper , Two Tigers , Journey , Discs Of Tron , etc. hardware .
I also have a goal set for myself .
The core kernel ( with utility functions listed above , and perhaps more ) must not exceed 1 k of ROM space .
It currently uses 138 bytes too many , but that also includes test code for tasks .
Just the core stuff right now is 669 bytes .
So I have 335 bytes to implement : task switching
correct " sleep "
puts - draws a text string to the screen
puti - draws an integer value to the screen
puth - draws a hex value to the screen

In the psychology department at Newcastle University , there is a coffee station where people can help themselves , so long as they leave money in the tray — 50 pence ( about $ 1 ) for a coffee and 30 for tea .
It operates on an honor system .
Alas , not everyone is honorable .
“ The woman running the station was a little disappointed at the level of contributions , ” says Gilbert Roberts , a professor in the department .
Psychologists have long been aware of this dismal aspect of human behavior : people are more honest if they know they ’re being observed — so when nobody ’s watching , they feel they can get away with murder , or at least with a free cup of coffee .
This problem gave Roberts and two colleagues an idea for an experiment .
For 10 weeks this spring , they alternately taped two posters over the coffee station .
During one week , it was a picture of flowers ; during the other , it was a pair of staring eyes .
Then they sat back to watch what would happen .
A remarkable pattern emerged .
During the weeks when the eyes poster stared down at the coffee station , coffee and tea drinkers contributed 2.76 times as much money as in the weeks when flowers graced the wall .
Apparently , the mere feeling of being watched — even by eyes that were patently not real — was enough to encourage people to behave honestly .
Roberts says he was stunned : “ We kind of thought there might be a subtle effect .
We were n’t expecting such a large impact . ”
Introducing WSGI : Python 's Secret Web Weapon , Part Two
October 4 , 2006
James Gardner
Web Server Gateway Interface Part II : Making Use of Middleware
In Part I we discussed how the Web Server Gateway Interface ( WSGI ) is helping to unify the Python web - framework world by providing a standard API through which different web applications can operate with different servers .
We also looked at the HTTP protocol and how to write and deploy WSGI applications .
In the second part of this article , we 'll look at how to make use of existing middleware components to add functionality to your WSGI applications .
What is Middleware ?
WSGI middleware is software that behaves like a server to an application , passing an environ dictionary and start_response callable to the application in the same way a server would .
Middleware components also expect the application to return an iterable , such as a list of strings , or to be iterable themselves .
Importantly , middleware also behaves like an application to the server , expecting to receive an environ dictionary and start_response callable itself , and returning an iterable back to the server .
Middleware effectively sits between a server and an application , isolating one from the other , and can therefore do any of the following or a combination thereof :
Provide more functionality by adding a key to the environ dictionary
dictionary Change the status
Intercept an error
Add , remove , or change headers
Change a response
Middleware is therefore extremely powerful and can build a broad range of discrete components that can be used with different WSGI servers and applications .
For example , a middleware component can :
Produce error documents when certain status codes are received ( typically responding to 404 and 500 codes )
and codes )
Email error reports to a developer if a problem occurs
Provide interactive debugging facilities
Forward requests to other parts of the application
Test the API compliance of applications and servers to the WSGI
Authenticate a user
Cache pages
Provide a session store
Gzip the response
Have a look at the middleware and utilities page on the wsgi.org site to get an idea of some of the middleware that already exists .
Paste , one of the packages mentioned , contains many middleware components of its own that are not listed separately on the wsgi.org page , but are worth taking the time to investigate .
Getting Started
As an example , we 'll create an application that uses session middleware to store the value of a variable between requests .
Here is the application that needs session support :
def application ( environ , start_response ) : session = environ [ ' beaker.session ' ] if not session .
has_key ( ' value ' ) : session [ ' value ' ] = 0 session [ ' value ' ] += 1 session.save( ) start_response( '200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / plain ' ) ] ) return [ ' The current value is : % d ' % session [ ' value ' ] ]
The application stores a variable called value in the session store .
On each request , the variable is incremented and a message stating its current value is returned .
For this application to work , the environ dictionary needs to contain the beaker . session key , which is provided by the session middleware from the beaker package .
Here 's how you would wrap the application in beaker 's session middleware :
from beaker .session import SessionMiddleware application = SessionMiddleware ( application , key=' mysession ' , secret=' randomsecret ' , )
The new application object behaves just like a normal WSGI application .
When the combined application and middleware object is called , the SessionMiddleware adds the beaker . session key to the environ dictionary and calls the original application with the modified environ dictionary and start_response ( ) callable .
The application then calls start_response ( ) as normal and returns an iterable to the middleware .
The middleware returns this information to the server so that , from the server 's point of view , the combined middleware and application can be treated in exactly the same way as a normal WSGI application .
You can test the example above by serving the finished application with the following code and visiting http://localhost:8000 on your local machine once the server is running :
def application ( environ , start_response ) : session = environ [ ' beaker.session ' ] if not session .
has_key ( ' value ' ) : session [ ' value ' ] = 0 session [ ' value ' ] += 1 session.save( ) start_response( '200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / plain ' ) ] ) return [ ' The current value is : % d ' % session [ ' value ' ] ] from beaker . session import SessionMiddleware application = SessionMiddleware ( application , key=' mysession ' , secret= ' randomsecret ' , ) from wsgiref import simple_server httpd = simple_server .
WSGIServer ( ( ' ' ,8000 ) , simple_server .
WSGIRequestHandler , ) httpd.set_app(application ) httpd.serve_forever ( )
If you are running a version of Python prior to 2.5 , you will need to download and install the wsgiref package as described in the Part I of this article .
You will also need to download and install the beaker package , which provides SessionMiddleware .
If you test the example above , you may find the count goes from 1 to 3 , missing 2 .
This is because many web browsers try to retrieve a / favicon.ico file the first time a site is visited , and this request also results in value being incremented .
If you have the LiveHTTPHeaders extension for the Firefox web browser installed , you 'll be able to see the request being made when you visit a site not already in the browser 's cache .
Middleware Chains
In the previous example , we saw how adding a single middleware component to an application gave it powerful new functionality .
In fact , you do n't have to stop at one middleware component .
Since a combined middleware and application object is also a valid WSGI application , you can also wrap the combined application and middleware object in another middleware component .
This leads to the idea of middleware chains , where you have a number of pieces of middleware between the server and the application .
Below is an example using some fictional middleware components :
MyEnvironMiddleware ( MyStatusMiddleware ( SessionMiddleware ( application , key=' mysession ' , secret=' randomsecret ' , ) ) , ' Some Configuration Option ' , )
In situations such as the one above where you are using a number of middleware components , it is often more convenient to structure your code like this :
application = SessionMiddleware ( application , key=' mysession ' , secret=' randomsecret ' , ) application = MyStatusMiddleware( application ) application = MyEnvironMiddleware ( application , ' Some Configuration Option ' )
In a similar way , it 's possible to create an entire web - framework stack just out of individual WSGI middleware components ; indeed , the popular Pylons web framework , used to build production sites worldwide , already takes this approach .
Having a stack made entirely from WSGI middleware has a huge advantage : developers are free to pick and choose the components they need , or even to replace the parts of the stack they do n't like by simply changing which middleware they use .
If you 've ever tried changing parts of the application stack in other framework architectures , you understand how hard it can sometimes be .
Error Handling
During development of an application , it 's really useful to be able to debug errors .
The first step is to display an error report .
To do this , you can use the CgitbMiddleware middleware from the Paste project :
from paste.cgitb_catcher import CgitbMiddleware application = CgitbMiddleware ( application , {' debug ' : True} )
Now if an exception is raised in your application code , a full error report -- similar to one shown below - - will be displayed .
Figure 1 . CgitbMiddleware middleware in action
For production deployment , you 'd want to disable this facility to prevent a visitor from accidentally being shown the values of important variables , such as passwords that might otherwise be displayed if an error occurred .
While it is undoubtedly useful to have a traceback report , it would be even more useful to be able to interactively debug each part of the call stack up to the point at which the error occurred by using a web - based command prompt .
Such a solution already exists and can be added in exactly the same way :
from paste.evalexception import EvalException application = EvalException ( application )
The EvalException middleware will not work in a multiprocess environment , such as a WSGI application deployed as a CGI script , because the middleware must be able to store information about the error in memory .
This is not possible if the whole application is restarted on each request .
If you want to test the EvalException middleware , you could use this code :
def application ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( '200 OK ' , [ ( ' Content - type ' , 'text / plain ' ) ] ) response = [ ] variable1 =
' All local variables will be displayed ' response .
append ( ' Everything is going fine ...
') raise Exception ( ' Something went wrong ! ' ) response.append
( " We wo n't get to here ! " ) return response from paste.evalexception import EvalException application = EvalException ( application ) from wsgiref import simple_server httpd = simple_server .
WSGIServer ( ( ' ' ,8000 ) , simple_server .
WSGIRequestHandler , ) httpd.set_app(application ) httpd.serve_forever ( )
If you run the example above and visit http://localhost:8000 , you will see the error report .
Clicking on the icon will give you the interactive debug prompt , and clicking on will give you a representation of the code at the point that the error occurred .
Try entering this at the prompt and press enter :
print " Hello World ! "
You will see the Hello World !
printed exactly as if it were entered at a normal Python prompt because the middleware acts like a full Python interpreter .
You can even use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to scroll through the command history , just as you can at a real Python prompt .
The EvalException middleware also displays the values of local variables and has an extra data button that displays extra information about the environment .
The screenshot below shows the middleware in action with the interactive prompt and local variables , including variable1 , displayed :
Figure 2 . EvalException middleware in action
Having this much power makes it much easier to debug applications , but makes it even more important that you disable debugging for production use so that malicious visitors can't execute destructive commands through your debug screen if an error occurred .
Once again , this example shows just how much useful functionality can be added to an application using a single middleware component .
Configuration
When the Web Server Gateway Interface was being drawn up , there were a number of discussions about how best to deploy a finished application with middleware .
Clearly developers could n't expect non-technical users to directly modify the middleware chains themselves .
The most widely adopted solution is to use PasteDeploy .
Users configure a config file in a familiar INI - style format , and the desired application -- with any necessary middleware -- is created by PasteDeploy from that file .
PasteDeploy is used like this :
from paste.deploy import loadapp application = loadapp ( ' config:/path/to/config.ini')
The configuration file can be used to specify server settings , including middleware , and even combine multiple WSGI applications together into a composite application .
All the options are well documented on the PasteDeploy site .
The Many Frameworks Problem Revisited
At the start of Part I of this article , we looked at how the WSGI was created to help solve the fragmentation of the Python web community .
The WSGI specification also had wider ambitions .
PEP 333 states :
" If middleware can be both simple and robust , and WSGI is widely available in servers and frameworks , it allows for the possibility of an entirely new kind of Python web application framework : one consisting of loosely coupled WSGI middleware components .
Indeed , existing framework authors may even choose to refactor their frameworks ' existing services to be provided in this way , becoming more like libraries used with WSGI , and less like monolithic frameworks .
This would then allow application developers to choose " best - of - breed " components for specific functionality , rather than having to commit to all the pros and cons of a single framework . "
With today 's powerful middleware , this vision is fast becoming a reality .
Emerging projects such as Clever Harold provide just such a framework of loosely - coupled middleware components .
Projects such as Pylons go further still , providing a ready - made configuration of WSGI middleware .
We have also seen existing projects like Myghty refactored to work better with WSGI configurations .
The WSGI has shifted the point of reuse from the framework itself to individual middleware components .
While developers can still create their own solutions to web development problems , as long as they 're creating , using , and improving middleware components , the whole Python community now benefits .
I hope this article has demonstrated some of the power of WSGI middleware and will encourage you to make use of the specification and the various projects that already implement it .
Here are some useful places to start if you wish to learn more about WSGI programming .
This website is about clinical depression , also referred to as major depression or major depressive disorder .
Here we address not the “ down ” mood which we all get from time to time and which leads us to say , “ I ’m depressed , ” but the often debilitating illness which affects one in five …
Fox Island , Wash .
IN his 1997 book “ Dereliction of Duty , ” Col. H. R. McMaster wrote that “ the ‘ five silent men ’ on the Joint Chiefs made possible the way the United States went to war in Vietnam . ”
So it is today with the war in Iraq .
Regrettably , the silence of our top officers has had a huge impact not just on the battlefield but also on how we have brought our injured warriors home from it .
These planning failures led to the situation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center recently reported by The Washington Post , which resulted in the firings of the hospital ’s commander and the secretary of the Army .
The sad truth is that The Post ’s reports were n’t entirely new : Mark Benjamin , of United Press International and the Web magazine Salon , and Steve Robinson , the director of veterans affairs at Veterans for America , have been reporting on the disgraceful treatment of our war wounded since 2003 .
More important , the Walter Reed scandal is simply the tip of the iceberg : President Bush , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Congress all pointedly failed to provide the money and resources for our returned troops wherever they are , both the obviously wounded and those who may seem healthy but are suffering mentally and physically from their service .
Soldiers have long joked : “ If you are really sick or injured , Army medical care is O.K .
But if you are hurting only a little , especially if it is n’t visible , you ’re in big trouble . ”
The American soldier still receives the best trauma care in the world , especially at Walter Reed .
The problem there has been with deplorable outpatient care management .
The military health system is seriously undermanned and underfinanced for the number of casualties coming home .
Also , there has been little preparation for identifying and treating post - traumatic stress injuries .
Last year , because of spending in Iraq , the Army had a $ 530 million shortfall in its budget for posts at home and abroad .
This forced the Army ’s vice chief of staff , Richard Cody , to tighten belts that were already at the last notch .

Java API Design Guidelines

Summary
There are tons of books and articles about how to design and write good Java code , but surprisingly little about the specific topic of API design .
Here 's a summary of what I 've learnt on the subject from various sources and my own experience .

I recently attended an excellent talk at JavaPolis , Elliotte Rusty Harold 's XOM Design Principles .
Although the talk is nominally about XOM ( an API for XML documentation manipulation ) , in fact more than half of it is about API design principles in general .
This is a curiously neglected subject .
There are tons of books and articles about how to design and write good Java code , but surprisingly little about the specific topic of API design .
Yet with the proliferation of new Java APIs , whether through JSRs or through Open Source projects , this is an increasingly important subject .
I 've been closely involved with the evolution of the JMX API for over five years and have learnt a great deal about what works and what does n't during that time .
During the talk , I had the odd experience of continually wanting to cheer as Elliotte made point after point that I hugely agreed with .
I 'm going to try to summarize here what I see as being the key points from this talk , from my own experience , and from a couple of other sources :
[ Update : Although I was unaware of it when writing this blog entry , the slides referenced by Josh Bloch in a comment here cover some of the same ground and add much of interest . ]
Design to evolve
If your API is worth anything , it will evolve over time .
You should plan for this from the outset .
A key part of the planning is to decide what sort of compatibility you will guarantee between revisions .
The best approach is to say that once something is in the API it will stay there and it will continue to work .
Tweaking the API incompatibly between revisions will result in user reactions ranging from annoyance to murderous rage .
The problem is particularly severe if your API ends up being used by different modules that are part of the same application .
If Module 1 uses Commons Banana 1.0 and Module 2 uses Commons Banana 2.0 then life will be a whole lot easier if 2.0 is completely compatible with 1.0 .
Otherwise your users risk wasting huge amounts of time tweaking classpaths in a futile endeavour to make things work .
They might end up having to play mind - destroying games with class - loaders , which is a clear signal that you have failed .
For APIs that are part of Java SE , we have an extreme form of compatibility .
The aim is that no code whatsoever should break when you update from one version to the next .
This means that classes and methods are never removed .
It also means that we try to avoid changes that might break code that was depending on certain implementation details , even if the code should n't have been doing that .
The no -code - breakage rule applies to already - compiled code ( binary compatibility ) .
In some rare circumstances we might make changes that mean some existing code no longer compiles ( source compatibility ) .
For example , adding an overloaded method or constructor can sometimes produce ambiguity errors from the compiler when a parameter is null .
We do try to find a way to avoid changes that break source compatibility in this way , but sometimes the best approach does imply that some source code might stop compiling .
As an example , in Java SE 6 the constructors for javax .
management .
StandardMBean have been generified .
Some existing source code might conceivably stop compiling because it does not respect the constraints that are expressed using generics here , but that code is easily fixed by adding a cast , and the rare cases where that happens are outweighed by cases where the constraints will catch programming errors at compile time .
In general , you can't know what users of your API will do with it .
When contemplating a change that might break existing code , you have to reason conservatively .
Only if you can honestly say that it is next to impossible that a change will break code can you reasonably make it .
You should certainly rule out completely a signature change , which basically means removing or renaming a visible method or class or changing the parameters of a visible method .
( But you can remove a method if it overrides a method in a parent class without changing the parent method 's semantics . )
Since the very earliest versions of your API are sure to have many mistakes in them , and you do n't want to freeze those mistakes for all time , it 's a good idea to bring out one or more 0.x versions before the 1.0 version .
Users of these versions know that the API is unstable and wo n't curse you if it changes .
Once you 've brought out 1.0 you 're committing to compatibility .
For APIs that are developed through the JCP , these 0.x versions correspond to the phases before the final release ( Early Draft Review , Public Review , Proposed Final Draft ) .
If possible , it 's a good idea to make an implementation of the API available at the same time as these intermediate specifications .
If at some stage you decide that there 's really too much accumulated cruft from previous versions and you want to start over , then create a new API with different package names .
Then code that uses the old version and code that uses the new version can co-exist easily .
API design goals
What should the design goals of your API be ?
Apart from compatibility , the following goals from Elliotte 's presentation seem like an excellent set :
It must be absolutely correct .
In the case of XOM , this meant that the API could never produce malformed XML documents no matter what the caller did .
For the JMX API , for example , it means that you can never get the MBean Server into an inconsistent state by registering strange MBeans in it or using funny ObjectNames or performing several operations concurrently .

It must be easy to use .
This is hard to quantify .
A good way to get an idea is to write lots of example code .
Are there groups of operations that you keep having to repeat ?
Do you have to keep looking up your own API because you forget what things are called ?
Are there cases where the API does n't do what you might expect ?

It must be easy to learn .
This overlaps considerably with ease of use .
But there are some obvious principles to make learning easier .
The smaller the API , the less there is to learn .
Documentation should include examples .
Where appropriate , the API should look like familiar APIs .

Documentation should include examples .
Where appropriate , the API should look like familiar APIs .
It must be fast enough .
Elliotte was careful to put this in the list after the above items .
Make sure the API is simple and correct .
Then think about performance .
You might be inclined to make API changes because the original API could only be implemented in an inefficient way .
By all means change it to allow a more efficient implementation , provided you do n't compromise correctness or simplicity .
Do n't rely on your intuition to know what performs well .
Measure .
Then tweak the API if you 've determined that it really matters .

It must be small enough .
This covers the size of the compiled code and especially the amount of memory it needs as it runs .
The same principles as for speed apply .
Make it simple and correct first ; measure ; and only then think about tweaking the API .
Be minimalist
Because of the compatibility requirement , it 's much easier to put things in than to take them out .
So do n't add anything to the API that you 're not sure you need .
There 's an approach to API design which you see depressingly often .
Think of everything a user could possibly want to do with the API and add a method for it .
Toss in protected methods so users can subclass to tweak every aspect of your implementation .
Why is this bad ?
The more stuff there is in the API , the harder it is to learn .
Which classes and methods are the important ones ?
Which of the five different ways to do what I need is the best ?
The situation is exacerbated by the Javadoc tool , which dumps all the classes in a package , and all the methods in a class , in an undifferentiated lump .
We can expect that JSR 260 will update the Javadoc tool to allow you to produce " views " of the API , and in that case fatter APIs will not be so overwhelming .
The bigger the API , the more things can go wrong .
The implementation is n't going to be perfect , but the same investment in coding and testing will yield better results for a smaller API .
If your API has more methods than it needs , then it 's taking up more space than it needs .
The right approach is to base the API on example code .
Think of problems a user might want to solve with the API .
Add just enough classes and methods to solve those problems .
Code the solutions .
Remove anything from the API that your examples do n't need .
This allows you to check that the API is useful .
As a happy side - effect , it gives you some basic tests .
And you can ( and should ) share the examples with your users .
Interfaces are overvalued
There 's a certain style of API design that 's very popular in the Java world , where everything is expressed in terms of Java interfaces ( as opposed to classes ) .
Interfaces have their place , but it is basically never a good idea for an entire API to be expressed in terms of them .
A type should only be an interface if you have a good reason for it to be .
Here 's why :
Interfaces can be implemented by anybody .
Suppose String were an interface .
Then you could never be sure that a String you got from somewhere obeyed the semantics you expect : it is immutable ; its hashCode ( ) is computed in a certain way ; its length is never negative ; and so on .
Code that used String , whether user code or code from the rest of the J2SE platform , would have to go to enormous lengths to ensure it was robust in the face of String implementations that were accidentally incorrect .
And to even further lengths to ensure that its security could not be compromised by deliberately evil String implementations .
In practice , implementations of APIs that are defined entirely in terms of interfaces often end up cheating and casting objects to the non-public implementation class .
DOM typically does this for example .
So you can't give your own implementation of the DocumentType interface as a parameter to DOMImplementation .
createDocument and expect it to work .
Then what 's the point in having interfaces ?
Interfaces cannot have constructors or static methods .
If you need an instance of an interface , you either have to implement it yourself , or you have to ask some other object for it .
If Integer were an interface , then to get the Integer for a given int you could no longer use the obvious new Integer ( n ) ( or , less obvious but still documented inside Integer , Integer.valueOf( n ) ) .
You would have to use IntegerFactory .
newInteger(n ) or whatever .
This makes your API harder to understand and use .
Interfaces cannot evolve .
Suppose you add a new method to an interface in version 2 of your API .
Then user code that implemented the interface in version 1 will no longer compile because it does n't implement the new method .
You can still preserve binary compatibility by catching AbstractMethodError around calls to the new method but that is clunky .
If you use an abstract class instead of an interface you do n't have this problem .
If you tell users not to implement the interface then you do n't have this problem either , but then why is it an interface ?
Interfaces cannot be serialized .
Java serialization has its problems , but you can't always get away from it .
The JMX API relies heavily on serialization , for example .
For better or worse , the way serialization works is that the name of the actual implementation class is serialized , and an instance of that exact same class is reconstructed at deserialization .
If the implementation class is not a public class in your API , then you wo n't interoperate with other implementations of your API , and it will be very hard for you to ensure that you even interoperate between different versions of your own implementation .
If the implementation class is a public class in your API , then do you really need the interface as well ?
Of course , there are sometimes good reasons for a type to be interface .
Here are some common ones :
Callbacks .
If the interface is intended to be implemented by user code , then it is often more appropriate than an abstract class .
See Runnable for example .
This is mostly true of interfaces with just one method .
Once there start being several methods you often find that an implementation class only needs to do something in one of them , and it 's annoying to have to implement all the others .
Furthermore if an interface has three methods today then you might want it to have four tomorrow , which is not usually possible as we saw .
An abstract class can avoid these problems .
Multiple inheritance .
It is occasionally useful to be able to implement an interface deep in the inheritance hierarchy .
A good example is Comparable , where for example Integer is Comparable but its parent class Number is not .
However , there are n't many other good examples of this in the core Java classes .
It is usually bad practice to implement some random interface in a class whose primary purpose is something else .
Implementing the interface in a private inner class is usually cleaner , and then of course it could just as well be an abstract class .
Dynamic proxies .
The invaluable java.lang .reflect .
Proxy class allows you to make an implementation of any interface at runtime , where calling any of the interface 's methods results in a call to a single invoke method .
There 's no way to construct a dynamic proxy for an abstract class , so if you think it will be useful for users to make dynamic proxies that is one reason to favour an interface .
( cglib can sometimes be used to achieve the same effect for abstract classes , but with several limitations , plus the documentation is really poor . )
Be careful with packages
The Java language has fairly limited ways of controlling the visibility of classes and methods .
In particular , if a class or method is visible outside its package , then it is visible to all code in all packages .
This means that if you define your API in several packages , you have to be careful to avoid being forced to make things public just so that code in other packages in the API can access them .
The simplest solution to avoid this is to put your whole API in one package .
For an API with fewer than about 30 public classes this is usually the best approach .
If your API is too big for a single package to be appropriate , then you should plan to have private implementation packages .
That is , some packages in your implementation are excluded from the Javadoc output and are not part of the public API , even though their contents are accessible .
If you look at the JDK , for example , there are many sun . * and com.sun .* packages of this sort .
Users who rely on the Javadoc output will not know of their existence .
Users who browse the source code can see them , and can access the public classes and methods , but they are discouraged from doing so and warned that there is no guarantee that these classes will remain unchanged across revisions .
A good convention for private packages is to put internal in the name .
So the Banana API might have public packages com.example.banana and com.example.banana.peel plus private packages com.example.banana.internal and com.example.banana.internal.peel .
Do n't forget that the private packages are accessible .
There may be security implications if arbitrary code can access these internals .
Various techniques exist to address these .
The NetBeans API tutorial describes one .
In the JMX API , we use another .
There is a class javax .
management .JMX which contains only static methods and has no public constructor .
This means that user code can never have an instance of this class .
So in the private com.sun.jmx packages , we sometimes add a parameter of type JMX to sensitive public methods .
If a caller can supply a non -null instance of this class , it must be coming from the javax .
management package .
Other random tips
Here are some other random tips based on our experience with the JMX API and on the sources I mentioned .
Immutable classes are good .
If a class can be immutable , then it should be .
Rather than spelling out the reasons , I 'll refer you to Item 13 in Effective Java .
You would n't think of designing an API without having this book , right ?
The only visible fields should be static and final .
Again this one is pretty banal and I mention it only because certain early APIs in the core platform violated it .
Not an example to follow .
Avoid eccentricity .
There are many well - established conventions for Java code , with regard to identifier case , getters and setters , standard exception classes , and so on .
Even if you think these conventions could have been better , do n't replace them in your API .
By doing so you force users to throw away what they already know and learn a new way of doing an old thing .
For instance , do n't follow the bad example of java.nio and java.lang .
ProcessBuilder where the time - honoured T getThing ( ) and void setThing ( T ) methods are replaced by T thing ( ) and ThisClass thing ( T ) .
Some people think this is neato - keen and others that it is an abomination , but either way it 's not a well - known idiom so do n't force your users to learn it .
Do n't implement Cloneable .
It is usually less useful than you might think to create a copy of an object .
If you do need this functionality , rather than having a clone ( ) method it 's generally a better idea to define a " copy constructor " or static factory method .
So for example class Banana might have a constructor or factory method like this :
public Banana ( Banana b) { // copy constructor this ( b.colour , b.length ) ; } // ...or... public static Banana newInstance ( Banana b) { return new Banana ( b.colour , b.length ) ; }
The advantage of the constructor is that it can be called from a subclass 's constructor .
The advantage of the static method is that it can return an instance of a subclass or an already - existent instance .
Item 10 of Effective Java covers clone ( ) in excruciating detail .
Exceptions should usually be unchecked .
Item 41 of Effective Java gives an excellent summary here .
Use a checked exception " if the exceptional condition cannot be prevented by proper use of the API and the programmer using the API can take some useful action once confronted with the exception . "
In practice this usually means that a checked exception reflects a problem in interaction with the outside world , such as the network , filesystem , or windowing system .
If the exception signals that parameters are incorrect or than an object is in the wrong state for the operation you 're trying to do , then an unchecked exception ( subclass of RuntimeException ) is appropriate .
Design for inheritance or do n't allow it .
Item 15 of Effective Java tells you all you might want to know about this .
The summary is that every method should be final by default ( perhaps by virtue of being in a final class ) .
Only if you can clearly document what happens if you override the method should it be possible to do so .
And you should only do that if you have coded useful examples that do override the method .
Summary
Design to evolve .
Correctness , then simplicity , then efficiency .
Interfaces are overvalued .
Be careful with packages .
Read Effective Java .

Companies now advertise UK - only call centre policies
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
" Hello , it 's my car . " '' Your cat , sir ? . "
" No , my hatchback . "
" Your bad back , sir ? "
" No my car , it 's a hatchback . "
" Your cat has a bad back , sir ? " " Arghhhhhh ! "
Dealing with call centres has always been one of the great irritations of trying to contact your bank , insurer - almost any service provider .
But since many have relocated abroad , it ranks right up there with the weather and house prices as one of the most popular collective national moans .
Just 4 % of people have had a good experience when dealing with a call centre , according to a recent survey by YouGov .
Over half of those asked said their biggest gripe was having to contact call centres outside the UK and more than a third admitted to shouting and swearing at agents because they got so frustrated .
A lot of people did view the overseas call centres as taking British jobs and did n't like it
Claudia Hathway , Call Centre Focus
In recent months a number of big British firms have announced they are bringing call centres back to the UK , including Powergen .
Esure announced it was doing the same this week , with boss Peter Wood reportedly suggesting the trend for outsourcing is doomed .
So why are call centres coming home ?
Short - sighted planning is behind the U - turn , says Claudia Hathway , editor of Call Centre Focus ( CCF ) magazine .
Poor expectations
" Many companies just did n't think the move through , " she says .
" It was all driven by cost , not the customer .
But what 's the point of saving money when a poor phone call is the first - hand experience of the quality of service .
If it is a bad experience , people are not going to buy . "
Some also did n't realise the cost of updating the telephone infrastructure in countries like India and relocating managers from the UK to oversee the operation .
But is there something a bit more unsavoury playing a part in customer dissatisfaction ?
IN THE UK
There are 5,700 + call centres Employing 581,000 people
This is expected to rise to 647,000 in 2007
A call centre manager earns about £ 26,000 Starting salaries are about £ 11,000 SOURCE : CCA
" Some people definitely had a certain mindset and decided the call was going to be bad before they 'd even dialled the number , " says Adrian Web from Esure , which says it took the original decision to outsource because it could not recruit enough staff in the UK - not because of money .
" When we listened back to calls people had complained about often they were fine .
Some people wanted the member of staff to fail because they were in India .
I do n't know why that should be , but when customers start voting with their feet you have to respond .
You can not fight against what the customer wants . "
People 's complaints might have initially been fuelled by a bit of xenophobia , but it is now about the service they are receiving , says Ms Hathway .
" Initially a lot of people did view the overseas call centres as taking British jobs and did n't like it , but the fact they often do not get a good service is the issue now . "
False economy
Some companies have stuck to a UK - only policy from the start , like over - 50s holiday and insurance company Saga .
It says it could save 65 p on the cost of an average call if it outsourced , but its customers want to speak to someone who can easily understand them .
" The oldest person who has insurance with us is 103 , they do n't want to struggle to be understood on the telephone , " says Saga 's Paul Green .
" Taking call centres out of the UK might look like a good option if you are a short - sighted accountant with your nose stuck up against a spreadsheet .
We have always taken the broader view - we could save money but at the expense of service . "
Men make up 44 % of call centre staff
" A brand 's success is about the relationship between the consumer and the company , " says branding expert Jonathan Gabay .
" Anything that takes it apart , like a third party , makes that relationship less intimate .
People ring a call centre and want to talk to someone who they can relate to , who they feel understands their problems . "
But having call centres in the UK is no guarantee of customer satisfaction , and it's risky using the fact to differentiate yourself from competitors , like Natwest is doing .
" If people still can't get through it does n't matter if the person they are hanging on for is in the UK or India , " says Mr Gabay .
" It 's not where you are but what you know that matters . "
Perks of job
But it has n't all been a disaster .
While call centres abroad may have made you want to tear your hair out , the situation has driven a long - overdue debate about the industry , says CCA chief executive , Anne Marie Forsyth .

" There has been criticism that managers did n't understand how call centres work , they thought it was all about answering as many calls as possible .
They did n't understand agents were the frontline of contact for their companies and the focus should be on quality . "
Not all companies think the move was a mistake , things have just needed fine tuning .
Norwich Union recently hit the headlines for reportedly doing a U - turn on foreign call centres , but says it has not shut its operation in India .
" We have just moved certain calls back to the UK , like household claims , " says a spokeswoman .
" Feedback showed us these calls were better handled by staff in this country as customers making a claim were often anxious . "
Foreign staff taught how to chat with Brits
The overseas adventure has also benefited some call centre staff in the UK .
As centres were first being shifted abroad , much was made of the " battery farm " atmosphere at some British call centres .
Aware that happy workers tend to provide better service , the likes of Kwik Fit Insurance Services sought to improve conditions , and its workers now have a on - site hairdresser , trained masseur , beauty therapist , as well as yoga classes , a spacious garden , coffee shop and a chill - out room .
They even have of a " minister of fun " .
Has it worked ?
Yes - the centre ranked number 15 on the Sunday Times ' list of the best employers in 2005 .
Productivity has increased and customer satisfaction has reaching 98 % .
Everyone 's a winner .
Watch out for a report from a call centre in India next month as part of BBC business writer Steve Schifferes ' globalisation series .
Here is a selection of your comments .
I have just gone through the yearly rigmarole of renewing my car insurance .
My previous provider 's call centre operatives were obviously based abroad or had never dealt with someone with a liverpool accent as I had to repeat myself several times .
My new provider is Kwik fit and I spent 10 minutes chatting away to a glaswegian ( I think ) he was definitely Scottish and about 50 % of the call was chatting about everything apart from car insurance .
Quick and painless except for handing over my bank details .
I am not surprised they have 98 % customer satisfaction judging by how I was dealt with .
Michael , Hampshire
This is another prime example of English racism .
Most foreigners speak a better standard of English than we do !
Josephine Boyd , Bermondsey , London , UK
I recently posted an envelope , containing my paying - in book and a cheque , through my local bank 's letter box .
When the account was not credited I rang my bank to find out why .
All I wanted was for someone to quickly check that my envelope had not become stuck in the mail box .
( It had , but that is a another story ) .
I was connected to a call centre in India but getting them to understand was a problem in itself .
All they could do was email the UK and ask a member of staff at my local branch to give me a ring - which was not until the next day .
I was not impressed .
Alan Williams , Liverpool United Kingdom
My experience of foreign call centres has been very positive .
Admiral insurance , who 've had a base in india for years , are consistently rapid to answer your call and provide excellent service .
Alliance & Leicester , who pride themselves on answering their phones from Liverpool or Lytham or wherever , always take 5 minutes to answer and , when they do pick up the phone , put you straight on hold then give you some horrific attitudinal back - chat .
Give me a well - educated , articulate , intellegent person in Mumbai over an intellectually sub-normal whining dullard in the uk any day , please .
People who have a problem with different accents are narrow minded xenophobes .
Craig Kellock , Falkirk , UK
Shame - we 've had a good laugh with some of our experiences on the phone to overseas call centres
Maggie , South London
I have given up calling any call centre .
I now write an old fashioned letter I find the whole process much less stresful .
No automated button pushing , no need to proove who I am prior to even begining to explain the reason for my call and no need to listen to endless hold music .
It may take a couple of days but most things can probably wait that long .
Richard , Redditch
Call centres abroad is an absolute disaster .
I have had nothing but bad experiences and now vow to only use companies with UK call centres .
Make your opinion count - if you do n't like your bank call centre abroad , change banks .
Stevie , Bury
I really could n't care if the operator is British , Asian , or even Martian .
I just want 2 things - 1 : Clarity of voice / accent , 2 : Britsh customers ( me and you ) funding jobs in Britain .
And part 2 is important because we can only spend our money with these companies if they give us the opportunity to earn it !!
Imagine if every job was outsourced !
Their profit margin would be great , but there would be no customers to buy their products .
Paul D , Norwich
I needed to instruct my bank on where to send my new cheque card .
I telephoned and got through to an operator in India .
She then tried to get through to my bank in Bristol but could n't !
After being kept on hold whilst she kept trying to get through , I gave up with the phone and sent a fax !
Yet strangely enough , my account manager can always get hold of me on the phone so why is it not a two - way thing ?
Jean , Bristol
The overseas call centre of my bank fails because the staff ( who are pleasant and helpful ) appear not to have the information I as a customer need .
Since branch staff are n't able to deal anymore ( it would seem ) with routine enquiries , most queries now are dealt with by call centre .
If they can't help , what do you do ?
It 's a huge failing on the part of the bank .
OK they might be driven by profit as any good business should be but it should never be done at the expense of the customer .
My bank has become so greedy and blinkered that it cannot see the false economy it is creating .
Whoever trained or fail to train their overseas workers should be made to listen to the dribble of " music " the rest of us have to hear while we die a slow death on hold .
Joss Bruce , London
The thing I hate most about call centres is not where they are based but when the person on the other end of the phone can't help you .
At which point the conversation starts to go round in circles .
They obviously have some kind of script that they go through , and if at any point the conversation deviates from that script they go back to the beginning , as if by starting again something will change , really really frustrating .
This ultimately comes down the centre staff not being trained enough in the product or service to be able to understand the problem or query .
The company obviously thinks that they can covered all possible scenarios with one script .
L , Sheffield
I feel that the worst part of dealing with call - centres is not the fact that the person on the other end is in Mumbai , London , Edinburgh or Swansea but that they are hamstrung by their role .
Bad experiences
I have had with call - centres have stemmed not from the person 's accent or nationality but the fact that they just did not have the authority to step out of a pre-determined script to address my particular problem .
Large companies employ under - trained staff to simply try to plaster over issues rather than trained & experienced problem solvers .
Most of the companies I now deal with on a regular basis are those that employ some variety of account manager who treat me as a person rather than a number on a quota .

Oh , so these companies want to move their operators back to the UK because its what their customers want , not because they are losing money ?
What a pity the very same uber - greedy , 'we know best ' suits did n't listen to their customers in the first place .
I doubt the combined efforts of the entire labour party spin machine could have dreamed up such incredulous porky pies .
I doubt anyone will be any similarly contrite handing back of ' performance ' bonuses though - shareholders duly take note ...!

I am fed up with people always blaming the call centre staff for the problems they face - why do n't they ever blame the poor training , rigid scripts or big brother control the company places on the staff , notwithstanding the decision - inavriably financial - that was made to transfer overseas in the first place ?
I have never worked in a CC , but I understand they are only trying to do their job with the resources and training they have been given .
As for accents , I can find it equally hard to understand strong ( e.g. )
Scots accents as I do Indian .
Also consider that a CC job can be considered a proper career in India , but is treated almost " lowest of the low " here , often with staff attitudes to match .
I do n't care where the person is as long as they can answer my question and be as polite and friendly back to me as I am to them .
But I DO object to being treated as though I am scum and they have only picked up my call as a favour to me , as I have found many times with UK st ! aff .

My Brother died in December 2006 .
On phoning a call centre to advise them of his passing I was told we cant take your word for that !
He will have to call himself !
I was very angry and said to the girl " ARE YOU DEAF - I JUST TOLD YOU HE DIED " She replied " Sorry I was not listening "
It 's bad enough that you have to wait for 10 min's + to talk to these people .

In all the ink , real and virtual , that ’s being spilled over ABC ’s fictionalization of the run-up to the 9/11 attacks , it seems to me that one aspect of ABC / Disney ’s position has been missed : if the public descriptions of the show are accurate , then the people who made it and those who plan to show it have some serious libel exposure .
To recap , just in case you are reading this blog from Pluto , ABC hired a bunch of right - wing hardcases who got the Republican chair of the 9/11 Commission to lend them his good name .
Purporting to dramatize the findings of the 9/11 commission they instead produced the sort of mockumentary that Rush Limbaugh would love , and in fact does love .
The show includes scenes that are flat - out inventions designed to show that the Clinton administration refused clear shots at bin Laden ( in fact , no such event took place ) and was generally to blame for the 9/11 attacks .
Missing from the show are key moments such as Bush ignoring written warnings that al Quaeda was planning to attack .
Equally absent is the famous ‘ My Pet Goat ’ moment .
And so on .
Publicity for the show has been a bit odd : ABC sent pre-release tapes to Limbaugh and to conservative bloggers , but not liberal ones .
It also refused requests by Clinton and others in his administration for an advance look — shocking disrespect for a former President .
The blogs are hard at work on this one .
But nowhere have I seen mention of the libel claim that I think is looming .
Generally in the United States you ca n’t libel a public figure . [*]
Plus , libel claims based on fiction are obviously much harder than claims based on assertions in supposed non-fiction .
But neither of these bars is insurmountable .
And on the facts as reported , they could be surmounted surprisingly easily .
As one New York court put it not so long ago , a claim of “ libel by fiction ” requires that “ the description of the fictional character must be so closely akin to the real person claiming to be defamed that a reader of the book , knowing the real person , would have no difficulty linking the two . ”
The novel Primary Colors did n’t meet that test as it did n’t use real names , nor were the physical description of any character like the plaintiff in that case .
But the 9/11 show differs from Primary Colors in a very basic way :
It uses actors portraying real people with their actual names involved in activities that are a blend of real things they did and of the partisan imagination .
I suspect it would n’t be hard to get a court to see the difference from Primary Colors - like facts .
Furthermore , even if ABC were to run a big disclaimer with the episode , that would n’t necessarily suffice .
It ’s even harder to make out a case of libel when the victim is a public figure .
Basically , to win you have to show that the author of the libelous work demonstrated a “ reckless disregard for the truth . ”
Given the public nature of the warnings that various scenes are false , if in fact they are false then I think this part of the case should be pretty easy .
If I were at ABC or Disney I ’d be having a serious talk with my lawyers right about now .

As noted in the comments , a better way to say this would have been , “ Generally , in the United States , it is very difficult for a public figure to win a libel case . ’
Officials believe White House chose new Intelligence chief in effort to darken Iran Intelligence Estimate , broaden domestic surveillance Larisa Alexandrovna

SWIFT banking spy program
The nomination of retired Vice Admiral John Michael " Mike " McConnell to be Director of National Intelligence is part of an effort by the Vice President to tighten the Administration 's grip on domestic intelligence and grease the wheels for a more aggressive stance towards Iran , current and former intelligence officials believe .
If confirmed , McConnell will replace current National Intelligence Director John Negroponte , who was tapped Friday to become Deputy Secretary of State under Secretary Condoleezza Rice .
According to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity , Negroponte 's exit followed a lengthy internal administration battle between the Office of the Vice President and the two - year - old Office of the Director of National Intelligence .
According to officials close to both men , two issues surround Negroponte 's departure and McConnell 's nomination : a forthcoming National Intelligence Estimate on Iran -- which the White House could use to buttress a case for military force -- and pressure from the Vice President to augment domestic surveillance .
Negroponte had resisted both efforts .
Tensions soared after Negroponte made a public statement last year that countered the administration position that Iran was an immediate threat and that its alleged nuclear weapons program was in an advanced stage .
" The NIE on Iran is at issue , " said one former senior intelligence officer close to Negroponte .
The National Intelligence Estimate is an interagency report that synthesizes information across all intelligence agencies on a particular topic , providing an overall assessment and analysis .
In private conversations with RAW STORY , current and former US intelligence officials from various agencies raised concerns with McConnell 's appointment and its effect on the Iran NIE .
" McConnell will go along with whatever [ Cheney tells him to do ] and make sure that no objective NIE comes out , " one former senior intelligence officer said .
A spokesman for the National Intelligence Director 's Office , however , denied the Estimate would be affected .
" I do n't have any reason to believe that the change with Mr. Negroponte and Admiral McConnell will delay the NIEs on Iran or Iraq at this point , " spokesman Chad Colton said Sunday .
The Iran Estimate is scheduled to be released some time this month .
All of the officials RAW STORY spoke with had reservations about Vice Admiral McConnell .
In a call Friday , President Reagan 's Director of Intelligence Programs for the National Security Council from 1984 - 1987 and Chief of Operations and Analysis at the Central CIA 's Counterterrorism Center under President Bush Sr. Vincent Cannistraro called the nomination " a disaster . "
Others said McConnell would follow the White House 's direction .
" McConnell 's not an effective manager " said former CIA officer Larry Johnson .
" He will be likely to acquiesce to White House pressure on issues . "
" McConnell was not Rummeyesque , " Johnson added .
" He does n't have a clear vision .
He 's not a strong manager . "
The National Intelligence Estimate on Iran Parts of an earlier Iran Intelligence Estimate were leaked to the Washington Post in 2005 .
These excerpts asserted that Iran was at least ten years away from possessing any significant nuclear enrichment capability and contrasted sharply with White House estimates , which had warned Iran could mount a full - scale attack in 3 - 5 years .
" The carefully hedged assessments , which represent consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies , contrast with forceful public statements by the White House , " the Post 's Dafna Linzer reported .
" Administration officials have asserted , but have not offered proof , that Tehran is moving determinedly toward a nuclear arsenal . "
Negroponte defended the published findings , attempting to push back against pressure from the Vice President 's office , and maintained his opposition to military action against Iran .
By March 2006 , however , the Department of Defense -- on orders from the Vice President 's Office -- had created the Iranian Directorate , which was largely a recreation of the notorious Office of Special Plans .
The Office of Special Plans operated in the build - up to the Iraq war and is believed by most experts to have been the conduit through which pre-Iraq war intelligence was allegedly manipulated , if not cooked outright .
In a previous RAW STORY article on the Iranian Directorate , John Pike of Global Security -- a Washington - based intelligence clearinghouse -- said , " It was created to , as Dean Acheson urged Harry Truman , to scare hell out of the American people by making things a little bit clearer than the truth . "
The creation of the Iran Directorate sharply undercut the Director of National Intelligence and what sources say were Negroponte 's efforts to collect the most comprehensive and accurate intelligence on Iran and provide it directly to the President .
The Office was created in 2005 by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to centralize information coming out of all 16 US intelligence agencies , including the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
According to officials , Negroponte , while trying to work around interagency tensions , was not given the requisite authority to override pressure from Cheney 's office .
In October , Negroponte publicly cautioned against the use of force with regard to Iran , telling President Bush that because of " technical errors " in Iran 's nuclear program , the situation was not an emergency .
Domestic Surveillance
The other key area of concern for the intelligence community in McConnell 's nomination is the Executive Branch 's attempt to expand domestic surveillance programs , especially those conducted by the National Security Agency .
Current and former intelligence officials say that Negroponte and his staff were not comfortable with the level of domestic surveillance or the use of NSA wiretaps that were being pushed by the White House .
" [ The office of the Vice President ] could not get Negroponte to do anything with NSA and domestic surveillance , " said one former senior intelligence official .
" McConnell worked with Cheney during the Gulf War . "
" He is not competent , but he is someone they can control , " the official added .
None of the intelligence sources would describe what types of programs were at issue or confirm if these programs were those already known to the public .
But they emphasized that compared to Negroponte , McConnell would be much more willing to accommodate the White House position on domestic surveillance .
McConnell 's background is in surveillance programs , dating to when he served during the Gulf War as Director of the National Military Joint Intelligence Center , followed by a term as Director of the National Security Agency .
After leaving government service in 1996 , McConnell became a vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton , a major defense contractor .
According to his online Booz Allen biography , McConnell led the " firm 's support to the Presidential Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection , focusing on the vulnerabilities of the banking and financial sector . "
McConnell 's unique banking intelligence experience aligns with a major facet of President Bush 's international banking surveillance efforts .
In June 2006 , The New York Times revealed that the CIA had been given authority by the Bush administration to mine the banking records of suspected " Al Qaeda " members using the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) .
" The program is limited , government officials say , to tracing transactions of people suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda by reviewing records from the nerve center of the global banking industry , a Belgian cooperative that routes about $ 6 trillion daily between banks , brokerages , stock exchanges and other institutions , " Eric Licthblau and James Risen reported for The Times .
" The records mostly involve wire transfers and other methods of moving money overseas and into and out of the United States . "
The CIA and Treasury Departments both said they had instituted safeguards for protecting privacy by hiring an " outside auditor " to provide a check against civil rights violations .
The company auditing the SWIFT program is Booz Allen Hamilton .
In September 2006 , Privacy International and the American Civil Liberties Union issued a joint statement describing why Booz Allen Hamilton was not a genuine " check " on the SWIFT program .
" Booz Allen is one of the largest US Government contractors , with hundreds of millions of dollars in US Government contracts awarded each year , " the groups wrote in a statement .
" Booz Allen has a history of working closely with US Government agencies on electronic surveillance , including the Total Information Awareness program .
Among Booz Allen 's senior consulting staff are several former members of the intelligence community , including a former Director of the CIA and a former director of the NSA .
In its private consulting practice , Booz Allen has been at the forefront of the push to increased information sharing , calling for private businesses to provide more information to the US Government . "
In addition to his work for Booz Allen , in 2004 McConnell also joined the board of directors of security firm CompuDyne , which hopes to obtain more federal contracts in the area of " signals intelligence " -- interception and surveillance , in common parlance -- an area which is well known as being McConnell 's specialty .

Note to self :
Tell airlines that HTML based print - at - home boarding passes are a bad idea .
The info below is very innocuous , but if you think about other things that could be done .....
Ok , people I have a plane to catch but I thought you might find this useful .
If you fly Southwest , you know that being a B or C sucks .
If you print your boarding passes , you never have to be in that group again .1 ) Use Firefox ( IE cannot correctly save the web page ) .
2 ) When viewing your boarding pass , click " File " then " Save Page As " .
You want the " Save as Type " to be " Web Page , Complete " .
3 ) Save this graphic :
http://www.southwest.com/images/boardingA.gif somewhere on your hard drive .4 ) Use any HTML editor to change the " B " or " C " graphic on your saved boarding pass to the " A " graphic that you saved .
You now have an A boarding pass .
This works perfectly , and before you ask - no - the A , B , or C is not embedded or associated in any way with the barcode on the side so you 'll be fine .
If you do n't believe me , watch the screen attached to the boarding pass scanner the next time you are boarding on Southwest .
It just turns green and says " Valid Boarding Pass " - nothing about boarding group .
Can you Digg It Ryan
Flickr provides an API for which there are numerous language bindings .
A binding for Lisp was , however , missing , and because I wanted to write an application for automating some tasks in Flickr ( more on that later on ) , I decided some time ago to start by implementing bindings to the Flickr API for Common Lisp , aptly named “ Clickr ” .
Instead of telling you how great my bindings are I think it ’s best if I just demonstrate how they work :
Let ’s get my Flickr user first and see what my name is :
CL - USER > ( defvar * schani * ( user - with - name “ schani ” ) )
* SCHANI *
CL - USER > ( user - realname * schani * )
“ Mark Probst ”
How many favorites do I have ?
CL - USER > ( length ( user - favorites * schani * ) )
1675
Every bit of information that Clickr gets from the API is stored .
If you request it again , Clickr will used that stored information instead of making the same API calls again .
Also , every Flickr object that Clickr knows about corresponds to exactly one Clickr object .
If you get , say , the same photo via two different routes , Clickr will give you the same photo object twice .
Let ’s do some more complicated stuff !
What ’s the number of users whose photos are in my favorites ?
CL - USER > ( defvar * fav-users * ( remove - duplicates ( mapcar #’ photo - owner ( user - favorites * schani * ) ) ) )
*FAV - USERS *
CL - USER > ( length * fav-users * )
805
How many of those have faved at least one of my photos ?
CL - USER > ( length ( remove - if - not #'( lambda ( user )
( find - if #'( lambda ( photo )
( eq ( photo - owner photo ) * schani * ) )
( user - favorites user ) ) )
* fav-users * ) )
183
This last query makes a huge number of API calls , so try it at your own risk !
The second time you do it , though , it ’s lightning fast !
Clickr can even provide you with some information not available through the API :
CL - USER > ( photo - num - views ( first ( user- photos * schani * ) ) )
127
CL - USER > ( photo - num - faves ( first ( user- photos * schani * ) ) )
3
I need that information for my little application , and since the Flickr API still does n’t provide it , Clickr has to fetch the photo page and extract those numbers from the HTML code .
On to my application , which I ’ve called “ Automatr ” !
There are lots of groups on Flickr , like top -f or top -v , whose only posting requirements are that your photo fulfills some simple “ counting ” rule .
In the case of top -f the rule is that you can post any image provided that it has at least 25 faves .
Being very lazy I wanted a tool that did those posting jobs for me automatically , which is why I wrote Automatr .
Right now Automatr can do five things :
Adding and removing tags , adding and removing photos to and from groups and adding photos to sets .
Let ’s look at the simplest job , adding a tag !
Let ’s say that I want to add the tag “ top - f25 ” to all my photos which have at least 25 faves .
Here ’s the Automatr rule for that :
( add-action ‘ add- top-f25-tag
‘( add -tag “ top-f25 ” )
‘( >= ( count faves ) 25 ) )
The first argument is just the name of the rule and can be anything .
The second argument is the action and the third argument is the condition under which the action is to be applied .
Of course Automatr is smart enough not to try to add the tag a second time , so it ’s not necessary to specify that only photos without that same tag be tagged .
Groups are more complicated in that they need to be declared first .
Here ’s the declaration of the top -f group :
( defgroup ‘ top -f
“ 23561440@N00 ”
: max - batch 1 )
The main argument here is the ID of the group .
The easiest way to get to it that I know of is to look it up in the HTML source of the group page .
Yeah , it sucks .
Clickr should be able to do that automatically if you provide it with the group URL , but I was too lazy to implement that .
Anyway , the “ max - batch ” argument specifies how many photos Automatr is allowed to add to that group in one batch .
In this case it ’s one , meaning that even if I had a hundred photos eligible for entry , Automatr would post only one , determined at random .
Here ’s the rule for posting photos to top-f :
( add-action ‘ top -f
‘( add- to - group top - f )
‘( >= ( count faves ) 25 ) )
Pretty straightforward .
Here ’s a more complicated group declaration :
( defgroup ‘ top-v
“ 56022122@N00 ”
: max - batch 1
: max - posted 11 )
The “ max - posted ” argument tells Automatr that at any point in time there can be at most 11 photos posted to that group ( by the user in question ) .
If Automatr wants to post an additional photo to the group , it has to delete one of the 11 first .
The photo to be deleted is , again , chosen at random .
That ’s basically it .
If you want to play around with Clickr and Automatr yourself , just download it and follow the README file in the package .
If you do something with it , I ’d love to hear from you !
One thing blogging and good copywriting share is a conversational style , and that means it ’s fine to fracture the occasional rule of proper grammar in order to communicate effectively .
Both bloggers and copywriters routinely end sentences with prepositions , dangle a modifier in a purely technical sense , or make liberal use of the ellipsis when an EM dash is the correct choice — all in order to write in the way people actually speak .
But there are other mistakes that can detract from your credibility .
While we all hope what we have to say is more important than some silly grammatical error , the truth is some people will not subscribe or link to your blog if you make dumb mistakes when you write , and buying from you will be out of the question .
Here are five mistakes to avoid when blogging and writing web copy .
1. Your vs. You ’re
This one drives me insane , and it ’s become extremely common among bloggers .
All it takes to avoid this error is to take a second and think about what you ’re trying to say .
“ Your ” is a possessive pronoun , as in “ your car ” or “ your blog . ”
“ You ’re ” is a contraction for “ you are , ” as in “ you ’re screwing up your writing by using your when you really mean you are . ”
2 . It ’s vs. Its
This is another common mistake .
It ’s also easily avoided by thinking through what you ’re trying to say .
“ It ’s ” is a contraction of “ it is ” or “ it has . ” “ Its ” is a possessive pronoun , as in “ this blog has lost its mojo . ”
Here ’s an easy rule of thumb — repeat your sentence out loud using “ it is ” instead .
If that sounds goofy , “ its ” is likely the correct choice .
3 . There vs. Their
This one seems to trip up everyone occasionally , often as a pure typo .
Make sure to watch for it when you proofread .
“ There ” is used many ways , including as a reference to a place ( “ let ’s go there ” ) or as a pronoun ( “ there is no hope ” ) .
“ Their ” is a plural possessive pronoun , as in “ their bags ” or “ their opinions . ”
Always do the “ that ’s ours ! ” test — are you talking about more than one person and something that they possess ?
If so , “ their ” will get you there .
4. Affect vs. Effect
To this day I have to pause and mentally sort this one out in order to get it right .
As with any of the other common mistakes people make when writing , it ’s taking that moment to get it right that makes the difference .
“ Affect ” is a verb , as in “ Your ability to communicate clearly will affect your income immensely . ” “ Effect ” is a noun , as in “ The effect of a parent ’s low income on a child ’s future is well documented . ”
By thinking in terms of “ the effect , ” you can usually sort out which is which , because you ca n’t stick a “ the ” in front of a verb .
While some people do use “ effect ” as a verb ( “ a strategy to effect a settlement ” ) , they are usually lawyers , and you should therefore ignore them if you want to write like a human .
5 . The Dangling Participle
The dangling participle may be the most egregious of the most common writing mistakes .
Not only will this error damage the flow of your writing , it can also make it impossible for someone to understand what you ’re trying to say .
Check out these two examples from Tom Sant ’s book Persuasive Business Proposals :
After rotting in the cellar for weeks , my brother brought up some oranges .
Uhh … keep your decomposing brother away from me !
Featuring plug - in circuit boards , we can strongly endorse this server ’s flexibility and growth potential .
Hmmm … robotic copy written by people embedded with circuit boards .
Makes sense .
The problem with both of the above is that the participial phrase that begins the sentence is not intended to modify what follows next in the sentence .
However , readers mentally expect it to work that way , so your opening phrase should always modify what immediately follows .
If it does n’t , you ’ve left the participle dangling , as well as your readers .
P.S. You may find it amusing to know that I , like David Ogilvy , have never learned the formal rules of grammar .
I learned to write by reading obsessively at an early age , but when it came time to learn the “ rules , ” I tuned out .
If you show me an incorrect sentence , I can fix it , but if I need to know the technical reason why it was wrong in the first place , I go ask my wife .
Some 40 years after the release of the classic science fiction movie Fantastic Voyage , researchers in the NanoRobotics Laboratory of École Polytechnique de Montréal ’s Department of Computer Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering have achieved a major technological breakthrough in the field of medical robotics .
They have succeeded for the first time in guiding , in vivo and via computer control , a microdevice inside an artery , at a speed of 10 centimetres a second .
Under the direction of Professor Sylvain Martel , holder of the Canada Research Chair in Micro / Nanosystem Development , the Polytechnique team has succeeded in injecting , propelling and controlling by means of software programs an initial prototype of an untethered device ( a ferromagnetic 1.5- millimetre - diameter sphere ) within the carotid artery of a living animal placed inside a clinical magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) system .
Encouraged by these results , staff at the Polytechnique NanoRobotics Laboratory are currently working to further reduce the size of the devices so that , within a few years , they can navigate inside smaller blood vessels .
“ Injection and control of nanorobots inside the human body , which contains nearly 100,000 kilometres of blood vessels , is a promising avenue that could enable interventional medicine to target sites that so far have remained inaccessible using modern medical instruments such as catheters , ” Professor Martel explained .
“ In collaboration with our scientific partners , Polytechnique researchers have begun developing several types of micro- and nanodevices for novel applications , such as targeted delivery of medications to tumour sites and diagnoses using navigable bio-sensors . ”
The results of this scientific breakthrough were published by Professor Martel and 10 co-authors from École Polytechnique de Montréal and the CHUM on March 14 in the scientific journal Applied Physics Letters .
Patent applications have been submitted for this method of real - time monitoring and guidance of devices for minimally invasive surgeries using MRI .
Commercialization of the technology has been entrusted to Gestion Univalor , LP .

Climbing ' Jacob's Ladder ' -- Couple Crusades to Save Their Son Parents could be closing in on a breakthrough to treat son's rare disorder .
Feb. 27 , 2007  -- Andrew Trossman and Marcy
White were watching a few little mice very intently .
" We are counting on them , and Jacob is counting on them , " Trossman said .
Jacob is the Toronto couple 's 4 - year - old son , and since birth he lived with strange symptoms that no one seemed able to identify .
Instead of crying , he shrieked like a donkey , and his eyes would twitch uncontrollably .
It was only through an extraordinary coincidence that Trossman and White were set on the path to discovering that their son suffered from a rare genetic brain disorder , and that he had , at most , 20 years left to live .
What followed is straight out of the film " Lorenzo's Oil . "
Trossman and White were not experts in biomedical engineering , but the doctors they consulted seemed to have given up , so they set out themselves to find a treatment for whatever it was that ailed their son .
And just this month , promising results from those very important mice led them to believe they might have had a breakthrough .
The Child Who Could Not Cry
From the first days after Jacob 's birth , it was clear he would not have an ordinary life .
" The only thing that really , really still stands in my mind is just hearing somebody say , ' I 've never seen this before , ' " White recalled .
" There is this little baby … with tubes [ in ] him , in the first , what is it , half hour of his life . "
Jacob never cried like a normal baby cries .
Not once , because he could n't .
His sound was something else .
" They call it a strider , but it kind of sounds like a donkey , " Trossman said .
" A very striking sound . "
Both of Jacob 's vocal cords were paralyzed .
He was in and out of hospitals , and for 10 months , doctors could not diagnose what was wrong .
" He just had everybody stumped , " White said .
White and Trossman said no one was willing to try to solve Jacob 's problem , and they were told they would never know -- an " unacceptable " possibility , they said .
" We had to find out what was wrong , " Trossman said .
" Because if you do n't know what is wrong , you can't fix it . "
Earning a ' Ph.D. in Jacob '
So , White and Trossman began trying to figure it out themselves , reading everything they could find .
They talked to any expert who would listen , until , in a way , they became the experts .
White even audited medical classes at the University of Toronto .
She and Trossman said they 've earned an unofficial degree -- they call it a " Ph.D. in Jacob . "
After months of research , finally a break :
White uncovered that her family had a history of childhood illness going back generations .
She dug up medical records of her mother 's brothers -- uncles she had never met because both died before their second birthday .
" I got shivers when I saw it , " she recalled .
" It talked about paralyzed vocal cords … recurrent vomiting , nostagnis , which is when the eyeballs shake . …
It was a perfect match . "
But the clincher was an article buried in a medical journal from almost 25 years ago .
It described in great detail cases similar to Jacob's .
" They handed me an article and said , ' You know , we came across this article , we think it is about your family , ' " said White .
Of course , White thought " your family " meant a family like hers ; but in fact , the family was hers .
" We actually saw there was a family tree , and there is White and that was just unbelievable , " Trossman said .
A New Place to Start
Using this new research as a guide , doctors took another set of blood tests .
The tests indicated that Jacob had Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease , or PMD , a rare genetic brain disorder ;
White is a carrier .
Worldwide , the disease affects one in 300,000 children , mainly boys .
PMD is degenerative , and there is no treatment or cure .
And in severe cases like Jacob's , children have only 15 to 20 years to live .
" We have a huge deadline , " Trossman said .
" We wanted to get something in him before he turned 5 , because then we would have the benefit of any additional neurological development to carry him for the rest of his life , and it has to . "
So , again , White and Trossman hit the books .
They traveled to medical conferences , and even visited a lab in Germany in search of answers .
They heard about an experimental drug that acts as a myelin sheath replacement , but it was n't being considered for PMD patients .
Help in the Laboratory
The experimental drug was being tested in clinical settings for patients with spinal injuries , but Trossman and White thought it might work for PMD and it might help their son .
They enlisted the help of Dr. Jim Garbern from Wayne State University in Detroit .
" Marcy and Andrew are some of the sharpest people I have met in life , period , " Garbern said .
" They are crackerjack smart about the latest finding in this specific disease and biology , and are self - taught , though this is n't their area of education . "
The couple convinced a drug company to allow Garbern to test the drug on mice with a genetic disorder similar to PMD .
The affected mice shake violently , like the eyeballs of those who have PMD .
Going into the mice test , White and Trossman were optimistic .
" It 's really exciting .
I 'm thrilled to be here , " White said at the time .
" But a little bit nervous , because we 've got lots riding on this . "
But there were no miracles that first day .
The mice kept shaking , just like before .
' The Miracle That We Were Hoping for '
Months went by , and Garbern continued his research .
In the meantime , Andrea Bocelli -- Jacob 's favorite singer -- was in the Toronto area for a concert .
With the help of ABC News , the family reached out to the concert director and he agreed to let Jacob come to a rehearsal .
They sang all the way there , and even got to meet Bocelli backstage .
It was a joyous moment , but through the holidays they received little news from Garbern .
Then a few weeks ago , Garbern sent " Nightline " a DVD with some results of the trials .
We brought the DVD to Toronto and showed it to White for the first time .
Garbern had upped the dosage of the drug and injected the mice sooner after birth .
It seems to have had a dramatic effect on one of the mice .
Once shaking violently , the mouse was now walking , even running .
Trossman and White were overwhelmed .
" We just need to get that drug into Jacob , " White said .
" I think it does n't take a brain surgeon to see an improvement , " her husband added .
" This is the miracle that we were hoping for that first day . "
' Pushing as Hard as We Can '
The trials are still in the very early stages ; rigorous clinical testing must take place before Jacob can get access to the drug .
For Trossman and White , there is hope , but no time for complacency .
" We are pushing as hard as we can , " Trossman said .
" As hard as we know how to do , " his wife added .
And White insisted that exhaustion is not an issue .
" It does n't matter , " she said .
" Until we can get that drug in Jacob , we can't stop .
It is not an issue ; that is what we are doing .
If we can find a doctor here who can help us , here in Canada , [ to ] get access to this drug and get this drug in Jacob , that is when we can feel like , ' Yes , we have done something ' … unless we do something that actually does help him , then we have n't done anything , or we have n't done enough .

Lauschangriff auf Festplatten Florian Rötzer
Seltsamerweise gibt es keinen Aufschrei , wenn nach einem neuen Gesetz der Verfassungsschutz von Nordrhein - Westfalen auch ohne richterliche Anordnung über das Internet in Computer zum Ausspähen eindringen dürfte - auch im Bundesinnenministerium plant man ähnliches
Gestern fand im Landtag Nordrhein - Westfalens die zweite Lesung des neuen Verfassungsschutzgesetzes statt .
Offenbar weitgehend unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit , die noch gar nicht bemerkt hat , wie hier FDP - Innenminister Ingo Wolf eine neue Stufe auf dem Weg zum Überwachungsstaat beschreitet ( Der Verfassungsschutz soll " Emails auf Festplatten " lesen dürfen ) .
Die SPD - Fraktion sah immerhin noch Klärungsbedarf , allerdings nur beim Lauschangriff auf Wohnungen , weswegen es noch eine dritte Lesung geben wird .
Wirklich neu ist jedoch , dass nach dem Gesetz der Verfassungsschutz berechtigt wäre , über das Internet in Computer einzudringen und dort die Dateien auszuspähen .
Damit würde ebenso wie beim Lauschangriff in die Wohnung eingedrungen .
Ähnliches will der Bundesinnenminister auf Bundesebene durchsetzen , mit der Antiterrordatei gehen die Informationen dann auch an die Polizei weiter .
Man müsse auch technisch „ auf Augenhöhe mit den Verfassungsfeinden “ kommen , meinte Wolf und sieht in dem Gesetz dieses Ziel erreicht , das es dem Verfassungsschutz erlaubt , für eine „ effektive Terrorismusbekämpfung “ auch „ die Neuerungen im Bereich der Technik , insbesondere der Observations - , Informations - und Kommunikationstechnik “ nutzen zu können .
Schön heißt es im Gesetzesentwurf wie üblich , dass es zu diesem keine Alternativen gebe .
Und es wird auch behauptet , dass dadurch auf keiner Seite Kosten entstehen .
Anlass des Gesetzentwurfs ist das Auslaufen der 2002 auf den 1.1.2007 befristeten erweiterten Befugnisse des Verfassungsschutzes .
Als Begründung wird schlicht genannt , dass die Bedrohung durch den islamistischen Terrorismus weiterhin vorhanden sei .
Die Novellierung war bereits auf dem Weg , bevor der missglückte Anschlag auf die Regionalzüge stattgefunden hat .
Der Verfassungsschutz darf u.a .
Informanten einsetzen , verdeckte Ermittlungen führen , nicht öffentlich gemachte Äußerungen mit technischen Mitteln mithören und aufzeichnen ( Lauschangriff ) , Legenden stricken , gefälschte Dokumente erstellen oder in „ technische Kommunikationsbeziehungen durch Bild- , Ton- und Datenaufzeichnungen “ eindringen .
Neu wird - in der Amtssprache – bei der Überwachung des Brief- , Post - und Fernmeldeverkehr eingefügt , was eben weit über das Beobachten von im Internet stattfindender Kommunikation hinausgeht :
heimliches Beobachten und sonstiges Aufklären des Internets , wie insbesondere die verdeckte Teilnahme an seinen Kommunikationseinrichtungen bzw .
die Suche nach ihnen , sowie der heimliche Zugriff auf informationstechnische Systeme auch mit Einsatz technischer Mittel .
Der Sprengstoff findet sich im letzten Satz , der das Eindringen in Computer ermöglicht , die sich in einer Wohnung befinden , die nach dem Grundgesetz Art. 13 unter besonderem Schutz steht , weswegen auch Lauschangriffe nach einem Bundesverfassungsgericht nicht ohne weiteres möglich sind .
Thematisiert wird in dem Gesetz allerdings lediglich , dass dann , wenn dabei ein Eingriff in das Brief - , Post - und Fernmeldegeheimnis stattfindet , dies nur unter der Voraussetzung des Gesetzes zu Artikel 10 Grundgesetz zulässig wäre .
Das betrifft aber nur die Übermittlung von Informationen , wenn Emails oder andere Dateien aber auf der Festplatte gespeichert sind , träfe es nicht mehr zu .
Wie es scheint , dürften nach diesem Gesetz also die Verfassungsschützer in Rechner eindringen , selbst wenn sie sich nicht in Nordrhein - Westfalen befinden , ohne dass eine Zustimmung von einem Richter oder der G10 - Kommission erforderlich wäre .
Bei einer Anhörung im Oktober zur Änderung des Verfassungsschutzgesetzes gab es von Experten unterschiedliche Meinungen .
So wurde festgestellt , dass es im Hinblick auf Art. 10 Grundgesetz keinen maßgeblichen Unterschied zwischen Fernmelde - und Internetkommunikation gebe , aber das Eindringen in Rechnersysteme wurde , wenn es sich auf eingeschaltete Rechner bezieht , auch nicht als Eingriff in die Unverletzlichkeit der Wohnung gesehen .
Als Grund wurde u.a. angeführt , dass sich Art. 13 GG nicht auf die Wohnung , sondern nur auf die „ räumliche Privatsphäre “ beziehe .
Nur das Betreten einer Wohnung falle unter Art. 13 , nicht aber das „ Herauslesen “ von Daten .
Wenn der Betreiber online ist , so eine „ Begründung “ , dann habe er sein System derart geöffnet , „ dass er selbst den Zugriff der Verfassungsschutzbehörde ermöglicht “ .
Internet und Rechnersysteme sollten , so ein Rechtsprofessor , nicht besser als Briefe und Telefonate geschützt sein .
Es sei mit einem Eindringen in einen Computer auch keine Überwachung der Wohnung möglich , was natürlich nur stimmen würde , wenn am Computer keine Webcam und kein Mikrofon angeschlossen ist .
Andere sehen darin sehr wohl einen Eingriff in die informationelle Selbstbestimmung ( Art. 2 Abs. 1 i.V. mit Art. 1 Abs. 1 GG ) und eine Verletzung von Art. 13 GG , weswegen eine richterliche Anordnung notwendig sei .
Zudem können , wie Bettina Sokol , die Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz , anmerkt , mit dem Eindringen in einen Computer über den Einsatz technischer Mittel , auch „ Lebensvorgänge innerhalb der Privatsphäre “ ausgeforscht werden .
Zudem könne , wer Daten auf seinem Rechner in der eigenen Wohnung speichert , „ mit Recht davon ausgehen , den Schutz des Art. 13 GG auf Unverletzlichkeit der Wohnung in Anspruch nehmen zu können “ .
Als absurd sieht Sokol auch die Behauptung an , dass jemand , der online geht , auch die auf dem Computer gespeicherten Daten oder Emails „ in höherem Maße der Außenwelt öffnen “ würde .
Sokol fordert daher auch für das Eindringen in Computer eine richterliche Anordnung , die von Kontrollmechanismen des G10 - Gesetzes nicht ersetzt werden könne .
In einer Pressemitteilung erklärte Sokol , dass
im Gesetzentwurf nichts enthalten ist , um den Kernbereich der privaten Lebensgestaltung zu schützen .
Nach dem Bundesverfassungsgerichtsurteil zum großen Lauschangriff ist klar , dass es einen ganz privaten Bereich eines jeden Menschen gibt , der auch vor dem Blick der Sicherheitsbehörden verborgen bleiben muss .
Es geht diese Behörden zum Beispiel nicht die Krankheitsgeschichte oder das Liebesleben der von ihnen beobachteten oder ausgespähten Personen an .
Wie könnten die Verfassungsschützer überhaupt in Rechner über das Internet eindringen , also ohne die Wohnung zu betreten ?
Eine Möglichkeit wäre , in den Computer über das Internet einen Trojaner einzuschleusen .
Das könnte über eine Email geschehen , es könnten auf Webseiten oder Chats Trojaner ausgelegt werden oder man könnte durch Angriffe die Firewall eines Rechners lahm legen , um einen Trojaner oder ein anderes Überwachungsprogramm einzuschmuggeln .
Das FBI hatte Ende 2001 bestätigt , dass es an einem solchen Trojaner arbeite , der als Magic Lantern bezeichnet wurde .
Danach versiegten allerdings die Informationen .
Der Trojaner müsste so gemacht werden , dass er von den vorhandenen Antiviren - Programmen nicht erkannt wird .
Man müsste also jeweils individuelle Veränderungen vornehmen oder die Trojaner in Absprache mit den Herstellern von Antiviren - Programmen entwickeln .
Für kundige Computernutzer dürfte allerdings ein eingeschleuster Trojaner nicht lange unerkannt bleiben , zumal es ja nur Sinn macht , wenn die ausgespähten Daten wieder über das Internet versendet werden .

Fitzgerald set the tone for the trial in his opening statement today , arguing that Cheney was much more deeply involved in the leak than anyone previously thought , while , in their opening statements , Libby 's defense argued that he was sacrificed to cover up Karl Rove 's involvement .

From MSNBC :
Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald used his opening statement in the CIA leak trial Tuesday to allege that Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff lied about Cheney 's early involvement in the disclosure of a spy ’s identity .
Fitzgerald alleged that Libby in September 2003 “ wiped out ” a Cheney note just before Libby 's first FBI interview when he said he learned about Wilson and his wife , CIA operative Valerie Plame , from reporters , not the vice president .
It was not clear if Fitzgerald meant that the note was destroyed or that Libby had forgotten about it .
In their opening statements , Libby 's attorneys said Bush administration officials tried to blame him for the leak to cover up for presidential adviser Karl Rove ’s own disclosures .
Attorney Theodore Wells said Libby went to Cheney in 2003 and complained that the White House was subtly blaming him for leaking Plame ’s identity to columnist Robert Novak .
“ They ’re trying to set me up .
They want me to be the sacrificial lamb , ” Wells said , recalling the alleged conversation between Libby and Cheney .
“ I will not be sacrificed so Karl Rove can be protected . ”
US envoy Christopher Hill says there is still a way to go
Under the agreement , Pyongyang has promised to shut down its main nuclear reactor in return for fuel aid .
The US and Japan have also pledged to begin talks with North Korea on building closer ties .
The agreement was read out in front of delegates at the close of the talks , by China 's chief envoy Wu Dawei .
Mr Wu said the deal was " favourable for the peace process in north - east Asia and for the improvement of ties between relevant countries " .
White House spokesman Tony Snow called it " a very important first step " towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula .
Delegates from the two Koreas , the US , China , Japan and Russia had been meeting in Beijing since Thursday .
They worked late into Monday night to try and hammer out the final details of the deal .
' One phase '
Under the agreement , Pyongyang has pledged to close its Yongbyon reactor within 60 days , in return for 50,000 metric tons of fuel aid or economic aid of equal value .
The closure of Yongbyon will be verified by international inspectors .
N KOREA NUCLEAR PROGRAMME
Believed to have ' handful ' of nuclear weapons
But not thought to have any small enough to put in a missile Could try dropping from plane , though world watching closely
The US has agreed to begin the process of removing North Korea from its list of terror states and establish diplomatic relations .
Japan will also discuss normalising relations with the North .
Chief US negotiator , Christopher Hill , said the agreement reached this week was " only one phase of denuclearisation .
We 're not done . "
One of the topics that looks set to be left for later discussion is the fate of any nuclear weapons the North already possesses .
Signs of progress
In Washington , Mr Snow hailed the deal but sounded a note of caution .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is North Korea so who knows if this will really mean the suspension of their nuclear programme .

" If they do n't abide by the terms , they do n't get the benefits they desire , " he said .
" There 's still the possibility of sanctions through the international community . "
Other US figures had earlier voiced scepticism .
John Bolton , former US ambassador to the United Nations , said North Korea should not be rewarded with " massive shipments of heavy fuel oil " for only partially dismantling its nuclear arsenal .
" It sends exactly the wrong signal to would - be proliferators around the world , " Mr Bolton told CNN .
And while Japan has approved the joint agreement , Foreign Minister Taro Aso was quoted as saying that Tokyo would not provide aid as there had been no progress on the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by the North in the 1970s and 80s .
But despite the difficulties ahead , analysts say this deal is an important sign of progress , after more than three years of talks .
The previous deal , agreed in September 2005 , rapidly fell apart over differences between North Korea and the US over implementation .
The North Korean nuclear issue has become even more pressing in recent months , after Pyongyang conducted its first atomic test in October .

Casey Serin is a 24 - year - old real estate investor who is $ 2.2 million in debt .
Last year , Serin bought eight houses in four states and now he ca n’t afford the mortgage payments for any of them .
Even though Serin is in danger of losing all of his property , that is not even his biggest problem .
You see , he might be going to jail .
Serin lied on several of his loan applications and talked candidly about these “ liar loans ” on his blog , I Am Facing Foreclosure .
When friends warned Serin about the danger of confessing his fraudulent activities online , Serin tried to take the blog off the Internet , only to find out that Google has already cached it .
This is not the first time Serin got screwed by Google .
In one of his first attempts to secure a loan , the lender actually Googled Serin to see if his application was truthful ( it was n’t ) .
While Serin ’s application painted a rosy picture of his financial status , his blog truthfully revealed that he has several properties and is having problems with many of them .
Serin , who is a website developer , said he thought he had blocked search engines from indexing his blog , and that the lender ’s investigators must have a backdoor way of getting around such security measures .
Lying on a mortgage application is a federal crime .
It is an act of bank fraud , wire fraud , and mail fraud .
“ This can results in jail time , ” said Joseph Falk of the national Association of Mortgage Brokers .
As a way to cut energy use , it could not be simpler .
Unscrew a light bulb that uses a lot of electricity and replace it with one that uses much less .
While it sounds like a promising idea , it turns out that the long - lasting , swirl - shaped light bulbs known as compact fluorescent lamps are to the nation ’s energy problem what vegetables are to its obesity epidemic : a near perfect answer , if only Americans could be persuaded to swallow them .
But now Wal - Mart Stores , the giant discount retailer , is determined to push them into at least 100 million homes .
And its ambitions extend even further , spurred by a sweeping commitment from its chief executive , H. Lee Scott Jr. , to reduce energy use across the country , a move that could also improve Wal - Mart ’s appeal to the more affluent consumers the chain must win over to keep growing in the United States .
“ The environment , ” Mr. Scott said , “ is begging for the Wal - Mart business model . ”
It is the environmental movement ’s dream : America ’s biggest company , legendary for its salesmanship and influence with suppliers , encouraging 200 million shoppers to save energy .
Cindy Sheehan , who has crusaded nationally against the war in Iraq since her son was killed there , called on antiwar activists yesterday not to support Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , who is seeking re-election next year .
" I believe that any candidate who supports the war should not receive our support , " Ms. Sheehan told The Associated Press in an interview .
" It does n't matter if they 're Senator Clinton or whoever . "
Though Ms. Sheehan has criticized Mrs. Clinton 's position on the war in the past , this is the first time she has urged people to withhold support from the senator .
Senator Clinton voted to authorize the president to wage war in Iraq , but she has been critical of the way his administration has conducted the war .
Still , she has not called for either a withdrawal of American troops or a timetable for their withdrawal .
Mrs. Clinton 's office declined to comment on Ms. Sheehan 's remarks .
Ms. Sheehan made headlines over the summer when she camped outside President Bush 's vacation home in Crawford , Tex. , to demonstrate her opposition to the war .

South America
Is the 4th Largest Continent in the World South America is located in the Southern hemisphere , and is bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Atlantic Ocean in the east .
The continent covers some 6,890,000 square miles of land , with the region ’s geography dominated by the Andes Mountains and the Amazon River .
South America is very diverse , and is home to the vast Amazon Rainforest , grasslands like the Pampas Plain and savannahs such as the Atacama Desert .
South America
Is Home to 6 of the World ’s Most Unusual and Exciting Animals
The most unusual of all of these is the agouti , which is a rodent .
It is closely related to the guinea pig and varies in color from light brown to red , typically having light colored underparts .
The agouti is covered in coarse , short hair which raises up in spikes when the animal is frightened or alarmed .
More well - known animals native to the country are species such as llamas , chinchillas and armadillos , but Argentina is also home to deadly anacondas known for their ability to be able to wrap round their animal kingdom victims and crush their bones .
Finally , there is the anteater , known for its very large fore claws , which can easily tear open ant mounds .
This animal has very long fur , which protects them from being bitten and attacked by the insects they feast on .
There Are 10 Spanish Speaking Countries in South America ..or 9 .
It all depends on whether you decide to count Panama or not .
Some people believe that this country does n’t count towards the final tally as it is the dividing line between Central and Southern America , while others will add it in .
South America is a very diverse continent in terms of its languages .
Portuguese is of course one of the main spoken languages , but there are a great many people that also speak Dutch , French and English too .

South America ’s Climate Is Mostly Hot and Wet , but It Is also Home to the Driest Desert on Earth The Atacama Desert , located in Chile , is believed to hold this title .
It covers a 621 mile ( 1000 kilometer ) strip of land .
Most of the land mass is populated by sand , salt lakes and stony terrain .
The average rainfall for the entire year is believed to be only 0.5 fluid ounces .
It is reported that some of the weather stations in the area set up to record statistics on the desert have never received a single drop of rain !
3 of the World ’s Greatest Empires Originate in South America The Mayans , Aztecs and Incas all have their roots in South America – and they were among the wealthiest , yet most mysterious , colonies in the world .
The Aztecs were considered to be the most powerful until the year 1519 , when a Spanish army leader called Hernando Cortez launched a war against them .
The Aztecs , though wealthy , had very little in the way of advanced weaponry and could not fight back against Cortez and his soldiers .
This marked the end of their power .
After this time , the Spanish started to colonize more of South America and tried to tap into the region ’s vast natural resources .
Argentina , One of the Largest Countries in South America , Takes Its Name from the Word “ Silver ” One of the most fascinating South America Facts is how the country came to be named .
Argentina was formerly called The United Provinces of the Rio De La Plata , but took its new name after a legend sprang up that there was a large treasure of silver hidden away in the mountainous regions of the country .
The name is derived from the Latin Argentum and dates back to the 16th century when explorers from Spain and Portugal came to the country to look for this treasure .
The Largest Rainforest in the World Is in South America The Amazon rainforest is 2,123,562 square miles ( 4 million square kilometers ) in area and is home to some 2.5 million different types of insect species .
Not only that , but it also contains one fifth of the world ’s freshwater .
It also shares its name with a river that has another amazing statistic : the Amazon River is actually the world ’s second longest .
South American Music
Is World Famous Music traditions such as samba , tango and cumbia originate in these lands .
Samba was made famous by Brazilian musicians , and one of its most famous exponents was the singer and movie star Carmen Miranda , who did more to bring the music to the mainstream in the 20th century than anyone else .
Cumbia is probably one of the least well - known forms of South American music .
It originates in Columbia and the sounds form part of courtship rituals and dances between people from the country .
It is a fusion between African and Amerindian traditions .
The Nazca Lines Are a Jaw Dropping Feat of Geology Scholars believe these ancient lines , located in Peru , were created between 450 - 600 AD .
Calling them lines does them an injustice , though , as they are an intricate and truly beautiful set of images of different animals and creatures .
The only reason they have been preserved is because of the climate in Peru .
It was originally believed that these images were only viewable from the air , though this theory has been disproved to an extent as climbers who have traversed the surrounding foothills have claimed to have seen them from the top of their ascents .

South America ’s Condor
Is the World ’s Largest Flying Bird
The condor is a type of vulture and is native to Peru , Ecuador and Chile .
It is also the main symbol on the coat of arms of Colombia .
It has a wingspan of almost 10 feet ( 3 meters ) , but , sadly , due to aggressive hunting in the countries it originates from , it is in danger of extinction .
The condor was widely believed to kill livestock so was frequently killed for this reason ; however , this has now been found to be untrue and there are efforts being made to preserve and sustain the remaining birds .

SANTA CRUZ , Calif . -
The protest was carefully orchestrated , planned for weeks by Students Against War during Friday evening meetings in a small classroom on the University of California campus here .
So when the military recruiters arrived for the job fair , held in an old dining hall last April 5 -- a now fateful day for a scandalized university -- the students had their two - way radios in position , their cyclists checking the traffic as hundreds of demonstrators marched up the hilly roads of this campus on the Central Coast and a dozen moles stationed inside the building , reporting by cellphone to the growing crowd outside .
" Racist , sexist , antigay , " the demonstrators recalled shouting .
" Hey , recruiters , go away ! "
Things got messy .
As the building filled , students storming in were blocked from entering .
The recruiters left , some finding that the tires of their vehicles had been slashed .
The protesters then occupied the recruiters ' table and , in what witnesses described as a minor melee , an intern from the campus career center was injured .
Fast forward :
The students had left campus for their winter vacation in mid-December when a report by MSNBC said the April protest had appeared on what the network said was a database from a Pentagon surveillance program .
The protest was listed as a " credible threat " -- to what is not clear to people around here -- and was the only campus action among scores of other antimilitary demonstrations to receive the designation .

This is the story of a guy who bought a couple of computer tablets on eBay from China and got less than he bargained for .
Phil S. was n’t a stranger to buying on eBay , and had purchased many computer items from sellers in the USA , China , and other countries around the globe .
Phil was also a “ power user ” and adept at resolving just about any problem that he came across since he used to run a computer store .
Last month , he saw a tablet being offered by a highly - rated seller with excellent specifications like Android 9 , a ten - core very fast processor , and tons of ram and storage .
So , he bought two of them .
The tablets arrived from China a few weeks after ordering them .
A quick double - check of the specs according to the “ about ” section of settings revealed he got exactly what he paid for , an even got an Android upgrade to version 10 .
However , when he started using the tablet , he noticed problems immediately .
There was something off .
The specs claimed that the unit was running Android 10 , but the screen had the exact appearance of Android 4.4 .
The units seemed slow .
After running a few tests , he found that they were old units hacked to appear like new , high capacity fast tablets .
In other words , the seller or his henchmen went into the “ about ” page on the tablet ( shown above in the black picture ) and actually changed the wording that it displayed .
Using some sophisticated sniffing tools , Phil found some of the real specs of his tablets .
* Mouse Print :
The fraud pervaded every specification that the seller had listed , speed , resolution , capacity , processor , and software version .
For example , the resolution was not the 2560 x 1600 promised , but only 1280 x 720 ; and the processor only had four cores and not 10 .
When Phil complained to eBay , they refunded his money .
But he wanted to warn others about this scam .
If you see ads online for no name computers with great specs but at ridiculously low prices ( Phil ’s tablets were only $ 69 ) , you might want to think twice before hitting the buy button .
Smiley Lore :-) Scott E. Fahlman
A lot of people have asked me about this , so I thought I ’d put the information here , linked under my home page :
Yes , I am the inventor of the sideways “ smiley face ” ( sometimes called an “ emoticon ” ) that is commonly used in E - mail , chat , and newsgroup posts .
Or at least I ’m one of the inventors .
By the early 1980 ’s , the Computer Science community at Carnegie Mellon was making heavy use of online bulletin boards or “ bboards ” .
These were a precursor of today ’s newsgroups , and they were an important social mechanism in the department – a place where faculty , staff , and students could discuss the weighty matters of the day on an equal footing .
Many of the posts were serious : talk announcements , requests for information , and things like “ I ’ve just found a ring in the fifth - floor men ’s room .
Who does it belong to ? ”
Other posts discussed topics of general interest , ranging from politics to abortion to campus parking to keyboard layout ( in increasing order of passion ) .
Even in those days , extended “ flame wars ” were common .
Given the nature of the community , a good many of the posts were humorous ( or attempted humor ) .
The problem was that if someone made a sarcastic remark , a few readers would fail to get the joke , and each of them would post a lengthy diatribe in response .
That would stir up more people with more responses , and soon the original thread of the discussion was buried .
In at least one case , a humorous remark was interpreted by someone as a serious safety warning .
This problem caused some of us to suggest ( only half seriously ) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously .
After all , when using text - based online communication , we lack the body language or tone - of - voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone .
Various “ joke markers ” were suggested , and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution – one that could be handled by the ASCII - based computer terminals of the day .
So I suggested that .
In the same post , I also suggested the use of :-( to indicate that a message was meant to be taken seriously , though that symbol quickly evolved into a marker for displeasure , frustration , or anger .
This convention caught on quickly around Carnegie Mellon , and soon spread to other universities and research labs via the primitive computer networks of the day .
( Some CMU alumni who had moved on to other places continued to read our bboards as a way of keeping in touch with their old community . )
Within a few months , we started seeing the lists with dozens of “ smilies ” : open - mouthed surprise , person wearing glasses , Abraham Lincoln , Santa Claus , the pope , and so on .
Producing such clever compilations has become a serious hobby for some people .
But only my two original smilies , plus the “ winky ” ;-) and the “ noseless ” variants seem to be in common use for actual communication .
It ’s interesting to note that Microsoft and AOL now intercept these character strings and turn them into little pictures .
Personally , I think this destroys the whimsical element of the original .
Unfortunately , I did n’t keep a copy of my original post .
It did n’t seem like a big deal at the time .
By the time I realized that this smiley - face phenomenon was going to be long - lasting and that it would spread around the world as the Internet grew , it was too late to easily retrieve the post , and the original message was lost for many years .
Several attempts to find the post on old backup tapes were unsuccessful .
But in 2001 - 2002 Mike Jones of Microsoft sponsored a more serious “ archeological dig ” through our ancient backup tapes .
Jeff Baird and the CMU CS facilities staff put in a heroic effort with the support and encouragement of Howard Wactlar , Bob Cosgrove , and David Livingston .
They found the proper tapes , located a working tape drive that could read the ancient media , decoded the old formats , and did a lot of searching to find the actual posts .
I am most grateful to all who participated in this successful quest , which I call the “ Digital Coelacanth Project . ”
So the message itself , and the thread that gave rise to it , are here .
The exact date of the smiley ’s birth can now be determined : 19 September , 1982 .
It was great to have this message back just in time for the 20th anniversary of the original post .
As you can see , the note in which I suggested this thing was quite short and casual – just part of an ongoing discussion that involved many people .
I apparently did n’t even read it over before posting , since a word or two were dropped in editing .
I do remember writing a longer message in which I explained the need for a humor - marker in more detail , and suggested the :-) symbol , along with :-( to indicate anger or real unhappiness .
But this longer message must have come later – perhaps a later bboard post or an E - mail message that I sent to someone .
In any case , that more detailed post did not turn up in our search .
Many people have denounced the very idea of the smiley face , pointing out that good writers should have no need to explicitly label their humorous comments .
Shakespeare and Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain got along just fine without this .
And by labeling the remarks that are not meant to be taken seriously , we spoil the joke .
In satirical writing , half the fun is in never being quite sure whether the author is serious or not .
To a large degree , I agree with these critics .
Perhaps the E - mail smiley face has done more to degrade our written communication than to improve it .
But in defense of the idea , let me say two things :
First , not all people who post on boards have the literary skill of Shakespeare or Twain , and even those luminaries had bad days .
If Shakespeare were tossing off a quick note complaining about the lack of employee parking spaces near the Globe Theater , he might have produced the same kind of sloppy prose that the rest of us do .
Besides , Shakespeare ’s work is full of clichés and his spelling was atrocious . :-)
Second , and more important , these authors were publishing their words in a different medium , with different properties .
If 100,000 copies of a novel or an essay were distributed in printed form , and if 1 % of the readers did n’t get the joke and were outraged at what they had read , there was nothing these clueless readers could do to spoil the enjoyment of the other 99 % .
But if it were possible for each of the 1000 clueless readers to write a lengthy counter - argument and to flood these into the same distribution channels as the original work , and if others could then jump into the fray in similar fashion , you can see the problems that this would cause .
If the judicious use of a few smilies can reduce the frequency of such firestorms , then maybe it ’s not such a bad idea after all .
Again , we ’re talking here about casual writing on the Internet , not great works printed in a one - way medium that is relatively inaccessible to the general public .
One final point : I ’ve seen various claims that the sideways smiley face , built from ASCII characters , was invented by someone else .
I believe that I invented this particular glyph and the “ turn your head to one side ” principle independently .
I do n’t recall seeing anything like this before my 1982 post , though a few messages in the thread we just located come close .
Leonard Hamey ’s post suggesting ( # ) for humor might be taken as an example of “ turn your head to one side ” – it ’s not really clear if that was his intent – and apparently \__ / was used by one of our research groups to indicate a smile .
Some people have told me that the :-) or :) convention was used by teletype operators in the old days .
Maybe so .
Others have written to tell me that their father or uncle or they themselves used to type these symbols , or something close to them , in private letters ( or , in one case , on punch cards ) long before 1982 .
I have n’t ( yet ) seen any hard evidence of this , but I have no reason to doubt their accounts .
It ’s a simple and obvious idea after all , and the ind ependent invention of this idea by multiple people would not be implausible .
So , the smiley idea may have appeared and disappeared a few times before my 1982 post .
I probably was not the first person ever to type these three letters in sequence , perhaps even with the meaning of “ I ’m just kidding ” and perhaps even online .
But I do believe that my 1982 suggestion was the one that finally took hold , spread around the world , and spawned thousands of variations .
My colleagues and I have been able to watch the idea spread out through the world ’s computer networks from that original post .
Let me close with a quote from an interview with Vladimir Nabokov , author of Lolita and other modern classics ( thanks to Eli Brandt for calling this to my attention ) : Q : How do you rank yourself among writers ( living ) and of the immediate past ?
Nabokov : I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile – some sort of concave mark , a supine round bracket , which I would now like to trace in reply to your question .

The stuff you want at the price you need
IF A planet - wide data network , akin to the internet , were built on Mars , what would it look like ?
That might sound like a silly question , but it raises an important point .
The design of computer networks is constrained by the need to be compatible with the internet and other systems that have grown up over the past four decades .
What if network designers could start again with a clean slate , unencumbered by today 's messy reality ?
Ever since the internet 's inception in 1969 engineers have tweaked it in a piecemeal fashion .
That the system has scaled up well enough to handle almost 1 billion users and blazingly fast fibre - optic links is nothing short of amazing .
But as the internet has grown , so too have problems such as spam , viruses and “ denial of service ” attacks that can cripple large websites — not to mention the challenge of accommodating all kinds of new devices , from cars to mobile phones to wireless sensors .
“ We 've pretty much exhausted the tweaks we can do , ” says Tom Anderson of the University of Washington .
As a result , a handful of the internet 's original pioneers , along with a gaggle of young Turks , are now putting their heads together to consider how to fix the network 's shortcomings — not by fiddling with a few things here or there , but by starting again from scratch .
To this end , America 's National Science Foundation ( NSF ) has launched two initiatives .
The first , Global Environment for Networking Innovations ( GENI ) , is a project to build an advanced test - bed network for piloting new protocols and applications .
In January the project 's leaders produced their conceptual design plan , and they must now lobby for the money to implement it .
The second project , Future Internet Design ( FIND ) , will examine how best to equip the internet for the needs of the future .
In December , the NSF asked for FIND proposals from the engineering research community , which are due this month .
The aim of these schemes is to prompt academic engineers to think afresh for the longer term .
“ The challenging question is : can we conceive a vision for what a global communications network will look like in ten or 15 years ?
To do that , you have to free yourself from what the world looks like now , ” says David Clark of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who helped to design the internet , and now is trying to fix it .
“ The internet is so obvious that it is hard to contemplate what a non-internet would look like , ” he says .
Visions of the future
That said , it seems reasonable to assume that the number of devices on the network will continue to multiply in new and unforeseen ways .
So researchers are starting from the assumption that communications chips and sensors will eventually be embedded in almost everything , from furniture to cereal boxes — “ hundreds of billions of such devices ” , suggested one group of engineers in a working paper last year .
And while today 's internet traffic is generally initiated by humans — as they send e-mails , click on web links , or download music tracks — in future , the vast majority of traffic may be “ machine to machine ” communications : things flirting with other things .
To further complicate matters , these things will probably be connected wirelessly , and will move around .
Given all these demands , what sort of new ideas have the engineers come up with ?
It is still early days , of course , and a number of veteran internet engineers are holding back their own proposals in order to encourage the emergence of a younger generation , who might otherwise feel that the initiative was being dominated by the old boys ' network , as it were .
Still , a few proposals have already emerged .
One is “ trust - modulated transparency ” .
The idea is to enable the network 's traffic - routing infrastructure to judge the trustworthiness of packets of data as they pass by .
Packets deemed trustworthy would be delivered normally , but dubious packets ( from unfamiliar senders , for example ) might be shunted aside for screening , just as security guards in office buildings wave through staff but look more closely at visitors .
Particularly dubious packets might then be blocked , thus making various kinds of online wrongdoing more difficult .
The whole system would be based on a “ web of trust ” , in which traffic flows freely between devices that trust each other , but is closely scrutinised between those that do not .
“ The basic , fundamental change is that packet - forwarding decisions are based on levels of trust between sender and receiver , as well as traditional things like optimal path , ” says John Wroclawski of the USC Information Sciences Institute , one of the proposal 's developers .
Another idea is a new approach to addressing , called “ internet indirection infrastructure ” , proposed by Ion Stoica of the University of California , in Berkeley .
It would overlay an additional addressing system on top of the internet - protocol numbers now used to identify devices on the internet .
This would make it easier to support mobile devices , and would also allow for “ multicasting ” of data to many devices at once , enabling the efficient distribution of audio , video and software .
But how could a new addressing system be tested ?
Dr Anderson and others have set up PlanetLab , a worldwide experimental overlay network that sits on top of the internet and acts as a testbed for new networking software .
Using PlanetLab , researchers can quickly establish a global network of machines in order to test a new approach to packet routing , say , or content distribution .
PlanetLab allows many such prototype networks to operate at once , without interfering with each other .
One of these “ virtualised ” networks is in fact a recreation of the internet itself , which can be used to test modifications to the internet protocol .
Yet another proposed feature of a clean - slate internet comes from Dr Clark , who suggests adding diagnostic systems so that users can work out what has gone wrong when the internet fails to perform as expected .
Then , when a videoconference call failed to connect smoothly , for example , it would be possible to determine whether the fault lay with the internet service provider or with poorly configured equipment .
But the network itself would have to collect and share performance measures , something today 's dumb network cannot do .
Today 's network is dumb for a reason , however : it was a deliberate design decision .
Back in the 1970s , rather than prejudging the kinds of uses to which the internet might be put and favouring some at the expense of others , its designers opted to make it as simple as possible .
This open approach is what has made the internet such a vibrant platform for innovation .
New applications , such as the web , peer - to - peer file sharing and internet telephony , were later able to emerge even though they were undreamt of back in the 1970s .
None of these are explicitly provided for by the internet 's underlying design , but neither does it preclude them .
The internet itself stays resolutely dumb , and blindly passes packets of data between devices on the edges of the network , which can then be upgraded to do new things .
This non-discriminatory approach is known as the “ end - to - end principle ” , and it is one of the most cherished aspects of the internet 's design .
The end - to - end principle has promoted innovation at the edges of the network , but it has necessarily prevented innovation at its core .
One possible remedy , which would allow diversity and innovation to flourish within the core of the internet , is the concept of “ active networks ” or “ metanets ” .
The idea is that today 's routers , the boxes that direct internet traffic , would be replaced with more flexible devices , able to learn new communications protocols when needed .
Devices at the edge of the network could then dynamically reprogram all the routers along the network path between them to use whatever new protocol they wanted .
The routers would be able to partition themselves internally , so that other users of the network would not be affected .
This approach has the advantage that new protocols would then emerge , tailored to applications such as video streaming , file sharing , and new things that have yet to be imagined .
The drawback , however , is that routers are able to handle traffic quickly because they are single - minded .
Adding complexity to the internet 's core infrastructure might end up increasing versatility at the expense of performance — a trade - off not all users would be prepared to make .
Soul of a new network
The idea of metanets also provides an answer to the question of how to deploy a new clean - slate internet .
Metanets would , in effect , allow multiple internets to run in parallel .
There could then be competition between different protocols ; and if one of the metanet protocols turned out to be much more secure , for instance , then security - sensitive users would have a reason to adopt it .
Perhaps the clean - slate approach is not quite as esoteric and academic as it seems .
Before a Darwinian internet of competing metanets can emerge , however , engineers must dream up new ideas and devise new protocols , which will take time .
And as well as confronting technical hurdles , the engineers vying to redesign the internet will undoubtedly find themselves caught up in social , political and economic arguments .
That is because while the internet 's existing architecture fosters innovation and promotes free speech , for example , it also allows spam and illegal music downloads to flourish .
In reconsidering the technological underpinnings of the network , the engineers will inherently be making choices with far wider implications .
“ When ever you design an architecture like this , you 're not just designing a technical solution , but also designing an industry structure , ” says Dr Clark .
It may well transpire that the greatest impediment to upgrading the internet will turn out to be political disagreements over how it should work , rather than the technical difficulty of bringing it about .
Approximately 10 % of the US population identifies themselves as having no religion .
But a recent poll suggests that Americans view atheists and religious skeptics as slightly less dangerous than .
Perhaps that 's why we rarely see atheism even mentioned in traditional media , and when it is , the context is almost never ' fair and balanced . '
It 's not surprising that with these kinds of attitudes , politicians of every ideological stripe run away screaming from even a hint of atheism .
But in the blogosphere it is openly discussed , as on the atheist / skeptic blog Unscrewing the Inscrutable ( UTI ) managed by Brent Rasmussen .
UTI -- Observations and inanities by a second - shift assistant supervisor in the Puppy - Grinding division of the Evil Atheist Conspiracy ® ( our motto : " Sure it 's cruel , but think of the jobs ! " ) , your host , Brent Rasmussen .
DarkSyde ( DS ) :
You 're an atheist , what does that mean to you and why are you one ?
Brent Rasmussen ( Brent ) :
It means that I am a human being in which god - belief is absent .
Please notice the lack of the mention of an actual god ( whatever that is ) .
Atheists are folks in whom god - belief , of any kind , is absent .
Conversely , theists are folks in which god - belief is present .
Simple , really .
It 's an off - on , black or white proposition .
Either god - belief is there , or it 's not there .
Philosophically , I hold the same position as George H. Smith - that the word " god " is literally incomprehensible .
A blank .
A semantic null .
I make the further claim that it has a mutable and changeable meaning that is wholly subjective and is different for each and every individual human being on the planet , each and every time they use it - thus rendering it nonsense .
Dangerous nonsense , to be sure , but nonsense all the same .
The reason that I am an atheist is that the only other choice in this binary spectrum is complete and utter lunacy .
DS : Do you have a religious background ?
Brent : I was a raised a Mormon .
Almost all of my relatives on both my father 's and my mother 's side are Mormon .
I was steeped in Mormonism and general Christianity when I was a child .
Contrary to what many Christians try to claim , Mormons are not a " cult " in the sense that they mean it .
Mormonism is simply another Christian denomination .
A little different , a little on the edges , but Christian nonetheless .
I mean , c'mon - is Pentecostal snake - handling any different than Mormon " baptism for the dead " when you get right down to it ?
DS : How did you go from that to being a skeptic or atheist ?
Brent :
Well , interestingly enough my father had his own problems believing the contradictory doctrinal claims of the Mormon church - which he had also grown up in .
He went so far as to remove himself , and later his family ( my mother and my siblings ) from the rolls of active Mormons at the head office .
The critical thinking and reasoning he applied to digging out the facts of the Mormon religion impressed me and rubbed off on me .
Unfortunately , my father did not apply the same critical thinking to his new born - again Christian faith , or to religion in general , and remains a happy Christian man to this day .
He stopped with debunking Mormonism .
It was enough for him , I think .
Well , I went much further with it and applied all the lessons in critical thinking that he had taught me to religion in general , and to Christianity specifically .
Guess what ?
They came up wanting .
Big surprise , huh ?
Well , at the time I was devastated .
I really , really wanted some religion to be true and for a god to exist .
Much later I realized that being an atheist is the best way to approach this life .
It 's like un - wrapping the cotton swaddling from your skull and seeing the bright , beautiful world as it truly is .
Our planet , each other , our lives , our universe , they are all so incredibly and wonderfully exciting - all on their own !
Why gild the lilly , you know ?
Is n't it enough to see the mind - blowingly beautiful fog of stars on a clear night - and knowing that our tiny little envelope of air and dirt is embedded in this small part of one of the spiral arms of our galaxy - without attributing it to Jojo The Great God Of The Congo 's B.O. or something ?
I mean , why diminish it like that ?
I 'd rather understand it the way it really is - and not the way that I wish for it to be .
DS : Then you must be a card carrying member of the so - called Godless liberal left , yes ?
Brent : Hardly .
I 'm pretty conservative .
I was a conservative , registered Republican for the largest part of my voting life .
I recently changed to " independent " .
I consider myself a " little " l " libertarian .
My wife claims that I am still one of the most conservative people she 's ever known - especially when I'm " driving like a grandpa " - to which I reply , " I am a grandpa ! "

Teachers are among the hardest and lowest paid workers and yet must meekly accept any and all criticism .
Here is one teacher who ’s tried to think outside the square , and all it got him was a whole heap of trouble .
Gotta love his initiative though .
Teacher in trouble over meth maths question
A High school teacher is in trouble over an algebra test for his students that incorporated a drug dealer .
Local news reports said the principal at Moriarty High School in New Mexico believes the teacher “ made a misjudgment ” when he posed this question to his students :
Smoky J. sells meth ( methamphetamine , a stimulant ) .
Smoky ’s source says he has to sell a G’s ( thousand dollars ’ ) worth of meth by the end of the month .
How do you like the new and updated version of ‘ If a train leaves Chicago at …..’
If Smoky sold $ 240 the first week and $ 532 the second week , how much money must Smoky make if he wants to avoid the beat down from his connection ?
What the teacher should do is go through the answers to see if any of his students can deliver meth at a lower price .
Then work for them .
I 've been exploring Cambrian House recently , a very interesting site with some fresh ideas for the web .
Check out some of my ideas below in the idea wars to find out which ideas get supported .

The planemo twins :
Two peculiar planet - like worlds
A few dozen such objects have been identified in recent years but this is the first set of " twins " .
Dubbed " planemos " , they circle each other rather than orbiting a star .
Their existence challenges current theories about the formation of planets and stars , astronomers report in the journal Science .
" This is a truly remarkable pair of twins - each having only about 1 % the mass of our Sun , " said Ray Jayawardhana of the University of Toronto , co-author of the Science paper .
" Its mere existence is a surprise , and its origin and fate a bit of a mystery . "
' Double planet '
The pair belongs to what some astronomers believe is a new class of planet - like objects floating through space ; so - called planetary mass objects , or " planemos " , which are not bound to stars .
Now we 're curious to find out whether such pairs are common or rare .
The answer could shed light on how free - floating planetary - mass objects form
Valentin Ivanov
They appear to have been forged from a contracting gas cloud , in a similar way to stars , but are much too cool to be true stars .
And while they have similar masses to many of the giant planets discovered beyond our Solar System ( the larger weighs in at 14 times the mass of Jupiter and the other is about seven times more massive ) , they are not thought to be true planets either .
" We are resisting the temptation to call it a ' double planet ' because this pair probably did n't form the way that planets in our Solar System did , " said co-researcher Valentin Ivanov of the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) in Santiago , Chile .
' Amazing diversity '
The two objects have similar spectra and colours , suggesting that they formed at the same time about a million years ago .
They are separated by about six times the distance between the Sun and Pluto , and can be found in the Ophiuchus star - forming region some 400 light years away .
They go under the official name Oph 162225 - 240515 , or Oph 1622 for short .
" Recent discoveries have revealed an amazing diversity of worlds out there , " said Dr Jayawardhana .
" Still , the Oph 1622 pair stands out as one of the most intriguing , if not peculiar . "
His colleague , Dr Ivanov , said they were curious to find out whether such pairs are common or rare .
" The answer could shed light on how free - floating planetary - mass objects form , " he added .
Oph 1622 was discovered using the ESO 's New Technology Telescope at La Silla , Chile .
Follow - up studies were conducted with the ESO 's Very Large Telescope .
Google identifies 8153 sites as harmful February 14 , 2007

Google now warns surfers with message “ This site may harm your computer ” under potentially unsafe sites on the search results page .
Even then you click on the title of such page , you wo n’t be able to visit it – Google just warns you once again that visiting this site may be harmful to computer and offering you to pick another search result .
For example type “ beautiful free screensavers ” , you ’ll get :

After my update on the global supply situation the other day , I also wanted to catch up with another of my favorite topics : how US drivers are responding to the flattening of global oil supply ( something I last looked at here ) .
We now have VMT ( vehicle miles traveled ) data through August , and that allows us to see what happened during the summer when oil ( and thus gasoline ) prices were very high .
For context , here 's the price history :
Daily West Texas Intermediate spot prices , Jan 2002 - November 2006 .
Click to enlarge .
Source : EIA .
( As an aside , it appears to me that in the last three years , as the market has got tighter and tighter , it has developed an interesting seasonal structure where there is a spring run-up in price , and then a larger summer run-up in price , and then an autumn price drop .
However , these features are getting earlier and earlier , and larger and larger , each year .
I think the drop in price in September / October fits this narrative , and I expect prices will start to run up again late this year or early next year ( though probably not too much higher than they got this year , absent worsened geopolitical problems ) .
So if we look at what drivers did in response to these prices :
Monthly vehicle miles traveled in the United States , Jan 2002 - Aug 2006 .
Graph is not zero scaled to better show changes .

Source : FHWA Travel Volume Trends .
We find that the extra high prices of summer 2006 were enough to cause a slight drop in VMT ( against the traditional few percent / year rise and the general flattening of the last couple of years ) .
Looking at the same thing a different way , the following graph shows a longer history of monthly VMT data together with a 12 month trailing average ( which erases the seasonal signal ) , and a linear fit to the latter .
Monthly vehicle miles traveled in the United States , Jan 1990 - Aug 2006 , together with a twelve month trailing average and a linear fit to the average .
Graph is not zero scaled to better show changes .
Click to enlarge .
Source : FHWA Travel Volume Trends .
As you can see , US VMT generally rises fairly relentlessly , but the high prices of the last couple of years have been enough to stem the tide , and indeed now cause it to just begin to drop slightly ( though it might flutter up again now that prices have eased somewhat ) .
Last time I discussed this , I developed a method for estimating the fuel economy of the deployed US vehicle fleet ( basically by dividing monthly gasoline consumption in the US by monthly VMT with an approximate correction for diesel powered miles ) .
An update on that picture looks as follows :
Estimated deployed gasoline fleet fuel economy by month in the United States , Jan 1990 - Aug 2006 , together with a twelve month trailing average and a linear fit to the average .
Graph is not zero scaled to better show changes .

Source : FHWA Travel Volume Trends for VMT , and EIA for motor gasoline supplied .
In general , the recent price rise has not caused anything noticeable to happen to the long - term very slow rise in fuel economy .
Transportation adaptation to recent high oil prices appears to have come overwhelmingly from curtailment of VMT growth ( so far ) .
Nominee for US defense secretary advocated bombing of Nicaragua
By Joe Kay
28 November 2006
In December 1984 , Robert Gates , the Bush administration ’s nominee to replace Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary , advocated military strikes against Nicaragua in response to what he considered to be a growing threat to US interests in Central and South America .
Gates was then deputy director of intelligence at the CIA .
Gates made his proposal in a newly declassified document that is part of a collection put together by the National Security Archives , a private research group , to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Iran - Contra affair .
The scandal involved top Reagan administration officials secretly selling arms to Iran in order to finance right - wing “ contra ” guerillas in Nicaragua in violation of a congressional prohibition .
Gates has long been suspected of involvement in these illegal activities , though he was never indicted .
Leading Democrats have already indicated that Gates will be easily confirmed with bipartisan support before the end of the lame - duck congressional session in December .
In a memorandum to then - CIA Director George Casey , Gates urged that the administration use “ all necessary measures ( short of military invasion ) to bring down the regime ” in Nicaragua .
Among these measures , he advocated “ the use of air strikes to destroy a considerable portion of Nicaragua ’s military buildup . ”
“ Without a comprehensive campaign openly aimed at bringing down the regime , at best we somewhat delay the inevitable , ” Gates wrote .
“ Without US funding for the Contras , the resistance essentially will collapse over the next year or two . ”
In the memo , Gates advocated a view with which he had become associated within the administration and the intelligence apparatus : a hard - line militarist position against the Soviet Union and any regimes considered to be “ left ” or pro-Soviet .
Gates denounced negotiations with Cuban President Fidel Castro in 1958 - 60 , wrote that the conduct of the Vietnam War consisted of “ half - measures , half - heartedly applied , ” and denounced congressional legislation that placed constraints on executive power to conduct foreign policy .
In the latter category he included the Boland amendment , which prohibited US backing for the anti-Sandinista contra forces in Nicaragua .
The lesson he drew from this historical experience was the need for direct military action in Nicaragua , which would have to circumvent congressional restrictions .
“ Any negotiated agreement simply will offer a cover for the consolidation of the regime and two or three years from now we will be in a considerably worse shape than we are now , ” he wrote .
Gates ’ position mirrored that of others in the Reagan administration who now occupy prominent positions in the Bush administration , including then - ambassador to Honduras John Negroponte .
Negroponte is currently the director of national intelligence , a position that was first offered to Gates , but which Gates declined .
( See “ Democrats back Negroponte nomination as new documents detail role in contra war ” ) .
The Reagan administration decided not to follow Gates ’ suggestion to carry out military strikes and instead elected to illegally pursue CIA financing of the contras , paid for through sales of weapons to Iran .
Lawrence Walsh , the independent counsel in the Iran - Contra investigation , decided not to indict Gates for involvement in these activities , however there is little doubt that Gates played a prominent role .
Walsh later wrote that he was highly skeptical of Gates ’ claims that he did not learn of the secret funding until 1986 .
Robert Parry , an investigative journalist who helped uncover the Iran - Contra scandal , noted in an interview on Democracy Now !
November 9 that , even while serving as a member of the Carter administration ’s National Security Council , Gates helped arrange contacts between Iran and the Reagan presidential campaign .
These contacts continued through the 1980s , and , according to some reports , Gates helped manufacture an intelligence rationale to justify the sale of weapons to Iran .
Primarily because of his role in Iran - Contra , Gates was forced to withdraw his nomination as CIA director in 1987 , however this nomination was resubmitted and approved by the Senate in 1991 .
Thirty - one senators voted against Gates , an unprecedented number for a nominee to head the CIA .
Gates ’ role in the Iran - Contra scandal is not uncharacteristic .
He has a long and sordid history as a leading figure in the CIA .
When nominating Gates , Bush said that he “ helped lead America ’s efforts to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan ” in the 1980s .
At that time , the CIA was financing Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan , including Osama bin Laden , in the American proxy war against the Soviet Union .
Even as he was helping sell weapons to Iran , Gates played a role in weapons sales to Iraq .
Throughout the 1980s , the two countries were at war with each other .
An affidavit submitted by Howard Teicher , a former National Security Council member under Reagan , names Gates as one of those involved in approving the sale of chemical weapons precursors and cluster bombs to Saddam Hussein .
Gates has also been accused of “ politicizing ” intelligence while at the CIA — that is , manufacturing intelligence to justify US policy .
In particular , he has been accused of helping to concoct a supposed Soviet plot to assassinate the Pope in 1981 in order to push for a harder line against the Soviet Union .
The confirmation hearings for Gates are scheduled to begin next week , but leading Democrats have already indicated that he will be easily confirmed .
Earlier this month , the incoming Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , said he hoped that Gates would be confirmed “ as soon as possible . ”
“ The one thing he has going for him ... is that we want the change to take place very quickly , ” Reid said .
Before Gates was nominated as defense secretary , he was part of the Iraq Study Group , which consists of top strategists and former officials from both the Democratic and Republican parties .
The group , led by Republican James Baker and Democrat Lee Hamilton , is expected to issue recommendations next month , which are said to include initiating talks with Iran and Syria .
The Democratic Party as a whole is lining up behind the Iraq Study Group .
The White House , meanwhile , has announced the formation of its own study group .
Editor ’s Note :
This week ’s Clarion Call features a guest commentary by Lowell Gallaway .
He is an emeritus professor of economics at Ohio University .
Gallaway discusses the impact of a Supreme Court decision 35 years ago and the current emphasis on obtaining academic credentials .
In the mid-nineteenth century , the French economist Frederic Bastiat distinguished between good and bad economists by focusing on whether they thought through the long - run consequences of their arguments .
According to Bastiat , a good economist was not blinded by the possible short - run gains to be attained by pursuing a certain course of action , but asked the question , “ What will be the long - run consequences of doing that ? ”
Bastiat was saying that the good economist worries about what we today call unintended consequences , whereas the bad economist considers only the immediate and visible consequences .
While Bastiat ’s point was couched in terms of economists , his analysis could be applied just as well to anyone in position to make public policy decisions , including judges who can make law through their decisions in cases .
( Judges often say that they are simply “ interpreting ” the law when they ’re actually creating it . )
A classic case of this phenomenon was the Supreme Court ’s 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Company ( 401 U.S. 424 ) .
That decision rendered the use of ability testing by employers to select the most capable applicants for jobs a minefield of possible litigation .
The Court ’s decision proceeded from an unstated premise that cognitive ability testing by employers to evaluate possible employees was of the same ilk as literacy tests that had often in the past been used to disenfranchise minority voters .
In the words of the Court ’s unanimous opinion , ability tests “ operate as built - in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability . ”
The upshot of the Griggs decision was to place employers in the position of being presumed guilty of job discrimination if they used ability tests to screen applicants , unless they could prove themselves innocent by showing that the pre-employment test they used had a manifest relationship to the performance of the job in question .
In the Supreme Court ’s view , since cognitive ability tests appeared to have a more adverse impact on minority workers than on others , their use was presumptively discriminatory .
Duke Power had also established a requirement that applicants for most jobs had to have a high school diploma .
The Court also ruled that this requirement was illegal unless the employer could prove that having finished high school was necessary to the work .
The Court ’s intent in Griggs was to eliminate job market screening mechanisms used by employers to sort out job applicants , where there was a “ disparate impact ” on minority workers .
However , it is one thing for a court to rule against a practice and quite another to actually bring about its demise .
Confronted with the Griggs decision , employers could adapt in various ways .
One would be to attempt to construct tests that would satisfy the Court ’s demand that any test should be both valid and clearly related to the performance of the job in question .
The trouble with that option is that it would be costly to devise such tests and even if the business thought it had come up with them , there was still the risk of being dragged into court if a disappointed job applicant sued .
It costs a lot of money even if you win a court case , and there is always the possibility that a judge will rule the tests to be not good enough .
So what else could employers do ?
One approach would be to turn to an alternative indicator of ability .
While the Court would not accept an overt requirement for a high school diploma , nothing in Griggs prevents potential employees from including their educational accomplishments in their resumes .
And nothing prevents employers from reading those resumes .
Thus , employers could behave as if they were imposing an educational requirement without formally doing so .
That strategy also has its difficulties , chiefly that it might still lead to a “ disparate impact ” on the employment of minorities .
A solution would be to have a quota hiring system for minorities and beyond that rely on educational credentials to help sort out job applicants .
In effect , the cost of affirmative action hires is treated as an additional fixed cost of doing business .
It appears that many employers have pursued that strategem .
What are its consequences ?
The answer depends on how individuals seeking employment behave .
Would they become aware that employers were still quietly using education credentials ?
Would they observe that others with whom they were competing had greater success if they had impressive educational certificates ?
Given the abundance of publicity emphasizing the positive association of levels of education with employment success , it seems highly likely that they would become so aware .
At least , there would develop a widespread belief that it is in each individual ’s interest to acquire educational credentials – and the higher the better .
That belief has been reinforced by a number of factors , particularly at the college level .
Higher education spokesmen talk constantly about how they raise their students ’ “ investment in human capital . ”
Politicians often speak about the supposed importance of education in stimulating economic growth .
Students ( perhaps the wisest of all ) seem to know that institutions of higher learning have become the gatekeepers to much of the nation ’s job market .
Higher education ’s response to its acquiring the role of gatekeeper of much of the job market is a story in itself .
It has behaved in a way that is suggestive of massive monopolistic imperfections in the market for its product .
Confronted with a significant increase in demand for its services ( due at least in part to Griggs ) , it has engaged in overt price discrimination against students and their parents .
Assisted by certain government rules , they carefully estimate the maximum amount a student ’s family can pay in determining tuition charges .
Discounts in the form of scholarships and work - study jobs are given to those who are thought unable to pay the full amount .
By this method , colleges and universities are attempting to capture as much as they can of what economists call the consumer surplus that occurs in market transactions .
If the Supreme Court had not inveighed against the use of ability tests by employers , it ’s doubtful that they would have come to rely so greatly on educational credentials as a surrogate for ability .
That has driven up the demand for – and price of – a college education .
It has also closed off many jobs and careers to people who ca n’t or do n’t get their educational credentials .
The profusion of “ degree mills ” that sell diplomas in exchange for money and little or no true academic work is another consequence .
Under the old regime of ability testing , which probably did a better job of identifying workers with the desired abilities , people did n’t need to spend years of their lives and huge amounts of money just to obtain a piece of paper .
Griggs played a major role in catalyzing the current mania for educational credentials .
Oddly enough , there have n’t been any legal challenges to employers who use college degrees as a screening device just the way Duke Power used the high school diploma .
Under the Court ’s reasoning , it would seem that a person ruled out of consideration for an entry - level job in hotel management , e.g. , because the employer insists on college graduates , would have a strong case .
For many jobs , a college degree is no more essential to the ability to do the work than was the high school diploma in Griggs .
When the Supreme Court decided Griggs , it undoubtedly was not thinking about the long - run consequences .
It was “ interpreting ” the 1964 Civil Rights
Act in a way it thought would be beneficial , but it has had serious unintended consequences .
If Bastiat were still alive , he would nod ruefully .
Drawing on advances in robotics and computer technology , Johns Hopkins University researchers are designing new high - tech medical tools to equip the operating room of the future .
These systems and instruments could someday help doctors treat patients more safely and effectively and allow them to perform surgical tasks that are nearly impossible today .
The tools include a snakelike robot that could enable surgeons , operating in the narrow throat region , to make incisions and tie sutures with greater dexterity and precision .
Another robot , the steady - hand , may curb a surgeon 's natural tremor and allow the doctor to inject drugs into tiny blood vessels in the eye , dissolving clots that can damage vision .
These and other projects are being built by teams in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Computer - Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology , based at Johns Hopkins .
Launched in 1998 with funding from the NSF , the center aims to transform and improve the way many medical procedures are performed .
Working closely with physicians from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , the center 's engineers and computer scientists are building robotic assistants intended to enhance a surgeon 's skills .
They are devising detailed visual displays to guide a doctor before and during a difficult medical procedure and planning digital workstations that would give the physician instant access to an enormous amount of medical information about the patient .
Because most of the new medical tools are linked to computers , their work can easily be recorded .
Later , these records would be checked against data describing how well a patient responded to the treatment .
From this review , doctors could learn which techniques and procedures were most effective .
" We could produce the equivalent of a flight - data recorder for the operating room , " said Russell H. Taylor , a professor of computer science and director of the center .
The emphasis is on futuristic technology , but " we 're not trying to replace or automate surgeons , " Taylor insists .
" We want to work in partnership with surgeons to help them do their work more effectively .
Human hands are remarkable , but they have limitations .
There are times when it would be useful to have a ' third hand , ' and we can provide that .
Sometimes a surgeon 's fingers are too large to work in a small confined space within the body .
We can help by building tools that act like unhumanly small and highly dexterous hands . "
One promising example is the team 's snakelike robot .
Currently , a doctor performing throat surgery must insert and manually manipulate long inflexible tools and a camera into this narrow passageway .
The snakelike robot would provide an alternative .
It could enter the throat with two thin rods tipped with tentaclelike tools capable of moving with six degrees of freedom .
If directed , the tools can bend easily into an S - curve .
During surgery , a doctor would sit at a robotic workstation and peer into eyepieces that display a three - dimensional view of the operating site .
The doctor would then maneuver the controls to guide the movement of the robot .
The prototype is made of nonmagnetic metals so that it can be used safely near magnetic imaging equipment .
The tools ' movements are nimble because sophisticated software can make up to 100 adjustments per second .
The steady - hand system , also devised by a Johns Hopkins team , was built to help with another challenging task : microsurgery .
At this scale , even the best surgeons display some tremor in their hands .
Yet the slightest uncontrolled movements can be troublesome during surgery on microscopic structures , such as tiny blood vessels in the eye .
To address this problem , the steady - hand robot can grasp a needle and move it carefully in tandem with the surgeon in a technique called cooperative manipulation .
In tests of the device , the researchers have successfully injected a liquid into a chicken embryo's blood vessels , resembling structures in the human eye .
" The steady - hand could allow a surgeon to make very precise and accurate micro-movements without tremor , " Taylor said .
Before they are used on human patients , both the snakelike robot and the steady - hand system will require perhaps five more years of lab testing and prototype advancement .
Still , Taylor believes both have a good chance of eventually joining more traditional tools in hospital operating rooms .
" What makes this work particularly rewarding , " he said , " is that we have the opportunity to do cutting - edge engineering that can help people in a very direct way . "
Hello from the new owner and curator of the Newton Museum !
The collection will be staying together and I have some plans for the website ... stay tuned for more .
— Walter Smith
Happy New Year from the Newton Museum !
Here are the last two Newton catalogs from 1996 - Newton Solutions 1 and Newton Solutions 2 .
Thanks for visiting , and enjoy !
Update # 1 - 12:30 pm
A report by the country 's most respected news organization , filed by Faux News ' Senior Entertainment Reporter John Ellis , was just posted on the network's web site and described the chaotic scene outside the US Supreme Court
A throng of angry crowds lined up outside the Supreme Court of the United States , demanding that justice be served and given the immense importance of this case , emotions ran high on both sides of the case .
As bleary - eyed lawyers from both sides hurried inside to present their case , I encountered the movie 's co-producer , Joe Lieberman .
Surrounded by placard - waving protesters in Brooks Brothers attire proclaiming him as ' Sore Loserman , ' here 's what he said , " While I am convinced that we won this award fair and square , it seems like a few overseas ballots were indeed late in arriving .
Even so , it is our patriotic duty to have a full and fair recount .
That would be in the best traditions of this country 's legal system . "
Update # 2 - 1:00 pm
The network of choice , CNN , interviewed many amongst the angry mob as well as prominent players involved in this landmark case .
Here are a few choice quotes
" Not only was this award stolen , my client , Exxon , has determined that Global Warming is the worst hoax perpretated by anyone on the patriotic citizens of this country .
This will not stand . "
- Senior Spokesman for Exxon , Jim Baker .
" It 's California , California , California . " - NBC Senior Entertainment and News Analyst , Tim Russert .
" There is no way we could determine the legitimacy of these overseas ballots .
I mean , how can we determine the intent of the overseas voter .
They are foreigners , after all . " - Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court , Sandra Day 'O Connor .
" But Justice O'Connor , the bylaws of the Academy of Motion Pictures , Arts , and Sciences have in them a provision to discern the intent of the voter .
It was inserted precisely for a scenario such as the one we 're confronted with today . "
- David Boies , lead lawyer for Guggenheim , David , Gore et al , responding to Justice O'Connor 's persuasive claim .
" This injustice negates everything that we fought for in the civil rights movement .
This is a modern - day lynching . "
- Jesse Jackson , noted Civil Rights Leader .
Update # 3 - 1:30 pm
As tension builds and the case proceeds inside the hallowed halls of the court , the Entertainment Industry 's bible , The Hotline , had this to say about Al Gore and calls by his supporters not only to to reclaim his award , his legitimate place in history , and run for President of the Academy of Motion Pictures , Arts , and Sciences
The Left 's drama played out on the left coast as Hollywood ( diCaprio , DeGeneres et al ) virtually begged Al Gore to run .
Sure they raised money with Barack and Hillary .
But doubts remain .
Besides , only an Oscar winner can truly be one of them .
( Note how Gore did n't go totally native in his carefully constructed quotes . )

At the base of the human brain there lies a tiny organ called the pituitary gland .
About the size of a pea , this demure little gland produces and secretes a cocktail of hormones into the bloodstream from its bony nook inside the skull , helping the body to govern many internal systems .
The pituitary is perhaps most well - known for its production of the amino acid protein somatotropin , a growth hormone which stimulates cell reproduction and bodily development .
This humble chemical factory typically produces some amount of growth hormone throughout an individual ’s life , though the volume usually drops off precipitously after adolescence .
In spite of its small size , however , misbehaving pituitaries have been known to cause massive consequences for their owners .
One of the more common defects is a benign tumor called an adenoma .
This swelling originates in the pituitary , often producing excessive amounts of one or more of the gland ’s chemical messengers .
Andre the Giant
When such a tumor spills excessive growth hormone into the body , a condition called acromegaly arises .
The effects of acromegaly vary depending on the development stage of the stricken individual .
If the condition arises after the end of natural growth , the victim ’s hands , feet , jaw , forehead , and ribcage will often grow outwards .
But when the tumor arises earlier , in someone who has n’t yet reached full height , a phenomenon called gigantism occurs .
This state causes continuous growth , ultimately leading to an abnormally tall stature in adulthood .
The extremities also grow more than the rest of the body , leading to disproportionately large hands and feet , and a characteristic large - boned face .
The extreme height and distinctive features of gigantism have been irresistible to Hollywood .
Actors Richard Kiel ( “ Jaws ” in James Bond movies ) and Matthew McGrory ( “ Karl the Giant ” in Big Fish ) both had acromegaly .
Even those acromegalics in other professions frequently seem to end up on the big or little screens .
André the Giant and Paul Wright , both professional wrestlers , and Gheorghe Muresan , a basketball player , have all had parts in more than one movie or TV show .
Carel Struycken , who played Lurch in the Addams Family movies , was literally pulled off the street when a woman abandoned her car to run after him and offer him a part in Sergeant Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band .
Unfortunately fame and fortune do n’t offer much protection against the life - threatening effects of acromegaly .
Over time it leads to a host of systemic problems including arthritis , diabetes , and heart disease .
The tumor itself , should it grow too large , can press against the optic nerves and cause blindness .
Untreated acromegalics rarely live past middle - age .
Early treatment could avoid most of these problems , but early diagnosis , let alone treatment , is hard to come by .
Most people go for years⁠ — as much as a decade or more⁠ — between the onset of symptoms and a diagnosis .
The wedding of Charles Sherwood Stratton ( General Tom Thumb ) and Lavinia Warren
Even someone as drastically affected as André the Giant did n’t receive a diagnosis of acromegaly until well into his pro-wrestling career , and after much damage had already been done .
His death in 1993 was directly attributable to his disease .
While an adenoma can result in a surplus of growth hormone , there are some conditions which can result in just the opposite .
Certain brain diseases , tumors , and trauma can cause the pituitary gland to reduce its output , which causes a host of ill effects .
Most cases of growth hormone deficiency appear in adults , causing reduced bone and muscle mass , increased body fat , and some impaired brain functions .
However , when this condition occurs in a child , the shortage of growth hormone usually leads to pituitary dwarfism , resulting in an abnormally short stature with normal body proportions .
Perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the pituitary ’s power occurred in a man named Adam Rainer .
Born in Austria in 1899 , Adam experienced abbreviated growth during his childhood , and it soon became apparent that he was destined to be a very short man .
At age twenty - one he stood only 3 ′ 10.5 ″ tall .
One can only imagine that by that age Adam had come to terms with his fate , accepting that he would live out his life as a dwarf .
But he was mistaken .
In his early twenties , little Adam Rainer began to grow at an astonishing rate .
It seems that his malfunctioning pituitary had gone from producing too little growth hormone to producing far too much , and over the next eleven years he grew an average of 3.6 inches per year .
By the time he was thirty - two Adam Rainer stood at just under 7 ′ 2 ″ ⁠— a giant by some estimations ⁠ — and it was at about that time that he lost the ability to stand on his own .
The strain of such massive growth left him bed - ridden , and though his rate of growth did decrease , it did not stop .
By the time Adam died at age fifty - one , he had gained another six inches , leaving him at 7 ′ 8 ″ tall .
He was the only man in history to be classified as both a dwarf and a giant .
Today , treatment for pituitary problems is readily available , though the gradual onset of symptoms frequently leads to late diagnosis , which in turn decreases the effectiveness of treatment .
Carel Struycken
Surgical measures for gigantism have been available since Dr. Julius von Hochenegg successfully pioneered a method in 1908 where he accessed the pituitary by punching through the back of the nose , an approach still favored by surgeons today .
A handful of drugs can also be used to alleviate the problems of excessive growth hormone and to try to shrink the tumor , though their track record is not wonderful .
Pituitary dwarfism can be successfully treated by simply administering synthetic growth hormones , assuming it is diagnosed before skeletal development is complete .
The most astonishing thing of all may be that this entire set of dramatic symptoms is the result of a deficit or surplus of one single hormone .
The pea-sized pituitary produces half a dozen distinct hormones , each of which triggers a unique set of problems should the pituitary be compromised .
Acromegaly and dwarfism are but two of a plethora of potential problems .
Sometimes small things can be very important indeed .
Samsung has partnered with Korea University to develop a machine - gun equipped sentry robot , which consists of “ two cameras : one for day - time and one for infrared night vision , zooming capabilities , a speaker for notifying the intruder , sophisticated pattern recognition to detect the difference between humans / trees , and a 5.5 mm machine - gun . ” … are expected to sell for $ 200,00 USD and will be available late in 2007 .
The South Korean government plans to deploy these friendly reminders on the border between South and North Korea , to further ease relations between the countries

TONIGHT ’S
Oscars will be awarded , most likely , in the usual atmosphere of solemn self - congratulation and decorous chest - thumping .
But for all the outward celebration , the truth is that the industry is in a state of ongoing disquiet .
It is hardly news that for years now the American motion picture industry has been in a slow downward spiral .
Though by some accounts attendance was slightly up in 2006 over the previous year , the box - office tracking firm Exhibitors Relations reported that attendance actually declined yet again , reaching its lowest point in 10 years .
And though defenders of the industry protest that foreign markets account for 40 % of a film ’s revenue and that those proceeds are compensating for falling domestic box office , foreign receipts have been down too , and even DVD sales are plateauing .
In short , the overall trends remain discouraging .
Even more worrisome than what could be just a cyclical dip is how people are regarding motion pictures and the moviegoing experience .
A recent Zogby survey found that 45 % of American moviegoers had decreased their attendance over the last five years , with the highest percentage of that decrease in the coveted 18 - to 24 - year - old bracket ; at the same time , 21 % of respondents said they never went to the movies .
The two most - cited reasons for seeing fewer movies were rising ticket prices and the quality of the films ( a perpetual culprit ) .
Another survey , this one conducted by PA Consulting for the Motion Picture Assn. of America , reached an even more chilling conclusion .
Eighty - three percent of its respondents said they were satisfied with the content of the films they saw , but 60 % nevertheless expected to spend less of their income on moviegoing in the future , citing dissatisfaction with the moviegoing experience and the emergence of better alternatives for their time and money .
By this reckoning , no matter how much films may improve , their prospects are not likely to — which suggests that something has fundamentally changed in our relationship to the movies .
The long , long romance may finally be losing its bloom , and that is why Hollywood should be concerned .
What is happening may be a matter of metaphysics .
Virtually from their inception , the movies have been America ’s primary popular art , the “ Democratic Art , ” as they were once called , managing to strike the American nerve continuously for decades .
During the 1920s , nearly the entire population of the country attended the movies weekly , but even when attendance sank in the 1950s under the assault of television and the industry was virtually on life support , the movies still managed to occupy the center of American life .
Movie stars have been our brightest icons .
A big movie like “ The Godfather , ” “ Titanic ” or “ Lord of the Rings ” entered the national conversation and changed the national consciousness .
Movies were the barometers of the American psyche .
More than any other form , they defined us , and to this day , the rest of the world knows us as much for our films as for any other export .
Today , movies just do n’t seem to matter in the same way — not to the general public and not to the high culture either , where a Pauline Kael review in the New Yorker could once ignite an intellectual firestorm .
There are n’t any firestorms now , and there is no director who seems to have his finger on the national pulse the way that Steven Spielberg or George Lucas did in the 1970s and 1980s .
People do n’t talk about movies the way they once did .
It would seem absurd to say , as Kael once did , that she knew whether she would like someone by the films he or she liked .
Once at the center , movies increasingly sit on the cultural margins .
This is both a symptom and a cause of their distress .
Two years ago , writing in these pages , I described an ever - growing culture of knowingness , especially among young people , in which being regarded as part of an informational elite — an elite that knew which celebrities were dating each other , which had had plastic surgery , who was in rehab , etc. — was more gratifying than the conventional pleasures of moviegoing .
In this culture , the intrinsic value of a movie , or of most conventional entertainments , has diminished .
Their job now is essentially to provide stars for People , Us , “ Entertainment Tonight ” and the supermarket tabloids , which exhibit the new “ movies ” — the stars ’ life sagas .
Traditional movies have a very difficult time competing against these real - life stories , whether it is the shenanigans of TomKat or Brangelina , Anna Nicole Smith ’s death or Britney Spears ’ latest breakdown .
These are the features that now dominate water - cooler chat .
There may have been a time when these stories generated publicity for the movies .
Now , however , the movies are more likely to generate publicity for the stories , which have a life , and an entertainment value , of their own
But in the two years since , another phenomenon has battered the motion picture industry , attacking one of the very fundamentals of moviegoing : the movies ’ communal appeal .
Before demographics became the marketing mantra , the movies were the art of the middle .
They provided a common experience and language — a sense of unity .
In the dark we were one .
Now , however , when people prefer to identify themselves as members of ever - smaller cohorts — ethnic , political , demographic , regional , religious — the movies can no longer be the art of the middle .
The industry itself has been contributing to this process for years by targeting its films more narrowly , especially to younger viewers .
In effect , the conservative impulse of our politics that has promoted the individual rather than the community has helped undermine movies ’ communitarian appeal .
All of this has been hastened by the fact that there is now an instrument to take advantage of the social stratifications .
To the extent that the Internet is a niche machine , dividing its users into tiny , self - defined categories , it is providing a challenge to the movies that not even television did , because the Internet addresses a change in consciousness while television simply addressed a change in delivery of content .
Television never questioned the very nature of conventional entertainment .
The Internet , on the other hand , not only creates niche communities — of young people , beer aficionados , news junkies , Britney Spears fanatics — that seem to obviate the need for the larger community , it plays to another powerful force in modern America and one that also undermines the movies : narcissism .
It is certainly no secret that so much of modern media is dedicated to empowering audiences that no longer want to be passive .
Already , video games generate more income than movies by centralizing the user and turning him into the protagonist .
Popular websites such as Facebook , MySpace and YouTube , in which the user is effectively made into a star and in which content is democratized , get far more hits than movies get audiences .
MySpace has more than 100 million users worldwide , and Fortune magazine reported that 54 million of them spend , on average , 124 minutes on the site for each visit , while 11.6 million users spend 72 minutes a visit on Facebook .
YouTube ’s most popular videos attract more than 40 million hits , which is substantially larger than the audience for all but a very , very few movies .
But these sites are arguably not only diverting viewers who might be attending the movies , they are replacing one of the movies ’ functions :
If stars ’ lives are superseding movie narratives , audiences are superseding the stars .
Who needs Brad Pitt if you can be your own hero on a video game , make your own video on YouTube or feature yourself on Facebook ?
The promise of an alternative life — the vicarious thrill of escape — has always been one of the movies ’ greatest blandishments .
In the theater we could all imagine ourselves to be Cary Grant or Bette Davis .
Now with avatars — essentially masks that one can use to represent oneself on the Internet — anyone can be Cary Grant or Bette Davis without having to imagine it .
In effect , we have become our own movies .
Film no doubt will withstand these assaults .
The industry , with its synergies , will probably find a way to profit from stars ’ lives and from our own star - like lives .
But it is much more difficult to survive a change in consciousness than a change in taste or technology , and that is what the movies face now — a challenge to the basic psychological satisfactions that the movies have traditionally provided .
Where the movies once supplied plots , there are alternative plots everywhere .
Where the movies once supplied community , there is less hunger for it .
And though we still love the frisson that stars provide , we like our own frisson too .
How the movies cope with these threats will go some way toward determining whether they remain vital or will be usurped .
But the problem for the industry , even on its biggest night , is that the answer is likely to lie less in the executives ’ hands than in our heads .
I could n’t imagine a better statement about the right to keep and bear arms coming from any court in this land ( emphasis mine ) :
To summarize , we conclude that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms .
That right existed prior to the formation of the new government under the Constitution and was premised on the private use of arms for activities such as hunting and self - defense , the latter being understood as resistance to either private lawlessness or the depredations of a tyrannical government ( or a threat from abroad ) .
In addition , the right to keep and bear arms had the important and salutary civic purpose of helping to preserve the citizen militia .
The civic purpose was also a political expedient for the Federalists in the First Congress as it served , in part , to placate their Antifederalist opponents .
The individual right facilitated militia service by ensuring that citizens would not be barred from keeping the arms they would need when called forth for militia duty .
Despite the importance of the Second Amendment ’s civic purpose , however , the activities it protects are not limited to militia service , nor is an individual ’s enjoyment of the right contingent upon his or her continued or intermittent enrollment in the militia .
Clothing and toys are manufactured overseas .
So why not make software there too , where labor is cheaper ?
Many U.S. technology companies have outsourced their software development to India .
Last year Hewlett - Packard became India ’s largest multinational IT employer , with more than 10,000 employees .
The enthusiasm for overseas outsourcing and offshoring , mirrors the enthusiasm for Internet companies in the Nineties .
In a recent article , Ravi Chiruvolu , a partner at Charter Venture Capital wrote that “ Venture Capitalists decided that because of cheap engineering talent in countries like India it would be more cost effective to outsource software development .
If Nike could outsource sneaker manufacturing , we could do the same with code . ”
Following similar logic , Oracle has announced it will more than double the number of software engineers it employs in India to 6,000 .
Although the offshoring trend has resulted in a net transfer of jobs outside of the US , this article is n’t about job losses in the United States .
We live in a global economy and people in India deserve jobs as much as people in the United States or anywhere else .
It ’s worrisome when companies are criticized solely because they have hired people overseas .
Offshoring is a mistake when technology companies confuse operational effectiveness and strategy .
Operational effectiveness is about working cheaper or faster .
Strategy is about the creation of a long - term competitive advantage , which for technology companies is usually the ability to create innovative software .
Outsourcing programmers works when the software developed is n’t a key part of the pipeline of innovation for products a company actually sells .
For example , when website design or back - office software such as payroll or inventory control is outsourced , that can be good because it improves operational effectiveness .
But writing innovative software cannot be done on an assembly line .
It requires hard - to - find development and design skills .
Farming out development to legions of programmers overseas will not create a differentiation advantage .
When a technology company outsources software development , that company loses its capacity to innovate and its competitive advantage .
Why Some Software Companies are Confusing the Box for the Chocolates
Recently , I bought some chocolates as a gift for some friends from a specialty shop .
These chocolates are remarkable .
Owner Jean - Marc
Gorce makes them by - hand and his small shop has been rated as one of the top ten in the United States .
In addition to being a chef , Jean - Marc is also an entrepreneur and an innovator .
Jean - Marc recently started selling his chocolates in gold and blue boxes .
I told him I liked the new boxes .
He explained that his wife designed the boxes and he found a company in the Philippines that could produce the boxes in the small volume they needed for a good price .
Jean - Marc ’s gold and blue boxes are an example of successful outsourcing .
Jean - Marc sells chocolates , not boxes .
The design and production of chocolates is his core competency .
Jean - Marc can outsource box production to improve his operational efficiency without sacrificing his reputation as a maker of superlative chocolates .
While outsourcing boxes improves chocolatier Jean - Marc ’s operational effectiveness , he would never consider outsourcing chocolate production because he would lose his core differentiation advantage .
Yet , in their enthusiasm for cost savings , several US technology companies have done precisely that – outsourcing their core technology and key strategic differentiator .
Design and Assembly are Different
This is n’t the first time companies have tried to commoditize software development .
In the eighties , Japanese companies unsuccessfully attempted to set up software factories to manufacture programs .
They discovered that just throwing a lot of programmers together does n’t create innovative software .
Unlike software , it makes sense to outsource the manufacture of clothing and toys .
Most of the cost of clothing and toy manufacturing is in the assembly , not the design .
Those products can still be designed close to corporate headquarters but assembled elsewhere to keep costs low .
Programming is like design and nearly all of the costs of creating software come from writing the program , not the assembly .
The assembly stage for software is really just copying the final program onto a disk and enclosing it with a manual in a box .
Harvard Business School ’s Michael Porter , a world expert on strategy and competitive advantage , nicely summarized the problem with competing solely on operational effectiveness :
“ If all you ’re trying to do is essentially the same thing as your rivals , then it ’s unlikely that you ’ll be very successful .
It ’s incredibly arrogant for a company to believe that it can deliver the same sort of product that its rivals do and actually do better for very long .
That ’s especially true today , when the flow of information and capital is incredibly fast .
It ’s extremely dangerous to bet on the incompetence of your competitors — and that ’s what you ’re doing when you ’re competing on operational effectiveness . ”
Ultimately , the offshoring fad is bad for companies not because of the short - term programmer layoffs but because technology companies will lose their capacity to innovate .
Tech companies that outsource their programming talent will ultimately be replaced by competition , and then everyone will be losing their jobs .
Artist 's impression : A " lesser " Pluto with its small moon Charon
If you have been " plutoed " you have been demoted or devalued , just as happened to the former planet Pluto when its status was downgraded .
A " climate canary " is something whose poor health indicates a looming environmental catastrophe .
This is the 17th time ADS members have voted to choose a word of the year .
" It was good that the society focused on a genuine scientific concern , though I believe the nomination came in from outer space , " said committee chairman Professor Wayne Glowka .
Racial slur
The General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union decided last year that Pluto did not meet its new definition of a planet and would be categorised as a dwarf planet instead .
Other words in the running were :
flog - an advertisement disguised as a blog or web log
prohibited liquids - " fluids that cannot be transported by passengers on airplanes "
macaca - " an American citizen treated as an alien "
Macaca is considered by some to be a racial slur .
Former Senator George Allen had a comfortable lead in the polls ahead of last November 's Congressional elections when he referred to the son of Indian immigrants as a macaca .
Mr Allen lost to Democrat Jim Webb .
Members of the 117 - year - old ADS include academics , writers , editors and linguists .
The society says its vote is for fun only and they do not act in any official capacity of introducing words into the English language .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 9 - The United States said Friday that it would continue to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to " a very small , limited number " of prisoners who are held in secret around the world , saying they are terrorists being kept incommunicado for reasons of national security and are not guaranteed any rights under the Geneva Conventions .
Adam Ereli , the State Department 's deputy spokesman , said the United States would not alter its position after the president of the International Red Cross said in Geneva that his organization was holding discussions to gain access to all detainees , including those held in secret locations .
Mr. Ereli said that the Geneva Conventions requiring humane treatment of prisoners of war did not apply to certain terrorism suspects seized as " unlawful enemy combatants , " but that , in any case , the United States treats most of them as prisoners of war .
" We 're going the extra mile here , " Mr. Ereli said , by allowing the Red Cross access to Al Qaeda suspects and others held at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and in Afghanistan .
The Red Cross also has access to prisoners held in Iraq .
The T - shirt featuring President Bush could offend , Qantas says
Allen Jasson said he was sticking up for the principle of free speech by challenging the decision by the Australian flag carrier .
Mr Jasson was stopped as he was about to board the flight from Melbourne to London last Friday .
Qantas said the T - shirt had potential to offend other passengers .
The T - shift features an image of President George W Bush , along with the slogan " World 's Number One Terrorist " .
' Principle '
The 55 - year - old computer specialist , who lives in London , had encountered difficulties with the same T - shirt on an earlier Qantas flight in December .
After clearing the international security checks at Melbourne Airport , he reportedly approached the gate manager to congratulate him on the company 's new - found open - mindedness .
At that point , Mr Jasson was ordered to remove the T - shirt after being told it was a security threat and an item which might cause offence to other passengers .
He was offered the chance to board the flight wearing different clothing , but refused .
" I am not prepared to go without the t- shirt .
I might forfeit the fare , but I have made up my mind that I would rather stand up for the principle of free speech , " he told Australian media .
A Qantas spokesman defended the airline 's decision , saying : " Whether made verbally or on a T - shirt , comments with the potential to offend other customers or threaten the security of a Qantas group aircraft will not be tolerated " .
AMERICA is the home of the efficient - market hypothesis , which says financial markets have become so keenly contested that it is impossible for investors to keep beating them .
Yet the very universities that peddle this theory so confidently also gleefully undermine it by doing precisely that : over one year and over ten , their endowment funds beat the S&P 500 and hammer most other institutional investors , including pension funds .
The final figures for the most recent fiscal year will be out next week .
But according to preliminary numbers from the National Association of College and University Business Officers ( NACUBO ) and TIAA - CREF , a financial - services group , university endowments made an average return of 10.7 % in the year to June 30th 2006 , net of fees and expenses .
The biggest endowments are big investors : between them , Harvard and Yale have some $ 50 billion , around one - seventh of the total .
They tend to do better than their smaller peers and pretty much everyone else .
Indeed , these eggheads even beat the quants .
Endowments larger than $ 1 billion returned 15.2 % on average last year , more than the main hedge - fund index ( see chart ) .
The best - performing endowment in 2005 - 06 , which belonged to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , gained a handsome 23 % .
That put it a whisker ahead of Yale 's ( 22.9 % ) , run for more than 20 years by David Swensen .
Endowment managers would no doubt like to claim this is all down to skill .
But they do enjoy certain advantages over their rivals .
In principle , their investment horizon lasts not weeks , months or years , but forever .
Their capital is extremely patient .
Each endowment has a single client — itself — that needs to extract only a small sum annually to keep the wheels of scholarship turning .
Therefore , unlike pension funds , they do not have to fret about matching assets with liabilities .
This means endowments can tolerate lots of volatility , which in turn allows them to make , and stick to , contrarian bets .
They have been “ incredibly gutsy ” in going against the grain , says Will Wechsler of Greenwich Associates , a financial - services consultancy .
Perhaps they can stay solvent longer than the market can stay irrational .
A second advantage is the university environment .
“ Whereas pension trustees are naturally risk - averse , universities are all about innovating , financially as well as intellectually , ” says James Walsh , who runs Cornell 's $ 5 billion endowment .
Investment constraints are kept to a minimum .
Alumni with Wall Street experience are encouraged not only to donate money but also to sit on investment committees .
Many are happy to oblige .
“ This gives us access to minds we could n't otherwise afford , ” says Mr Walsh .
The brainpower on tap at the university itself is not always as useful .
According to one former Harvard official , its endowment fund has done so well because it has avoided taking advice from the economics faculty .
Put these factors together , says Mohamed El - Erian , Harvard 's endowment chief , and you have a recipe for “ thinking more boldly than the pack ” .
America 's endowments were among the first to look beyond the staid mix of domestic equities , bonds and cash .
The idea they helped develop in the 1970s and 1980s — deemed eccentric at the time — was to break the portfolio into a mix of standard and “ alternative ” assets , as uncorrelated with each other as possible so as to spread risk .
This strategy is sometimes referred to as “ portable alpha ” .
Their early moves into hedge funds , venture capital , private equity , property , distressed debt and the like brought outsized profits .
Universities and foundations have also benefited from geographical diversification , especially into emerging markets .
Foreign equity was their best - performing asset class last year , making 24.7 % according to a survey by the Commonfund Institute , which manages pooled investments .
Endowments have also revolutionised commodities .
By making a killing in “ hard ” assets like timber in recent years , the universities have helped to turn them from industrial assets to financial ones in investors ' eyes .
Harvard keeps three lumberjacks on its team , the joke goes .
Sweating as they swot
Indeed , for university endowments to call all of these assets “ alternative ” is something of a misnomer .
It is assets such as government bonds , once safely in the mainstream , that must fight for their place in university portfolios .
Today the typical large endowment has 41 % of its holdings in assets other than shares , bonds and cash , says NACUBO .
In the past couple of decades , illiquid investments , which are less efficiently priced than liquid ones , have rewarded those brave enough to buy them .
Thus big , bold endowments have thrived by resisting what John Maynard Keynes — a proponent of asset diversification — called the “ fetish of liquidity ” .
Will university endowments continue to defy the ivory - tower theorists ?
Don Fehrs , head of research at Evanston Capital Management , a hedge fund — and a former head of Cornell 's endowment — thinks it is becoming harder for them to maintain their advantage because , predictably , copycat investors have piled into areas they once had largely to themselves .
The biggest endowments now employ dozens of bright sparks to look for promising new pastures .
Some have even sent scouts to developing countries .
Others are hoping to stay ahead by handing large sums to bright but untried managers .
They are spending less time on broad asset allocation , and more on trying to pick winners within each class .
This is a trickier exercise , but they may have no choice .
Simply putting 20 % into hedge funds is no longer enough .
The big test of their prowess will come when lax credit conditions tighten .
John Griswold of Commonfund thinks that some investment committees , stuffed with alumni , may be starting to lose track of the risks their endowments are taking .
All endowments are finding it harder to hold on to their best people .
Although a few high - fliers , such as Mr Swensen , are content to forgo the vast salaries they could earn at private firms — top endowment chiefs rarely get more than $ 2 m a year — many have been tempted away as portable alpha of a different kind .
Harvard , Stanford , Cornell and Duke have all lost their bosses over the past year and a half .
After 15 years in the job , Harvard 's Jack Meyer tired of the hostility students and professors showed towards his highly paid ( and highly successful ) managers .
He quit and set up a hedge fund , taking more than 30 of his colleagues with him .
Stanford 's Michael McCaffery left after failing to persuade the university to let him manage private money alongside the endowment .
These defections have left quite a few vacancies at the top .
Nevertheless , the endowment model continues to win plaudits — and to attract imitators abroad .
As Japan loosens its investment rules , its university presidents are said to be looking very closely at the “ Yale model ” .
In Britain , Cambridge University has persuaded Mr Swensen to sit on the committee overseeing its £ 1.2 billion ( $ 2.35 billion ) central endowment .
Despite the resistance of otherworldly dons , it recently became the first British university to hire a City financier to run its fund .
The university 's vice - chancellor , Alison Richard , was previously provost of Yale , where she gained a “ powerful understanding ” of what a well run endowment can do .
Profits trumping profs on the banks of the Cam : that really would be an investment coup .

Piracy , The Better Choice
As crazy as this may sound , we ’re heading into a time when it seems like piracy is going to be the better choice compared to legally owning content .
The Inquirer ’s Charlie Demerjian explains why this will be the case in a recent article .
Head on over and read the article .
If you have n’t yet done so , also read a recent paper by Peter Gutmann which I also discussed here to learn about the details of the content protection technology in Windows Vista and the latest PC hardware .
I am never , ever , going to buy HD - DVD content .
Ever .
If I ever buy HD - DVD content I hope I get struck by lightning at the very instant .
And this ofcourse just like the fact that I never bought music from Apple ’s DRM infected iTunes , even though I do own an iPod Nano .
Instead , I ’m just going to rip CD ’s and download MP3 files because that ’s much easier to do for a whole number of reasons , one of which is that I can actually backup my music when and however I want , and can easily use it on almost any device I want , however and whenever I like .
If you read Demerjian ’s article , and Gutmann ’s paper , you ’ll be amazed at how stupid Microsoft and all the people behind these copy protection technologies actually are .
This is going to backfire on them in so many different ways it ’s kind of scary .
It ’s amazing that they actually expect consumers to put up with all of this .
It ’ll be even more amazing if they actually get consumers to put up with it too .
They ’ll probably have short term success with selling this HD - DVD crap to consumers , but on the long run it ’s going to be a lot more difficult as consumers begin realizing they were screwed and experiencing the disadvantages of the copy protection technologies first hand .
Kindof like what seems to be happening to Apple ’s iTunes .
Perhaps now that AACS copy protection technology has been cracked , people might still buy HD - DVD content because they know they ’ll still be able to make copies and remove the restrictions .
But it ’ll still be too much of a hassle and it seems piracy is still going to be the better choice .
I do n’t usually like to make predictions for the new year , but in this case I ’ll make an exception : I predict that traffic at The Pirate Bay is going to increase significantly in 2007 .
So to the crew at The Pirate Bay , if you guys are reading this , make sure you plan ahead for the growth and start preparing some extra servers and bandwidth .
You ’re going to need it .

It is a huge and horrible mistake
Russian skier Olga Pyleva
Pyleva , who faces a police investigation , won silver in the 15 km biathlon on Monday but tested positive for banned stimulant carphedon .
" I was set to retire but I did n't think I 'd finish this way , " said Pyleva , who has been banned for two years by the International Biathlon Union .
" I beg all my fans , my entire country , to forgive me for the incident . "
The 30 - year - old has had a glittering career , winning pursuit gold at the 2002 Olympics .
She was also world champion individual biathlete in 2004 and claimed relay world championship golds in 2000 , 2001 and 2005 .
" I did n't ever wish to put all of my previous achievements and wins in doubt by taking the banned drug , " said Pyleva .
" I want to say that I have never intentionally used any banned substances .
It is a huge and horrible mistake .
" I hope they believe me .
I have always been open .
I have spoken only the truth . "
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) has handed a file with details of Pyleva 's case to an Italian magistrate .
Under the strict Italian anti-doping laws , Pyleva could theoretically face a prison sentence although such an outcome is unlikely .
The IOC says Pyleva will be free to return to Russia , even if criminal charges are bought .
Nikolai Durmanov , the head of Russia 's anti-doping committee , said Pyleva 's plight was the fault of the company who manufactured and marketed the medication she took for a foot injury .
" Pyleva is not the first athlete who has suffered from their marketing policy , " he said .
I was completely sure that the medication was clean
Russia team doctor Nina Vinogradova
" Several other athletes were caught using their drug which contained carphedon .
" We have warned the factory that they were producing doping but they never reacted .
They had even recommended their medication for athletes .
" Now we can only express sorrow for the incident .
Nothing can be done to improve the situation . "
Contrary to statements made on Thursday , which blamed a rogue " unauthorised " doctor for prescribing the medication , Russia team doctor Nina Vinogradova said she had given it to Pyleva in good faith .
" There is not a single word that the medication contains any banned substances in the description that was issued , " said Vinogradova , who is considering suing manufacturers Fatherland Medications .
" I was completely sure that the medication was clean .
" We have always been honest and in the last 20 years none of my athletes have been questioned by any anti-doping committee . "
But a spokesman for the manufacturers said his company was not at fault and would contest any legal action .
" If a criminal case is filed , we have sufficient facts to show our innocence , " said Fatherland Medications strategic planning boss Andrei Belashov .
Nearly 400 drugs tests have been conducted since 31 January , with Pyleva the only athlete to fail .
Anderson Headed To Washington State On Thursday
( KCPW News ) Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson is headed to Washington State later this week to testify in favor of a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush .
Lawmakers there are pushing the measure in hopes of starting impeachment proceedings in Washington , D.C. Anderson says he ’s accepted the invite because he strongly disagrees with many actions taken by the Bush Administration that experts say are illegal and unconstitutional .

Hi there , I 'm Pheras Hilal , a journalist / writer from Venture and JO magazines .
Both magazines are Jordanian publications in English , Venture Magazine is a Business Intelligence Monthly , while JO is a social monthly .
I 'm in charge of developing two tech support sections in both magazines .
I develop a section called " The Cutting Edge " in Venture Magazine , which features hi-tech gadgets and new innovations created by several Electronics giants .
In JO , I 'm in charge of a section called " Tech Support " which basically contains articles about the latest in technology .
In our August issue , I 'm doing a piece in JO about HDTVs , so I would very much appreciate it if you can provide me with high resolution images of some HDTVs and further information on these tvs and also prices .
In Venture , I 'm looking for hi tech gadgets and gizmos to review and write about , so I would appreciate if you can supply with a list of your products attached with high resolution images on a monthly basis .
Please do find the time to meet my requests and get back to my e-mail as I require such information asap .

Regards , Pheras Hilal
Oh , you know we responded ...
You 'd like for us to do your work for you ?
Okay .
Please provide us a monthly stipend of $ 25 k a month in operating expenses and we 'll just write your damn magazine .
I 'm sure as a journalist / writer you 're flush with venture capital .
Or how about you replace those sections of your magazine with high - resolution screen shots of our website with giant , comedy - sized quotation marks around each image .
That would be pretty ' Cutting Edge . '
Joel Johnson P.S. Also , I 'll need a pony with a built - in HDTV .
Save it E - Whitney .
Tell that to your buddies , and I 'm sure you 'll have a great laugh for the day .
God did n't spare me with time on my hands , episodes of Wayne 's World and an internet connection so that I can grow up to be a geek techie as yourself .
I have better things to write about in my life than to waste it all on stupid things plugged to my fucking USB port , hence I asked for your help .
What a loser .
And you keep on dreaming about getting half your annual income from me .
Pheras Hilal
I 'm sure your readers are looking forward to your tech coverage .
It 's obviously something you care a lot about .
Protologism — a neologism that is not yet widely - accepted .
It could be argued that the word itself is a protologism , which makes for some interesting pretzel - symantics .
As compared to a neologism , which enjoys some popularity .
Metaneologism — a true protologism , since I could find no use of it on the Web .
It is the class of words we are defining right now in this paragraph , so my official definition is : a word that describes the class of newly - coined words .
Like protologism , it falls into the class of words it is used to describe , i.e. , metaneologism is a metaneologism ; so are protologism and neologism .
Neologophobophobe — a foreseen smart - ass attempt to mock me by creating a ridiculous protologism , but which I am hereby revealing as the fraud that it is ( so do n't even try it , or I 'll tell everyone you 're a neologophobophile ) .
Blogosphere — used ironically , except not , since everyone knows exactly what it means .
Folksonomy — the spontaneous cooperation of a group of people to organize information into categories ; not to be confused with the protologism , folktsunami — the wave of global usage which swamps the language , leading ultimately to a folksonomy .
Diary - a — the act of passing off self - indulgent journal - style entries as informational weblog entries .
Hyperclink — a URL possessing an obvious mistake .
Linkpimping — shamelessly emailing bloggers with " tips " on link - worthy posts you " discovered " ( i.e. , wrote ) , to boost your Technorati ranking .
Re-coining — the act of adding to or replacing the definition of a neologism whose meaning is , despite its youth , varied and muddy .
Netrosexual — I 'm re-coining this one out of historical necessity .
Its new , protologistic definition is : a person whose corporeal being is so devoid of sexuality that they overcompensate online in horrific and often malicious ways .
Tail - o- vision — the long tail of the coming internet video economy , poised to supplant the dominance of television .
( Can be shortened to tailvision for aesthetic purposes . )
Flickle — the emotional state of a Netflix user who is no longer sure they want to watch the movies they have added to their account , ushering in a frantic session of queue re-ordering .
Goothenasia — the phenomenon of Google attempting to perfect the Web , and instead swallowing and digesting it .
Can also be called , " Grey Google , " after grey goo , the runaway nano - replicator doomsday scenario .
with friends and heard someone scream , " I hate that fucking word ! "
( Probably right after they themselves have just said , " Web 2.0 ” ) .
Hipsters .
That 's why I 've become a proud neologophile .
I hereby challenge the rest of you neologophobes to explore and embrace the rich ecology of made - up words , because otherwise , you 're just living in the past .
Do n't be afraid ; we 'll go at a nice , leisurely pace ...
Let 's look first at words that are used to describe the realm of neologisms itself :
Before we continue , we should consider an important point .
Sometimes rejection of a given neologism is simply the right thing to do , like when marketing dorks start abusing it to sell a product .
This makes " Web 2.0 ” — the most cited Wikipedia entry of 2006 — an interesting case study .
The term was coined in 2004 as the title for a series of tech conferences , and such conferences are little more than marketing bonanzas .
But just because big business co-opts something does n't make it invalid , just as some words that business will never co-opt are never considered valid .
( Example : Synergism . )
OK , with all that out of the way , we can move on to our vocabulary list of neologisms and protologisms .
Study the following thoroughly : See how fun that can be ?
Your turn .
Use these words in a sentence in the comments , or define some of your own .

Recently , the topic of traffic shaping and BitTorrent encryption was once again resurrected , this time by Wired News writer Michael Galore .
In a recent post he explains that encrypting BitTorrent traffic is bad .
But is this really the case ?
The post over at the Wired blog , Monkey Bites concludes that encryption does n’t fool many ISPs , and that it is a poor method of evading traffic shaping ISPs .
I tend to disagree .
First of all , at this point , encryption is the only way to get around ISPs that throttle BitTorrent traffic .
Sure , encrypting BitTorrent traffic is bad from an ISPs perspective , but most BitTorrent users with traffic shaping ISPs have no other choice .
Let ’s take a look at the arguments that are supposed to support the claim that encryption is a bad thing .
Most of these arguments come from a blog post that Bram Cohen , the inventor of the BitTorrent protocol wrote earlier this year .
1 . A massive bi-direction file transfer , even when it ’s encrypted , still looks like a massive bi-directional file transfer to sniffers and shapers .
It does n’t take a lot of deep science for an ISP to deduce that it ’s BitTorrent traffic .
Well , this argument does n’t really explain why you should n’t at least try encryption , if your ISP is throttling BitTorrent traffic .
It says something about the effectiveness of encryption , but from a quick survey among friends that have to face up against packet shaping ISPs , I ’ve learnt that encryption works excellently for most of them .
And are n’t there more massive bi-direction transfers ?
VOIP for instance ?
2. Obfuscation results in incompatibility between encrypting clients and non-encrypting clients .
True , but so does DHT , that was introduced in the official BitTorrent client by Bram Cohen , was implemented in other clients soon afterwards .
You can always allow incoming and outgoing connections to non-encrypted clients ( ensuring compatibility ) as a milder form of encryption .
Even Bram Cohen realized that it ’s not all that bad , because the latest versions of the mainline client now support encryption .
3. Encryption damages any BitTorrent data caching efforts put forth by your ISP .
I have n’t heard of any ISP throttling and caching BitTorrent traffic at the same time .
Caching essentially helps your downloads , so an ISP that ’s caching BitTorrent traffic is not likely to throttle it as well .
4 . By encrypting BitTorrent transfers , you ’re just being hostile towards your ISP .
Not to get all weepy over the poor ISPs , but it will only make them resent you more .
The ISPs are being hostile towards their customers if they start to limit BitTorrent traffic , often even without letting them know .
Sure , encryption is probably not the best solution for both parties , but if my ISP was limiting my BitTorrent download speed to 10 kb /s , they leave me with no other choice .
BitTorrent encryption is currently supported by the following BitTorrent clients , and a detailed article on how to encrypt BitTorrent traffic can be found here .
Clients supporting encryption :
Azureus : Windows – Linux – Mac OSX
Bitcomet : Windows
BitTorrent mainline : Windows – Linux – Mac OSX
KTorrent : Linux
rTorrent : Linux – Mac OSX
uTorrent : Windows
BitTornado ( in v0.3.18 ) : Windows
I encourage ISPs to find better ways to manage the huge amounts of traffic BitTorrent is generating .
Some ISPs may make it look like this is only a bandwidth problem , but in fact it may have more to do with money than most people assume .
External traffic costs ISPs a lot of money .
One possible solution is the Cache Discovery Protocol that was recently implemented in the mainline client .
The “ Cache Discovery Protocol ” allows ISP ’s to detect the most popular torrents , cache the data , and seed it .
ISP ’s like this solution , because it ’s cheaper to use bandwidth within their network than to use external traffic .
But for now I would say : Encrypt !
Have you ever been in a situation where you 've started to receive SPAM on an email address you 've just created ?
How can this be possible if you never gave it to anyone ?
Unfortunately , keeping your address private does not necessarily protect you against spammers anymore .
These guys know how to harvest addresses from a mail server without you even knowing about it .
This technique is known as Directory Harvesting and here 's how it works .
Mr. Johnny Spammer needs to collect some email addresses to send his Vi@gr@ ads to , and he needs them quick .
He decides to code a script that will probe a huge list of SMTP servers for valid addresses using a dictionary of common first and last names .
Since most corporations use the same standards when they create addresses , Mr. Spammer 's script can easily come up with all possible variation of a name , add up the domain at the end , and send a probe containing the newly created address on its way to see if the targetted mail server will return a response .
Let 's say that the script starts probing a mail server for someone named John Doe .
It will try all of these combinations before trying another name : jdoe@ , john.doe@ , johndoe@ , johnd@ , Doe. John@ , etc ...
As you can see , if someone is named John Doe at the targeted domain , the script will probably find out about him .
This vulnerability exists because mail servers usually provide non delivery reports ( NDR ) to senders when they try to reach someone who does n’t exist .
If the attacking computer does not receive any NDR , it means that the address it is trying to reach is an existing one .
Why not disable NDRs then ?
Because :
Suppressing NDRs is not an RFC - compliant practice
Ordinary users will want to know if their mail has n't reached the recipient
What can you do to defeat DHAs ?
On Windows 2003 , you can enable a feature named SMTP Tar Pitting .
This feature has been added to the OS since SP1 , and unfortunately , it cannot be used under Windows 2000 .
" Tar Pitting " your mail server is the act of deliberately adding a delay into SMTP communications that are related to undesirable traffic .
By slowing down these communications , you also reduce the rate at which DHAs are executed , especially when recipient filtering is on .
If your mail server waits 10 seconds before it sends each of its NDRs , can you imagin how long it would take for a spammer to scan 35000 randomly generated addresses ?
ExchangeInbox.com has a nice tutorial about how to enable tar pitting on Windows 2003 .
If you 're administrating an exchange server , I would definitely recommend that you take a look at it .
If you are looking at a more efficient and elegant solution , a company named Postini offers an excellent product to fight DHAs , SMTP attacks and spam ( White paper right here , free registration required ) .
edit :
One of our readers sent us a comment about how you , home users , can prevent your address from being harvested by DHAs .
Just contact your ISP and have them change your user id into a randomized sequence of alphanumeric characters ( ask them to change it to something like e34 jfu98s @ fakeISP.com ) .
This should do the trick !
I know that these kind of addresses are going to be pretty hard to remember , but hey , easy solutions do n't really exist in the IT world !
The latest addition to the body of evidence came last month when Professor Stuart Brody of the University of Paisley published a study showing sex can lower blood pressure .
" We 're not just talking about the immediate effects of having had nice sex .
The beneficial effects could last at least a week , " says Professor Brody .
One theory is that intercourse stimulates a variety of nerves , most notably the " vagas " nerve , which is directly involved in soothing and calming .
But you have to go the whole heterosexual hog .
According to Professor Brody , studies show " penile - vaginal intercourse is the only sexual behaviour consistently associated with better psychological and physiological health " .
Such sex has been linked , in women , to a heightened emotional awareness , possibly because the " love hormone " oxytocin is released .
One study even found that semen is a mood - enhancing ingredient .
Doctors speculate that this is because semen contains several other mood - altering hormones — including testosterone , oestrogen , prolactin and several different prostaglandins — which can pass into the woman 's bloodstream .
This explanation , says Dr David Hicks , sexology specialist and consultant in GU medicine at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield , " is certainly feasible " .
Condom - free sex has its drawbacks , of course : contracting a sexually transmitted disease or becoming pregnant unintentionally .
If you are dogged by the sniffles at this time of year , regular love - ins could work wonders for your immunity — condoms and all .
Psychologists have found that people who have sex once or twice a week have levels of immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) that are up to a third higher than their more restrained peers .
IgA is an antibody that boosts the immune system and is the first line of defence against colds and flu .
The health benefits for middle - aged men are also particularly persuasive .
Recent studies suggest that men who have orgasms twice a week are half as likely to die early as men who orgasm less than once a month .
The more frequently men ejaculate , the less likely they are to develop prostate cancer , and if middle - aged men have sex twice a week or more they also have a lower risk of heart attack .
Much has been made of the slimming and toning effects of a sexual work - out .
In fact , sex probably burns off about the same number of calories per minute as a brisk walk .
" You get all the benefits of exercise , " confirms Dr Hicks .
" This includes the release of endorphins , raised heart rate , moving the muscles and joints . "
You might also look younger .
" Regular sex makes you feel younger as you are more relaxed , satisfied and less stressed , " says Dr Kevan Wylie , consultant andrologist at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital .
" Sex has huge mental benefits , " adds Dr Hicks .
" It 's the outward proof that you are wanted , desired and valued . "
And if you feel sexy , you tend to look it , too .
Sex is not , sadly , a cure - all .
" There is a danger in thinking that we can fix anything by leaping into bed , " says Dr Petra Boynton , a psychologist at University College in London specialising in sex and relationships .
" The fact is you are likely to have a much better sex life if you are healthy and happy , rather than the other way round . "
Still , it can't hurt to try .

Repeal Day
Seventy - three years ago today the 21st amendment to the US Constitution was fully ratified .
If you forgot your history the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment .
I know , do n’t all jump up and down at once .
But a quick Wikipedia check would tell you that ’s when Prohibition ended in the United States .
We all remember that lovely time in American History do n’t we ?
Illegal booze , bathtub gin , rumrunners , speakeasies and people drinking like fish anyway .
Without Prohibition , Organized Crime and the Kennedy family would never have gotten off the ground .
Well Franklin Roosevelt , the martini swilling president at the time , thought Prohibition was complete bullshit .
I know everyone remembers FDR for winning World War II , pulling America out of the Great Depression , blah , blah , blah – but helping end Prohibition should be at the top of his accomplishments list .
His valiant efforts certainly hastened Prohibition ’s demise and made drinking , a cornerstone of American civilization , legal again . �
Some enterprising people want to create a new “ drinking holiday and commemorate December 5th as “ Repeal Day .
Why not ?
I know some of you think St. Patrick ’s Day and Cinco De Mayo ’s got it covered – but give it some thought .
How many forms of pleasure are guaranteed by the Constitution ?
After work , stop by your local drinking establishment and celebrate by having a drink or two .
I know most of you do n’t need an excuse , but try and get into the spirit of the holiday .
If for some reason you can’t drink , pretend like you ’re Jewish on Christmas – eat Chinese and go to the movies .
Or have a root beer .
Hoist� a glass� to toast FDR , tip the cute bartender , and celebrate your freedom !
Of course , do n’t impinge on the freedom of others by turning into a drunken asshole , drinking underage , throwing up in the streets , or driving while intoxicated .
The police still stake a dim view of these activities no matter what day it is !
If you 've ever tasted pesto in Italy you know that the pesto here in the United States just is n't the same .
I received a lesson in how to make pesto from a real Italian grandmother last week and now I understand the difference and what makes this pesto recipe so special .
A Special Pesto
My friend Francesca makes the trip from her small town near the pesto-epicenter of Genoa , Italy to San Francisco once or twice a year - this time ( lucky for us ) she brought her mom and two - year old son Mattia .
Her mom makes a beautiful pesto ( and perfectly light , potato gnocchi to go along with it ) and offered to show me and my friend Jen how it is done .
I have to say , it was a complete game - changer .
If you love pesto , you really have to try this .
Her technique results in an incredibly special pesto .
Chop by hand or blender ?
Most of the pesto you encounter here in the U.S. is different for a few reasons .
First off , most of what you see is made by machine , usually a food processor or hand blender .
This holds true even if it is homemade .
Do n't get me wrong , it usually tastes good , but because the ingredients are n't hand chopped you end up with a texture that is more like like a moist paste and there little to no definition between ingredients .
During my lesson I quickly began to realize chopping all the ingredients by hand and not blending them is key because this prevents the ingredients from becoming a completely homogenized emulsion or paste .
When you dress a pasta with a pesto that has been hand chopped the minuscule flecks of basil will separate from the olive oil in places , you get definition between ingredients , and bright flavors pop in a way they do n't when they 've been blended into one .
Choosing the right basil
Another thing , Genovese pesto is famous in part because it is often made with young , small basil leaves .
For us non-Italians it is easy to find Genovese basil in stores and at farmer 's markets particularly in the summer , but chances are it was n't picked young .
I would n't worry about it too much , simply by hand chopping all your ingredients , you will see a major shift in personality of your pesto .
If you grow your own basil , I 'm envious .
The technique
If you 're serious about making good pesto , using this technique , get a good , sharp ( preferably large , single blade ) mezzaluna , or a good knife - you 'll need it .
Chopping the ingredients will take twenty minutes or so .
Whatever you use to chop , make sure it has a sharp blade or the basil will turn dark .
Once you chop your ingredients , you 'll form them into a cake , pictured above .
You add olive oil to this cake , and it 's magic - below .
How to Store Pesto
Store any pesto you might use in the next day or two , refrigerated , under a thin film of olive oil .
You can also freeze it in snack - sized baggies .
Thaw and toss whatever gnocchi or pasta you like with it .
Let me know if you try this and what you think !
Use your beautiful fresh pesto with this gnocchi recipe .
Or this simple homemade pasta .
Tutto bene !

The idea of an encyclopedia — a compendium of all the best available knowledge — is as tempting as it is flawed .
Truth does not always come in bite - sized chunks .
And the notion of an infinitely elastic internet encyclopedia , always up to date and distilling the collective wisdom of the wired is even more tempting .
When open to all comers , anonymously , the problems are even more glaring .
This week a senior Wikipedia editor , who used the pseudonym Essjay , turned out not to be a professor of religious studies as he claimed , but in fact a 24 - year - old college drop - out .
That has highlighted both the strengths and the failings of the world 's biggest online encyclopedia , which now boasts well over 1.5 m articles .
The “ Encyclopedia Britannica ” , by contrast , has a mere 120,000 .
Essjay ( or Ryan Jordan in real life ) , got away with his pretence because Wikipedians jealously preserve their anonymity .
With most entries , anyone can edit without even logging in ; or they can create an entirely fictitious online identity before doing so .
The effect is rather like an online role - playing game .
Indeed , it is easy to imagine some sad fellow spending the morning pretending to be a polyglot professor on Wikipedia , and then becoming a buxom red -head on “ Second Life ” , a virtual online world , in the afternoon .
That anonymity creates a phoney equality , which puts cranks and experts on the same footing .
The same egalitarian approach starts off by regarding all sources as equal , regardless of merit .
If a peer - reviewed journal says one thing and a non-specialist newspaper report another , the Wikipedia entry is likely solemnly to cite them both , saying that the truth is disputed .
If the cranky believe the latter and the experts the former , the result will be wearisome online editing wars before something approaching the academic mainstream consensus gains the weight it should .
Wikipedia has strengths too , chiefly the resilient power of collective common sense .
It benefits from the volunteer efforts of many thousands of outside contributors and editors .
If one drops out , another fills his place .
People are vigilant on issues that interest them .
When mistakes happen , they are usually resolved quickly .
This correspondent 's modest Wikipedia entry was edited this week by an anonymous contributor who posted a series of entertaining but defamatory remarks ; a mere four minutes later , another user had removed them .
Constant scrutiny and editing means even the worst articles are gradually getting better , while the best ones are kept nicely polished and up to date .
Someone , eventually , will spot even the tiniest error , or tighten a patch of sloppy prose .
Mr Jordan , for all his bragging , seems to have been a scrupulous and effective editor .
The most tiresome contributors do get banned eventually , though they can always log in under a new identity .
Other shortcomings are the subject of earnest internal debate too , such as Wikipedia 's inherent bias towards trivial recent events rather than important historical ones .
That is already changing , slowly , though subjects of interest to northern white computer - literate males are over - covered , while others are laughably neglected .
Wikipedia is the biggest collaborative online encyclopedia , but not the only one .
Citizendium , supposedly launching soon , aims to be like Wikipedia but without anonymity , and with more weight given to recognised experts .
Conservapedia aims to offer a version of the truth untainted by Wikipedia 's liberal secular bias on issues such as evolution .
So how useful is Wikipedia ?
Entries on uncontentious issues — logarithms , for example — are often admirable .
The quality of writing is often a good guide to an entry 's usefulness : inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information .
A regular user soon gets a feel for what to trust .
Those on contentious issues are useful in a different way .
The information may be only roughly balanced .
But the furiously contested entries on , say , “ Armenian genocide ” or “ Scientology ” , and their attached discussion pages , do give the reader a useful idea about the contours of the arguments , and the conflicting sources and approaches .
In short : it would be unwise to rely on Wikipedia as the final word , but it can be an excellent jumping off point .

I read a story about FEMA not allowing Katrina victims to talk to reporters .
That sounded a bit outrageous to me so I asked a friend of mine who works in a position which allows her / him to see what ’s going on across the state of Louisiana to tell me if it was true .
( Sorry , they are not allowed to speak “ on the record ” to the press ! )
Here is her / his unedited response ( with parts taken out which could reveal her / his identity ) :
it is like a prison in the biggest of those camps …. we went to do XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX the cops were running license plates and then at 5 am doing sweeps of homes claiming to look for a child molester and instead waking them up at 5 am , entering their homes and then rounding up folks with any outstanding warrants of any kind , traffic violations , whatever , so we went a few times to meetings of the internally organized people ’s council to explain that you just dont ’ have to let the cops into your trailers , your trailers are your homes , and they need a warrant to enter … .
my contact on the organizing council who invited XXXXXX , and many others , mentioned that they would n’t let the press in then …. that there are occasionallly press conferences organized by the administration and signs are put up on people ’s doors telling them they are not allowed to go outside during the times of the conferences ….
she then showed me that the hand held video camera she was using to tape my presentation was actually from WFAB .
Apparently this reporter had been refused so many times that she smuggled in a camera and lots of tape and put it in the hands of the organizing council to tape what was going on …. you know for them to give up equipment like that the situation had to be crazy … .
I did lots of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX , mostly at “ Renaissance Village ” one of the biggest “ settlements ” in the state with over 1500 families , in Baker , LA , about 30 min outside BR … .
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX …. they just lifted this ban yesterday though ( THANK GOD ) because of the media pressure .
People have no idea how out of control things are down here ….
I mean really unbelievably out of control ….
the complaints for racial profiling and police harrassment …are starting to take a more military influenced direction …. the torture techniques made public with abu gharib and guantanamo … are now becoming routine down here …. instead of just going and rounding up some black kids in the neighborhood and telling them they have to come out of their own yards to answer some question and then beating them up a bit or searching them and putting a gun to their head or whatever the routine racial profiling scenario would have been pre-k [ Katrina ] , now you see stops without arrests where young black boys are stripped and cavity searched in public , in daylight , in front of the neighborhood …. we are collecting … complaints about what the officers in such brutality cases say when asked by the victims “ why me ” …. routinely people are getting responses like “ there is still room in the mississippi ” or “ you did n’t have to come back , now did you . ”
One victim testified at a city council hearing a few months back …. pulled over for a windshield wiper violation ( I mean , you ca n’t make this shit up ) in front of the 5th precinct in daylight .
Beaten severely , dragged back around the corner to his car , left cuffed and bleeding on the side of the street while the police cut up his seats and burned out the inside of his car …dragged him back ( remember there are tons of witnesses ) and put him in the back of a police car , in the heat , for several hours , took him out , he could barely stand from the heat and blood loss …. did a strip and cavity search in front of the police precinct … found nothing , charged him with nothing , let him go …
NOVEMBER is a busy time for city restaurants .
Urban dwellers close up their second homes , and market ingredients shift from cool tomatoes to dense squashes and earthy mushrooms .
The appeal of eating comfort foods around a convivial table returns .
Two weeks ago , amid all this autumn activity , Stephen Kaye telephoned , offering to sell a whole Tamworth pig .
Stephen is an upstate farmer who has brought us the most delicious asparagus I ’ve eaten , the creamiest fingerling potatoes we ’ve served , mint that made an ice cream still unsurpassed , and my first grass - fed beef , a Dexter - Angus cross .
Now he was proposing to deliver a pig the week before Thanksgiving .
My first reaction was :
Are you kidding ?
Do you have any idea of the logistics that go into serving the great American meal to 185 diners ?
My harried sous chef has n’t the time or the space to handle a 150 - pound carcass .
But then I remembered that this is also a busy time on the farm .
It is a race against the frost , to gather root crops and plant garlic and hardy greens that winter over .
And of course it is also ideal pig - killing time .
Any later in the season , and precious forage or grain for other animals would have to be used to maintain the girth that the pig put on in summer pasture .
Any earlier , and we would n’t be taking advantage of all the energy and nutrients available in the field grasses .

Robert P. Hartwig , the president and chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute , a trade group in New York , said that even with insurance premium prices at a record high in Florida , they were still not high enough to offset all the potential damage that many weather analysts expect over the next decade or so .
Mr. Buchmueller says his company will have considerably more capital than most Florida start - ups  an estimated $ 45 million by the end of the year .
And he says that he is confident that he has found a gap in the market where the going prices are higher than the actual risk .
“ Everyone in Florida thinks they ’re paying too much for insurance , ” he said , “ and some of them are right . ”
Florida has been hit by a number of hurricanes in the last few years .
Insurers have paid billions of dollars in claims , and the price of coverage for homes in the state is the highest in the nation .
Some people are paying almost as much for insurance as for mortgage payments .
And every week , 15,000 homeowners in Florida are requesting bare - bones coverage from the state - run insurance agency because no one else will sell it to them  at any price .
Image Ross J. Buchmueller found that big , expensive houses fared the best in hurricanes , and his company will sell only to owners of those homes .

In January , Florida ’s Legislature went into special session to deal with the insurance crisis and decided to force down prices for all companies , including Mr. Buchmueller ’s , by perhaps 20 percent .
But many insurance experts say that if hurricane damage is heavy in the next few years , the state will probably have to make up for the price cut and possibly a lot more in claims costs by issuing bonds and passing on potentially enormous expenses to all policyholders .
Florida regulators welcomed Mr. Buchmueller ’s company as a new source of coverage .
They approved his plan in mid-January , and he has started selling policies through independent agents across the state .
Mr. Buchmueller previously spent about 20 years working for the Chubb Corporation and the American International Group .
Compulsory powers to fingerprint and photograph 700,000 foreigners a year who live in Britain as part of the national identity card scheme were announced yesterday by the home secretary , John Reid , as the scope of what critics see as a future Big Brother state became clearer .
At the same time , 150 screening centres around the world are to be set up in 18 months so that biometric data - electronic fingerprints and photos - can be taken and stored from passengers coming to Britain from 169 countries outside Europe .
But Mr Reid had to confirm that the Home Office 's original plans for one huge new " clean " database to store the details of everyone resident in Britain have had to be scaled back on the grounds of expense as the government tries to cut the estimated £ 5.4 bn cost of introducing ID cards .
The controversial national identity register , which will store everyone 's biometric fingerprints and photographs as well as personal biographical details , will now be housed on three separate existing government computer systems .
Mr Reid denied yesterday that this was a U - turn , although the computer industry has widely seen the decision as a significant change of tack : " Doing something sensible is not necessarily a U - turn , " said Mr Reid .
" We have decided it is lower - risk , more efficient and faster to take the infrastructure that already exists , although the data will be drawn from other sources . "
An " action plan " produced by the Home Office yesterday said that existing Department for Work and Pensions technology used for national insurance records would store biographical parts of a person 's national identity register entry .
Home Office systems used to hold data on asylum seekers will be expanded to hold the biometric photographs and fingerprints .
Private companies will be invited to bid for contracts to develop these databases in the next six months .
The Home Office claimed that the split between different databases would guard against malicious or fraudulent damage .
Mr Reid said that it would also reduce the overall £ 5.4bn cost of the ID project but declined to give a new estimate , saying it would be reported to parliament next April .
He also confirmed that the current price excludes issuing the compulsory resident permits to foreign nationals living in Britain .
Increased fees and charges for renewing their visas are expected to cover the extra cost .
While ID cards are unlikely to be compulsory for British residents before 2011 , foreign nationals will have to give their fingerprints for a compulsory foreigners '
ID card from 2008 .
Biometric checks on non-European travellers to Britain from 2008 would in volve a " triple check " before they stepped on to the plane , said the immigration minister , Liam Byrne .
Everyone from the 169 countries outside the European Economic Area who intends to work , study or stay in Britain for more than six months will be expected from 2008 to provide their fingerprints and photograph before they travel .
The biometric details of visitors from 108 countries of the 169 that have a visa agreement with Britain will also have to be provided , even if they are coming to the UK just for one day .
Already 450,000 people have been refused entry to Britain last year for failing this pre-departure test .
Mr Reid said this extension abroad of the national identity scheme would mean that " people we are concerned about will be stopped from coming here before they travel " and it would make illegal working in Britain much more difficult .
But critics claim that Mr Reid is building a " database state " in which ministers are trying to use computers to manage people by watching them .
The director of human rights group Liberty , Shami Chakrabarti , said : " Nothing short of repeal of this act will do . "
The timetable
2007 Biometric visas issued at 150 posts abroad ; new passport readers at key airports ; tenders invited for first phase of ID databases .
2008 Fingerprints and photos taken of all foreign nationals applying for visas : compulsory biometric ID cards for foreign nationals living , working or studying in the UK .
2009 Fingerprinting for ID cards starts and first Icards issued to British citizens ; electronic background checks on 120 m passengers ( 60 % ) before they travel to Britain ; UK employers start online identity checks of foreign staff .
2010 Electronic background checks on 190 million travellers ( 95 % ) coming to Britain .
2011 ?
Parliament votes on making ID cards compulsory for all British residents plus all foreign nationals living in Britain .
An EARTH SANDWICH is created when two slices of bread are simultaneously placed on opposite sides of the EARTH .
:: THE CHALLENGE
In May of 2006 Ze Frank issued a challenge to his audience ( Sports Racers ) , in an episode of the early influential video blog " The Show " to create the first earth sandwich in history . :: click here to watch the challenge episode ::
Using the FIND THE OPPOSITE TOOL viewers were able to locate their opposites on the globe .
Unfortunately for many fans of the show the United States is across from the Indian Ocean .
Click below to find your opposite !
Hundreds of people around the globe began sending pictures of bread on the ground in tribute to the effort .
( Pictured left ) :: THE FIRST EARTH SANDWICH
After two other legitimate attempts failed * , the first earth sandwich was completed less than one month from the original challenge .
A baguette was placed in Spain , near Madrid at the same time that another baguette was placed in New Zealand outside of Aukland .
Two videos were made , one from Spain : And the other from New Zealand : :: AND IT GOES ON Many earth sandwiches have been made in the past few years , including one by Doc Searles : * One attempt was made between the island of Fiji and the African nation of Mali .
In the story that was related to me , a young man in Fiji tried to call an embassy in Mali .
The bureaucrat on the other end patiently listened to the request before saying that 1 ) it was certainly possible and 2 ) that it would cost money .
The BBC News website 's Kathryn Westcott talks to those among a growing group who have chosen not to have children , and are fed up with the emphasis given to family life .
Childless or childfree ?
Not so long ago , all women without children were known as childless , with its implication of a state of loss .
Nowadays , a growing number of women are insisting on the term childfree - with its emphasis on liberation .
Mariah , who lives in Sweden , decided to be sterilised at the age of 25
Numbers are difficult to come by , but London School of Economics sociologist Dr Catherine Hakim has carried out some extensive research in this area .
She has no doubt rising numbers of people are actively choosing not to have children .
" In many European countries around 10 % of women reach the age of 45 with no kids , " she says .
" Of that figure , there are those who have chosen to remain childfree , those who have delayed having a child and are experiencing problems , and those who are infertile .
A UN fertility study says 2 - 3 % will fall into that category . "
She believes the number without children will double in many countries to around 20 % - except Germany , where the figure is already closer to 30 % , partly because it is seen as having some of the most family unfriendly policies in Europe .
' Taboo subject '
" The whole idea of the childfree lifestyle is beginning to be recognised by the media , " says Dr Hakim .
" Private feelings are being legitimised and people are beginning to feel that they are not being deviant in some way .
More and more people are questioning whether children are for them
Despite that , in some countries where there are very strong pro-natal policies , such as France , the idea of women actively choosing not to have children is , to many , an anathema .
Until recently , it was extremely difficult for men and women to undergo sterilisation in France .
" In France , it is difficult being a women without any children , " says 33 - year - old Alexandra , who lives in Nantes .
" The subject is just taboo .
There is no open debate .
People refuse to believe you could not want to have children - they always think it 's because you simply have n't met the right person . "
HAVE YOUR SAY A falling birth rate is a good thing .
The planet is already overpopulated

Alexandra , who has a long - term partner , says that up until her mid-20s , she always thought she would have children .
But , after changing her mind , she says she is confident that nothing will make her change it back again .
Lifestyle choice
She says that the assumption that it is only the work - mad who shun parenthood is far from accurate .
" I did n't make the choice for career reasons - it was a lifestyle choice .
I only work part - time and I like to enjoy life , " she says .
FERTILITY RATES
In Europe 2.1 children per woman is considered to be the population replacement level .
These are national averages Ireland : 1.99 France : 1.90 Norway : 1.81 Sweden 1.75 UK : 1.74 Netherlands : 1.73 Germany : 1.37 Italy : 1.33 Spain : 1.32 Greece : 1.29 Source : Eurostat - 2004 figures
At -a- glance : National policies
But Mariah who lives in the city of Linkoping , Sweden , says that over the past few years , she has met more and more Swedes who are opting for a childfree lifestyle .
The 30 - year - old says she has known that she never wanted to have children since she was a child herself .
" I was sterilised at the age of 25 .
It 's a choice I have never regretted , " she says .
" Once I had made the decision , I felt stronger as a woman .
I have a long - term partner and he is happy with my decision . "
She says that in Sweden there is a lot of pressure from family and friends to have children .
" It 's the norm and Swedes really do n't want to stand out in a crowd .
But , in the past few years , I feel there have been more and more people questioning whether or not they having children is really for them .
Waste
" Some people simply have no maternal feelings - some are worried about how the world is going , some like to travel , some like to pursue their careers - we 're not selfish people . "
" Selfish and irresponsible , " are words that 43 - year - old Jane , who lives in London , is used to hearing .
I 've been called irresponsible for not having children but there are many couples who have had children without thinking seriously about the impact such a decision will have
Jane , 43
" I made the choice early on not to have children .
I do n't dislike them - I simply decided that I could not devote 100 % of my time to someone else , " she says .
" I have also been called selfish but I think that people who have three children are encroaching on the planet 's resources - I can't believe the amount of waste that children produce .
" The world 's population is still growing - it 's only people in the West who are perceived to be not having enough children .
People will always have children and the world will continue , " she says .
' Better deal '
Jane , who works in the media , says there is an increasing tension in the workplace because many employees without children feel that parents get a better deal when it comes to time off .
This is partly why Europe is now following the US with the establishment of active groups of the childfree , some of whom are demanding a better deal for their members .
Jonathan McCalmont is the founder of Kidding Aside ( The British Childfree Association ) , which was first set up on the internet to lobby for equality for people without children .
He is fed up with the way the government is wooing parents with longer maternity pay , paternity leave , flexible hours and family tax breaks .
He describes the latter as " simply a middle - class tax break masquerading as social policy . "
He is angry at what he says is a redistribution of money from people without children to those with .
He contends that childfree people who have other responsibilities - such as looking after an elderly parent - should get the same benefits .
" We believe it is up to the individual to decide what constitutes a family , " he says .
" It 's not up to the state . "
Who was The Strongest Chess Player of All Time ?
Computer Analysis of World Chess Champions
By Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko
University of Ljubljana , Faculty of Computer and Information Science , Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , Ljubljana , Slovenia .
This article is based on a paper by the same authors published in the ICGA Journal ; full reference is given below .
Who is the best chess player of all time ?
Chess players are often interested in this question to which there is no well founded , objective answer , because it requires a comparison between chess players of different eras who never met across the board .
With the emergence of high - quality chess programs a possibility of such an objective comparison arises .
However , so far computers were mostly used as a tool for statistical analysis of the players ' results .
Our approach was different : we were interested in the chess players ' quality of play regardless of the game score , which we evaluated with the help of computer analyses of individual moves made by each player .
A method to assess the difficulty of positions was designed , in order to take into account the differences in players ' styles and to compensate for the fact that calm positional players in their typical games have less chance to commit gross tactical errors than aggressive tactical players .
We also give a carefully chosen methodology for using computer chess programs for evaluating the true strength of chess players .
The fourteen classic - version World Champions , from the first World Chess Championship in 1886 to the present , were evaluated .
Matches for the title of » World Chess Champion « , in which players contended for or were defending the title , were selected for analysis .
Several different criteria were designed .
The basis for evaluation was the difference between the position values resulting from the moves played by the human and the moves chosen as best by the chess program .
We also calculated the average number of blunders and observed how would the players perform providing they would all deal with equally complex positions .
Our analyses , among other things , also clearly show that the percentage of best moves played depends on analysed position itself and that is in very high correlation with the difference of best two moves evaluations ( according to the computer ) : the bigger the difference between best two moves evaluations – the easier it is to find the best move .
By observing the average material quantity during the games , we tried to determine players inclination to simplify positions .
Generally , our computer analysis seems to have produced sensible results that can be nicely interpreted by a chess expert .
Anyway , many will find some of the results quite surprising .
The winner according to the main criterion , where we measured average deviations between evaluations of played moves and best evaluated moves according to the computer , is Jose Raul Capablanca , the 3rd World Champion .
As we did in the study , this result should be interpreted in the light of the comparatively low complexity of positions in Capablanca 's games .
Anyway , he was also on top according to other criteria where we measured quality of play and was only beaten according to one criterion ( albeit a very important one ) , namely the quality of play provided that all players dealt with equally complex positions , by the present World Champion , Vladimir Kramnik .
Both Capablanca and Kramnik distinctly deviated from the rest of the players .
Separatelly , we conducted analysis of the latest World Championship match between Kramnik and Topalov .
The results ( mean loss per move : Kramnik 0.1220 , Topalov 0.1328 ; only the games with classical time control were taken into account ) tell that Kramnik 's play was somewhat better , while the overall quality of play in the match was on quite decent level ( comparing to other World Championship matches ) , although the record ( Kramnik 's 0.0903 in the London 2000 match against Kasparov ) was really not in danger .
Note that the lower this measure the better the performance .
The chess program Crafty was used to perform the analyses .
We needed an open source program in order to slightly modify it , as is described in the article .
One may argue that Crafty is weaker than at least some of the fourteen World Champions who were taken into consideration .
However , altogether more than 37,000 positions were evaluated and even if evaluations are not always perfect , for our analysis they just need to be sufficiently accurate on average since small occasional errors cancel out through statistical averaging .
Anyway , we would like to encourage other researchers that might have access to source code of the strongest commercial chess programs , to modify and run them in the way we proposed , in order to obtain a comparison between various different engines as well .
The basic criterion for evaluating World Champions was the average difference between moves played and best evaluated moves by computer analysis .
According to this analysis , the winner was the third World Champion , Jose Raul Capablanca .
This result should be interpreted in the light of the comparatively low complexity of positions in Capablanca 's games which is quite in line with the known assessments in the chess literature of his style .
For example , Garry Kasparov in his set of books My Great Predecessors when commenting Capablanca 's games speculates that Capablanca occasionally did not even bother to calculate deep tactical variations .
The Cuban simply preferred to play moves that were clear and positionally so strongly justified that calculation of variations was simply not necessary .
He also describes Capablanca with the following words :
 He contrived to win the most important tournaments and matches , going undefeated for years ( of all the champions he lost the fewest games ) . and his style , one of the purest , most crystal - clear in the entire history of chess , astonishes one with his logic . 
The results of blunder - rate measurement are similar .
We expected positional players to perform better by this criterion than tactical players , since in quiet positions there were less opportunities to blunder .
Note the excelent result of Tigran Petrosian who is widely renowned as a pure positional player .
In compliance with this observation , Steinitz , who lived in an era of tactical romantic chess , took clearly last place .
Capablanca is renowned for playing a ' simple ' chess and avoiding complications , while it is common that Steinitz and Tal faced many ' wild ' positions in their games .
The results of complexity measurement clearly coincide with this common opinion .
The method for assesing the complexity of positions is described in detail in the original article ( see also the reference below ) .
Graph of errors made by players at different levels of complexity clearly indicates the validity of the chosen measure of complexity of positions ; the players made little errors in simple positions , and the error rate increased with increasing complexity .
We used the above mentioned metric of position complexity to determine the distribution of moves played across different intervals of complexity , based on positions that players had faced themselves .
This , in turn , largely defines their style of play .
For example , Capablanca had much less dealing with complex situations compared to Tal , who is to be regarded as a tactical player .
The main deficiency of the two criteria , as detailed in the previous subsections , is in the observation that there are several types of players with specific properties , to whom the criteria do not directly apply .
It is reasonable to expect that positional players in average commit fewer errors due to the somewhat less complex positions in which they find themselves as a result of their style of play , than tactical players .
The latter , on average , deal with more complex positions , but are also better at handling them and use this advantage to achieve excellent results in competition .
We wanted to determine how players would perform when facing equally complex positions .
The winner was the fourteenth World Champion Vladimir Kramnik .
Kramnik also had the best performance of all the matches ; his average error in his match against Kasparov ( London , 2000 ) was only 0.0903 .
We also tried to determine how well the players would play , should they all play in the style of Capablanca , Tal , etc .
It is interesting to notice that Kasparov would outperform Karpov , providing they both played in Tal 's style .
The percentage of best moves played alone does not actually describe the quality of a player as much as one might expect .
In certain types of position it is much easier to find a good move than in others .
Experiments showed that the percentage of best moves played is highly correlated to the difference in evaluations of the best and second - best move in a given position .
The greater the difference , the better was the percentage of player 's success in making the best move .
Based on that observation , another criterion was the expected number of best moves played providing that all players dealt with positions with equal difference between the best two moves , as was described in the previous section .
It represents another attempt to bring the champions to a common denominator .
See the results right below .
Kramnik , Fischer , and Alekhine had the highest percentage of best moves played , but also the above - mentioned difference was high .
In contrast , Capablanca , who was right next regarding the percentage of the best move played , on average dealt with the smallest difference between the best two moves .
The winner by this criterion was once again Capablanca .
He and Kramnik again clearly outperformed the others .
The purpose of calculating the average material quantity , that is the sum of the numerically expressed values of all pieces on board , was not to determine the quality of play , but to collect additional information on a player 's style of play .
We mainly tried to observe a player 's inclination to simplify positions .
Among the players who stand out from the others , Kramnik obviously dealt with less material on board ( remember his early queen exchanges in his Berlin Wall games against Kasparov ? ) .
The opposite could be said for Steinitz , Spassky , and Petrosian .

How to Make the Right Decision
I ‘ve made a lot of poor decisions since I graduated college , and the only thing positive I can say at this point is that I now know exactly why those decisions were bad ones .
I endured a lot of heartbreaking crap because I simply did n’t understand how to make the right choices for my future .
And while you may be reading this thinking you have all your ducks in a row , all I can say is that I feel you – I honestly do .
All I ’m asking today is that you listen to my story , because I think I can help you to make more positive decisions about your future .
First , my story
The most life - changing things I learned in college had absolutely nothing to with school , books , theorems , or companies .
By far , the “ stickiest ” things that I learned – the things that still affect me the most – were a direct result of experiences gained through personal exploration .
Specifically , I ’m talking about :
1. Living in a new city
Throughout college , I was fortunate enough to live in and explore Atlanta , and I immediately embraced it as my own .
No one guided me on that venture , and all the experiences I had there were uniquely mine .
I loved the cosmopolitan yet southern flair of the city , the amazing architecture , its national profile , and all of the creative energy that it encompassed .
I miss it so much because it filled me with such an overwhelming sense of possibility and hope for a better future .
2. Travel
In 2001 , I spent the summer in Houston , TX , as an intern .
For most of my time there , I was completely isolated because I had no friends in Texas .
Although I remember being homesick and hating the fact that I was lonely , I actually have extremely fond memories of my time in Houston .
I ended up spending most of my time golfing , and I learned a lot about myself .
First , I realized just how much I love the finite reality that is geography .
I ’m fascinated by the sense of mental connectedness that you can achieve by traveling to different places and putting them all together in a relative spatial context .
Being in Houston really opened my eyes to that , and it ’s been a major part of my life ever since .
The second , and probably most important , thing that I learned was that I could enter a completely unknown space with virtually no resources and really thrive .
The only problem with this knowledge is that I just recently realized how powerful and potentially life - changing it really is .
I look at it as the roots of my own entrepreneurial spirit , if you will .
3. Independence
Theoretically , college is a transitional time where you go from being almost totally dependent to being almost totally independent .
I said theoretically .
I know tons of people who graduated from college and got hit with the immediate and harsh reality of “ Now what ? ”
Some of those people , myself included , ended up regressing into the land of parental dependence once more .
Now that I look back on my time in college , it ’s very clear that when I exercised my independence , I received the ultimate twofold benefit .
First , I made myself happy .
If that ’s not enough , I also learned by creating new experiences .
Through these experiences , I gained not only tangible knowledge , but also intangible knowledge about myself and about what I could do with my life to really be happy .
Putting it all together
Despite all of my revelatory experiences , I still failed to understand how to use my knowledge to make the best possible decisions about my career and my life ’s direction .
College kids get hit with a lot of noise around graduation time , and I was no exception .
Here ’s some of the noise that made my internal signals all the more unclear :
Soon - to - be graduates all feel pressured to “ get a job , ” and things like company profile and starting salary become artificial measures of success .
If you ’re reading this , please understand that nothing could be less relevant .
.
The entire setup stinks .
Companies will only interview people who are set to graduate with a particular major , and so the kids have to worry about getting the “ right ” interview with the “ right ” company , all in hopes that they ’ll obtain the myth that is a perfect job with the perfect company .
It ’s so stupid I could puke .
I fell victim to all the garbage I just listed , and I ’m certain that much of it influenced my decision making .
I went to the big career fairs that are so popular , and I followed the other sheep with regard to what I call the corporate pursuit .
Looking back , I remember not wanting to set up any interviews , and I also remember only reluctantly going to those career fairs .
I felt as though I was being irresponsible if I did n’t go , and I never wanted to feel like I was throwing away some of the opportunities that college supposedly afforded me .
Although interviews and corporate jobs were considered the natural pre and post graduation processes , all I can say for sure is that I did not proactively choose to walk the path that I ended up taking .
It was by no means what I wanted to do , and unfortunately , my decisions throughout this process ended up costing me a lot more than I care to elaborate on here .
On any scale , at any level , the principles behind your decision making should be the same .
Factors like money and peer expectations , while always present , are nothing more than distractions .
Based on your life ’s experiences , only you know what will ultimately make you happy .
I made my initial career decisions based on money and peer expectations , and I forfeited many of the things that mattered most to me .
I got knocked off the fulfilling track of independent exploration , and this also cost me some of the best sources of inspiration in my life ( my city , my travels , and my freedom ) .
The bottom line
I ca n’t tell you how many decisions in my life have been guided by pragmatism and finances , and I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve been bitten in the ass as a result of these decisions .
I did n’t have the balls to stay in Atlanta after college because I did n’t want to rent an apartment .
I thought renting was stupid because you basically end up pissing away all that money , and that ’s just not smart .
Right ?
Wait a minute …
Is it smarter to compromise your happiness and not follow the direction that you want your life to take , all in the name of pragmatism ?
You know , the more I think about it , the more I realize that all the people in my life who offer “ practical advice ” are not nearly as happy or as free as I hope to be someday .
Sometimes I want to slap myself for not being blissfully ignorant .
Anyway , I ’m done making decisions based on the wrong criteria , and after reading all this , I hope you are , too .
The next time you ’re faced with a big decision in life , look no further than yourself and your past for guidance .
As long as you never let a decision cost you something that is uniquely you , you will always make the right decision .
Screw money – it ’s not you .
If a decision costs you money ( or possessions , or whatever ) , you ’ll get over it .
However , if it costs you something that you love , you ’ll be like me and wake up one morning wishing that you had n’t made such critical mistakes .
Do n’t worry about me , though .
I ’m doing just fine now :)
Mr Hariri was killed in an explosion in February 2005
The White House said Syria hoped to stop the formation of an international tribunal to try suspects in the killing of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri .
Spokesman Tony Snow said any attempt to destabilise the Lebanese government would violate UN resolutions .
Syria 's ambassador to the US rejected the allegations as " ridiculous " .
Imad Mustapha said the United States should stop blaming other countries for its own mistakes in the Middle East .
A UN team has been investigating who was behind Mr Hariri 's death in 2005 .
Hezbollah demand
The BBC News website 's world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds says the White House statement appears to result from the tense situation in Lebanon , where Hezbollah is demanding one third of cabinet seats , thereby giving it a veto over decisions .
Such a veto would enable it to block approval of the international tribunal to try suspects in Mr Hariri 's assassination , our correspondent says .
The Hezbollah leader , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , has threatened street demonstrations in support of his demand .
We are ... increasingly concerned by mounting evidence that the Syrian and Iranian governments , Hezbollah , and their Lebanese allies are preparing plans to topple Lebanon 's democratically - elected government
Tony Snow
White House spokesman
The US is concerned that this instability could result in the fall of the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora .
The statement also casts doubt on any willingness by the Bush administration to consider Syria and Iran as potential partners over the future of Iraq , an idea that the Baker commission on Iraq is expected to suggest , our correspondent adds .
Former US Secretary of State James Baker is heading a bipartisan Iraq Study Group , considering future strategy in Iraq for US policy makers .
Hariri tribunal
The White House said it was " increasingly concerned by mounting evidence that the Syrian and Iranian governments , Hezbollah , and their Lebanese allies are preparing plans to topple Lebanon 's democratically - elected government .
" There are indications that one goal of the Syrian plan is to prevent the current Lebanese government from approving the statute for an international tribunal that would try those accused of involvement in former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri 's assassination , " the statement continued .
But the Syrian ambassador to the US , Imad Mustapha , told the BBC's Newshour programme that the allegations were " ridiculous , verging on the silly " .
" It 's a shame that the United States , a world superpower , would belittle itself to such petty politics .
Let 's be clear about this .
Today , in Lebanon , there is a domestic political bickering .
This is a purely Lebanese issue .
" We , in Syria , respect the sovereignty of Lebanon , we are not interfering on this , and we call on the United States to follow suit and not to interfere in Lebanese domestic issues , " Mr Mustapha said .
In March , the UN Security Council approved the formation of an international tribunal that would try those accused of involvement in the murder of Mr Hariri .
The UN sent a draft plan for the tribunal to Lebanese authorities on 21 October but it has yet to be approved of by Lebanon 's cabinet and parliament or by the UN Security Council .
Mr Hariri was killed on 14 February 2005 , along with 20 others in a massive blast on Beirut 's seafront .
UN investigators said in September they had found new evidence that he was probably killed by a suicide bomber .
The assassination has been widely blamed on Syria , but Syrian President Bashar al - Assad has repeatedly denied that his country had anything to do with the killing .
They 're talking about engineering longevity in the present issue of The Scientist .
It is promising to see more talk of such in the scientific community , even if it is more the Longevity Dividend and not at all SENS .
More discussion means growing support for extending the healthy human lifespan .
George Bernard
Shaw commented on how ridiculous it is that just as we are reaching the age at which we begin to acquire some wisdom , our faculties start to deteriorate and our bodies let us down .
So , when we should be applying our hard - won experience to solving the problems of human conflict , overpopulation , and the degradation of our planet , we spend a disproportionate amount of our remaining lifespan worrying about our failing health and memory .
How different our lives could be if we lived twice as long and retained full possession of our health and senses , and no one would have to retire unless they wished to .
...
So , all we need do is hurry up and solve the medical problems of aging - the sooner the better for all of us .
Michael Anissimov catches a few interesting quotes while commenting on the same subject :
Is living forever a lost cause ?
No .
Biological tissue works according to the same physical principles as any machine , and is subject to analysis and fine - grained repair just like any other system .
Some people view radical life extension as impossible because to equate the human body with a repairable machine is seen as blasphemy .
In related news , one of the most popular economist bloggers on the net , Arnold Kling , writes : " I tell my high school students now that I think there is a good chance that they will be immortal . "
James D. Miller , an associate professor of economics at Smith College , also writes : " I have told my college students the same thing , and will even be discussing this possibility in my upcoming intro micro textbook .
Obviously , immortality would change the world beyond measure .
But long before we achieve immortality people will realize that immortality will someday be within our grasp .
This expectation alone will radically alter human society . "
It 's only human nature to lose sight of the trends in technological progress that will take us from the world we recognize today to the radically different and improved future of 20 , 40 and 60 years hence .
It 's easy to take for granted the amazing technology of today , and forget just how different it was to live 20 years ago .
The biotechnology revolution is taking us into a whole new world of control over our own bodies , our biochemistry and its failings .
Help yourself and help others to live to see that world - the rewards will be great for all of us .
Technorati tags : life extension
Now ' that 's ' how to SPAM
If he had not asked my permission , his email would have been deleted immediately and his domain added to my junk mail filters .
So I 'm sat infront of my Mac yesterday and at about 4.30 , the phone rang .
Now I 've written before about telephone salesmen , but this was a call with a difference .
( I 've changed the names so various reasons . )
Caller : Hi , my name is Roger Daltrey from Who 's Better Software .
I 'm calling to ask if it will be OK to send you an email about our web monitoring software ?
Now I 'm impressed so far .
Not only did Roger identify himself upfront to save me the job of interogating him , he actually asked , and very politely I should add , if it was OK to contact me .
My defences came down and , Holy smokes , I even asked him right there what his software did .
Roger asked for my email address , of which I have several ( one of which is designed to be read only when Jupiter is in conjunction with Uranus and it's also a full moon . )
Malarkey :
That depends , how often will you be sending me information and will I be added to your database ?
Caller : I will only send you one , and if you do n't reply you wo n't receive any more communications from us .
So I gave him my email , this guy has class .
Now , here is the odd thing
For the next two hours I was actively waiting for this guy to email me !
Two hours in which I was wondering about his software .
Maybe it will be really good and I can use it myself ?
Maybe I can recommend it to my clients ?
For two hours I am thinking about his product .
When was the last time that happened from a cold call ?
And all because he was polite , respectful and was not so arrogant as to think that it was OK just to waste my time by spamming me .
At the end of the call , I asked Roger where he found my details .
On your web site he replied .
Now my web sites list my email address , it was there for Roger to see .
He could have spammed me without asking .
But he did ask , and in doing that he made me think about his product and about the experience of dealing with him ( hell , I 'm even blogging about it ) .
Things could have worked out very differently
1 . If he had immediately launched into a sales pitch for his product on the phone , I would have cut him off at the knees and got on with my day .
2 . If he had not asked my permission , his email would have been deleted immediately and his domain added to my junk mail filters .
But he did n't do either of these things .
I wanted to receive his email and ...
... when it arrived I read it .
Now ' that 's ' how to SPAM .

Here ’s a perfect example of how not to participate in the Blasphemy Challenge :
That was David Mills , author of Atheist Universe .
Picking up dog shit with Bible pages .
( And is that a little girl laughing in the background ?!
What is up with that ?
Why is she being told to take part in this , even if she is offscreen ?
If the roles were reversed and a little girl laughed as a Christian picked up dog shit with a Biology textbook , we ’d claim that was mental child abuse . )
Here ’s another video where a Bible is burned .
And all Christians who saw these videos saw the error of their ways and became atheists …
No .
Of course they did n’t .
They became upset and angry .
I did as well .
And I ’m not the only atheist who was offended by Mills , either .
Bligbi , however , is defending Mills and videos similar to his :
Burning , destroying and otherwise “ disrespecting ” a symbol is a longtime tool of rebellion .
People burn flags .
They blow up statues .
They destroy all manner of things from the mythological “ bra burning ” of the sixties to the burning of effigies of despised political leaders today .
And when it comes to the Bible , there is probably no greater symbol of terrorism , brutality and subjugation on the planet .
Why should it be spared from destruction by those who see it this way ?
I think the various reasons fall apart under closer inspection .
Why should it be spared ?
It should be spared because it ’s a book that has some very important stories about how to live life .
It provides the background to much of human history ( good and bad ) in the past couple millennia .
That alone gives it reason to be kept around .
To be sure , I ’m not mad at the act of burning .
I ’m mad because this was just plain offensive and did n’t make an effective statement .
Remember Michael Richards ’ racist rant from a couple months ago ?
A lot of comedians were asked what they thought about it .
One of the most frequent responses was that while they ’re not defending him , Richards ’ biggest crime was that he simply was n’t funny .
His job was to make jokes , and he strayed from that entirely .
That might be a weak analogy , but it ’s what I ’m trying to get at .
The point the guys in the videos want to make ( I presume ) is that they do n’t live their lives based on what the Bible says .
The book has done a lot of harm .
And they want nothing to do with it .
Those points are ignored completely .
They end up looking like ignorant jerks who are just trying to be provocative .
If you want to make a point , ask yourself who your audience is .
I ’m not sure what atheists could get out of watching that video .
I definitely do n’t know what they expected Christians to think .
Christians were riled up about the Blasphemy Challenge in itself partly because younger people were making articulate statements about why they were not religious .
They were young , they were finally coming out about their atheism , they were denying beliefs they were raised with and that many people hold sacred , and they were exposing a side of atheism a lot of people had never seen before .
I doubt Christians were watching the Mills video thinking , “ Wow … what rebellion ! ”
No .
They probably spread the video around to other Christians with a message that says , “ Look at how intolerant and disrespectful these atheists are .
They all talk about logic and reason , but they wo n’t even open the book in the first place . ”
And while Mills does n’t represent all atheists , we ’re too often judged by the extremists in our midsts .
There are * so many * reasons to criticize the Bible .
There are definitely more creative ways to do it than burning it or comparing it to dog shit .
The mistake with Mills is that he made a symbolic gesture that completely evaded the whole point of the Blasphemy Challenge , which is to publicly admit you ’re an atheist and explain why that is ( While saying the catchphrase , “ I deny the holy spirit ” ) .
Back to Bligbi for a moment .
She also had this to say :
[ Those who oppose the video say ] “ If I show how nice and respectful I am , someday they ’ll treat me nicely and respect me despite our differences ” .
But , the fact of the matter is that “ someday ” will never come because the point of this particular mind game is to create a situation where the oppressed group is too ashamed to act in a manner that will ensure that that “ someday ” arrives .
For example , Martin Luther King Jr was arrested in Birmingham , Alabama in April of 1963 for protesting segregation …
Please tell me David Mills was not just compared to Martin Luther King , Jr…
Please ?

THIS IS GARBAGE !!!!!
cause
Simple ->
Inflation is caused by an increase in money supply ( printing more money )
effect
ALWAYS
ONLY
control
Inflation takes wealth from the poor and middle class and re-distributes it to the rich
hyperinflation .
Money is a man made system and design .
Yet the governments , banks , industries , economic ' experts ' do n't know how inflation is caused .
This is an absurd idea , they know all right .
They count on you not knowing though !
So what is theof inflation ???
Theof inflation isa price rise .
Governments and ' experts ' say they control inflation by imposing wage and price controls .
These attack the effects of inflation NOT the cause .
See here
The phrase " Blinding by Science " has never been more amptly used !
Theway to control inflation is to stop printing more money ( Read this great article ) .
Money has the same value , thus prices remain pretty much constant and we have a stable economy .
So the people who print the money , inflation .
So for the us that 's the Bank of England ( they also control interest rates - thanks Gordon ) .
Bank of England are a corporation who 's only responsibility is to its ' shareholders .
It is not part of the UK Government , they have no power over it .
( Warning signals going off yet ??)
Why do they want to increase inflation ??
They use the Hegelian principle : Problem - Inflation riseReaction - Public sensitive to the price rise - complain to thgovernmentnt to take actionSolution 1 - Govt take action - pass new legislation ( usually results in redistribution of wealth - Government create new taxes to control inflation i.e. they confiscate your wealth ) Solution 2 - Bank of England rises interest rates - more money to the banks !!!
It is actually the antithesis of Robin Hood !
This repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats .
Lenin stated the best way to destroy capitalismsm was to debauch the currency
This process has been used to destroy many nation 's economy .
For example the greatest example is Germany .
This was This involved printing ridiculous amounts of money and destroyed the German middle class ( their savings became worthless ) .
The result was making it an unstable country , which eventually allowed a dictator in charge ( Lenin was right ! ) .
A recent example of hyperinflation is Zimbabwe .
They have a lovely leader in power too :( So the Bank of England - a corporation that controls inflation how they see fit , they have the power to destroy your savings .
And the best bit - they can get away with it , because nobody knows !!
When the time is right , they will ruin our economy here if that is in the establishments ' plans .
They can do it in the USA very easily - the Federal Reserve is not a Government department .
Like here , it is basically a corporation .
I 'd like to personally thank Ralph Epperson and his book " The Unseen Hand " for awakening me on this topic .
I had no real idea too until a few months ago , so thank you Ralph !
Bohr ’s principle of complementarity predicts that in a welcher Weg ( “ which - way ” ) experiment , obtaining fully visible interference pattern should lead to the destruction of the path knowledge .
Here we report a failure for this prediction in an optical interferometry experiment .
Coherent laser light is passed through a dual pinhole and allowed to go through a converging lens , which forms well - resolved images of the respective pinholes , providing complete path knowledge .
A series of thin wires are then placed at previously measured positions corresponding to the dark fringes of the interference pattern upstream of the lens .
No reduction in the resolution and total radiant flux of either image is found in direct disagreement with the predictions of the principle of complementarity .
The theory of measurement and non-perturbative techniques are aslo briefly discussed .

Blue Lagoon
Credit & Copyright : Russell Croman
Explanation : Stars come and go as you slide your cursor over this engaging image of M8 , aka the Lagoon Nebula .
Of course , the nebula is itself a star - forming region , but the stars that appear and disappear here include background and foreground stars that by chance lie along the same line of sight .
In this " for fun " comparison of two nearly identical digital images , the stellar point sources were removed from one image by computer processing to leave only the diffuse emission from the glowing gas clouds .
In both pictures , red emission ( H - alpha emission ) from atomic hydrogen dominates the cosmic lagoon 's visible light , but narrow band filters were used to record the image data and map the hydrogen emission to green hues , with emission from sulfur atoms in red and oxygen in blue .
The lovely Lagoon Nebula spans about 30 light - years at an estimated distance of 5,000 light - years toward the constellation Sagittarius .
Monads are a remarkably powerful tool for building specialized programming languages .
Some examples include :
But there 's a bunch of things I do n't understand about monads .
In each case , my confusion involves some aspect of the underlying math that " bubbles up " to affect the design of specialized languages .
( Warning : Obscure monad geeking ahead . )
Commutative monads
A " commutative monad " is any monad where we can replace the expression :
do a <- ma b <- mb f a b
... with :
do b <- mb a <- ma f a b
... without changing the meaning .
Examples of commutative monads include Reader and Rand .
This is an important property , because it might allow us to parallelize the commonly - used sequence function across huge numbers of processors :
sequence :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m [ a ]
Simon Peyton Jones lists this problem as Open Challenge # 2 , saying :
Commutative monads are very common .
( Environment , unique supply , random number generation . )
For these , monads over - sequentialise .
Wanted : theory and notation for some cool compromise .
Commutative monad morphisms
Monad morphisms are the category theory equivalent of Haskell 's monad transformers .
Haskell 's monad transformers can be expressed as monad layerings , which correspond to the monad morphisms of category theory .
Many complicated monads break down into a handful of monad transformers , often in surprising ways .
But composing monad transformers is a mess , because they interact in poorly - understood ways .
In general , the following two types have very different semantics :
FooT ( BarT m ) BarT ( FooT m )
If FooT and BarT commute with each other , however , the two types would be equivalent .
This is helpful when building large stacks of monad transformers .
Chung - chieh
Shan encountered a related problem when applying monad morphisms to build a theory of natural language semantics :
It remains to be seen whether monads would provide the appropriate conceptual encapsulation for a semantic theory with broader coverage .
In particular , for both natural and programming language semantics , combining monads --- or perhaps monad - like objects --- remains an open issue that promises additional insight .
Monad morphisms and abstract algebra
Dan Piponi has been drawing some fascinating connections between monad morphisms and abstract algebra .
See , for example :
This approach seems to throw a lot of light on monad morphisms --- but at least in my case , the light only highlights my confusion .
Of the three problems listed here , this is the one most likely to be discussed in a textbook somewhere .
And a solution to this problem would likely help significantly with the other two .
So , my question : Does anybody have any books , papers or ideas that might help untangle this mess ?
Update :
Be sure to see the comment thread on the second Dan Piponi post above and Chung - chieh Shan 's excellent bibliography on monad transformers .
While admissions officials emphasize the need for class rankings to view a student in context , the impulse to do away with rankings came from parents and high school administrators who thought colleges were failing to view students in their full context when they used shortcuts like class rank .
Sometimes students are separated in class rankings by a few hundredths of a point in a four - point grading system , in which an A is worth four points and a B three points .
In the most competitive private and public high schools , the gap between a student ranked second and one ranked 14th can be minuscule .
Private schools in particular make this argument .
" Especially in schools that are smaller , ranking is something that could hurt applicants , " said Myronee A. Simpson , associate director of college guidance at the Ranney School , a private school in Tinton Falls , N.J. " Our top 10 percent of the class here , since we have 46 seniors , would be four or five students . "
Some high schools have other motivations for eliminating class ranking : to restrain cutthroat competition among students and to encourage them to take challenging courses without worrying about their grades .
" The day that we handed out numerical rank was one of the worst days in my professional life , " said Margaret Loonam , a co-principal and director of guidance at Ridgewood High School , a public school in northern New Jersey that stopped telling students and colleges about class rank a decade ago .
" They were sobbing .
Only one person is happy when you hand out rank : the person who is No. 1 . "
" In a school like this , where the top 30 percent of the class is strong academically , it was unfair to all of those students who are in that elite group , " Mrs. Loonam said .
At some schools , including Ridgewood , officials continue to maintain class rankings in secret , disclosing them only when absolutely necessary , like when a student is applying to military academies , which require class rank , or when they are competing for merit scholarships that require the information .
Feeds , feeds , feeds everywhere .
I ca n’t keep up with all incoming data .
I am drowned !
I thought digg and similar services would help me on this , but it just raised the problem on a meta - level .
It takes me at least 20 minutes per day to :
Remove duplicates entries
Look over hundreds of entries to select the one that worth a reading , by looking at the title , the origin and the tags .
( 80 % of the time )
Read my selection , and even though I know this will make it worse , add news feeds I ’ve found from my selection .
I had to automate some of this daily activity .
I had to cut off this huge amount of data and to get closer to what I needed to read .
But how ?
First of all , let ’s analyze a bit what a feed reader wants .
It can be resumed in two things :
She wants to get the best news on her field of interest , out of a huge list of rss feeds .
She wants to keep an eye on what ’s going on out there , and make her field evolve with some indexes .
Most of the work can be done by pieces of software .
I think this is called webmining but I am not an expert .
Webmining would be a part of Datamining .
But let ’s cut off the big words : a couple of Python script can do the job .
That ’s “ Atomisator ” job !
Atomisator grabs multiple feeds out there , removes duplicate news by using the distance of Levenshtein distance , and create a new feed out of it .
It also provides a way to filter up entries on the fly , by looking at each entry content .
Simple filters for instance , will validate an entry if it contains certain words .
The filtering system is pluggable , and works as a transformation chain , so new filter can be written to fine - tune the entries .
This makes it possible to create several custom feeds form the same pile of data .
Another field of investigation was to use a bayesian network to filter entries but it does n’t work well : pertinency moves too fast on this kind of news , and an inference mechanism would work on static news topics ( Historic events maybe ? )
Last but not least , a special filter is used to collect statistics , and compute a buzz - o - meter report .
This report indicates the top 50 most used words over all sources , and is filtered with an english common words dictionnary .
It does n’t use the tags like most tag clouds , because people often use the same tags over and over , without really thinking about it .
A scan of the post content is way better : you get the REAL tags .
That ’s how I keep an eye on what ’s the most talked about , even though it ’s not on my custom feed : I can adapt it afterwards .
Ok now here ’s the feeds I use , updated every 30mn :
Get it all here in this page
This is pretty handy for my daily job .
The buzz - o - meter is for fun , but I see from time to time new words that pops in the list , I can investigate on .
It also shows that Ajax and Ruby lead the buzz - o - sphere .
The source code is GPL and available here , but still poorly documented and not packaged , should be better soon .
The version running the feeds is a bit different from the trunk and some merging will be done soon .
This was a project started some months ago I just wrapped and re-lauched yesterday .
N.B. : I had a few comments on how poorly written was this blog entry .
If you find some mistakes or badly turned sentences , do n’t hesitate : tell me !
( i am french 😉 )
To Australians , it is the linguistic equivalent of beer and barbecues - but for a short time yesterday the ubiquitous greeting of " mate " was in danger of being banned at the nation 's centre of government .
In an edict from a senior civil servant , security staff at Australia 's national parliament in Canberra were told not to use the greeting " G'day mate " when admitting visitors and politicians in case they caused offence .
News of the ban sparked national outrage and ridicule , not least from the prime minister John Howard , who uses the term often , especially when addressing George Bush .
With the media also in uproar - the front page of yesterday 's Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper declared : " Mate : It 's an Insult " - Mr Howard said the ban should be revoked immediately .
" It 's all about context , I think we should be both courteous and gregarious , " said the prime minister , who in 1999 wanted to include a reference to mateship in the preamble to Australia 's constitution .
" We have a treasured informality in this country and that 's something we should hold on to . "
The issue , however , has been a national talking point .
The opposition Labor party said the ban reflected the " elitist culture fostered under Howard 's nine - year - old conservative government . "
" This is John Howard 's Australia .
It 's about masters and servants , " said Kim Beazley , the opposition leader .
" It is a great part of Australian culture that we call each other mate . "
Former Australian Labor prime minister Bob Hawke said the ban signalled an erosion of Australia 's egalitarian ways .
" It 's pomposity gone mad , " Mr Hawke told ABC Radio .
" It 's not surprising .
In a sense we 're living in an age where the concept of mateship has been damaged to a fairly large extent by a lot of the approaches of this government . "
Mr Hawke , a former union leader famous for his down - to - earth approach , said the term had been useful to him at official functions .
" It does n't imply any intimacy , it shows a reasonable level of respect .
I think it 's one of our great words . "
According to Sue Butler , the editor of Australia 's Macquarie dictionary , the word has its origins in Australia 's colonial past .
It originally referred to someone 's working partner , but has evolved into a term of affection .
" Now it has an iconic status in Australian vernacular and by no stretch of the imagination is it offensive , " she said .
As some of you might have noticed the storage space for Gmail stopped increasing since January 1st 2007 .
In April 2005 Google made the leap from 1G to 2G and the growth never stopped since then .
As those who watch carefully stated the storage quota increased with about 0.33 MB a day ever since .
It ’s said that the sudden stop occurred due to the omission of the code that increase the storage quota after 31 December 2006 .
This might be true for we know Google to be quite lavish with storage space but it remains to be seen how quick will the problem be solved and how much is the storage limit going to increase after all .

Chris in Paris was telling me that Bush 's " new " plan for victory in Iraq reminded him of an episode of the hysterical BBC comedy " Blackadder . "
With a little sleuthing , Chris was able to find the episode in question .
The relevant part begins about 2 minutes into the video - I 've transcribed the dialogue , but you can find the video itself at the end of this post .
GENERAL : Now , Field Marshal Hague has formulated a brilliant new tactical plan to ensure final victory in the field .
CAPTAIN BLACKADDER : Ah , would this brilliant plan involve us climbing out of our trenches and walking very slowly towards the enemy , sir ?
CAPTAIN DARLING :
How could you possibly know that Blackadder , it 's classified information ?
CAPTAIN BLACKADDER :
It 's the same plan that we used last time , and the seventeen times before that .
GENERAL : Ex ... ex... ex... actly !
And that is what is so brilliant about it !
It will catch the watchful Hun totally off guard .
Doing precisely what we 've done eighteen times before is exactly the last thing they 'll expect us to do this time !
There is , however , one small problem .
CAPTAIN BLACKADDER :
That everyone always gets slaughtered in the first ten seconds ?
GENERAL : That 's right .
And Field Marshal
Hague is worried that this may be depressing the men a tad .
So , he 's looking to find a way to cheer them up .
CAPTAIN BLACKADDER : Well , his resignation and suicide would seem the obvious .

A reader sends this one in , after reading my book BMOC .
One of the characters in the book is a business man who has a knack for monetizing wacky business models ( one example : providing free fountains to malls in exchange for being able to harvest the coins out of them ) .
The book is named after his new company called BMOC , which specializes in making teens popular .
This caused a reader to send me this web site for FakeYourSpace.com .
They are selling popularity their own way , by providing you comments and visits from hot and cool friends on your MySpace pages .
Sort of sock puppetry for teens .
Welcome to Fake Your Space .
You have found a new and
exciting service which offers help to all the men and women out there
who do n't feel like they are popular enough on social networking sites
such as MySpace , Facebook , and Friendster .
If you are tired of seeing everyone else with the hottest friends and
want some hotties of your own , then this is the place for you .
LOL .
Wish I had thought of it for my book .
Below the fold is the business model for BMOC , which I thought was crazy enough :
From Chapter 5 of BMOC :
.... So that is when Susan , more
relaxed , asked what the hell BMOC did .
" Let me answer a question
with a question , " Marsh began his explanation .
" When TV
and radio and magazines sell to teenagers , what are they selling ? "
Oh
Christ , thought Susan , tricked again .
One of the pretensions of many
interviewers at HBS was that they liked to formulate a short verbal
business case for you to solve .
This always struck her as bizarre " “
if there was anything an HBS grad had been taught to do , it
was to analyze and talk about a case .
Thinking of Julian , Susan
decided that if she was going to interview HBS students , she would
instead focus on the question of whether the student had any friggin '
real - world common sense .
She had taken this interview in large part
because it promised to be different than all the rest , and here Marsh
went with the case BS .
" Well , they sell a lot of
cosmetics , and clothes , and CD's , " Susan answered .
" OK ,
that 's right , but I did not ask my question well .
Put yourself
in the teenager 's shoes .
The ads they see " ¦ what are
they really selling .
For example , when a teenage girl buys a
hot new outfit , what is she really buying ? "
" Hmmm .
Positive comments
from her friends ; an aura of being cool ; popularity , I suppose . "
" EXACTLY !
When the media
advertises to teens it is selling popularity !
Taken that way , the
teenage popularity business is enormous , literally hundreds of
billions of dollars a year .
One day , I asked myself :
Why so
indirect ?
They are selling popularity , but they are doing it via a
lipstick sale .
That seemed terribly inefficient to me .
If teenagers
want to buy popularity , why not let them do it directly ? "
" Excuse me ?
You can't
sell popularity off a rack . "
" Ahh , but you can .
The
name " ˜BMOC ' stands for " ˜Big Man On Campus . '
That name , by the way , is one of the reasons you are here " “
more on that later .
For a fee , we guarantee to make teenagers
popular . "
Susan thought about this for a
minute .
Was this a trick ?
Was this some elaborate case where the
key is not to get suckered into accepting such a bizarre business
model ?
She temporized with a question .
" What does BMOC
actually do to make kids popular ?
Is it something like wardrobe
consulting , helping the dorky kids to dress cooler and maybe take a
bath once in a while , that sort of thing ? "
" Well , that 's part
of it , but probably not the most important part .
The keys to our
business model 's success are our Local School Operatives , or
LSO 's as we call them .
We go into area high schools and seek
out and recruit the coolest , most popular people .
We keep them on
retainer , paying them a bonus when we have a client at their school
that they can help to become popular .
In many cases it 's
surprisingly easy " “ invite the client to sit with them at
lunch , to join them on dates , that sort of thing .
We can guarantee
popularity , because we literally have the local teenage opinion
makers on our payroll . "
Susan smiled .
OK , this had to
be fake .
This is all a hypothetical case .
The game was to find the
fatal flaw .
And she was pretty sure she knew what it was .
" I can't see the P&L
working .
Keeping all of these kids on retainer , plus the bonuses you
pay them .
I just can't see it making a profit , unless your
fees are very , very high or you do n't pay your student
representatives very much . "
" Ahh , a good point , and
you 've hit on our other innovation .
First , you are correct , we
charge high fees now , though as we grow with economies of scale , we
expect to be able to charge much less .
The real innovation , though
is " ¦ do you know what a product placement is ? "
" Sure .
It 's when a
company pays to get their product into a TV show or movie " “
like when Reese 's pieces were used in the movie ET or I guess
if you showed Seabiscuit eating Purina Horse Chow . "
" Exactly !
And product
placements are particularly effective .
They act like an ad but they
ca n't be ignored like an ad .
Anyway , we have taken product
placements one step further :
We get paid by major manufacturers to
place their products not in movies but in the hands of the most
popular kids in high school , the ones who really lead opinion as to
what 's cool and not cool who we " ¦ "
" Who you happen to have on
retainer anyway . "
" Exactly .
But be careful
how you think about " ˜on retainer . '
The natural reaction
is to assume this means money , but in our case it 's not .
We
keep the most popular people on retainer merely by " ¦ "
" Giving them free
products , " Susan interrupted again , with growing excitement ,
" that manufacturers are already paying you to put in their
hands . "
Marsh nodded , with a big smug smile on his face .
Shit , this was n't a joke , Susan thought to herself .
It might
in fact be brilliant .
It served advertisers better by putting their
product in the hands of those that really drive teenage opinion .
And
it served teens better , by giving them a clearer , more direct path to
their goal of popularity .
And both paid money to BMOC for the
privilege .
This really could work .
She saw the implications of this
approach immediately .....

Al Gore , the former vice - president of the United States , lives in a mansion that uses more electricity than the average family 's bungalow !
David Suzuki rides on a bus that uses more fuel than a Smart car to get across Canada !
Oh my God !
And this is just the tip of the vanishing iceberg !
The right - wing press , determined to act in the public interest by making us forget the planet is going to hell in a hand basket by discrediting those who want to tell us about it , have pooled their resources to find even more stunning examples of hypocrisy from these two incredibly annoying environmentalists .
Consider the following :
Al Gore , on a recent trip to New York City to discuss his film , is walking west on 50th St. , when he reaches Park Ave .
Gore waits for the lights to change .
Then , when he gets his walk signal , he proceeds across Park , strolling past dozens of idling cars and taxis and trucks that have been brought to a halt .
How many tonnes of greenhouse gas were spilled into the atmosphere , just so Al Gore could cross the street ?
Who the hell does he think he is ?
Does it even occur to Al Gore to ask all these drivers to turn off their engines while he passes by ?
Does he urge his fellow pedestrians to join him in running across the street , thereby shortening the time these cars will have to idle ?
You know the answer , do n't you ?
Outside Kamloops , taking a break from the eco-tour , David Suzuki orders a Coke with ice .
Then he gets involved in a discussion with someone about the melting polar ice caps and the rising oceans blah blah blah and forgets about his soft drink .
By the time he gets around to drinking it , THE ICE HAS MELTED .
So here 's this guy , who supposedly cares about all those disappearing icebergs , and yet when he has some ice right in front of him , he does n't even give it the time of day .
Al Gore , in a memo to one of his aides about a terrific new idea he has to alert Americans about the perils of global warming , doodles a light bulb coming on over someone 's head .
But the light bulb he draws is not one of the new twirly energy - efficient ones shaped like a pig 's tail , but an old - fashioned incandescent bulb that sucks energy .
If Gore is really so concerned about the planet , why does n't he doodle an environmentally friendly bulb ?
Would n't THAT be a good idea ?
Huh , Al ?
A joint Fox News // Global News examination of David Suzuki 's blue boxes found plenty of bottles and plastic containers and cardboard and empty tin cans , but there was something very curious about the contents .
While there were 23 empty tin cans , there were only 16 tin can lids .
What happened to those seven missing lids ?
Did they get tossed into the regular garbage ?
Did David Suzuki allow seven tin lids to go landfill rather than a recycling centre ?
How can we believe anything from a man who would commit such a crime against the environment ?
Sept. 19 , 2006 , 10:43 a.m. Tipper 's loading up the Gores ' solar - powered dishwasher , which she intends to run as soon as Al gets that coffee cup from his study and puts it in the empty spot on the top rack .
But the moment Tipper leaves the kitchen , Al , who ca n't be bothered to go upstairs to grab the cup , starts the dishwasher with the spot still empty , thereby WASTING SOLAR POWER .
If everyone follows his example , how long will it be before the sun runs out of power ?

WASHINGTON , D.C. 
" We 're going to get the band back together , and we 're on a mission from God . "
That was the message out of the first day of the 34th annual Conservative Political Action Conference , taking place yesterday , today , and tomorrow at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington , D.C .
The quotation , lifted from the Blues Brothers , came from Richard Viguerie , a direct - mail pioneer known as one of the " funding fathers " of the conservative movement .
Speaking on the conference 's first panel , " Strategies for a Bold Conservative Future , " Mr. Viguerie declared that conservatives " should withhold our support from all of the top- tier candidates " for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination  referring to Mayor Giuliani , Senator McCain of Arizona , and the former governor of Massachusetts , Mitt Romney .
" I feel very angry and betrayed , " Mr. Viguerie said .
" We , as conservatives , need new leaders . "
The question is who those leaders should be .
If conservatives are unhappy with the socially liberal Mr. Giuliani , the maverick Mr. McCain , and the oscillating Mr. Romney , whom would they prefer ?
At CPAC , the question has no answer .
An alien  or , say , a Democrat  wandering through the halls of CPAC might think that the nomination battle currently underway is a real dogfight between Mr. Romney and Senator Brownback of Kansas , a social conservative of good standing in the movement .
Upon entering one 's hotel room at the conference , the first thing one stumbles across is a slick flyer ( literally slick , it could trip you and kill you ) for Mr. Brownback , touting his credentials as " Proudly Pro-Life " and " A Reagan Conservative You Can Trust . "
( The " You Can Trust " is underlined , presumably meant to stick a needle into the less - than - consistent - over - the - years Mr. Romney . )
Meanwhile , both Mr. Brownback and Mr. Romney have brigades of young people handing out flyers and , in Mr. Romney 's case , notice of a reception for convention - goers to be held tonight .
Messrs .
McCain and Giuliani , meanwhile , are essentially unrepresented .
Mr. McCain is skipping the conference altogether .
Much grumbling could be heard throughout the day yesterday about the slight .
" He just does n't like us , " I overheard one woman say as she made her way into the main ballroom .
Mr. Giuliani will be here to speak at noon today , but , as of yesterday , he appeared to have no presence on the ground in the form of volunteers or campaign materials .
The former mayor 's decision to attend was only announced Monday .
And , so , there is on display at this year 's CPAC a wide gap between the reality of the current Republican primary contest and the second - coming - of - Reagan fantasies of conservative activists .
" I'm very offended that the media is telling us we have a choice of just three for the nomination , because they 're the only ones who can raise $ 100 million , " longtime conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly , founder and president of the Eagle Forum , said at the morning panel .
" The Republican nomination can not be bought , " she said , pointing out that Reagan did not have the most money when he ran in 1980 .
But Mr. Reagan had spent years as a conservative favorite , ever since giving a televised speech supporting the 1964 candidacy of Barry Goldwater .
There is no one in that position today .
The former speaker of the House , Newt Gingrich , perhaps comes closest , but with a messy marital history , a Joe Biden - like propensity for making foolish off - the - cuff statements , and an image battered by his years fighting President Clinton on the national stage , his current non-candidacy looks likely to stay its current course .
Perhaps most realistic was Mr. Viguerie 's conclusion that conservatives  at least the social conservatives who make up such a sizeable portion of CPAC  simply are n't going to have a successful candidate in 2008 .
" We are not at the size and the strength we need to be right now , " he said .
" I do n't think we have the infrastructure to support a Ronald Reagan - type candidate . "
He estimated it would take six to 10 years to get back up to that level .
Still , what remains to be seen is whether the conservative grassroots activists in the crowd here share the dissatisfaction with the current presidential field evinced by those on the stage yesterday .
Both Messrs .
Giuliani and Romney are set to speak today .
The reception each gets should be telling .
The camera has a way to go before it is available for practical use
Being developed by a lab at Rice University in Houston , Texas , the single - pixel camera is designed to tackle what its developers see as the " inefficiencies " of modern digital camera .
It currently resembles an old - fashioned pinhole camera and is the size of a suitcase , but assistant professor of electrical engineering Kevin Kelly told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme that it is only " the beginning of things . "
" Hopefully it will get smaller , " he said .
Inefficiencies
The camera was created , according to Dr Kelly and his colleague Richard Baraniuk , because digital cameras are very wasteful .
They require expensive microprocessors and massive battery power to capture an image - most of which will not be used in displaying the picture .
This is because the captured image is compressed , to a jpeg file for example , to make the file size smaller and more convenient to store .
The experimental camera 's images are captured by a single sensor
Although a digital camera picture may contain many millions of pixels , most photos can be described with far fewer because there is a lot of redundant or duplicate information in an image .
For example a picture of a blank wall will have many pixels with the same colour and texture information .
Dr Baraniuk said that this is where the single - pixel camera really has an advantage .
" Instead of taking the light from an object through a lens and focusing it on a pixel array , we actually reflect it off an array of mirrors , " he said .
This digital micromirror device , as it is known , consists of a million or more tiny mirrors each the size of a bacterium .
" From that mirror array , we then focus the light through a second lens on to one single photo - detector - a single pixel . "
Random mirrors
As the light passes through the device , the millions of tiny mirrors are turned on and off at random in rapid succession .
Complex mathematics then interprets the signals assembling a high resolution image from the thousands of sequential single - pixel snapshots .
" In the last couple of years , scientists and engineers have figured out that from these randomised measurements , you can actually reconstruct an image of the object that is sitting in front of the lens , " said Dr Kelly .
The camera is hooked up to a computer to display the captured image which can take minutes to construct .
Although at the experimental stage at the moment , if the device ever makes it to market it could make digital cameras more efficient and dramatically improve battery life by doing away with the need to process and compress each image .
Using a single light sensor also means that it can be swapped , for example , for an ultra-violet sensor on a satellite , or infra-red for a night - vision camera .
" Instead of using a million really expensive sensors , we can use one really expensive sensor and still give you a million - pixel image , " said Dr Kelly .

A very nice photograph with a great tonal range .
I am a certified barrista , and would love to purchase a print around 11x14 " to hang in my home .
Any possibility of doing that ?
Whether you are able to do that or not , I have really enjoyed viewing your photograph , which is a product of lots of hard work .
Congratulations !

Hi Matthew ,
My first instinct is to join that site and get into the fray of things on the thread ;-)
To tell some of them how wrong they are in their assumptions :
It is not a stopped video clip , there are no backdrops , mirrors , umbrellas , no sound / photogate triggers etc ..... and to tell them I 'm not a " poor girl " because I use a Tamron 90 mm macro ;-) )
But I wo n't ...

Photographer found comment helpful .
Not only did you need the inspiration to make this shot but it also took a lot of perspiration .
I often think that copious amounts of perspiration do not make for good art .
But I think with your project you have proved that picture perfect , as a result of blood , sweat , and tears ( of milk ) can be very artful .
Congratulations .

So I know how much patience you must have had ( or did you use some kind of sensor trigger ? )
Love the brown and white together .
a 10 from me .
Photographer found comment helpful .
An easy 10 ...
Glad I missed this challenge by a few seconds ( my 2nd miss like that this week ) - I shot nearly the same thing but yours definitely succeeded where mine failed !
I really felt the pang of not having strobes or TTL flashes cause I could n't get my aperture up with only 2 650 watt tungstens & a 250 watt halogen - my DOF was so shallow I had a hard time getting a drop in focus .
It was my first ever attempt at stop - motion work & I obviously need a schooling in the technique ...
Good luck !

The only t hing I have to say about it , is that you could edit out this three white dots , in the coffee itself ... but you couldnt have done that for this contest , being it was basic editing , so good job !

The first five albums by the British rock group Queen included a defiant footnote on the back cover , to wit : “ No synthesizers were used in the making of this record . ”
It was n’t until the ’ 80s that the band finally experimented with , or perhaps succumbed to , the inevitable march of technology .
DNA synthesizers , pioneered by Bio-IT World ’s 2005 President Award winner Leroy Hood ( see “ Hood Hails ‘ Century of Biology , ’ ” page 19 ) , have enjoyed a niche role in biotechnology at best for manufacturing DNA strands for microarray platforms and other applications .
But as costs plummet , the ability to rapidly synthesize and customize longer , more intricate fragments of genomic DNA opens up a plethora of applications in basic and applied biology .
The term “ synthetic biology ” was originally coined in 1980 , but since 2003 , its usage has become analogous to synthetic chemistry and covers the application of engineering and computer science to genomic circuits to construct small biological devices .
As noted in a recent review * , these include “ diagnostic tools that improve the care of patients with infectious diseases , as well as devices that oscillate , creep , and play tic - tac - toe . ”
If there is a distinction , “ synthetic genomics ” is less about tinkering with genetic circuitry and more about customizing microbial vehicles “ for groundbreaking scientific advances , including the development of alternative energy sources , and the production of new vaccines and pharmaceuticals , ” says J. Craig Venter .
“ Synthetic genomics has the potential to enable significant societal , environmental , and medical benefits . ”
This summer , two companies have established the beginning of a commercial synthetic biology industry .
Codon Devices , founded by a quartet of molecular biologists from MIT , Harvard , and UC Berkeley , raised $ 13 million in venture capital ( see “ Synthetic Biologists Assemble Codon Devices Company , ” July 2005 Bio - IT World , page 1 ) .
It will initially focus on developing customized genetic toolkits for biosensors and engineered cells for chemical and protein manufacture .
Meanwhile , Venter is stepping back into the boardroom ( for the first time since leaving Celera Genomics in 2002 ) by founding Synthetic Genomics .
Eschewing venture capital , the company has secured $ 30 million in private financing , about half from Mexican agrotechnology billionaire Alfonso Romo Garza .
“ We ’re moving from reading the genetic code to writing it , ” Venter told the Wall Street Journal , which broke the news of Venter ’s new company .
Having cracked the genome , evidently it ’s time to start stitching it up again .
As if on cue , the J. Craig Venter Institute announced it will participate with MIT in a Sloan Foundation - funded project to examine the societal implications of synthetic genomics , particularly the potential risks and necessary safeguards to prevent bioterror abuses .
Minimal Genome
The significance of Venter ’s arrival on the synthetic biology scene should not be underestimated , given his remarkable sixth sense for developing and exploiting key technologies .
Venter ’s first foray into synthetic genomics came six years ago with a landmark paper on the “ minimal genome . ”
Although Japan ’s Mitsuhiro Itaya first coined the term in 1995 , Venter and colleagues published a landmark paper in Science in 1999 suggesting that a mere 300 genes might be necessary and sufficient to encode life .
Progress was suspended while Venter tackled the human genome , but last year , his group took another important step with the “ resynthesis ” of a viral genome — an important proof - of - principle for synthetic genomics , which will require pimping much larger genomes .
The new Synthetic Genomics
Web site says it all : “ Imagine a future where clean , environmentally friendly microorganisms produce the bulk of industrial materials that are today made from petrochemicals ... where specifically tailored organisms harness the sun to create clean energy ... when researchers can use a modular , software - like product to design new microbial genomes which are manufactured on an industrial - like scale . ”
This may sound a tad fanciful , but the tantalizing prospect of harnessing microbes to synthesize drugs and other biomaterials will not be lost on our readers .
As for abundant clean energy , have you checked the price of oil lately ?

Why I Keep Cash Under My Mattress [ The Simple Dollar ]
ISLAMABAD / KABUL ( Reuters ) - Pakistani security forces captured one of the Taliban ’s top leaders hours after U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney ’s unannounced visit to Pakistan this week , a senior security official and Taliban sources said .
Pakistani soldiers stand guard on a rooftop in Quetta , September 6 , 2006 .
Pakistani security forces have captured a high - ranking Taliban leader in the southwestern city of Quetta , a senior Pakistani security official and Taliban sources said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Athar Hussain
The sources told Reuters that Mullah Obaidullah Akhund , the third most senior member of the Taliban ’s leadership council , was arrested late on Monday in the southwestern city of Quetta .
His capture would mark the first Pakistani arrest of a senior leader of the Islamist militia since it was driven from power in Afghanistan in 2001 and thousands of its fighters fled into Pakistan .
The Bush administration is facing a wave of skepticism over Pakistan ’s role as an ally in the war on terrorism .
Cheney had asked Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to do more to stop al Qaeda rebuilding from safe havens in Pakistani tribal lands and step up efforts to thwart a spring offensive by the Taliban against Afghan and NATO troops .
The New York Times carried a report on its Web site , saying U.S. officials in Washington had confirmed Akhund ’s arrest .
Friday ’s edition of Dawn , a leading Pakistani daily , ran a front - page story , again sourced to an unnamed official , with a headline reading : “ Mullah Omar ’s deputy Obaidullah captured ” .
Pakistani government and military spokesmen said they had no knowledge of the arrest .
Taliban sources , speaking on satellite telephones from undisclosed locations , said Akhund was caught at the home of a relative in the Baluchistan provincial capital .
They said two other leaders had been arrested in Quetta this week .
Pakistani security officials said five suspects had been detained midweek , but their identities were not confirmed .
Germany ’s conservative Die Welt daily , in an advance copy of a story to be published on Saturday , quoted “ an observer ” as saying Akhund had already been released .
“ I have just had coffee with the Mullah , ” the observer said .
Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousaf told Afghan Islamic Press , a Pashtun - language news agency based in Peshawar , that it was a false rumor .
At the end of 2006 the Taliban denied for more than a week that a U.S. air strike had killed Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Osmani , a senior commander , before confirming his death .
The Pakistani security official , whose information has proved reliable in the past but insists on anonymity as he is not authorized to speak , said the timing of Akhund ’s arrest was coincidence , and not linked to Cheney ’s visit .
LINK MAN
Aside from being on the leadership council headed by Mullah Mohammad Omar , Akhund was defense minister in the Taliban government before it fell .
As defense minister , Akhund was believed to have liaised closely with Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence during the years when the Taliban ruled in Kabul and could count on Pakistani support .
“ He was n’t a commander , but he and Mullah Beradar were key links to commanders in the field , ” Ahmed Rashid , a respected Pakistani journalist and author of “ Taliban ” , a seminal study of the Islamist militia , commented .
“ He was in the shura ( council ) and very important . ”
While Akhund ’s capture would represent a major coup , it sits uneasily with Pakistan ’s past denials of allegations that Taliban leaders were running the Afghan insurgency from Quetta .
Musharraf said last month that he was “ 500 percent ” sure that Mullah Omar was in Afghanistan , although he admits there are Taliban fighters in Pakistan .
The lack of arrests in the past fed speculation that Pakistani intelligence services or rogue agents have allowed Taliban leaders to operate freely .
Having supported the Taliban prior to al Qaeda ’s September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States , Pakistan has struggled to shake off suspicions that its spies continue to play a double game in case the West ’s commitment to Afghanistan does not last .
Gorbachev is getting involved in a high - profile case
The plea came in an open letter published on Mr Gorbachev 's website .
Russian prosecutors say Alexander Ponosov ran pirated software at school , violating intellectual property rights .
In reply to Mr Gorbachev , Microsoft said it did not launch the prosecution and that the scale of the case did not warrant criminal proceedings .
Mr Gorbachev 's letter , on the website run by his charitable foundation , said " many people in Russia regard this scandalous case as trumped - up , launched on the initiative of Microsoft corporation to set a precedent " .
" We have great respect for the work of Microsoft 's programmers ... and are in no way casting doubt on the principle of punishment for intellectual property violations .
" However , in this case we ask you to show mercy and withdraw your complaint against Alexander Ponosov , " the letter read .
' Amicable settlement '
But Olga Dergunova , chairman of Microsoft Russia , said : " This case was initiated by Russian authorities under Russian law .
" We did have the option in this case to take up civil action , but decided last year not to do so . "
She added : " We are eager to see this case resolved through an amicable settlement so that everyone can move forward . "
Russian President Vladimir Putin has also criticised the prosecution of Mr Ponosov , in Perm , east of Moscow .
The Perm region lies in the Ural Mountains , between Moscow and Siberia .
The teacher is accused of knowingly using pirated Windows software in the school and causing the company losses put at 266,000 roubles ( $ 10,000 ; £ 5,000 ) .
Mr Ponosov told the BBC that Russian prosecutors had brought the case against him and he was unaware of any Microsoft claim against him .
He says he is innocent , that the software had been pre-installed and he did not know it was unlicensed when he obtained the computers .
At a news conference on 1 February , President Putin said investigators should " go after the distributors , not the users " .
" It 's ridiculous to just arrest a chap for using computers , " he said .

[ Method ]
create - scanner ( string string ) &key case - insensitive - mode multi- line - mode single - line - mode extended - mode destructive => scanner , register - names
Accepts a string which is a regular expression in Perl syntax and returns a closure which will scan strings for this regular expression .
The second value is only returned if * ALLOW - NAMED -REGISTERS * is true .
It represents a list of strings mapping registers to their respective names - the first element stands for first register , the second element for second register , etc .
You have to store this value if you want to map a register number to its name later as scanner does n't capture any information about register names .
If a register is n't named , it has NIL as its name .
The mode keyword arguments are equivalent to the " imsx " modifiers in Perl .
The destructive keyword will be ignored .
The function accepts most of the regex syntax of Perl 5.8 as described in man perlre including extended features like non-greedy repetitions , positive and negative look - ahead and look - behind assertions , " standalone " subexpressions , and conditional subpatterns .
The following Perl features are ( currently ) not supported : (?{ code } ) and ( ??{ code } ) because they obviously do n't make sense in Lisp .
and because they obviously do n't make sense in Lisp .

Since version 0.6.0 , CL - PPCRE also supports Perl 's \Q and \E - see * ALLOW - QUOTING * below .
Make sure you also read the relevant section in " Bugs and problems . "
Since version 1.3.0 , CL - PPCRE offers support for AllegroCL's ( ?< name > " < regex > " ) named registers and \k < name > back - references syntax , have a look at * ALLOW - NAMED - REGISTERS * for details .
Since version 2.0.0 , CL - PPCRE supports named properties ( \p and \ P ) , but only the long form with braces is supported , i.e. \p {Letter} and \p {L} will work while \ pL wo n't .
The keyword arguments are just for your convenience .
You can always use embedded modifiers like " ( ?i-s ) " instead .

create - scanner ( function function ) &key case - insensitive - mode multi- line - mode single - line - mode extended - mode destructive => scanner
In this case function should be a scanner returned by another invocation of CREATE - SCANNER .
It will be returned as is .
You ca n't use any of the keyword arguments because the scanner has already been created and is immutable .

So , e.g. , ( : NON - GREEDY - REPETITION 0 1 " ab " ) is equivalent to the Perl regex string " (?:ab ) ? ? " .

Because CREATE - SCANNER is defined as a generic function which dispatches on its first argument there 's a certain ambiguity :
Although strings are valid parse trees they will be interpreted as Perl regex strings when given to CREATE - SCANNER .
To circumvent this you can always use the equivalent parse tree ( : GROUP < string > ) instead .
Note that CREATE - SCANNER does n't always check for the well - formedness of its first argument , i.e. you are expected to provide correct parse trees .
The usage of the keyword argument extended - mode obviously does n't make sense if CREATE - SCANNER is applied to parse trees and will signal an error .
If destructive is not NIL ( the default is NIL ) , the function is allowed to destructively modify parse - tree while creating the scanner .
If you want to find out how parse trees are related to Perl regex strings , you should play around with PARSE - STRING : * ( parse - string " ( ab ) * " ) (: GREEDY -REPETITION 0 NIL (: REGISTER " ab " ) ) * ( parse - string " ( a ( b ) ) " ) (: REGISTER (: SEQUENCE #\a ( : REGISTER #\b ) ) ) * ( parse - string " ( ?:abc ) { 3,5} " ) (: GREEDY -REPETITION 3 5 (: GROUP " abc " ) ) ;; (: GREEDY -REPETITION 3 5 " abc " ) would also be OK * ( parse - string " a( ?i ) b ( ? - i ) c " ) ( : SEQUENCE #\a ( : SEQUENCE (: FLAGS :CASE-INSENSITIVE-P ) (: SEQUENCE #\b ( : SEQUENCE (: FLAGS : CASE-SENSITIVE-P ) # \ c ) ) ) ) ;; same as ( : SEQUENCE #\a :CASE-INSENSITI
VE - P #\b :CASE -SENSITIVE-P # \c ) * ( parse - string " ( ?=a ) b " ) ( : SEQUENCE (: POSITIVE -LOOKAHEAD #\a ) # \b )
For the rest of the dictionary , regex can always be a string ( which is interpreted as a Perl regular expression ) , a parse tree , or a scanner created by CREATE - SCANNER .
The start and end keyword parameters are always used as in SCAN .
[ Generic Function ]
scan regex target - string &key start end => match - start , match - end , reg-starts , reg-ends
Searches the string target - string from start ( which defaults to 0 ) to end ( which default to the length of target - string ) and tries to match regex .
On success returns four values - the start of the match , the end of the match , and two arrays denoting the beginnings and ends of register matches .
On failure returns NIL .
target - string will be coerced to a simple string if it is n't one already .
( There 's another keyword parameter real - start - pos .
This one should never be set from user code - it is only used internally . )
SCAN acts as if the part of target - string between start and end were a standalone string , i.e. look - aheads and look - behinds can't look beyond these boundaries .
* ( scan " ( a ) * b " " xaaabd " ) 1 5 # ( 3 ) # ( 4 ) * ( scan " ( a ) * b " " xaaabd " : start 1 ) 1 5 # ( 3 ) # ( 4 ) * ( scan " ( a ) * b " " xaaabd " : start 2 ) 2 5 # ( 3 ) # ( 4 ) * ( scan " ( a ) * b " " xaaabd " : end 4 ) NIL * ( scan '( : greedy - repetition 0 nil # \b ) " bbbc " ) 0 3 #( ) #() * ( scan '( : greedy - repetition 4 6 # \b ) " bbbc " ) NIL * ( let ( (s ( create - scanner " ( ( [ a - c ] ) + ) x " ) ) ) ( scan s " abcxy " ) ) 0 4 #(0 2 ) # ( 3 3 )
[ Function ]
scan - to - strings regex target - string &key start end sharedp => match , regs
Like SCAN but returns substrings of target - string instead of positions , i.e. this function returns two values on success : the whole match as a string plus an array of substrings ( or NIL s ) corresponding to the matched registers .
If sharedp is true , the substrings may share structure with target - string .
* ( scan - to - strings " [ ^b ] * b " " aaabd " ) " aaab " #() * ( scan - to - strings " ( [ ^b ] ) * b " " aaabd " ) " aaab " # ( " a " ) * ( scan - to - strings " ( ( [ ^ b ] ) * ) b " " aaabd " ) " aaab " # ( " aaa " " a " )
[ Macro ]
register - groups - bind var - list ( regex target - string &key start end sharedp ) declaration * statement * => result *
Evaluates statement * with the variables in var - list bound to the corresponding register groups after target - string has been matched against regex , i.e. each variable is either bound to a string or to NIL .
As a shortcut , the elements of var - list can also be lists of the form ( FN VAR ) where VAR is the variable symbol and FN is a function designator ( which is evaluated ) denoting a function which is to be applied to the string before the result is bound to VAR .
To make this even more convenient the form ( FN VAR1 ... VARn ) can be used as an abbreviation for ( FN VAR1 ) ... ( FN VARn ) .
If there is no match , the statement * forms are not executed .
For each element of var - list which is NIL there 's no binding to the corresponding register group .
The number of variables in var - list must not be greater than the number of register groups .
If sharedp is true , the substrings may share structure with target - string .
* ( register - groups - bind ( first second third fourth ) ( " ( ( a ) | ( b ) | ( c ) ) + " " abababc " : sharedp t) ( list first second third fourth ) ) ( " c " " a " " b " " c " ) * ( register - groups - bind ( nil second third fourth ) ;; note that we do n't bind the first and fifth register group ( " ( ( a ) | ( b ) | ( c ) ) ( ) + " " abababc " : start 6 ) ( list second third fourth ) ) ( NIL NIL " c " ) * ( register - groups - bind ( first ) ( " ( a|b ) + " " accc " : start 1 ) ( format t " This will not be printed : ~ A " first ) ) NIL * ( register - groups - bind ( fname lname ( #' parse - integer date month year ) ) ( " ( \\w + ) \\s + ( \\w+ ) \\s +( \\d { 1,2} ) \\.( \\d {1,2} ) \\.( \\d{4} ) " " Frank Zappa 21.12.1940 " ) ( list fname lname ( encode - universal - time 0 0 0 date month year 0 ) ) ) ( " Frank " " Zappa " 1292889600 )
[ Macro ]
do - scans ( match - start match - end reg- starts reg-ends regex target - string &optional result - form &key start end ) declaration * statement * => result *
A macro which iterates over target - string and tries to match regex as often as possible evaluating statement * with match - start , match - end , reg-starts , and reg-ends bound to the four return values of each match ( see SCAN ) in turn .
After the last match , returns result - form if provided or NIL otherwise .
An implicit block named NIL surrounds DO - SCANS ; RETURN may be used to terminate the loop immediately .
If regex matches an empty string , the scan is continued one position behind this match .
This is the most general macro to iterate over all matches in a target string .
See the source code of DO - MATCHES , ALL - MATCHES , SPLIT , or REGEX - REPLACE -ALL for examples of its usage .
[ Macro ]
do - matches ( match - start match - end regex target - string &optional result - form &key start end ) declaration * statement * => result *
Like DO - SCANS but does n't bind variables to the register arrays .

[ Macro ]
do - matches - as - strings ( match - var regex target - string &optional result - form &key start end sharedp ) declaration * statement * => result *
Like DO - MATCHES
but binds match - var to the substring of target - string corresponding to each match in turn .
If sharedp is true , the substrings may share structure with target - string .
* ( defun crossfoot ( target - string &key ( start 0 ) ( end ( length target - string ) ) ) ( let ( ( sum 0 ) ) ( do - matches - as - strings ( m : digit - class target - string nil : start start : end end ) ( incf sum ( parse - integer m ) ) ) ( if ( < sum 10 ) sum ( crossfoot ( format nil " ~A " sum ) ) ) ) )
CROSSFOOT * ( crossfoot " bar " ) 0 * ( crossfoot " a3 x " ) 3 * ( crossfoot " 12345 " ) 6
Of course , in real life you would do this with DO - MATCHES and use the start and end keyword parameters of PARSE - INTEGER .
[ Macro ]
do - register - groups var - list ( regex target - string &optional result - form &key start end sharedp ) declaration * statement * => result *
Iterates over target - string and tries to match regex as often as possible evaluating statement * with the variables in var - list bound to the corresponding register groups for each match in turn , i.e. each variable is either bound to a string or to NIL .
You can use the same shortcuts and abbreviations as in REGISTER - GROUPS - BIND .
The number of variables in var - list must not be greater than the number of register groups .
For each element of var - list which is NIL there 's no binding to the corresponding register group .
After the last match , returns result - form if provided or NIL otherwise .
An implicit block named NIL surrounds DO - REGISTER - GROUPS ; RETURN may be used to terminate the loop immediately .
If regex matches an empty string , the scan is continued one position behind this match .
If sharedp is true , the substrings may share structure with target - string .
* ( do - register - groups ( first second third fourth ) ( " ( ( a ) | ( b ) | ( c ) ) " " abababc " nil : start 2 : sharedp t) ( print ( list first second third fourth ) ) ) ( " a " " a " NIL NIL ) ( " b " NIL " b " NIL ) ( " a " " a " NIL NIL ) ( " b " NIL " b " NIL ) ( " c " NIL NIL " c " ) NIL * ( let ( result ) ( do - register - groups ( ( # ' parse - integer n ) ( #'intern sign ) whitespace ) ( " ( \\d + ) |( \\+ | - |\\*|/) |( \\s + ) " " 12*15 - 42/3 " ) ( unless whitespace ( push ( or n sign ) result ) ) ) ( nreverse result ) ) ( 12 * 15 - 42 / 3 )
[ Function ]
all - matches regex target - string &key start end => list
Returns a list containing the start and end positions of all matches of regex against target - string , i.e. if there are N matches the list contains (* 2 N ) elements .
If regex matches an empty string the scan is continued one position behind this match .
* ( all - matches " a " " foo bar baz " ) ( 5 6 9 10 ) * ( all - matches " \\w * " " foo bar baz " ) ( 0 3 3 3 4 7 7 7 8 11 11 11 )
[ Function ]
all - matches - as - strings regex target - string &key start end sharedp => list
Like ALL - MATCHES
but returns a list of substrings instead .

[ Function ]
split regex target - string &key start end limit with - registers - p omit - unmatched - p sharedp => list
Matches regex against target - string as often as possible and returns a list of the substrings between the matches .
If with - registers - p is true , substrings corresponding to matched registers are inserted into the list as well .
If omit - unmatched - p is true , unmatched registers will simply be left out , otherwise they will show up as NIL .
limit limits the number of elements returned - registers are n't counted .
If limit is NIL ( or 0 which is equivalent ) , trailing empty strings are removed from the result list .
If regex matches an empty string , the scan is continued one position behind this match .
If sharedp is true , the substrings may share structure with target - string .
This function also tries hard to be Perl - compatible - thus the somewhat peculiar behaviour .
* ( split " \\s + " " foo bar baz frob " ) ( " foo " " bar " " baz " " frob " ) * ( split " \\s * " " foo bar baz " ) ( " f " " o " " o " " b " " a " " r " " b " " a " " z " ) * ( split " ( \\s + ) " " foo bar baz " ) ( " foo " " bar " " baz " ) * ( split " ( \\s + ) " " foo bar baz " : with - registers - p t ) ( " foo " " " " bar " " " " baz " ) * ( split " ( \\s ) ( \\s * ) " " foo bar baz " : with - registers - p t ) ( " foo " " " " " " bar " " " " " " baz " ) * ( split " ( , ) | ( ; ) " " foo , bar ;baz " : with - registers - p t ) ( " foo " " , " NIL " bar " NIL " ; " " baz " ) * ( split " ( , ) | ( ; ) " " foo , bar ; baz " : with - registers - p t :omit - unmatched - p t ) ( " foo " " , " " bar " " ; " " baz " ) * ( split " : " " a:b:c:d:e: f : g : : " ) ( " a " " b " " c " " d " " e " " f " " g " ) * ( split " : " " a:b:c:d:e:f:g : : " : limit 1 ) ( " a:b:c:d:e:f : g : : " ) * ( split " : " " a:b:c:d:e:f:g : : " : limit 2 ) ( " a " " b:c:d:e:f : g : : " ) * ( split " : " " a:b:c:d:e:f:g : : " : limit 3 ) ( " a " " b " " c:d:e:f : g : : " ) * ( split " : " " a:b:c:d:e: f:g : : " : limit 1000 ) ( " a " " b " " c " " d " " e " " f " " g " " " " " )
[ Function ]
regex - replace regex target - string replacement &key start end preserve - case simple - calls element - type => string , matchp
Try to match target - string between start and end against regex and replace the first match with replacement .
Two values are returned ; the modified string , and T if regex matched or NIL otherwise .
replacement can be a string which may contain the special substrings " \& " for the whole match , " \` " for the part of target - string before the match , " \ ' " for the part of target - string after the match , " \N " or " \{N} " for the N th register where N is a positive integer .
replacement can also be a function designator in which case the match will be replaced with the result of calling the function designated by replacement with the arguments target - string , start , end , match - start , match - end , reg-starts , and reg-ends .
( reg-starts and reg-ends are arrays holding the start and end positions of matched registers ( or NIL ) - the meaning of the other arguments should be obvious . )
If simple - calls is true , a function designated by replacement will instead be called with the arguments match , register - 1 , ... , register -n where match is the whole match as a string and register - 1 to register -n are the matched registers , also as strings ( or NIL ) .
Note that these strings share structure with target - string so you must not modify them .
Finally , replacement can be a list where each element is a string ( which will be inserted verbatim ) , one of the symbols : match , : before - match , or : after - match ( corresponding to " \& " , " \` " , and " \ ' " above ) , an integer N ( representing register ( 1+ N ) ) , or a function designator .
If preserve - case is true ( default is NIL ) , the replacement will try to preserve the case ( all upper case , all lower case , or capitalized ) of the match .
The result will always be a fresh string , even if regex does n't match .
element - type specifies the array element type of the string which is returned , the default is LW : SIMPLE - CHAR for LispWorks and CHARACTER for other Lisps .

[ Special variable ]
* property - resolver *
This is the designator for a function responsible for resolving named properties like \p {Number} .
If CL - PPCRE encounters a \p or a \ P it expects to see an opening curly brace immediately afterwards and will then read everything following that brace until it sees a closing curly brace .
The resolver function will be called with this string and must return a corresponding unary test function which accepts a character as its argument and returns a true value if and only if the character has the named property .
If the resolver returns NIL instead , it signals that a property of that name is unknown .
* ( labels ( ( char - code - odd -p ( char ) ( oddp ( char - code char ) ) ) ( char - code - even -p ( char ) ( evenp ( char - code char ) ) ) ( resolver ( name ) ( cond ( ( string= name " odd " ) # ' char - code - odd - p ) ( ( string= name " even " ) # ' char - code - even - p ) ( ( string= name " true " ) ( constantly t ) ) ( t ( error " Ca n't resolve ~ S.

( list ( regex - replace - all ( create - scanner " \\p{odd} " ) " abcd " " + " ) ( regex - replace - all ( create - scanner " \\p{even} " ) " abcd " " + " ) ( regex - replace - all ( create - scanner " \\p{true} " ) " abcd " " + " ) ) ) ) ( " +b+d " " a+c + " " ++++ " )
If the value of *PROPERTY - RESOLVER * is NIL ( which is the default ) , \p and \P in regex strings will simply be treated like p or P as in CL - PPCRE 1.4.1 and earlier .
Note that this does not affect the validity of ( : PROPERTY < name > ) parts in S - expression syntax .
[ Accessor ]
parse - tree - synonym symbol => parse - tree
( setf ( parse - tree - synonym symbol ) new - parse - tree )
Any symbol ( unless it 's a keyword with a special meaning in parse trees ) can be made a " synonym " , i.e. an abbreviation , for another parse tree by this accessor .
PARSE - TREE -SYNONYM returns NIL if symbol is n't a synonym yet .

[ Macro ]
define - parse - tree - synonym name parse - tree => parse - tree
This is a convenience macro for parse tree synonyms defined as ( defmacro define - parse - tree - synonym ( name parse - tree ) `( eval - when ( : compile - toplevel : load - toplevel : execute ) ( setf ( parse - tree - synonym ' , name ) ' , parse - tree ) ) ) so you can write code like this : ( define - parse - tree - synonym a-z ( : char - class ( : range # \a # \z ) ( : range # \ A # \Z ) ) ) ( define - parse - tree - synonym a - z* ( : greedy - repetition 0 nil a - z ) ) ( defun ascii - char - tester ( string ) ( scan '( : sequence : start - anchor a - z* : end- anchor ) string ) )
[ Special variable ]
* regex - char - code - limit *
This variable controls whether scanners take into account all characters of your CL implementation or only those the CHAR - CODE of which is not larger than its value .
The default is CHAR - CODE - LIMIT , and you might see significant speed and space improvements during scanner creation if , say , your target strings only contain ISO - 8859 - 1 characters and you 're using a Lisp implementation where CHAR - CODE - LIMIT has a value much higher than 256 .
The test suite will automatically set * REGEX - CHAR - CODE-LIMIT * to 256 while you 're running the default test .
Note :
Due to the nature of LOAD - TIME - VALUE and the compiler macro for SCAN and other functions , some scanners might be created in a null lexical environment at load time or at compile time so be careful to which value * REGEX - CHAR - CODE -LIMIT * is bound at that time .
The default value should always yield correct results unless you play dirty tricks with implementation - dependent behaviour , though .
[ Special variable ]
*use - bmh - matchers *
Usually , the scanners created by CREATE - SCANNER ( or implicitly by other functions and macros ) will use the standard function SEARCH to check for constant strings at the start or end of the regular expression .
If *USE - BMH - MATCHERS * is true ( the default is NIL ) , fast Boyer - Moore - Horspool matchers will be used instead .
This will usually be faster but can make the scanners considerably bigger .
Per BMH matcher - there can be up to two per scanner - a fixnum array of size * REGEX - CHAR - CODE -LIMIT * is allocated and closed over .
Note :
Due to the nature of LOAD - TIME - VALUE and the compiler macro for SCAN and other functions , some scanners might be created in a null lexical environment at load time or at compile time so be careful to which value * USE - BMH - MATCHERS * is bound at that time .
[ Special variable ]
* optimize - char - classes *
Whether character classes should be compiled into look - ups into O ( 1 ) data structures .
This is usually fast but will be costly in terms of scanner creation time and might be costly in terms of size if * REGEX - CHAR - CODE -LIMIT * is high .
This value will be used as the kind keyword argument to CREATE - OPTIMIZED - TEST - FUNCTION - see there for the possible non- NIL values .
The default value ( NIL ) should usually be fine unless you 're sure that you absolutely have to optimize some character classes for speed .
Note :
Due to the nature of LOAD - TIME - VALUE and the compiler macro for SCAN and other functions , some scanners might be created in a null lexical environment at load time or at compile time so be careful to which value * OPTIMIZE - CHAR - CLASSES * is bound at that time .
[ Special variable ]
* allow - quoting *
If this value is true ( the default is NIL ) , CL - PPCRE will support \Q and \E in regex strings to quote ( disable ) metacharacters .
Note that this entails a slight performance penalty when creating scanners because ( a copy of ) the regex string is modified ( probably more than once ) before it is fed to the parser .
Also , the parser 's syntax error messages will complain about the converted string and not about the original regex string .
* ( scan " ^a + $ " " a+ " )
NIL * ( let ( ( * allow - quoting * t ) ) ;; we use CREATE - SCANNER because of Lisps like SBCL that do n't have an interpreter ( scan ( create - scanner " ^\\Qa+\\E $ " ) " a + " ) ) 0 2 #( ) #() * ( let ( ( * allow - quoting * t ) ) ( scan ( create - scanner " \ \Qa ( ) \\E (?#comment\\Q ) a ** b " ) " ( ) ab " ) )
Quantifier '*' not allowed at position 19 in string " a\\(\\ ) (?#commentQ ) a**b "
Note how in the last example the regex string in the error message is different from the first argument to the SCAN function .
Also note that the second example might be easier to understand ( and Lisp - ier ) if you write it like this : * ( scan '( : sequence : start - anchor " a + " ;; no quoting necessary : end-anchor ) " a+ " ) 0 2 #( ) #()
Make sure you also read the relevant section in " Bugs and problems . "
Note :
Due to the nature of LOAD - TIME - VALUE and the compiler macro for SCAN and other functions , some scanners might be created in a null lexical environment at load time or at compile time so be careful to which value * ALLOW - QUOTING * is bound at that time .
[ Special variable ]
* allow - named - registers *
If this value is true ( the default is NIL ) , CL - PPCRE will support ( ? < name > " < regex > " ) and \k < name > in regex strings to provide named registers and back - references as in AllegroCL .
name is has to start with a letter and can contain only alphanumeric characters or minus sign .
Names of registers are matched case - sensitively .
The parse tree syntax is not affected by the *ALLOW - NAMED - REGISTERS * switch , : NAMED -REGISTER and : BACK - REFERENCE forms are always resolved as expected .
There are also no restrictions on register names in this syntax except that they have to be strings . ;;
Perl compatible mode ( * ALLOW - NAMED-REGISTERS * is NIL ) * ( create - scanner " ( ? < reg > . * ) " )

Due to the nature of LOAD - TIME - VALUE and the compiler macro for SCAN and other functions , some scanners might be created in a null lexical environment at load time or at compile time so be careful to which value * ALLOW - NAMED - REGISTERS * is bound at that time .
[ Special variable ]
* look - ahead - for - suffix *
Given a regular expression which has a constant suffix , such as ( a|b ) + x whose constant suffix is x , the scanners created by CREATE - SCANNER will attempt to optimize by searching for the position of the suffix prior to performing the full match .
In many cases , this is an optimization , especially when backtracking is involved on small strings .
However , in other cases , such as incremental parsing of a very large string , this can cause a degradation in performance , because the entire string is searched for the suffix before an otherwise easy prefix match failure can occur .
The variable * LOOK - AHEAD - FOR - SUFFIX * , whose default is T , can be used to selectively control this behavior .
Note :
Due to the nature of LOAD - TIME - VALUE and the compiler macro for SCAN and other functions , some scanners might be created in a null lexical environment at load time or at compile time so be careful to which value * LOOK - AHEAD - FOR - SUFFIX * is bound at that time .
[ Function ]
parse - string string => parse - tree
Converts the regex string string into a parse tree .
Note that the result is usually one possible way of creating an equivalent parse tree and not necessarily the " canonical " one .
Specifically , the parse tree might contain redundant parts which are supposed to be excised when a scanner is created .
[ Function ]
create - optimized - test - function test - function &key start end kind => function
Given a unary test function test - function which is applicable to characters returns a function which yields the same boolean results for all characters with character codes from start to ( excluding ) end .
If kind is NIL , test - function will simply be returned .
Otherwise , kind should be one of : :HASH -TABLE
The function builds a hash table representing all characters which satisfy the test and returns a closure which checks if a character is in that hash table .
:CHARSET
Instead of a hash table the function uses a " charset " which is a data structure using non-linear hashing and optimized to represent ( sparse ) sets of characters in a fast and space - efficient way ( contributed by Nikodemus Siivola ) .
:CHARMAP
Instead of a hash table the function uses a bit vector to represent the set of characters .
You can also use : HASH - TABLE * or : CHARSET * which are like :HASH - TABLE and :CHARSET but use the complement of the set if the set contains more than half of all characters between start and end .
This saves space but needs an additional pass across all characters to create the data structure .
There is no corresponding : CHARMAP * kind as the bit vectors are already created to cover the smallest possible interval which contains either the set or its complement .
See also * OPTIMIZE -CHAR-CLASSES * .
[ Function ]
quote - meta - chars string => string '
This is a simple utility function used when * ALLOW - QUOTING * is true .
It returns a string STRING ' where all non-word characters ( everything except ASCII characters , digits and underline ) of STRING are quoted by prepending a backslash similar to Perl 's quotemeta function .
It always returns a fresh string .
* ( quote - meta - chars " [ a - z ] * " ) " \\[a\\-z\\ ] \ \ * "
[ Function ]
regex - apropos regex &optional packages &key case - insensitive => list
Like APROPOS but searches for interned symbols which match the regular expression regex .
The output is implementation - dependent .
If case - insensitive is true ( which is the default ) and regex is n't already a scanner , a case - insensitive scanner is used .
Here are examples for CMUCL : * * package * #< The COMMON - LISP - USER package , 16/21 internal , 0/9 external > * ( defun foo ( n &optional ( k 0 ) ) (+ 3 n k ) ) FOO * ( defparameter foo " bar " ) FOO * ( defparameter | foobar| 42 ) | foobar| * ( defparameter fooboo 43 ) FOOBOO * ( defclass frobar ( ) ( ) )

[ Function ]
regex - apropos - list regex &optional packages &key upcase => list
Like APROPOS -LIST
but searches for interned symbols which match the regular expression regex .
If case - insensitive is true ( which is the default ) and regex is n't already a scanner , a case - insensitive scanner is used .

[ Condition type ]
ppcre-error
Every error signaled by CL - PPCRE is of type PPCRE - ERROR .
This is a direct subtype of SIMPLE - ERROR without any additional slots or options .
[ Condition type ]
ppcre-invocation - error
Errors of type PPCRE - INVOCATION - ERROR are signaled if one of the exported functions of CL - PPCRE is called with wrong or inconsistent arguments .
This is a direct subtype of PPCRE - ERROR without any additional slots or options .
[ Condition type ]
ppcre-syntax - error
An error of type PPCRE - SYNTAX - ERROR is signaled if CL - PPCRE 's parser encounters an error when trying to parse a regex string or to convert a parse tree into its internal representation .
This is a direct subtype of PPCRE - ERROR with two additional slots .
These denote the regex string which HTML - PPCRE was parsing and the position within the string where the error occurred .
If the error happens while CL - PPCRE is converting a parse tree , both of these slots contain NIL .
( See the next two entries on how to access these slots . )
As many syntax errors can't be detected before the parser is at the end of the stream , the row and column usually denote the last position where the parser was happy and not the position where it gave up .
* ( handler - case ( scan " foo * * x " " fooox " ) ( ppcre- syntax - error ( condition ) ( format t " Houston , we 've got a problem with the string ~S :~ % ~
Looks like something went wrong at position ~ A . ~ %~
The last message we received was \ " ~ ?\ " . " ( ppcre- syntax - error - string condition ) ( ppcre- syntax - error - pos condition ) ( simple- condition -format - control condition ) ( simple-condition -format-arguments condition ) ) ( values ) ) )
Houston , we 've got a problem with the string " foo* * x " :
Looks like something went wrong at position 4 .
The last message we received was " Quantifier '*' not allowed . " .
[ Function ]
ppcre-syntax - error - string condition => string
If condition is a condition of type PPCRE - SYNTAX - ERROR , this function will return the string the parser was parsing when the error was encountered ( or NIL if the error happened while trying to convert a parse tree ) .
This might be particularly useful when * ALLOW - QUOTING * is true because in this case the offending string might not be the one you gave to the CREATE - SCANNER function .
[ Function ]
ppcre - syntax - error - pos condition => number
If condition is a condition of type PPCRE - SYNTAX - ERROR , this function will return the position within the string where the error occurred ( or NIL if the error happened while trying to convert a parse tree ) .

UNICODE -PROPERTY -RESOLVER
See the CL - UNICODE documentation for information about the supported Unicode properties and how they are named .
[ Function ]
unicode - property - resolver property - name => function - or- nil
A property resolver which understands Unicode properties using CL - UNICODE's PROPERTY - TEST function .
This resolver is automatically installed in * PROPERTY - RESOLVER * when the CL - PPCRE - UNICODE system is loaded .
* ( scan - to - strings " \\p{Script : Latin} + " " 0 + AB _ * " ) " AB " #()
Note that this symbol is exported from the CL - PPCRE - UNICODE package and not from the CL - PPCRE package .
A filter is defined by its filter function which must be a function of one argument .
During the parsing process this function might be called once or several times or it might not be called at all .
If it 's called , its argument is an integer pos which is the current position within the target string .
The filter can either return NIL ( which means that the subexpression represented by this filter did n't match ) or an integer not smaller than pos for success .
A zero - length assertion should return pos itself while a filter which wants to consume N characters should return (+ POS N ) .
If you supply the optional value length and it is not NIL , then this is a promise to the regex engine that your filter will always consume exactly length characters .
The regex engine might use this information for optimization purposes but it is otherwise irrelevant to the outcome of the matching process .
The filter function can access the following special variables from its code body :
CL - PPCRE ::* STRING *
The target ( a string ) of the current matching process .
CL - PPCRE ::* START -POS * and CL - PPCRE ::* END - POS *
The start and end ( integers ) indices of the current matching process .
These correspond to the START and END keyword parameters of SCAN .
CL - PPCRE ::* REAL - START-POS *
The initial starting position .
This is only relevant for repeated scans ( as in DO - SCANS ) where CL - PPCRE ::* START - POS * will be moved forward while CL - PPCRE ::* REAL - START - POS * wo n't .
For normal scans the value of this variable is NIL .
CL - PPCRE ::* REG - STARTS * and CL - PPCRE ::* REG - ENDS *
Two simple vectors which denote the start and end indices of registers within the regular expression .
The first register is indexed by 0 .
If a register has n't matched yet , then its corresponding entry in CL - PPCRE ::* REG - STARTS * is NIL .
Note that the names of the variables are not exported from the CL - PPCRE package because there 's no explicit guarantee that they will be available in future releases .

What gives ?
" \ \Q...\\E " in CL - PPCRE should only be used in literal strings .
If you want to quote arbitrary strings , try CL - INTERPOL or use QUOTE - META-CHARS :

The advantage of this mode is that you 'll get a much smaller image and most likely faster code .
( But note that CL - PPCRE needs to do a small amount of work to massage AllegroCL 's output into the format expected by CL - PPCRE . )
The downside is that your code wo n't be fully compatible with CL - PPCRE anymore .
Here are some of the differences ( most of which probably do n't matter very often ) :
To use the AllegroCL compatibility mode you have to
( push :use-acl-regexp2-engine * features * )
A lot of hackers ( especially users of Perl and other scripting languages ) think that regular expressions are the greatest thing since sliced bread and use it for almost everything .
That is just plain wrong .
Other hackers ( especially Lispers ) tend to think that regular expressions are the work of the devil and try to avoid them at all cost .
That 's also wrong .
Regular expressions are a handy and useful addition to your toolkit which you should use when appropriate - you should just try to figure out first if they 're appropriate for the task at hand .
If you 're concerned about the string syntax of regular expressions which can look like line noise and is really hard to read for long expressions , consider using CL - PPCRE 's S -expression syntax instead .
It is less error - prone and you do n't have to worry about escaping characters .
It is also easier to manipulate programmatically .
For alternations , order is important .
The general rule is that the regex engine tries from left to right and tries to match as much as possible .
CL - USER 1 > ( scan - to - strings " < =| ( scan - to - strings "
CL - PPCRE uses compiler macros to pre-compile scanners at load time if possible .
This happens if the compiler can determine that the regular expression ( no matter if it's a string or an S - expression ) is constant at compile time and is intended to save the time for creating scanners at execution time ( probably creating the same scanner over and over in a loop ) .
Make sure you do n't prevent the compiler from helping you .
For example , a definition like this one is usually not a good idea : ( defun regex - match ( regex target ) ;; do n't do that !
( scan regex target ) )
If you want to search for a substring in a large string or if you search for the same string very often , SCAN will usually be faster than Common Lisp 's SEARCH if you use BMH matchers .
However , this only makes sense if scanner creation time is not the limiting factor , i.e. if the search target is very large or if you 're using the same scanner very often .
will usually be faster than Common Lisp 's if you use BMH matchers .
However , this only makes sense if scanner creation time is not the limiting factor , i.e. if the search target is very large or if you 're using the same scanner very often .
Complementary to the last hint , do n't use regular expressions for one - time searches for constant strings .
That 's a terrible waste of resources .
* USE - BMH-MATCHERS * together with a large value for * REGEX - CHAR - CODE -LIMIT * can lead to huge scanners .
together with a large value for can lead to huge scanners .
A character class is by default translated into a sequence of tests exactly as you might expect .
For example , " [ af - l\\d ] " means to test if the character is equal to #\a , then to test if it 's between #\f and #\l , then if it 's a digit .
There 's by default no attempt to remove redundancy ( as in " [ a - ge - kf ] " ) or to otherwise optimize these tests for speed .
However , you can play with * OPTIMIZE - CHAR - CLASSES * if you 've identified character classes as a bottleneck and want to make sure that you have O ( 1 ) test functions .

There 's by default no attempt to remove redundancy ( as in ) or to otherwise optimize these tests for speed .
However , you can play with if you 've identified character classes as a bottleneck and want to make sure that you have O ( 1 ) test functions .
If you know that the expression you 're looking for is anchored , use anchors in your regex .
This can help the engine a lot to make your scanners more efficient .
In addition to anchors , constant strings at the start or end of a regular expression can help the engine to quickly scan a string .
Note that for example " ( a - d|aebf ) " and " ab( cd|ef ) " are equivalent , but only the second form has a constant start the regex engine can recognize .
and are equivalent , but only the second form has a constant start the regex engine can recognize .
Try to avoid alternations if possible or at least factor them out as in the example above .
If neither anchors nor constant strings are in sight , maybe " standalone " ( sometimes also called " possessive " ) regular expressions can be helpful .
Try the following : ( let ( ( target ( make - string 10000 : initial - element # \a ) ) ( scanner - 1 ( create - scanner " a* \\d " ) ) ( scanner - 2 ( create - scanner " ( ?>a*) \\d " ) ) ) ( time ( scan scanner - 1 target ) ) ( time ( scan scanner - 2 target ) ) )
Consider using " single - line mode " if it makes sense for your task .
By default ( following Perl 's practice ) , a dot means to search for any character except line breaks .
In single - line mode a dot searches for any character which in some cases means that large parts of the target can actually be skipped .
This can be vastly more efficient for large targets .
Do n't use capturing register groups where a non-capturing group would do , i.e. only use registers if you need to refer to them later .
If you use a register , each scan process needs to allocate space for it and update its contents ( possibly many times ) until it 's finished .
( In Perl parlance - use " ( ?: foo ) " instead of " ( foo ) " whenever possible . )
instead of whenever possible . )
In addition to what has been said in the last hint , note that Perl semantics force the regex engine to report the last match for each register .
This implies for example that " ( [ a - c ] ) + " and " [ a - c ] * ( [ a - c ] ) " have exactly the same semantics but completely different performance characteristics .
( Actually , in some cases CL - PPCRE automatically converts expressions from the first type into the second type .
That 's not always possible , though , and you should n't rely on it . )
and have exactly the same semantics but completely different performance characteristics .
( Actually , in some cases CL - PPCRE automatically converts expressions from the first type into the second type .
That 's not always possible , though , and you should n't rely on it . )
By default , repetitions are " greedy " in Perl ( and thus in CL - PPCRE ) .
This has an impact on performance and also on the actual outcome of a scan .
Look at your repetitions and ponder if a greedy repetition is really what you want .

BACK TO THE HOMEPAGE
February 28 , 2007
With waterfront property highly prized the world over , we see the amphibious market as one of the next great opportunities – the people with the greatest disposable income will have the greatest need for amphibians .
At the same time , new techniques , technologies and materials are yielding a new breed of amphibious craft that are seemingly omnipotent .
Most amphibious craft to date have been biased towards performance on land ( such as the Splash , Commander , Amphicar , Platypus , Aquada and Humdinger ) or water ( such as the Aerosan or Sealegs here , and here ) .
Only the Quadski seems to have a balance of performance on both , and it is limited to one , perhaps two people .
Now a new technology threatens to seriously disrupt this marketplace .
Fast Track Amphibian has entered the development phase for a product line of all - terrain amphibious vehicles using tracks as their means of propulsion on both water and land .
Nearly all other amphibians comprise two drive systems – the FastTrack does it all with one , gaining a significant advantage in weight .
The patent - pending technology that enables the tracks to work as the sole means of high - speed propulsion on water is unique .
It enables a vehicle to “ get out of the hole , over the hump and on to the plane from dead in the water .
Videos of what this means in the real world can be found here .
FastTrack equipped vehicles can start , stop and cruise on water like a boat as well as traverse diverse terrain , from ice and snow to swamps , deep mud , mountains and deserts - all at very high speeds .
The first technology demonstrator can achieve 39 mph on water and 55 mph on land , all in comfort thanks to the air shocks and massive suspension system , which can be retracted or extended to suit the circumstance .
The technology demonstrator carries six people at high - speed almost anywhere , giving it seemingly limitless opportunity in the areas of recreation , utility , search and rescue , ship - to - shore and military operations .
Potential recreational uses include sports and racing , hunting and fishing , wilderness touring and camping .
This vehicle will take you up a muddy hill in the forest better than a motorcycle , take swamp and tundra and ice and snow in its stride and enter and exit the water in almost any conditions … it is a genuine all terrain vehicle and transitions from one medium to another seamlessly .
It makes very soft , comfortable , water entries at 40 mph and similarly smooth egresses at 20 mph .
The first vehicles the company produces for non-military customers will be hand built and custom made for those who can afford to be the first owners of this unique machine .
These vehicles will have aggressive styling , two or five place plush seating and 300 plus horsepower for speeds of 60 mph on water and 80 mph on land .
More videos are available here , showing the FastTrack 1 driving down a country road , running on powder snow , pulling two water skiers , on the plane with tracks down and tracks up , a ramp entry into water at over 40 mph , and watch how easily it crosses this river .
This short video shows the beastie doing 37 mph on water .
FastTrack 1 uses elongated rubber snow mobile tracks and is currently powered by a 148 horsepower snowmobile engine .
A 350 horsepower Chevrolet Corvette engine and a hybrid drive train are ready for installation in the Fast Track for a run at the world water speed record for amphibious vehicles later this year .
Testing indicates that speeds of over 60 miles per hour are possible with 250 horsepower .
Sponsorships for the water speed record attempt are available .
There is also the opportunity to set the Channel Crossing record for tracked amphibians and take the overall amphibious vehicle record currently held by Sealegs .
Potential partners and sponsors are invited to contact Ken Wernicke ..
The FastTrack company is not your normal company .
Located in Hurst , Texas ( between Dallas and Fort Worth ) , FastTrack was founded by Ken and Rod Wernicke , both retired engineers from Bell Helicopter .
Ken led the design and development of the XV - 15 and V - 22 Osprey tilt - rotors and Rod , his identical twin brother , was also instrumental in the development of tilt - rotor technology .
Keith , Kent and Tim , their engineer / inventor sons , are also in the company .
Research and development began after the Wernickes answered a Navy request for information on concepts for a scout vehicle that could travel on water at high speed and proceed with all terrain capability for reconnaissance on land .
The Wernickes conducted research for ten years before fabricating the first Fast Track vehicle , a full - scale demonstrator model , FastTrack 1 .
Two and a half years of land and water testing have proven the concept .
FastTrack 1 has pulled two water skiers .
It has gone from a standstill to 27 mph with six people on board , and to 39 mph with one .
Also in the works are plans to build a personal sized vehicle - ATV / Snowmobile / Personal Water Craft .
This vehicle will be less than half the weight of the FastTrack 1 .
The potential market for this vehicle is so large that mass production would be needed and FastTrack’s .
Recreational uses for Fast Track Technology include sports , hunting and fishing , wilderness touring and camping .
In addition the vehicle can be used by law enforcement for patrolling coastal and border areas .
It is ideally suited for flood and hurricane rescue .
A hurricane rescue vehicle is envisioned with a 600 hp engine , at a gross weight of 7000 lbs. , carrying a crew of two and seating 10 passenger / evacuees .
A vehicle of that size would also have multiple military uses .
In addition , there could be revolutionary transport opportunities for utility , cargo and personnel transport for operations in the arctic tundra and other seasonally inaccessible places .
Analytical studies indicated that Fast Track technology would be applicable to vehicles as large as 25,000 lb gross weight .
Using tracks as the sole means of propulsion has several advantages , over wheel / water jet or propeller amphibians and provides the best all terrain capabilities .
And how much will they cost ?
“ Price is very much a function of volume , ” says FastTrack ’s Keith Wernicke .
“ We think that an ATV / Snowmobile / Personal Water Craft vehicle could sell nearly million copies a year world wide .
“ At that kind of volume the price would be approx 50 % more than a top of the line Utility ATV .
At lower volumes they would cost about as much as a mid priced car .
“ The custom car sized vehicle would be in the " If you have to ask you can't afford it " price range of US $ 250,000 and up . ”
FastTrack is seeking suitable partners to help fulfil the market potential of this product .
Interested parties should contact Ken Wernicke .

... the surface of the water will at first be flat , as before the bucket began to move ; but after that , the bucket by gradually communicating its motion to the water , will make it begin to revolve , and recede little by little from the centre , and ascend up the sides of the bucket , forming itself into a concave figure ( as I have experienced ) , and the swifter the motion becomes , the higher will the water rise , till at last , performing its revolutions in the same time with the vessel , it becomes relatively at rest in it .

I do not define time , space , place , and motion , as they are well known to all .
Absolute space by its own nature , without reference to anything external , always remains similar and unmovable .
It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover and effectually to distinguish the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent , because the parts of that immovable space in which these motions are performed do by no means come under the observations of our senses .
I grant there is a difference between absolute true motion of a body and a mere relative change of its situation with respect to another body .

If we think of the Earth at rest and the other celestial bodies revolving around it , there is no flattening of the Earth ... at least according to our usual conception of the law of inertia .
Now one can solve the difficulty in two ways ; either all motion is absolute , or our law of inertia is wrongly expressed ... I [ prefer ] the second .
The law of inertia must be so conceived that exactly the same thing results from the second supposition as from the first .

Newton 's experiment with the rotating water bucket teaches us only that the rotation of water relative to the bucket walls does not stir any noticeable centrifugal forces ; these are prompted , however , by its rotation relative to the mass of the Earth and the other celestial bodies .
Nobody can say how the experiment would turn out , both quantitatively and qualitatively , if the bucket walls became increasingly thicker and more massive -- eventually several miles thick .

Some of you know that I ’m a developer on Adium .
( Hopefully all of you ; it is mentioned in the sidebar . ;)
Adium has a feature called “ message history ” .
When you open a new chat with a person , message history shows you the last n messages from your previous chat with that person .
Since 1.0 ( which changed message history to draw from the logs rather than separate storage and changed the log format to be XML rather than bastardized HTML — more info on the Adium blog post ) , message history has been implemented using a library that I wrote called LMX .
LMX is a reverse XML parser .
Whereas most XML parsers ( AFAIK , all of them except LMX ) parse the XML data from the start to the end , LMX parses it from the end to the start .
Thus , while characters are kept in their original order ( “ foo ” will still be “ foo ” ; it will not become “ oof ” ) , everything else is reported in the reverse order : elements close before they are opened , and appear from last to first .
All this is by design , so that Adium can retrieve the last n message elements without having to parse all the message elements before them .
Today , LMX gets its very own webpage ( not just a page on the Adium wiki , but a real webpage ) , and is released at version 1.0 .
It ’s the same code as shipped with Adium 1.0.1 , but shined up into a release tarball .
So , if you too ever find yourself in desperate need of a reverse XML parser , now there is one .

Functional specs subvert the hierarchy of nature Matt 45 comments Latest by daan
The other week I got some interesting perspective on the Functional Spec debate from an unlikely source : a comparison of code law and common law .
First , some background : No Functional Spec was the first Getting Real piece of advice ever written here .
It ’s also the subject of an essay in our new book and Jason addressed it during his Q&A session at SXSW ( you can hear near the end of this podcast ) .
Still , it ’s one of the more controversial aspects of Getting Real .
People argue it ’s reckless and that functional specs are a necessity .
So what ’s code / common law got to do with it ?
Here ’s a very basic explanation of the legalese :
Code law is based on a system of codified written laws .
The rules are set and that ’s that .
Common law , on the other hand , is based on a series of ongoing decisions ( like the legal system here in the US ) .
So we ’ve got a rigid system that ’s set in stone vs. a flexible one that reacts and responds to real - world situations .
Sounds familiar , eh ?
The bit that got me thinking was a passage in a book by Alan Watts , a philosopher and writer .
In it , he tries to explain why common law is superior :
Common law rests ultimately upon the judge ’s intuitive feeling for equity .
Every case is unique , and no code or set of fixed principle can provide for every eventuality .
The deciding factor is therefore something far more subtle and complex than any formulation of rules can be — the judge ’s brain , assisted by precedents and rules .
Code law , as well as authoritarian and traditionalist ethics , subverts the hierarchy of nature .
It gives greater trust and authority to the relatively crude and rigid structure of verbal rules than to the infinitely more fluid and complex structure of the brain , the organism , and the field in which they live .
In the first study of its kind , researchers have found that peyote – for now , the only legal hallucinogenic drug in the United States – does n't rob regular users of brain power over time .
While the findings do n't directly indicate anything about the safety of psychedelic drugs like LSD and mushrooms , they do suggest that at least one hallucinogen is OK to use for months or even years .
" We really were n't able to find any ( mental ) deficits , " said Dr. John Halpern , associate director of substance abuse research at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Massachusetts , and co-author of the study , released today in the Nov. 4 issue of the journal Biological Psychiatry .
Hallucinogenic drugs have long fascinated researchers , who are now studying whether they hold the potential to treat mental illnesses like depression and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
But little is known about the long - term effects of hallucinogenic use .
Part of the problem is that many users – such as LSD aficionados – take a variety of other drugs , so it 's hard to tease out the specific effects of psychedelic drugs .
Enter peyote , currently the only hallucinogenic drug legally allowed for use outside research labs ( although that may change ) .
Compared with LSD and mushrooms , peyote is a bit obscure , with its use – at least legally – limited to the sacramental rites of the Native American Church , which has as many as 300,000 members .
Many peyote users do n't take other drugs , making them ideal subjects for hallucinogenic research .
Peyote comes from the crowns of a cactus that grows in northern Mexico and parts of Texas .
Harvesters cut off the crown , dry it and sell it in " buttons , " Halpern said .
Generally , users eat the buttons whole or grind them up into a powder that can be mixed into food or brewed into a tea .
When enough peyote is eaten , users enter a hallucinogenic state thanks to its active ingredient , the chemical mescaline .
Halpern and colleagues recruited three groups of Navajos – 61 members of the Native American Church who regularly ate peyote , 36 alcoholics who have been dry for at least two months and 79 people who reported little or no use of alcohol or drugs .
The researchers then gave mental - health and cognitive tests to the subjects .
Only the alcoholics showed signs of brain problems .
On the psychological front , Native American peyote users were actually in better shape emotionally than those who did n't use the drug .
Why ?
For one thing , the church provides plenty of emotional support to members , said Dennis J. McKenna , senior lecturer at the University of Minnesota 's Center for Spirituality & Healing .
For another , Native American users are careful about how they use peyote .
" The context of the use is a really important thing , " McKenna said .
" Most people using mushrooms or LSD in a recreational way do n't really have a context for this type of use , " such as an emphasis on setting , à la psychedelic guru Timothy Leary .
By contrast , both alcohol and marijuana are considered bad for the brain if overused .
Although there 's still plenty of debate , some research suggests heavy pot use can harm memory for days after the last toke .
And , of course , there 's the anecdotal evidence of brain damage from everyone who 's known a Jeff Spicoli - type stoner .
Marijuana damage seems to be temporary , while alcohol - related damage appears to be more permanent , said study co-author Dr. Harrison Pope Jr. , director of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at McLean Hospital .
The jury 's still out , he said , on what damage LSD does to the brain , if any , and for how long .
Both researchers cautioned that the peyote findings should n't make anyone think LSD and mushrooms are safe .
The drugs are chemically different and appear to work differently too .
Neither Pope nor Halpern , for example , has ever heard of a peyote user having a flashback .
Even a person with memory impairment would likely remember that .
We all live in the same house .
We have a bunk - bed double on the bottom and single on the top .
Husband , first wife and the " ON " wife sleep on the bottom and the other two " OFF " wives sleep above .
We find this very intimate as we all are sleeping in the same bed though on different levels and we can still feel and hear what is happening when sex happens in our bed .
Relationships between us sisterwives are in the main quite good as our first wife Hanna is the main force in our household and will settle most of the disputes between the other wives herself without our husband being involved .
There are jealousies - this is inevitable between any group of women living closely together .
Our husband does his best to be fair to all of us but we all have our own opinion of what is fair , do n't we .
Sex , now that is the big one .
In our household we have one week ( but only on six days we can have sex with him ) sleeping with our husband and three weeks off .
Our first wife has the Saturdays with our husband in addition to her week so she gets four extra days with him in each cycle .
That 's why she sleeps on the lower bunk every night with the " ON " wife .
In reality we have sex in an average week about two to three times in the six days we can have sex with our husband .
Though it 's not totally satisfying ( two or three times a month ) for us we do find that having a week with our husband is the better method then the one - night method used by others .
Money , well we have four incomes in our household .
Our husband Brian is an accountant , first wife Hanna is the deputy headteacher at the local elementary school , second wife Mary is a nurse , I 'm the stay - at - home wife ( I look after the children under school age and do the cleaning , washing and generally look after the house ) , that 's my job , fourth wife Mary - Jane , she is a teacher at the same elementary school as Hanna .
On Sunday and when the other wives come home they do the ironing , some of the cooking and the gardening .
All income from the wives goes into the same account and each wife gets the same allowance for their personal needs , the rest is saved for special events and needs for us wives .
Husband 's income pays for all the household bills as would be normal in any marriage and he has his allowance that comes from his account .
No , we do n't have physical relationships between sisterwives because its not permitted in our religion .
We sleep with our arms on top of our bed covers so it does n't happen .
And in any case if any wife was foolish enough to try all would feel it in our bed ; a simple rule - no touching or kissing in bed or at any other time between one woman and another sisterwife and another .
As for sex , no we do n't get very much actual sex , ie , our husband entering us , but he does work very hard and sometimes quite late so a wife cannot expect him to perform every night .
I love being in a polygamy family and my sisterwives agree with me .
The downside is the sex , not the quality , I have no complaints about that , but just the quantity and we all know that it will get worse when the final two wives join in the next two to three years .
Then it will be like two to three times in six weeks .
As you go higher in the temple government the more wives you have to have and as our husband has been appointed as group treasurer and deputy convenor of our temple it means he now must have six wives .
Us wives get no say in how many wives our husband has but we do have a big say in who joins us - as a sisterwife it 's really the only power we have .
The United States has more than 30 million adult runners -- plenty of active feet to fuel a $ 18.1 billion - a- year athletic shoe industry , according to the NDP Group , a global provider of consumer - industry information .
Among the thundering hordes , however , a small but growing number are foregoing shoes altogether , following in the footsteps of self - pronounced " barefooters " like Ken Bob Saxton , who has been running marathons barefoot since 1997 .
Saxton doffed his sneakers for reasons of comfort , he said .
Many others , however , regard going barefoot as an ideal way to remain in touch with nature -- a phenomenon that in Europe has led to the emergence of parks designated specifically for barefoot hiking and exploration .
Whether a fleeting fad or a therapeutic revelation , most can agree that running barefoot is anatomically natural , said Neil Sharkey , Penn State professor of kinesiology .
After all , Sharkey noted , people are n't born with shoes on .
In fact , " Some evidence suggests that people who run with shoes may be more prone to chronic injuries and acute ankle sprains than people who run barefoot , " he said .
Thick layers of padding and stabilizing devices can hinder as well as protect .
Research in the so - called Pose Method of running , a relatively new technique that focuses on the laws of nature and gravity , shows that wearing shoes can sometimes force the feet into unnatural positions , he explained .
" When most people run in shoes , they tend to hit the ground with their heel first . "
By contrast , when running barefoot , people develop increased awareness ( called proprioception ) and sensitivity that allow them to land more evenly on the entire foot , Sharkey said .
This helps to cushion and absorb the force of impact by using the foot 's natural force - damping mechanisms .
" Depending on how they 're made , shoes can interfere with this natural shock - absorbing mechanism , " he noted .
The sheer weight of shoes also may drag athletes down in competition , giving those who train barefoot a slight edge , Sharkey said .
He cited the case of Abebe Bikila , an Ethiopian marathon runner , who won an Olympic gold medal in 1960 for a race he ran entirely barefoot .
More recently , South African Zola Budd ran barefoot to two world cross-country championships in the 1990s .
For those recreational runners who wish to try running barefoot , Sharkey suggested , the key is to start slow .
The long years of running with shoes take time and effort to counteract .
" [ A runner who is new to barefoot running ] needs to thicken the skin of the foot and also strengthen the ligaments and muscles to better respond to the environment , " he said .
Unfortunately , the available surfaces in developed countries such as the United States are n't always suited for this kind of training .
" Most runners are out there running on the side of the road or on pavement , under conditions where they really run the risk of stepping on broken glass or nails , " Sharkey warned .
To counter this problem ( and take advantage of a trend ) , footwear giant Nike has developed a lightweight shoe called Free , which is purported to mimic the barefoot experience while still providing a layer of protection .
Proponents suggest that the shoe can increase running performance by stimulating the foot 's natural strength and flexibility .
" This may be so , but I 'm not aware of any strong data supporting this view , " said Sharkey .
" Even a segmented thin - soled shoe can compromise the foot 's natural action .
Without the support of a traditional shoe , this may create even greater problems , especially for beginning runners , " he suggested .
For barefooters at all levels , Sharkey recommends running in a safe place where hazards can be easily spotted .
Athletic facilities with proper upkeep such as a university track or football field are good locations .
" It 's perfectly legitimate to run barefoot where you 're certain there is n't anything that could damage your feet , " he said .
Though switching over too suddenly may risk both pain and injury , Sharkey stressed , if a runner starts small , making gradual adjustments over a course of weeks and months , the soles of the feet can adapt to withstand all kinds of insults that once would have stopped people in their tracks .

Hitchens the Hacker ; And , Hitchens the Orientalist
And , “ We do n’t Want Your Stinking War !
Christopher Hitchens owes me a big apology .
I belong to a private email discussion group called Gulf2000 .
It has academics , journalists and policy makers on it .
It has a strict rule that messages appearing there will not be forwarded off the list .
It is run , edited and moderated by former National Security Council staffer for Carter and Reagan , Gary Sick , now a political scientist at Columbia University .
The “ no - forwarding ” rule is his , and is intended to allow the participants to converse about controversial matters without worrying about being in trouble .
Also , in an informal email discussion , ideas evolve , you make mistakes and they get corrected , etc .
It is a rough , rough draft .
Hitchens somehow hacked into the site , or joined and lurked , or had a crony pass him things .
And he has now made my private email messages the subject of an attack on me in Slate .
( I am not linking to the article because it is highly unethical and Slate does not deserve any direct traffic from my site for it . )
Moreover , he did not even have the decency to quote the final outcome of the discussions .
I ’d like to take this opportunity to complain about the profoundly dishonest character of “ attack journalism . ”
Journalists are supposed to interview the subjects about which they write .
Mr. Hitchens never contacted me about this piece .
He never sought clarification of anything .
He never asked permission to quote my private mail .
Major journalists have a privileged position .
Not just anyone can be published in Slate .
Most academics could not get a gig there ( I ’ve never been asked to write for it ) .
Hitchens is paid to publish there because he is a prominent journalist .
But then he should behave like a journalist , not like a hired gun for the far Right , smearing hapless targets of his ire .
That is n’t journalism .
For some reason it drives the Right absolutely crazy that I keep this little web log , and so they keep trotting out these clowns in amateurish sniping attacks .
It is rather sad , that one person standing up to them puts them into such piranha - like frenzy .
The precise reason for Hitchens ’ theft and publication of my private mail is that I object to the characterization of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as having “ threatened to wipe Israel off the map . ”
I object to this translation of what he said on two grounds .
First , it gives the impression that he wants to play Hitler to Israel ’s Poland , mobilizing an armored corps to move in and kill people .
But the actual quote , which comes from an old speech of Khomeini , does not imply military action , or killing anyone at all .
The second reason is that it is just an inexact translation .
The phrase is almost metaphysical .
He quoted Khomeini that “ the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time . ”
It is in fact probably a reference to some phrase in a medieval Persian poem .
It is not about tanks .
Since Mr. Hitchens wants to splash my private mail all over the internet against my will , as though he were himself an agent of the Bush Administration ’s electronic spying on the private conversations of Americans , I ’m glad to share the message that encapsulates the results of our deliberations at Gulf2000 .
Date : Sun , 23 Apr 2006 15:34:18 - 0400 From : “ Cole , Juan ”
The speech in Persian is here : Sorry that I misremembered the exact phrase Ahmadinejad had used .
He made an analogy to Khomeini ’s determination and success in getting rid of the Shah ’s government , which Khomeini had said “ must go ” ( az bain bayad berad ) .
Then Ahmadinejad defined Zionism not as an Arabi - Israeli national struggle but as a Western plot to divide the world of Islam with Israel as the pivot of this plan .
The phrase he then used as I read it is “ The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem ( een rezhim- e ishghalgar -e qods ) must [ vanish from ] from the page of time ( bayad az safheh - ye ruzgar mahv shavad ) . ”
Ahmadinejad was not making a threat , he was quoting a saying of Khomeini and urging that pro-Palestinian activists in Iran not give up hope– that the occupation of Jerusalem was no more a continued inevitability than had been the hegemony of the Shah ’s government .
Whatever this quotation from a decades - old speech of Khomeini may have meant , Ahmadinejad did not say that “ Israel must be wiped off the map ” with the implication that phrase has of Nazi - style extermination of a people .
He said that the occupation regime over Jerusalem must be erased from the page of time .
Again , Ariel Sharon erased the occupation regime over Gaza from the page of time .
I should again underline that I personally despise everything Ahmadinejad stands for , not to mention the odious Khomeini , who had personal friends of mine killed so thoroughly that we have never recovered their bodies .
Nor do I agree that the Israelis have no legitimate claim on any part of Jerusalem .
And , I am not exactly a pacifist but have a strong preference for peaceful social activism over violence , so needless to say I condemn the sort of terror attacks against innocent civilians ( including Arab Israelis ) that we saw last week .
I have not seen any credible evidence , however , that such attacks are the doing of Ahmadinejad , and in my view they are mainly the result of the expropriation and displacement of the long - suffering Palestinian people .
It is not realistic for Americans to call for Iran to talk directly to the Israeli government ( though in the 1980s the Khomeinists did a lot of business with Israel ) when the US government wo n’t talk directly to the Iranians about most bilateral issues .
In fact , an American willingness to engage in direct talks might well pave the way to an eventual settlement of these outstanding issues .
cheers Juan Cole
I do n’t have any intention of making a point by point reply to Hitchens ’s completely inaccurate screed .
He blames me for not referring to some other speech of Khomeini , when in fact I never instanced any speeches of Khomeini at all in this discussion except the snippet cited by Ahmadinejad– I was arguing that there is no Persian idiom to wipe something off the map , and that Ahmadinejad has been misquoted .
Hitchens imagines a whole discourse of mine ( which mostly never took place ) that he now sets out to refute– from English translations !
But I was saying that the wire service translations were the problem in the first place .
Hitchens seems to think that he can over - rule my reading of a Persian text by reference to some hurried journalist ’s untechnical rendering into English .
Hitchens alleges that I said that Khomeini never called for wiping Israel from the face of the map .
Actually , I never said anything at all about Khomeini ’s own speeches or intentions .
I was solely discussing Ahmadinejad .
Hitchens should please quote me on Khomeini and Israel .
He cannot .
He is making it up out of whole cloth .
He should retract .
I write so much with which the Far Right disagrees so vehemently .
I publish it here .
Why is it that they keep having to invent quotations and put them in my mouth .
Now , Cole is alleged to deny that Khomeini ’s rhetoric was hostile to Israel .
Is that even a plausible allegation ?
But , by the way , Khomeini sold oil to Israel , and Israel sold him weapons and spare parts , and put the Reagan administration up to doing the same thing .
You will note that when Khomeini originally made the statement about the occupation regime over Jerusalem vanishing from the page of time , that was not front page news .
In fact , secret Israeli arms shipments were arriving in Tehran as Khomeini was speaking .
So whatever is going on now is not about the rhetoric , is it ?
Here is what the National Security Archive says about Khomeini and Israel :
‘ Even during the hostage crisis in Tehran , Israel — later the United States ’ partner through much of the Iran initiative — began to strike weapons deals of its own with Iran .
Tel Aviv , like Washington , had a long history of selling arms to the Shah , which Tehran ’s revolutionary government was willing to exploit secretly , despite its public animosity toward the state of Israel .
Reportedly , the United States knew about Israeli transactions during the early 1980s but turned a blind eye .
News accounts alleged later that President Reagan ’s first secretary of state , Alexander Haig , gave Tel Aviv an “ amber light , ” acquiescing in the weapons transfers without officially approving them .
One report stated that Haig gave permission to Israel to sell U.S. - made military spare parts for fighter planes to Iran in early 1981 after discussions between his counselor at the State Department , Robert McFarlane , and Israeli Foreign Ministry official David Kimche .
An Israeli account of the U.S. - backed weapons sales of 1985 - 1986 reports that Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon proposed as early as 1982 that Washington consider an opening to factions in Iran using limited military sales as a vehicle .
The White House apparently declined the suggestion but four years later would be more receptive to a similar proposal brought to McFarlane , then national security advisor , by his long - time counterpart , Kimche . ‘
Note that not only were the Israelis dealing with Khomeini , they are alleged to have been doing so while he was holding American hostages .
Back to Hitchens .
How to explain this peculiar behavior on the part of someone who was at one time one of our great men of letters ?
Well , I do n’t think it is any secret that Hitchens has for some time had a very serious and debilitating drinking problem .
He once showed up drunk to a talk I gave and heckled me .
I can only imagine that he was deep in his cups when he wrote , or had some far Rightwing think tank write , his current piece of yellow journalism .
I am sorry to witness the ruin of a once - fine journalistic mind .
But the other reason for Hitchens ’s piece may be that he has become a warmonger , and it is possible that he wants a US war against Iran .
More on that below .
As for the matter at issue , Ahmadinejad is a non-entity .
The Iranian “ president ” is mostly powerless .
The commander of the armed forces is the Supreme Jurisprudent , Ali Khamenei .
Worrying about Ahmadinejad ’s antics is like worrying that the US military will act on the orders of the secretary of the interior .
Ahmadinejad cannot declare war on anyone , or mobilize a military .
So it does n’t matter what speeches he gives .
Moreover , Iran cannot fight Israel .
It would be defeated in 72 hours , even if the US did n’t come in , which it would ( and rightly so if Israel were attacked ) .
Iran is separated by several other countries from Israel .
It has not attacked aggressively any other country militarily for over a century ( can Americans say that of their own record ? )
It has only a weak , ineffective air force .
So why worry about it ?
What is really going on here is an old trick of the warmongers .
Which is that you equate hurtful statements of your enemy with an actual military threat , and make a weak and vulnerable enemy look like a strong , menacing foe .
Then no one can complain when you pounce on the enemy and reduce his country to flames and rubble .
It is obvious that powerful political forces in Washington are fishing for a pretext to launch a war on Iran , and that they are just delighted to have Ahmadinejad as cartoon villain and pretext .
But they had a moderate , reforming president in Mohammad Khatami for 8 years , and just blew off all his overtures to the West .
Iranians organized big candle - light vigils for America after September 11 , in sympathy !
Washington never gave the reform movement the slightest encouragement , perhaps in hopes that the Iranians would be forced to turn right again and form a proper object of US hatred .
If so , they got their wish last summer , when Ahmadinejad used the same dirty techniques to get elected as had George W. Bush .
All the warmongers in Washington , including Hitchens , if he falls into that camp , should get this through their heads .
Americans are not fighting any more wars in the Middle East against toothless third rate powers .
So sit down and shut up .
One , two , three , four !
We do n’t want your stinking war !
We are not going to see any more US troops come home in body bags at Dover for the sake of some Cheney affiliate grabbing the petroleum in Iran ’s Ahvaz fields .
We are not going to have another 15,000 wounded vets flood onto our streets with spine damage and brain damage .
We are not going to put Yazd behind barbed wire to liberate it , as a millenarian Christian general did to Habbaniyah in Iraq .
We are not going to imprison and torture thousands of Iranians at Evin Penitentiary in Tehran , as worthy successors to the bloodthirsty Shah and Khomeini .
We are not going to kill 200,000 Iranians with aerial bombardments of Tabriz , Isfahan , Qom , Kerman , Shiraz and Mashahd .
We are not going to let dozens of US corporations loot the American people and the Iranian people alike with no -bid “ contracts ” , embezzlement , corruption , and graft .
We are not going to let you have a war against Iran .
So sit down and shut up , American Enterprise Institute , and Hudson Institute , and Washington Institute for Near East Policy , and American Heritage Foundation , and this institute and that institute , and cable “ news ” , and government “ spokesmen ” , and all the pundit - ferrets you pay millions to make business for the American military - industrial complex and Big Oil .
We do n’t give a rat ’s ass what Ahmadinejad thinks about European history or what pissant speech the little shit gives .
I call on university students across America to begin holding antiwar rallies .
The only way you can have a war on Iran is to draft the young people .
It is you who are on the line .
Demonstrate !
Demonstrate against the very hint of war !
Demonstrate in front of the warmongering “ institutes ” in Washington , DC !
Demonstrate to end the one we ’ve already got !
( See Speaker ’s Forum on Iraq
Here is what the real Iran experts think about the prospect of an Iran war .
Because Hitchens ’s dirty tricks and lies against me are only the beginning .
Whoever stands against the Perpetual War machine will be attacked , slimed , marginalized , and destroyed if the warmongers get their way .
I do n’t care .
Thus far and no farther .
One , two , three , four .
We do n’t want your stinking war !

Parents and teachers often underestimate the effectiveness of puzzles in teaching children skills and concepts .
There are many types of puzzles , including those that teach spatial skills , hand - eye coordination , math , language , social science and science concepts , as well as logic and thinking skills .
By Ann Bowers
Parents and teachers often underestimate the effectiveness of puzzles in teaching children skills and concepts .
There are many types of puzzles , including those that teach spatial skills , hand - eye coordination , math , language , social science and science concepts , as well as logic and thinking skills .
Children as young as one year of age can use simple puzzles .
There are puzzles for all ages , including adults .
The best quality of puzzles is the enjoyment experienced by the user as they solve them .
Wooden Puzzles
Puzzles made of wood or very heavy cardboard help young children ages 1 - 8 learn motor skills and hand - eye coordination as they fit the pieces together .
They learn spatial concepts and how to problem solve .
These puzzles teach the alphabet , numbers , colors , shapes , and concepts about animals and nature .
Wooden puzzles have 2 to 30 pieces .
Simple number puzzles can be created using one inch ( 1/2 cm. ) ceramic tiles .
Use a permanent marker to write numbers from 1 to 100 on the tiles .
Children start by putting the first ten in order and then add ten at a time until they can put all 100 in order .
Teachers can make multiple sets by first painting each set of tiles a different color and then adding the numbers .
Jigsaw Puzzles
Jigsaw puzzles are usually made of heavy duty cardboard and have any number of pieces .
Jigsaws teach spatial concepts and problem solving as the pieces are examined to see how they fit together .
Jigsaw puzzles teach concepts about science , geography ( i.e. ; maps ) , social science , and even foreign languages .
Children learn to work cooperatively as they complete a puzzle .
A jigsaw in progress is a great way to keep children occupied during a break in homeschooling lessons or on a rainy day .
Mark the back of each puzzle piece with a different color of felt marker so that the pieces are easy to sort .
Word Search Puzzles
Word search puzzles are puzzles made up of letters in which words are spelled horizontally , vertically , or diagonally .
( Spelling them backwards is not recommended for children . )
The player must find specific words and circle them in the puzzle .
These puzzles help teach spelling and figure - ground perception .
Figure - ground perception is the brain ’s ability to see objects or words hidden in a background of pictures or letters .
Hidden Picture Puzzles
Hidden picture puzzles are those with elaborate , background pictures that contain specific pictures the player must find .
This type of puzzle teaches figure ground perception and detailed observation skills , as well as vocabulary .
A variation on the hidden picture puzzle is the puzzle in which two pictures appear to be the same , but the player must find the discrepancies between the two .
Crossword Puzzles
Crossword puzzles may be quite simple for children as young as 7 or very difficult for adults .
Crossword puzzles teach vocabulary , reasoning skills , spelling , and word attack skills .
The player must use word clues to determine the correct word to fit into the crossword , either across the puzzle or up and down .
There are excellent software programs which allow teachers to create crossword puzzles using spelling , reading , or vocabulary words .
Logic puzzles
Logic puzzles are basically of two types – word puzzles or mechanical puzzles .
Logic word puzzles come in many varieties , such as “ Don is 6 inches taller than Harry .
Harry is 2 ” shorter than Jan .
Rich is 5 ’ 8 ” tall and is the same height as Jan .
How tall is each person ? ”
These puzzles can be simple for children and range up to very difficult for adults .
In many ways , geometry problems can be considered logic word puzzles .
Logic mechanical puzzles consist of mechanically interlinked pieces .
The puzzles challenge the player to explore the interlocking pieces in order to assemble or disassemble the puzzle , put the pieces in sequence , or use dexterity to move the pieces .
Such puzzles include : Rubik ’s cubes , sliding tiles or blocks puzzles , impossible object puzzles , etc .
Logic puzzles teach logical thinking skills , deductive and inductive reasoning , spatial concepts , motor coordination , and planning advance gambits .
Patterns
Pattern puzzles may be colors , shapes , numbers , letters , or any combination of them .
The challenge is to create a pattern , determine what comes next in a pattern , or discover how the pattern was created .
Patterns teach logical progressions , deductive and inductive reasoning , and spatial concepts .
Mazes
Mazes require the player to find a way through a maze on paper , in virtual reality , or in real life .
Mazes teach spatial concepts , logical progression , and deductive reasoning , as well as directionality .
Mazes are often considered to be art themselves .
Riddles and Brain Teasers
Riddles and brain teasers are brief descriptions that challenge the player to discover what is being described .
In a brain teaser , for example , the description goes : a child is brought into a hospital emergency room after a car accident in which his father is killed .
The doctor in the emergency room says , “ I ca n’t operate on this child .
He ’s my son . ”
How can this be ? ”
Answer : the doctor is the child ’s mother .
Riddles and brain teasers teach how to think “ outside of the box . ”
Here is a riddle .
If a fire hydrant has H2O on the outside , what does it have on the inside ?
Answer : K9P
Here is another .
A hunter looking out of his cabin can only look south .
A bear ambles by .
What color is the bear ?
Answer : white ( It ’s a polar bear because the hunter can only look south , he must be at the North Pole . )
Incorporating puzzles of all kinds into a child ’s education and recreation is stimulating for the mind and fun for the child .
There are hundreds of resources on the internet for all kinds of puzzles , both free and available for purchase .
Get some puzzles and challenge your child !

Recycling Rain Water
Why do we water our plants with city water when rain water is free and not treated with chemicals ?
Because we are lazy , that 's why !
Most of the water that falls from the sky never gets absorbed by plants , but rather rain goes deep into the ground where plants can not use it or into our sewer systems .
Where I am from , most rain water ends up mixed with underground salt water or into the ocean , where it is also lost .
So start collecting and storing rain water .
There are several easy and cheap methods for doing this .
The first and cheapest method is to re-use empty water jugs or gallons .
That 's right !
Just dig a very small hole under the spout of any gutter or where water naturally pours off from the roof .
Next , place an empty and clean container in this small hole , so that the rain water will pour out of the gutter 's spout and into the gallon .
This makes the entire roof a giant funnel , and it is okay if most of the water misses the gallon .
Even a slight sprinkle of rain will fill several gallons quickly .
Just remember to clean your roof and gutters , since you want to minimize the debris entering into the gallons .
Third , you will want to keep bugs , especially mosquitoes , away from the water .
So , either use a mesh screen or netting with a rubber band to keep out even the smallest bugs , just like what keeps bugs out of an open window or patio .
Or you can close the gallon with the gallon 's lid immediately after each rainstorm .
That means you have to open the gallons before each rainstorm , and close it immediately afterwards .
This may be difficult and time consuming , but not impossible .
I strongly recommend using a mesh screen and rubber band .
Also , the convenient handle on gallons make them an excellent watering pail too .
The second and more costly method is to use a rain barrel .
A rain barrel is typically a 50 to 80 gallon container that also collects and stores rain water from rain gutters .
The advantages of using such a large container is that you will collect a larger amount of water .
This is better if you have a large garden or yard .
Typically , a rain barrel will come with their own mesh screen , water faucet , and water run off system in case it rains too much for the barrel to store .
Some cities even give away rain barrels for free , so do n't forget to ask your town hall , especially since this method even saves your city money .
Here is a few link to help you if you are interested in rain barrels : Rain Barrel Guide
There are even larger systems , such as water towers , for collecting a huge amount of rain water , but they are typically not practical for home owners .
So , there you have it .
Recycling rain water helps the environment and saves you money .
Rain is free , we will never run out of rain ( well , we may have droughts periodically , but that makes theses systems even more useful ) , and clean empty containers are also free .
What are you waiting for ?

A bill that would reduce state prohibitions on muni broadband deployments has moved out of committee and is headed for a vote by the U.S. SenateA bill that would reduce state prohibitions on muni broadband deployments has moved out of committee and is headed for a vote by the U.S. Senate .
The Community Broadband Act of 2007 , which has broad bi-partisan support , aims to promote universal and affordable broadband access in the U.S. by prohibiting state legislatures from denying local governments the right to offer broadband municipal services to their citizens .
Even as it assures local governments the right to deploy municipal broadband projects , it also protects private providers by forbidding munis from using governmental authority to discriminate against private competition .
Hopefully , the Community Broadband
Act will be passed and will become law .
State legislation forbidding local governments from enacting local initiatives to serve local residents flies in the face of everything we value about local control and small government .
It should never have required a proverbial “ act of Congress ” to insure that local government could make decisions aimed at lowering access rates and promoting economic development in their local communities .
And yet , it did .
Click here to read the story .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 27 — The president - elect of the Christian Coalition of America , which has long served as a model for activism for the religious right , has stepped down , saying the group resisted his efforts to broaden its agenda to include reducing poverty and fighting global warming .
The Rev. Joel C. Hunter , pastor of a Florida megachurch , was named the group ’s president - elect in July .
He was to have taken over the presidency in January from Roberta Combs , who is also the chairwoman of the Christian Coalition ’s board .
Mrs. Combs will continue in both positions now .
Over the last few years , Dr. Hunter , senior pastor of Northland Church in Longwood , Fla. , has gained a reputation as an evangelical leader seeking to expand the agenda of conservative Christian activists from issues like abortion and same - sex marriage .
In a telephone interview , Dr. Hunter said that although Mrs. Combs had indicated that the organization also wanted to expand its priorities to include the issues that concerned him , the board backed away from such a commitment during a conference call last Tuesday .
By the end of the call , Dr. Hunter and the coalition had decided to part amicably , according to both sides .
When I first saw C++ back in the mid-1980s , it looked pretty interesting .
Then it started to grow into a horrible monster .
I was just reading about the D programming language today .
All I can say is , " Wow ! " I wish they had this way back when .
This would seem to correct most of what I find distasteful about C , C++ , and Java , while keeping most of the things I like -- to the point where I would actually consider using it for certain projects .
The things I hate most about those programming languages are :
C
No objects
Manual memory management only
Lame macros
Having to define header files
C++
Complex , obscure syntax that I can't ever remember completely without a copy of The C++ Programming Language sitting next to me
Complex resource management schemes to avoid leading memory / etc. in the presence of exceptions
Did I mention that I hate the complex syntax ?
Java
( Almost ) Everything is an object ( but not quite )
Having to run in a VM with bytecodes even when you 're writing something for a single platform and do n't need or want to
No ability for structures to overlay memory for efficient access to C and network data wire protocol data structures , forcing the programmer to do bit - twiddling with ByteArray and shifts and masks
In short , D looks interesting .
Is it Lisp and would I go back to using D as my main programming language ?
No .
It still does n't have macros the way Lisp does and it does n't have sexprs ( yes , I really do like the parenthesis ) , but it is a better follow - on to C than C++ and still hits the system - programming domain that Java missed so bady .
It seems like something to keep in one 's hip pocket .

OH MY DARWIN !
Who 's the Fittest Evolutionary Thinker of Them All ?
BY James Schwartz
As the featured speaker at the twentieth annual Darwin festival at Salem State College in Salem , Massachusetts , Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould is lecturing to a packed auditorium -- not only professional biologists and students but also retirees and blue - collar workers .
It is the birthday of both Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin ( who happened to be born in the same year as well as on the same day ) , and Gould is talking about American history .
Stocky and clean shaven , with a plump baby face and thick graying hair , he wears a tie in honor of the occasion but no jacket .
He is unfolding bit by bit what he calls his Back to the Future theory of history , his belief that hundreds of chance occurrences got us where we are today .
If Robert E. Lee 's second in command had n't misunderstood his orders , Gould suggests , the South might have won the Battle of Gettysburg , and then the war , and we might still be a divided country .
He 's building up to his central theme : that history is unpredictable and serendipitous , that human existence arose by chance , and that life , intelligent or otherwise , is devoid of any special significance in the larger scheme of things .
Toward the end of his rhythmic , free - form lecture , Gould pauses in mid-sentence .
He has noticed that one person in the crowd of nearly a thousand is quietly leaving through a back exit .
" Do n't you want to hear the last ten minutes ? " he cries out in obvious distress .
" I do n't mean to be arrogant about my status , but most of these folks you have all the time .
Me you only got for a little while . "
Such pugnacity is hardly surprising to Gould 's numerous admirers and critics .
For years , he has been an aggressive voice of reason in the argument against creationism and other varieties of pseudoscience .
But Gould , who seems to thrive on controversy , is also entangled in a battle with a school of fierce anti-creationists called evolutionary psychologists , who believe that human nature is largely mapped out in our genes .
Most recently , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology psychology professor Steven Pinker has been responsible for generating public interest in evolutionary psychology ( EP ) .
Not only does Pinker have a gift for the clear expression of complicated ideas , but , with his good looks and stylish clothes , he knows how to get media attention .
His first book , The Language Instinct ( 1995 ) , was an engaging discussion of the nature of language and its evolution .
In 1997 , Pinker 's How the Mind Works appeared to great fanfare and quickly became a national best - seller .
The disagreement between Pinker and Gould is the latest variation on the old nature - versus - nurture debate that has been raging for centuries .
The most recent skirmishes date back to the 1970s , when sociobiology , a new discipline dedicated to explaining social behavior in biological terms , was catapulted into the limelight .
Gould became a leading early critic of sociobiology , penning eloquent disquisitions on the ability of humans -- not their genes -- to determine their own fate .
But in the 1980s , molecular biologists began identifying more and more genes involved in human diseases and behavior .
Sociobiology once again gripped the public imagination , but this time under the name of evolutionary psychology -- sociobiology with a relentless focus on human psychology .
The argument between evolutionary psychologists and their critics centers on elemental mysteries of human nature .
It is about the sort of tough questions that kids ask -- Why are some people bad ?
Why do some breeds of dogs kill squirrels , and can they be taught not to ?-- as well as some more adult concerns :
Are older men genetically programmed to abandon their longtime wives and take up with younger women ?
To what extent is intelligence , sexual preference , or the capacity to nurture mapped out in our genes ?
How deeply entrenched is the hatred and distrust of warring ethnic groups throughout the world ?
There is a certain poetry in the fact that Gould 's office is located in Harvard 's venerable Museum of Comparative Zoology , founded in 1859 by Louis Agassiz , its first director and Harvard 's last creationist .
The walls of Gould 's office bear the names of the animal classes , the letters visible in faded black paint dating from the days when the room was still an exhibition hall .
The office itself is the size of a basketball court , filled with crowded bookshelves and tables piled high with the great diversity of the world Gould celebrates in his writing .
This is the perfect Gould habitat , sprawling and packed with stuff .
A brilliant essayist and lecturer , Gould is the most popular science writer in America , which is remarkable because he engages serious ideas and draws from a rich store of knowledge of literature and history .
In addition to half a dozen books , Gould has published nine collections of the essays he 's been writing for Natural History over the last twenty - five years .
He thinks of himself as a scientist in the tradition of Galileo , who was unusual in his time for writing in Italian , the language of the people , rather than Latin , which was then the norm for serious scientific discourse .
He is still troubled by the fact that his friend the late astronomer Carl Sagan was denied entrance to the National Academy of Sciences .
" Scientists will say , 'he was a popular writer but also a good scientist , ' " Gould complains .
" The but has to be changed to an and . "
Gould himself has been the object of a fair amount of sniping over the quality of his science .
His theory of punctuated equilibrium -- the idea that sudden rapid changes in evolutionary history are followed by long periods of relative stability -- has a limited following among his colleagues .
Gould proposed his theory -- sometimes called jerky evolution -- as an alternative to the classical theory of slow , continuous evolution .
A Gould antagonist , Richard Dawkins , the English evolutionary biologist responsible for the term " selfish gene , " has been known to refer to the theory of punctuated evolution as " evolution by jerks . "
In his most recent book , Unweaving the Rainbow ( 1998 ) , Dawkins characterizes Gould as a guy who 's been " seduced by bad poetry . "
Whereas Gould prefers to see human behavior as a complex and unpredictable interaction of culture , and a highly pliable set of genetic potentials , EPists have little patience with such a wishy - washy notion .
They prefer to break down human psychology into a set of " complex adaptations , " specific traits exquisitely suited to perform their functions , in the often repeated mantra .
To EPists , it is a given that everything complicated and interesting about animals , and humans in particular - - ranging from the way we find mates , to the working of the eye , to the ability to detect cheaters in social interactions -- is the result of the long , slow , incremental process of Darwinian natural selection .
" You can't have a parent without an eye and an offspring with one , " Pinker explains to me .
" It 's all gradual and Darwinian . "
We are sitting at the dining room table in his newly renovated condo a few blocks north of Harvard Square .
The apartment , like Pinker 's understated dark dress shirt and black jeans , is up - to - the - minute and impeccable .
Every counter and surface is shiny and clear ; there 's not a stray magazine or envelope in sight .
It 's the kind of home that makes you suspect that there must be a back room where all the mess is stored .
The eye is the classic example of a complex adaptation .
As Pinker explains it , an animal picks up a random mutation for a clearer lens , which makes it better able to avoid predators and find mates than animals with less clear lenses .
This individual will give rise to offspring with better eyes , and over the course of generations , animals with clearer lenses will take over the population .
At some point down the line , one of these animals may acquire another random mutation , this time for a rounder eyeball , which enables the eye better to focus images .
In this way , mutation by mutation , over hundreds of generations , the multiple components of a complex function are acquired .
For Gould , it is Pinker 's insistence on natural selection as the only valid scientific explanation for the origin of complex animal behaviors that is so galling .
Although Gould acknowledges the importance of natural selection , he believes that the EPists have failed to appreciate other principles of evolutionary change such as random genetic drift , catastrophic events , and the constraints of basic laws of form .
Furthermore , he contends , by identifying a genetic origin for many complex human behaviors , the EPists would have us believe that human behaviors are far more entrenched and immutable than they really are .
Whereas Pinker argues that all of our complex mental functioning has been crafted over thousands of generations by natural selection to achieve a particular end , Gould believes that human attributes as basic as language may be accidental .
It was a British graduate student named Bill Hamilton who in the early 1960s had the insight that leads directly to Pinker 's view of the human mind .
Believing he 'd forfeited his chance for a Ph.D. from London University by pursuing his heretical approach to the study of altruism , Hamilton sat for hours in train stations and public gardens to relieve the loneliness of his student rooms .
While he sat , he mulled over a startling new idea , which he later named the theory of inclusive fitness .
Today , Hamilton is a tall , white - haired man of sixty - three , a Royal Society professor at Oxford widely considered the most influential evolutionary thinker since Darwin .
" I had the feeling that I might be a crank , " recalls Hamilton of his student days .
He describes three experiences that influenced his thinking .
As a schoolboy , he recognized that he felt a greater sense of obligation to his brothers and sister than to his school friends .
Also , his mother kept bees , and he'd seen how the sister worker bees often sacrificed their lives for the good of the colony .
Lastly , he had been deeply dissatisfied with the lectures on evolution he received as an undergraduate at Cambridge University , where it seemed to him that his professors did not give Darwin 's mechanism of natural selection its proper due .
Hamilton realized he could explain the puzzling phenomenon of sister bees sacrificing themselves for the good of the hive by shifting the perspective from the survival of an animal 's offspring to the dissemination of its genes .
Thanks to a peculiar system of sex assignment , a female bee shares more genes with her sisters than with her direct descendants .
If the goal is to make the greatest number of copies of her genes , a female bee is better off helping her mother make more sisters than she is producing her own offspring .
In 1964 , Hamilton pointed this out in a seminal two - part paper titled " The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior . "
More generally , his gene 's - eye point of view made it clear that the traditional Darwinian concern with an organism 's investment in its children was too limited .
Post - Hamilton , sacrifice for siblings and more distant relatives as well as one 's own children made sense .
In 1976 , Dawkins popularized this idea in an enormously influential book , The Selfish Gene .
To the consternation of his critics , Gould believes that human attributes as basic as language may be accidental .
But if it had n't been for the Harvard entomologist E.O. Wilson , Hamilton 's theory would very likely never have come to Dawkins 's attention .
Wilson seized on the idea and prodded his reluctant peers to recognize its significance .
At sixty - nine , Wilson still has the lean , angular build of a marathon runner .
Though he has an almost courtly conversational style and retains the aura of a southern gentleman , he has a relentlessly driven , competitive nature that has resulted in an extraordinarily productive career .
There are many folktales surrounding Wilson that illustrate one or another of the qualities that have made him successful , including the story of his reaction to Hamilton 's 1964 paper .
In one widely circulated version , Wilson is sent a copy of the paper to review , skims it , and , believing it to be the ravings of another manic graduate student , tosses it in the trash .
Hours later , in the middle of the night , he realizes he 's made a terrible mistake , bolts out of bed , and rushes back to the lab to retrieve the paper before the janitors empty the trash .
" That 's a great story , " Wilson laughs , " but it 's not true . "
The truth , he insists , is that he read the paper on a long train ride from Boston to Miami ( he 's a reluctant flier ) .
Hamilton 's idea struck him as improbable and too simple , and it did n't seem to lend itself to broad applications .
But when Wilson could n't find a logical flaw in the paper , he grew angry .
He , not Hamilton , was the world authority on social insects , and certainly no one else was going to explain the behavior of insect societies .
Yet the more he thought about it , the more he became convinced that the theory was fundamentally correct .
By the time he reached Miami , he was a convert .
" I would never throw out an article like that , " he explains .
" At the very worst , I 'd file it for future reference . "
With Hamilton 's ideas in mind , Wilson went on to formulate the basic tenets of sociobiology .
In 1975 , he published a beautifully illustrated overview of his theory titled Sociobiology : The New Synthesis .
If he had confined himself to animals other than ourselves , as he'd originally intended , his life would have been more peaceful .
But in a characteristically ambitious finale , he tacked on a chapter extending his theory to humans .
Our species is genetically programmed to be warlike and territorial , he wrote , and males will typically dominate females in human social hierarchies .
He hypothesized the existence of genes for spitefulness and homosexuality , genes for conformity that make humans easy to indoctrinate , and genes that make us favor kin and be wary of strangers .
In a section on hunter - gatherer societies , Wilson cataloged the behavior patterns of various members .
He found that , just as in ant colonies , different members of the groups played different roles .
There were individuals of higher status , leaders and outstanding specialists , for example , who generally established themselves by their mid-thirties .
These elites , he wrote , do more than their share of work and dominate the group 's sluggish , unproductive members .
Inside the academic anthill , there was no doubt as to which kind of ant Wilson was .
Already , as a graduate student , he 'd sensed he had a special destiny , as another Wilson tale suggests :
He and a fellow graduate student are driving back to Harvard after attending a meeting at which all the greatest minds in evolutionary biology had gathered .
Wilson 's friend is awestruck at having been in the presence of such greatness .
After driving along in silence for a while , Wilson turns to him and says , " It should n't be very hard to get to the top of that heap . "
In Cambridge , the reaction to Wilson 's book was intensely negative .
Fifteen local scientists , including Gould and Richard Lewontin , a universally admired population geneticist , formed the Sociobiology Study Group .
Together , Lewontin , who had been brought up by a French nanny on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , and Gould , the Queens - born son of a Marxist court stenographer , led the opposition .
With his ease with mathematics and a powerful analytic mind , Lewontin brought rigor and salience to the critique of sociobiology .
For months , the small group of allies plotted against sociobiology in Lewontin 's office .
At his own desk one floor above , Wilson had no idea what was brewing just below his feet .
In November 1975 , the Sociobiology Study Group published a letter in The New York Review of Books ( NYRB ) .
The letter , signed by all fifteen members of the study group , stated its objections in no uncertain terms .
Sociobiology , it asserted , is part of a tradition of biological determinism that has " provided an important basis for the enactment of sterilization laws and restrictive immigration laws by the United States ... and also for the eugenics policies which led to the establishment of gas chambers in Nazi Germany . "
The invocation of Nazism was clearly intended to cause alarm .
Less widely appreciated , however , was that there had been a pseudoscientific crusade in the early part of this century to improve the American gene pool .
Laws passed in more than thirty states led to the sterilization of tens of thousands of people judged mentally feeble or morally inferior , and immigration from nations deemed of inferior genetic stock was restricted .
Gould and Lewontin 's letter sounded a warning bell : Supposedly objective science had been used -- and could be again -- to justify dubious politics and prejudices .
Wilson was not one to take the Sociobiology Study Group attack lying down .
After licking his wounds for several weeks , he began a counteroffensive .
Since both Lewontin and Gould were widely known for their radical politics , he devoted himself to the study of Marxist economic theory so as better to understand the " enemy in the field . "
In December 1975 , his rebuttal appeared as a letter in the NYRB .
In it , he accused the authors of intentionally distorting his meanings in order to make a case against him .
In March of the following year , Wilson wrote a more detailed reply to his detractors in BioScience , a professional journal .
In that article , he refers to a statement by a Harvard professor characterizing Wilson as a " privileged member of Western industrial society whose book attempts to preserve the status quo . "
Wilson points out that , as a Harvard professor , the author of the statement enjoyed identical privileges .
Today , Wilson recalls those days with a wry chuckle .
" Gould and Lewontin going on in Marxist tones - - we 're talking about a bygone era , in an intellectual as well as a political sense .
Sometimes we wondered , ' Who did Lewontin think he was , writing those letters from his Vermont dacha ? ' "
The Vermont dacha is a reference to Lewontin 's cabin in southern Vermont , where he has long spent as much time as possible , talking crops and weather with local farmers and acting the part of crusty old New England codger .
In 1978 , Wilson was a featured speaker at the symposium on sociobiology held by the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in Washington , D.C. Gould was scheduled to speak at the same session .
Wilson , who had fractured his ankle jogging , had decided to deliver his speech from his seat onstage rather than make his way to the lectern .
A few minutes after he had begun to talk , a group of protesters from the International Committee Against Racism ( INCAR ) stormed the stage .
One dumped a pitcher of water over his head while the others chanted , " Wilson , you 're all wet ! "
A few minutes later , the protesters withdrew , and the audience broke out in a spontaneous standing ovation for the injured , dripping Wilson .
Gould took the microphone and quoted Lenin on the inappropriate use of violence .
Later he explained that the attack on Wilson had been an " infantile disorder " of socialism .
Did Gould and Lewontin 's attacks push Wilson further down the path toward human sociobiology ?
" Their attacks and other criticisms coming particularly from the New Left saying that this was bad science , and that I was racist and capitalist , were one of the major stimuli for me to move ahead , " Wilson says .
" Otherwise I might have delayed a considerable period of time before I wrote a book aimed at a broad audience . "
In 1978 , he brought out On Human Nature , a broad defense of sociobiological theory .
" Not just to answer them , " he says , " but perhaps in part to respond to what I considered scurrilous and unfounded criticism . "
A few years later , Wilson began to move in new directions , becoming a tireless and influential crusader for the cause of biodiversity , the movement devoted to the preservation of the diversity of animal and plant species .
The tension was nearly unbearable as the elevator inched its way to the third floor .
As the doors opened , Lewontin turned to Wilson and said , " I 'm glad that you 're doing real science again . "
An inconspicuous directory in the dim lobby of the Museum of Comparative Zoology Laboratories informs you that Lewontin 's office is on the third floor and Wilson 's is on the fourth .
It 's a long , slow elevator ride up .
A veteran of the sociobiology wars recalls unwittingly stepping into the elevator with Wilson and Lewontin in the late 1970s , shortly after Wilson had published a new monograph on ants .
The tension was nearly unbearable as the elevator inched its way to the third floor .
No one uttered a word .
As the doors opened and Lewontin got out , he turned to Wilson and said , " I 'm glad that you 're doing real science again . "
A central hall with laboratories on either side leads from the elevator to the Lewontin lab common room .
In it , there 's a vast rectangular wooden table covered with old copies of the NYRB and scientific journals .
Mounted to the wall , a magnificent moose head has watched over generations of students .
A minute after the appointed hour , Lewontin appears and ushers me into his office .
Lean and fit , with a round face and a full head of dark hair , one would never guess that he 's seventy .
Though he's one of Harvard 's most eminent faculty members , there 's no sign of his special status -- no couches , Oriental rugs , honorary degrees , or art -- not a luxury or frill of any kind .
Why is it , I ask , that he objects to the Wilson - Pinker view of major human behaviors as adaptations crafted by natural selection ?
" Instead of talking about adaptations , " Lewontin replies , " we should say organisms do the things they can do : Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly .
" We 'd be better off flying , " he continues , though he , like Wilson , is afraid of flying in airplanes .
" It would increase our fitness , we'd be better able to flee from predators .
But if we flap our arms , we do n't get any lift . "
He stands up and starts flapping his arms to illustrate .
" Even if I picked up a pair of Ping - Pong paddles , it would n't help .
"
He 's walking around the room now , madly flapping his arms and still not getting any lift .
" Until you 're doing something , you 're not doing it , " Lewontin says by way of summary , " and natural selection can't help .
What natural selection does is to make more efficient what the organism is already doing . "
Lewontin 's argument is that natural selection alone can't explain the origin of flight or of any complicated new function .
Unless a little bit of change gives an animal a little bit of an advantage , the change wo n't be selected for , and obviously a little bit of a wing does n't do any good .
Darwin was well aware of the problem and devoted considerable thought to it .
" An organ originally constructed for one purpose ... may be converted to one for a wholly different purpose , " he wrote in The Origin of Species ( 1859 ) .
This principle of functional shift makes it impossible to presume that any complex adaptation was crafted by natural selection , argue Gould and Lewontin .
In particular , it does n't make sense to say that a specific human behavior was selected for its current function when its original function may have been entirely different .
Gould later proposed the term " exaptation " ( to be distinguished from " adaptation " ) for features arising along these circuitous pathways .
This is the first line of defense against Wilson - Pinker sociobiological thinking .
But Gould and Lewontin went further .
In 1979 , they wrote a paper for a British conference on adaptation and natural selection titled " The Spandrels of San Marco , " in which they argued that many aspects of the design of animals are purely accidental .
The paper has acquired legendary status .
There even exists a collection of essays using the techniques of postmodern literary criticism to analyze the spandrels paper as scientific rhetoric .
Gould and Lewontin cleverly chose an example from the history of architecture to illustrate their point .
Spandrels are unintended by - products of an architectural design .
At the medieval cathedral of San Marco in Venice , the spandrels are four triangular spaces inadvertently created when the church 's dome was mounted on four rounded arches .
In the case of the cathedral , Lewontin and Gould argued , it would be easy to infer that the lavishly decorated spandrel is the heart of the architect 's design .
By analogy , " adaptationists , " as Lewontin and Gould dub sociobiologically inclined biologists , mistake a by - product of an adaptation for a genuine adaptation .
The origin of a complex adaptation is impossible to know , and any such attempt to invent hypotheses is , according to Lewontin and Gould , unscientific speculation .
Critics of sociobiology label these hypothetical scenarios " Just So Stories , " after Rudyard Kipling 's children 's book in which fanciful explanations are offered for adaptations such as the elephant 's trunk .
Lewontin added another important piece to the case in his 1984 book , Not In Our Genes .
Even if it were possible to understand an individual in terms of his genes and environment , he argued , we still would not understand group behavior .
The whole could not , even in principle , be reduced to the sum of its parts .
For a period in the early 1980s , it seemed Gould and Lewontin 's views had gained the upper hand .
But it was precisely at this time that the revolution in molecular biology spun into high gear .
With the development of new techniques for the sequencing and manipulation of DNA , it became easier and easier to identify and clone genes .
Suddenly genes were being identified for just about everything .
In Drosophila melanogaster , the common fruit fly and beloved laboratory organism of generations of geneticists , genes were found that affected sexual behavior , the pace of the internal clock , learning , and memory .
Not only that , but many virtually identical genes were found in humans , whose evolutionary line diverged from insects more than half a billion years ago .
Simultaneously , molecular biologists started identifying the genes that play roles in human disorders , such as Alzheimer 's , Huntington's , and Parkinson 's diseases .
As the decade progressed , the flood of DNA information led to the formation of a generously funded human genome project to sequence the entire three billion base pairs of human chromosomal DNA .
Now Gould and Lewontin were on the defensive .
They had always argued that it was bad science to break up an animal into individual traits or behaviors in order to claim that they are determined by particular , selectable genes .
In the early days , the Sociobiology Study Group had criticized the idea that there were genes for specific and variable forms of human behavior , including spite , aggression , xenophobia , conformity , and homosexuality .
Later , Gould expanded the argument to include even body parts .
" Hundreds of genes contribute to the building of most body parts and their action is channeled through a kaleidoscopic series of environmental influences , " he wrote in a Natural History essay .
Yet by the early 1990s , gene - based explanations for human behavior were on the rise .
The stage was set for the reemergence of sociobiology under the new name of evolutionary psychology .
In 1992 , the husband - wife psychologist - anthropologist team of Leda Cosmides and John Tooby laid down the manifesto for the new discipline of EP in their introduction to an edited volume of original papers titled The Adapted Mind .
EP was essentially an extension of Wilson 's program applied exclusively to humans , with a few amendments to quell the leftist critique .
Proponents of EP are quick to emphasize that human nature was crafted by natural selection to solve the problems of life on the African savanna 1.8 million years ago and that traits that may have been advantageous then , like xenophobia and aggression , may not confer a selective advantage in the modern world .
Hoping to avoid the criticisms that were leveled against the first sociobiologists , the new generation insists it is most interested in understanding the evolution of universal features of the human species , not in the particular genes that make one person different from another , such as genes for IQ or homosexuality .
In 1997 , an especially acrimonious debate over EP broke out when Gould took on the new school of sociobiologists in a long two - part article in the NYRB .
Describing his foes as " Darwinian fundamentalists , " he addressed himself to what he saw as the essential weakness of the adaptationist approach : " The human brain must be bursting with spandrels that are essential to human nature and vital to our self - understanding but that arose as nonadaptations , and are therefore outside the compass of evolutionary psychology , or any other ultra-Darwinian theory . "
No wallflower when it comes to protecting his turf , Steven Pinker leaped to defend his science .
" The ideas of EP are not as stupid as Gould makes them out to be , " he wrote in a letter to the NYRB published later that year .
" Indeed , they are nothing like what Gould makes them out to be . "
It does n't matter , Pinker argued , whether a complex adaptation originated as an exaptation or a spandrel ; if it later serves a useful function for the organism , it must have been acted on by natural selection to serve that function .
" That there is a particular school of adaptationism is a rhetorical device , " Pinker told me .
" The school is just about everybody , " he asserted , referring to the legions of scientists who study animal behavior using the sociobiological paradigm .
" Gould and Lewontin have influence over social scientists and literary types who read The New York Review of Books and Natural History ; they did n't like the direction sociobiology was going .
Marxists do n't want there to be an innate human nature , particularly not one that smacks of selfishness , greed , and aggression .
They always say that a person 's science can't be divorced from his politics , but they never apply this argument to themselves . "
In the case of Lewontin , at any rate , this charge is often made .
" There 's almost no scientific subject on which he 's positive , " says Bill Hamilton .
" I can't understand how such a good mind can be so negative about science per se .
The politics always comes first .
He does n't admit it , but that 's the case . "
Writing in his autobiography , Naturalist ( 1994 ) , Wilson says that Lewontin " was stage - cast for the role of contrarian .
He possessed a deep ambivalence that kept both friend and foe off balance . "
Before publication , Wilson sent Lewontin a copy of the manuscript asking for his comments .
After a long period of silence , Wilson had his assistant hunt Lewontin down .
A few days later , the manuscript was returned unopened with a letter attached to it .
" Dear Ed , " Lewontin wrote , " Given that our disagreements are so fundamental and broad and given the wide - spread misapprehension that they are personal rather than scientific , you can always say with complete honesty that you gave me the opportunity to comment on your manuscript and I declined .
Autobiography is not a genre I am tempted either to read or to write .
In order to get through life we all create elaborate fictions about ourselves , but I have always felt that these were better left to the hours between waking and sleeping . "
" It 's only an illusion that there 's a president in the oval office of the brain who oversees the activity of everything , " says Pinker .
Gould , who has always been somewhat more interested than Lewontin in finding common ground with his opponents , has recently shown some openness to EP ideas about the differences between the sexual attitudes of males and females .
In the EP view , males are likely to be promiscuous because it is advantageous to spread their sperm far and wide .
Females , on the other hand , are programmed to be more selective :
Their eggs are more precious than male sperm , and they are strapped into months of gestation and suckling after conception .
In his NYRB attack on EP , Gould goes so far as to call this line of reasoning the " most promising " EP has to offer , and he admits that it " probably does underlie some different and broadly general emotional propensities of human males and females . "
However , he cautions the EPists against pushing this theory too far and suffering the fate of Freudians , who " elevated a limited guide into a rigid creed that became more of an untestable and unchangeable religion than a science . "
Lewontin , who married his high school sweetheart and can to this day be seen walking hand in hand across Harvard Yard with her , takes a much harder line .
" I 'm a man , and I do n't go around screwing young girls , " he says .
" I 'm human , and so I have to be explained . "
One can almost see Lewontin hiking through the Vermont woods shaking his head in despair at the loss of Comrade Gould .
There had been no more articulate spokesman in the battle against bourgeois decadence .
Meanwhile , Pinker , busy promoting his latest book , Words and Rules : The Ingredients of Language ( Norton ) , marches forward .
In a recent appearance in London , Pinker and Dawkins held a public forum titled " Is Science Killing the Soul ? " which was attended by 2300 people and sold out weeks in advance .
Pinker spoke of the fiction of the unified self .
" It 's only an illusion that there 's a president in the Oval Office of the brain who oversees the activity of everything , " he said , in what undoubtedly struck many as a particularly apt metaphor .
The notion that there is no unified self is fundamental to EP .
If the brain is a collection of computers , each one of which performs a highly specialized function , then it makes sense to invoke natural selection acting over millions of years to account for the existence of those computers .
This view of the mind broken up into an array of independently evolved modules is disquieting to many .
As the Rutgers philosopher Jerry Fodor , the author of a forthcoming book titled The Mind Does n't Work That Way ( MIT ) , puts it , " If there is a community of computers in my head , there had also better be somebody who is in charge , and , by God , it had better be me . "
If one does not believe that human intelligence is the sum of an array of computers , then one must postulate the existence of some more general cognitive ability that gives us the capacity for complex thought .
And this general ability , Fodor believes , may be the result of a small but crucial evolutionary shift that distinguished our brains from the brains of other primates .
Like Fodor , Lewontin and Gould argue that the EPists have it wrong : Language , consciousness , and most of our distinctively human mental capacities are side effects of the fact that our brain grew big for other reasons .
Furthermore , they caution , these reasons cannot be reconstructed .
Our extraordinary human abilities are epiphenomena of " all those loose connections with nothing to do , " explains Lewontin .
As an example of a nonadaptive trait , he offers the uniquely human ability to use recursion in language , that is , to make sentences of the form : " I say that Noam Chomsky says , when people say ... "
Though chimps can be taught to compose simple sentences of the form " I want " or " I see " on a computer , they can not be taught to use recursion .
Does Lewontin have a theory about the origin of this unique linguistic ability of humans ?
" You could invent a story , " he explains with distaste .
" You could say it was an advantage to early human beings in being able to say , ' I saw Joe doing that , ' but that 's just yak ! "
Pinker insists that our ability to use language has evolved because language offered a selective advantage .
" Being articulate is highly valued in all cultures , " he says .
" Tribal chiefs are high in verbal skills and have more offspring . "
It is symbolically fitting that Gould and Lewontin were teaching their undergraduate course on evolution for the last time this spring while a few hundred yards down the road Pinker and a recently tenured Harvard animal behaviorist named Mark Hauser were giving a popular graduate seminar on evolutionary psychology .
" If there is a community of computers in my head , there had also better be somebody who is in charge , and , by God , it had better be me , " says Fodor .
The point of Pinker and Hauser 's course is to trace the origins of human thought .
There is no doubt that we can learn a lot about human language from studying apes and birds , Hauser told me after the seminar one afternoon .
The way birds learn their songs is strikingly similar to the way humans learn language .
In his characteristically acerbic way , Lewontin dismisses this idea .
It is simply impossible to say how novel abilities like human language arose .
He jibes : " One way to get around the problem that language is a novelty is to define it in such a way that does n't make it a novelty .
You 'll say bird twitter is language . "
In a 1998 article titled " The Evolution of Cognition : Questions We Will Never Answer , " Lewontin wrote , " It might be interesting to know how cognition ( whatever that is ) arose and spread and changed , but we can not know .
Tough luck . "
This spring , Lewontin will publish a collection of his essays with the appropriately contrarian title It Ain't Necessarily So. Even if God were to descend on Cambridge and part the waters of the Charles River at Lewontin 's feet , it would still be unthinkable to imagine the skeptical biologist embracing religion .
Gould , on the other hand , has recently been evincing a new sympathy for the realm of the unscientific .
In his most recent book , Rocks of Ages : Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life ( 1999 ) , he not only sets out terms for a peaceful coexistence with the obdurate religious believers among us but seems to offer another defense against the sociobiological threat .
His thesis is that it makes perfect sense to see science and religion as distinct and complementary forms of human endeavor : Science addresses the " factual character of the natural world " ; religion is concerned with spiritual meaning and morality .
This dualism stands in stark contrast to the views of Wilson , Dawkins , and Pinker , who categorically deny the existence of a soul or spirit .
Indeed , from the outset , it was Wilson 's goal to deny the existence of an independent moral realm .
In On Human Nature , he says , " Human behavior ... is the circuitous technique by which human genetic material has and will be kept intact .
Morality has no other demonstrable ultimate function . " Consilience ( 1998 ) , Wilson 's latest and most ambitious statement to date , takes an even more radical position , arguing that " there is intrinsically only one class of explanation . "
He goes on to make the bold assertion that " all tangible phenomena , from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions , are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible , however long and tortuous the sequences , to the laws of physics . "
Gould insists that it is not possible to reduce ethics to sociobiology or to unify knowledge by subsuming one theory in another .
Even if human traits like xenophobia and aggression , for example , were in the end shown to be the result of adaptations in the Pleistocene era , Gould contends , science alone will not suffice as an explanatory system .
The man who largely made his name insisting on the purposelessness of life has found a place in his heart for religion .
But that 's not to say Gould has turned into any kind of crypto-creationist .
No matter who turns out to be right in the end , he and his adaptationist foes can at least agree with Darwin that " whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity , from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been , and are being , evolved .

Toilet Snorkel
US Patent Issued In 1982
What exactly is this man doing ?
Communicating with his neighbors using his new Toilet Phone ?
Blowing up his Inflatable Toilet ?
Or is he simple blowing bubbles ?
Well the correct answer is None of the Above .
This guy is using the new breath easy , Toilet Snorkel , formulated to provide a fresh air source during fires in high rise buildings .
In most fires , it 's the smoke that will get you , and a source of fresh air can be a life saver .
So our inventor designed a way to snake a snorkel through the zigs and zags of your toilet , so you can breath sewer air instead of smoke .
Here 's our question ... could n't he have , just as easily , invented the Faucet Snorkel instead ?

Behind the purple door on the cobbled streets of Alston , Cumbria , the cooking pot was seldom off the boil .
In the ordinary kitchen tucked high in the North Pennines , thick brown liquid was poured into moulds imported from Belgian chocolatiers .
Luxurious bars of high - cocoa - fat chocolate were wrapped and labelled and placed in jiffy bags , then posted to all corners of the country .
It would have been an uncomplicated and charming cottage industry , but for one special ingredient : each 150g bar contained up to 3.5g of cannabis .
For six years , its presence in the chocolate helped ease pain for more than 1,600 people with multiple sclerosis , almost 2 % of all British sufferers .
It also caused the chocolate 's distributors , Mark and Lezley Gibson , to fall victim to village gossip , police raids and legal action that has left them branded as drug dealers .
On Friday , a jury found the Gibsons , and an associate , Marcus Davies , guilty of two counts of conspiracy to supply cannabis between 2004 and 2005 .
There were tears and gasps of shock in the public gallery at Carlisle crown court when the decision was delivered .
For Lezley , who suffers from MS , the decision at least ended the mental and physical agony of a prosecution that has dragged on for nearly two years .
But the reverberations of the decision reach far beyond the Gibsons ' kitchen in Alston .
The verdict is discomforting for those who assumed this country had , in effect , decriminalised cannabis .
And it is painful for those MS sufferers who have suddenly found their supply of cannabis chocolate cut off .
The Gibsons ' journey to Carlisle crown court began back in the mid-80s .
Lezley was a trainee hairdresser , good enough to beat the likes of Andrew Collinge and Nicky Clarke in apprenticeship competitions .
While the men went on to become celebrity coiffeurs , however , the worsening pins and needles in Lezley 's legs took her to hospital in Carlisle , where she was diagnosed with MS .
Treated for 10 weeks , she had two agonising lumbar punctures and was given steroids , which caused her to grow a beard and double her weight to more than 14 stone .
The final piece of " medical " advice before she was discharged was , she says , to forgo butter and eat margarine instead .
" I was called in - valid , " she recalls , emphasising the word .
" I was disabled .
I was written off , no longer any use to anyone .
When I was diagnosed , they said I would be incontinent and in a wheelchair within five years . "
Twenty - two years on , Lezley is a slight , attractive woman with a warm smile , and no wheelchair .
For three years after her diagnosis , however , she suffered paralysis of her right and left sides and periodically lost the power of speech and sight in her right eye .
" This was the normal downward spiral of MS .
Then I met Mark and started using cannabis , " she says .
Like many young men , Mark was a recreational user .
Lezley noticed that when she smoked it with him , she felt better .
" I read Charles Kingsley 's The Water Babies when I was young and I 've always been Mrs Doasyouwouldbedoneby , " she says .
" Once I found out that cannabis did this to me , I could n't keep it quiet .
I wanted to help other people . "
The former MP Robert Kilroy - Silk inadvertently assisted Lezley when she appeared on his show to talk about MS in the mid-90s .
There she met other MS sufferers and was inspired to found a support group , Therapeutic Help from Cannabis ( THC ) .
Fortified by a growing body of scientific evidence about the medicinal effects of cannabis on MS , Mark got involved and travelled to universities to talk at conferences about the drug .
It was when the Gibsons began talking publicly about cannabis that the police took an interest .
The couple were first raided in 1989 : Mark spent a week on remand in Durham prison .
They were busted again in 1995 and again in 1999 .
In 2000 , Lezley was acquitted of possession on the grounds of medical " necessity " .
A friend and fellow MS sufferer , Biz Ivol , began producing " Cannachoc " for a neighbour with MS .
She , too , was arrested and prosecuted .
When her illness was exacerbated by legal action , the Gibsons offered to take over the production of the chocolate in 2000 .
When Ivol died in 2004 , they named it " Canna - Biz " , in her honour .
Qualified in food hygiene , Mark began making the chocolate for about half a dozen MS sufferers in the kitchen above his gift shop in Alston , where he sells new age crystals and ethnic ornaments .
" It felt good to be of some use , to help society .
It was terrible to be told you 're no use at 20 , " says Lezley .
As word spread , people wrote letters addressed to " The lady with MS , Alston " or turned up at their door in wheelchairs .
Those who found cannabis helped reduce muscle spasm and increased bladder control were relieved to find an alternative to giving £ 150 a week to a drug dealer .
Soon the couple were posting bars to more than 100 people a week .
As long as he did n't sell it , and only gave it to MS sufferers , Mark believed he had a defence in law .
If prosecuted , he thought he could deploy the defence of " necessity " , which allowed for an illegal act to avert greater harm ( or , in this case , pain ) .
A number of people , including founders of medical marijuana cooperatives and even a GP , Dr Anne Biezanek , who supplied her sick daughter , have been acquitted of possession and supply using this medical " necessity " argument .
Gibson was meticulous about how he produced and supplied Canna - Biz .
He obtained the cannabis for free from altruistic growers and bought the chocolate ( ideally , organic Green & Black's ; otherwise Tesco's or Morrisons ' own brands ) .
Lezley helped with the administration and they instructed users to take no more than three squares from the 24 - square bar each day to ensure no psychoactive effects .
They never distributed it through their shop .
Crucially , they never sold it , instead suggesting a donation of between £ 1.50 and £ 5 to cover their costs ( some MS patients would give more ; many chose never to pay anything ) .
And they insisted that any " patient " must send them a doctor 's letter , on headed notepaper , confirming they had MS .
Lezley says the notes showed that almost all their patients were over 40 : " It 's not people looking for a cheap thrill ; it 's middle - aged people who are ill . "
Curtains began to twitch as Mark strolled across the street to Alston post office every day with jiffy bags of cannabis chocolate .
Small - town gossips reckoned the 4x4 - driving couple must be raking it in .
Mark was summoned to meet a senior Cumbria police officer in 2002 .
He was warned : open a cannabis cafe and you 'll be shut down .
But police advice about their chocolate operation was more ambiguous .
Mark told the court it was suggested he should not be " quite so blatant " about it .
" He did n't tell me to stop , " says Gibson .
" To this very day nobody has told us to stop . "
Nevertheless , heeding police warnings , the couple reduced their media profile and began using a regional post office instead of their local one .
Davies , an associate from Cambridgeshire , built a website for their new not - for - profit scheme , Therapeutic Help from Cannabis for Multiple Sclerosis ( THC4MS ) .
He also provided them with a PO box address in Huntingdon ; it meant the couple 's home address was no longer publicised .
When their local bank refused to let them open an account for THC4MS , Davies , who is registered disabled and grew his own cannabis to treat his severe diabetes and epilepsy , agreed to cash donor cheques for the Gibsons .
Internal police documents read out in court showed that Cumbria police decided it would be " oppressive and vindictive " to mount a surveillance operation on the couple after Lezley was acquitted in 2000 .
Early one morning in February last year , however , the police knocked on the Gibsons ' purple door .
Bars of Canna - Biz had spilled out of a jiffy bag at the Post Office and the police were called .
Along with Davies , they were charged with conspiracy to supply cannabis .
Legal arguments dragged on for nearly two years - destroying Gibson 's gift shop business - before their case finally opened in court two weeks ago .
Jeremy Grout - Smith , for the prosecution , argued that while the couple were not conventional drug dealers , there was no defence in law .
" To supply cannabis , even if you believe it is doing good , is not a defence , " he said .
Police found details of three bank accounts at Davies ' home into which more than £ 39,000 worth of cheques had been paid between March 2003 and March 2005 .
" So this seems to be distribution on quite a large scale and , to some extent at least , the defendants may have benefited financially - although the Crown does not claim this was their main motivation , " he said .
The Gibsons and Davies claimed that most of the sum was the income from other members of Davies ' family .
Even if some was money from donations , they said it was all ploughed back into the not - for - profit Canna - Biz operation .
In six years they have supplied more than 33,000 bars and calculate they have given away cannabis with a street value of £ 500,000 .
The pair are not visibly wealthy .
" We 're not very good ' drug dealers ' , are we ? " says Lezley .
" If I 'd sold it , I would n't be sitting here .
I 'd be in Spain with the rest of 'em . "
As the arguments were trotted out during nine days in court , little indignities struck home .
On one morning proceedings were delayed because the prosecution barrister had a medical complaint .
Lezley , who struggled to walk into court and found it painful to sit down for more than 10 minutes , was on time every day .
She believes her previous court battle advanced her MS by five years .
" At the moment I do n't know if I 'm able to move when I wake up , " she said two days before the verdict .
" I 'm not sleeping , I 'm constantly in pain across my shoulders .
I 'm not taking as much cannabis as I should because I 'm stuck in court . "
The couple struggled to retain their composure when faced with legal professionals who required correcting on several basic facts about medicinal cannabis and the law .
When Grout - Smith asserted that no one had been acquitted of supplying cannabis on grounds of medical necessity , he was put right by Mark .
The judge struggled to understand how a commercial medical cannabis treatment for MS users in Britain , called Sativex , could be unlicensed yet still be legal in the UK .
Mark , again , was on hand to explain : in a government fudge , it was denied a licence in Britain but for the past 12 months has been made available on a " named patient " prescription basis .
A doctor must get a licence from the Home Office to prescribe it to individuals .
A survey by Disability Now found few patients have been able to get it because the process is so bureaucratic and expensive .
Lezley is now licensed to carry a Sativex spray but finds smoking cannabis better .
The spray is " very , very strong " and , she says , more likely to incapacitate her than smoking .
The Gibsons are not the sort of campaigners who crave courtroom publicity .
But their case made public some interesting facts .
The couple kept 1,036 letters from doctors confirming patients had MS .
Of those , 65 made specific reference to cannabis chocolate , showing that some doctors had full knowledge of what they were writing the letter for .
One MS sufferer , Helen Wallace , gave evidence from her wheelchair in court that she had told her doctor precisely why she needed the note .
In this way , many of the letters from the medical profession were de facto prescriptions .
Despite such support , the political climate has shifted .
The government is determined not to be seen as " soft " on the drug since it was downgraded from class B to C. ( Paradoxically , downgrading cannabis has damaged the Gibsons because recreational users who once donated money or campaigned for their medical cause have dropped away , content that they can smoke a spliff in peace . )
As well as a growing body of research showing its medicinal applications , there is , equally , more scientific evidence linking cannabis to mental illnesses such as psychosis and schizophrenia .
The studies agree on one thing : cannabis affects different people in different ways .
Three months after the Gibsons were arrested , legal opinion also turned against them .
While several cannabis suppliers successfully evoked the defence of medical " necessity " , the court of appeal ruled in May 2005 that necessity could not be a defence in six test cases of supplying cannabis .
Removing this common - law defence has , in effect , recriminalised the medicinal use of cannabis .
Lawrence Wood , chief executive of the Multiple Sclerosis Resource Centre charity , says the law is " an ass " and society is hypocritical to allow possession for personal use without explaining where it can be obtained safely .
" If the government had licensed Sativex , and made it easily available , then these people would not have needed to supply it in this way , " he says .
Since the verdict , the couple have received emails from recipients of their chocolate .
" I shall miss it very much , " says one woman with MS .
" I have tried gradually using less each day but was in so much pain I started back on a full dose .
Do n't know what I shall do when this bar has finished . "
Lezley is defiant .
" The prosecutor told me what I did was wrong but the law is wrong .
It 's evil and cruel and totally unfair .
As a person who is ill , why am I in court ?
It ca n't be a crime to want to be well .
If it was paint stripper , I 'd take it .
It 's just unfortunate it 's illegal .
I 'm sorry that cannabis makes me well and I 'm sorry I 'm going to keep taking it , because I do n't want to be in a wheelchair and I do n't want to be incontinent . "
The maximum penalty for the unauthorised supply of cannabis is 14 years in jail but the pair , who will be sentenced in January , have been told they will not face a prison term .
They know , however , they must pour away the last Canna - Biz and pack up their pans .
They have no defence in law ; MS sufferers will no longer receive cannabis chocolate pain relief through the post .
" I want the judge to send a letter to all those people saying why they will no longer receive our medication , " says Lezley .
" I ca n't do that " .
We live in a world of democratized production .
Anyone with a compelling idea can use ubiquitously available hardware and software to create remarkably popular content .
Funtwo , for example , has enjoyed over 7 million views of a video he created with a home video camera ( one camera position , very few edits ) .
The subject of this video is Funtwo playing guitar in his bedroom ..
There are some who will argue that there are no rights issues associated with this particular video , but most people who make a living writing , performing and selling music would disagree .
Funtwo is either playing or phantoming ( lipsyching with a musical instrument ) to JerryC's arrangement of Johann Pachelbel 's Canon in D Major .
The original song is in the public domain , but JerryC 's arrangement is protectable under current copyright laws .
Both of these individuals ( whoever they may be ) certainly have the right to work for free , but let 's assume ( for the sake of argument ) that one or both of them wanted to get paid .
How would they do it ?
First we must understand the rights they might have under the current copyright laws and common practice business rules .
Master Rights -- the physical master recording ( audio and video ) .
These rights are usually owned by the producer , record Company or movie studio that paid for the production .
You must negotiate with them to use the work .
Mechanical Rights -- the 9.1 cents per cut on a CD or per download that is compulsory under the current copyright laws ( it is usual and customary to only realize approximately 60 percent of this amount on any give mechanical royalty )
These rights are usually negotiated for and collected by The Harry Fox Agency , although they can also be negotiated independently .
These royalties are usually divided up by the record company , the publisher (s ) , the producers , performers , composers and other interested parties .
Public Performance Rights -- if the work is broadcast or streamed over the public Internet , you are entitled to your personally negotiated fee or , if you are so inclined , you may be non-exclusively represented in the USA by one of three performing rights societies , ASCAP , BMI or SESAC .
Although the split is often the subject of negotiation , traditionally composers and their publishers split these fees 50/50 .
And , for the most part publishing companies administer and , therefore negotiate with people who wish to use the work .
Sync Rights -- if the work is a piece of music that is synchronized to a piece of video ( title music , theme music , background music , music for a music video , music for a film or TV show , etc. ) you are entitled to a fee .
Although the split is often the subject of negotiation , traditionally composers and their publishers split these fees 50/50 .
And , for the most part publishing companies administer and therefore negotiate with people who wish to use the work .
Unions & Guilds -- If union performers have contributed to the work ( singers , musicians , etc. ) there are residual payments to be made .
And , even if the performers are independent , they may still be entitled to a share of the profits from their creative contributions .
This depends , of course , on how egregious the terms of the non-union performers ' contracts were with the original producers of the work .
There are other types of licenses , but these are the most common .
Now , let 's say that you want to create a piece of video content that includes a music track .
Where do you start ?
Do you have a legal department ?
How about a music clearance department ?
No , I did n't think so .
Most people do n't even know what rights they are violating when they upload or download a piece of music .
As we enter into the year of user - generated content and we start to see big sites like YouTube and MySpace as well as smaller sites like BlipTV start to profit from the sale of advertising around this content , we must create an automated marketplace for aggregated music rights .
The computer technology required to create this type of automated clearing house is trivial , but the business rules and negotiations with all of the various rightsholders is not .
Internet distribution at a profitable scale is still in its infancy .
We are just starting to see ways to transform value into wealth online .
If Chris Anderson 's " Long Tail " theory is correct , digital content will ultimately , and counterintuitively , start to sell under the 20/80 rule ( as opposed to the classic Pareto 80 / 20 rule that currently governs most sales curves on or offline . )
Now would be a great time to get out ahead of this explosive math problem , before it actually explodes !
Are the automakers bluffing when they say they can't hit California 's new emissions targets ?
If so , the Union of Concerned Scientists is calling their bluff .
Yesterday the UCS unveiled a minivan design that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40 percent while saving consumers money and keeping safety and performance intact .
The UCS Vanguard — which is not a hybrid — uses off - the - shelf technologies , including the engine , transmission , and fueling systems .
Besides saving the litigious manufacturers millions in R&D costs , it enables them to drop their legal challenge to California 's emissions standards and get back to work making cars that people can drive without despoiling the planet .
Good news for them ... right ?
Assuming the automakers do n't manage to derail the new standard — not necessarily a safe assumption — California will require a 34 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for cars and light trucks within the next 10 years ; for larger trucks and SUVs , the cut is 25 percent .
The California standard has already been adopted by ten other states — Connecticut , Maine , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington — and Arizona , Maryland , Minnesota , New Mexico , Tennessee , and Texas are on their way there .
As Spencer Quong , the senior UCS vehicles engineer and former automaker consultant who designed the Vanguard , observed : " Meeting state laws for fighting global warming should be no sweat for the automakers .
They already have the solution to pollution right under the hoods of their own cars and trucks . "
I 'll be speaking with Quong later on and sharing what I find out with you here , so if you like what UCS is doing — or if you do n't — watch this space .

Believe it or not , this is a serious question .
You see , not to long ago I read an article titled Deep Thinkers and came away amazed by how intelligent dolphins appear to be .
Smart Dolphins
Allow me to quote the first three paragraphs of that story to provide some background for this unusual comparison .
First off , we learn that some dolphins have been trained to keep their pool clean by removing litter in exchange for fish :
At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi , Kelly the dolphin has built up quite a reputation .
All the dolphins at the institute are trained to hold onto any litter that falls into their pools until they see a trainer , when they can trade the litter for fish .
In this way , the dolphins help to keep their pools clean .
But Kelly has demonstrated that she 's figured out the system much as a clever child would :
Kelly has taken this task one step further .
When people drop paper into the water she hides it under a rock at the bottom of the pool .
The next time a trainer passes , she goes down to the rock and tears off a piece of paper to give to the trainer .
After a fish reward , she goes back down , tears off another piece of paper , gets another fish , and so on .
This behaviour is interesting because it shows that Kelly has a sense of the future and delays gratification .
She has realised that a big piece of paper gets the same reward as a small piece and so delivers only small pieces to keep the extra food coming .
She has , in effect , trained the humans .
Not bad , huh ?
It gets better .
She realized that it was possible to move even farther up the food chain , so to speak ...
Her cunning has not stopped there .
One day , when a gull flew into her pool , she grabbed it , waited for the trainers and then gave it to them .
It was a large bird and so the trainers gave her lots of fish .
This seemed to give Kelly a new idea .
The next time she was fed , instead of eating the last fish , she took it to the bottom of the pool and hid it under the rock where she had been hiding the paper .
When no trainers were present , she brought the fish to the surface and used it to lure the gulls , which she would catch to get even more fish .
After mastering this lucrative strategy , she taught her calf , who taught other calves , and so gull - baiting has become a hot game among the dolphins .
Costco
Contrast this with my experience at Costco on Sunday .
Costco , like Sam's Club , is a " warehouse " store that specializes in selling bulk items at a discount .
You pay a membership fee for the privilege of shopping there and presumably make up for it by spending less for the goods over the course of the year .
After you go through the checkout line , you have to stop at the exit so that someone can take your receipt , look at it , look at your cart , and then mark it with a marker .
( Fry 's electronics does this sort of thing to , but I generally do n't bother to stop on my way out . )
This time the door check person took at bit longer than I 'm used to and she became visibly concerned .
Something was n't adding up .
She moved me and my cart off to the side to investigate without blocking traffic .
I asked what the problem appeared to be , since I had no idea .
She said something like " well , there are 9 items in your cart but only 8 on the receipt . "
At that moment I realized two things :
Counting is apparently the first line of defense for these people .
It makes sense as an initial sanity check .
I suppose that you 'd also want to look for unusually high or low total dollar amounts too .
Either could be a red flag .
There 's an obvious solution to finding the unaccounted for item .
It may not be the most scalable algorithm , but we 're talking about nine items here .
It 's a very small hay stack .
The next 5 minutes provided a lesson in pure comedy and a testament to our failing education system .
The checker , clearly frustrated , spent a few minutes looking at my cart and the list of items I purchased .
She was unable to figure it out and refused my offer of help .
Eventually she gave up , reached for a clipboard , and began looking for something .
Was it a standard form ?
A procedure to follow in response to such an unthinkable event ?
I have no idea .
So then I opened my mouth and said something like " you have a list with 8 items on it and I have 9 items .
This should n't be rocket surgery . "
She put the clipboard down and I started to think she realized how crazy this all was .
But what happened next only served to amaze me even more !
She called a co-worker over to help .
On the one hand , this was quite funny and sad .
On the other hand , I was relieved that someone else was going to come over and show her how to resolve this apparently insurmountable crisis so that I could be on my way home with at least 8 of the 9 things I thought I had purchased .
The two of them , working together , managed to crack the puzzle and devise an algorithm that identified the big box of oatmeal as the " missing item . "
Amusingly , I had figured that out several minutes earlier while looking over her shoulder , but I kept quiet to see how long it would take .
I surrendered the oatmeal and headed out to my car , shaking my head and laughing to myself .
On the drive home I remembered the dolphin story and wondered how many fish you could buy instead of paying the useless door clerks at Costco .
I leave the " winning " search algorithm as an exercise to the reader . :-)

The capture of UK soldiers by Iran may be the provocation that is used for war ( which would also explain why Tony Blair has not resigned yet ) .
The interpretation of events you are about to read may seem a bit far - fetched .
But they may as well happened roughly as described .
The key factoid that triggered my train of thought was Tony Blair threatening to publish “ satellite records ” of the incident .
This can be interpreted in two ways : either the US had a image satellite overhead and would be willing to provide pictures as public evidence , or he wants to publish GPS log data to show that the Brits were still in Iraqi waters , as claimed .
At this point we can only speculate what will be published , but here is the interpretation guideline .
( Update : Meanwhile the “ evidence ” has been published , and it uncannily fits my predictions below … )
If they have high - res satellite images , the whole thing was a staged provocation all along .
Image satellites are not geostationary , meaning that they are circling the earth and taking pictures at pre-progammed positions of their orbits .
This in turn means , that “ camera time ” is a scarce asset , that is only devoted to worthwile targets or when a really pressing need arises .
The area captured by a single picture is only a few square kiometers and can not be too far away from the satellite path .
Changing the satellite path costs fuel that can not really be replaced in oribit .
In other words : satellites are very seldom pointed at the right spot by accident .
By all accounts , the capturing of the Brits has been a relatively quick affair , leaving not much room for the emergency - tasking of a satellite move .
So if they show us really pretty pictures , they are either forged or the whole thing has been planed all along , including the positioning of the satellite (s ) .
If they show us log files of the GPS receivers of the British as evidence for the position , I will not believe them one word .
The options range from outright forgery of the logs to ( much smarter ) generation of a position offset to cause the Iranis to thinks the British have stray into Irani waters .
As the british were most likely operating on US military GPS receivers , the manipulators would only have needed to generate an offset of the civilian GPS signal to cause the incident .
The Iranians would act on their civilian GPS recveivers in the good faith that they are inside their own waters , whereas the British would be sure to still be in Iraq .
Such an manipulation is fairly easy to accomplish .
Either the US Space Command , who controlls the GPS satellites , has programmed it into the satellites ( they have acknowledged that they can do with the signal what they like ) .
Or someone has run a local GPS signal generator with the position offset required to cause the problem .
Generating a GPS signal with a suitably strong amplifier would cause all civilian GPS receivers in the vicinity to lock onto the fake signal ( as the correct one is overpowered ) , causing them to show positions that are determined by the fake signal .
Quite a number of commercial and military systems that are either constructed for this purpose or can easily modified are on the market .
There has been even an university project that nearly succeeded in building such a generator .
So whatever they show us , be very very sceptic …
Edited to add :
In the 50s and 60s the Soviets manipulated navigation radio beacon signals at their borders to lure US ELINT flights over the border line who were in the strong believe to still be outside soviet territory .
The spy - planes were subsequently shot down by soviet fighter jets .
The operators are remembered at the “ They served in silence ” memorial in the NSA museum …
“ EAT up your greens ” is the exasperated cry of many a parent when faced with a fussy child .
But the paradox of vegetables is that they are both good and bad for you .
The cultivated plants consumed by all folks except hunter - gatherers have evolved an ambiguous relationship with people , in which they exchange the risk of being eaten by a human for the reproductive security that domestication brings .
But the wild plants from which these cultivars are descended are very definite about the matter .
They do not want to be consumed and they make that opinion known by deploying all sorts of poisonous chemicals to discourage nibbling herbivores .
In many cases , those poisons have persisted into the cultivated varieties , albeit at lower levels .
Animals , of course , have evolved ways of dealing with these poisons .
The best of these , from a plant 's point of view , is when an animal can taste , and thus reject , a poisonous chemical .
This has long been assumed to be the basis of the taste of bitterness , but that theory has only now been put to a clear test .
In a paper just published in Current Biology , Mari Sandell and Paul Breslin , of the Monell Chemical Senses Centre , in Philadelphia , have looked at the phenomenon in that bête noire of presidents and parents alike : broccoli .
Bitter tastes are detected by receptor proteins that are , in turn , encoded by a family of genes known collectively as TAS2R .
Humans have around 200 TAS2R genes , each sensitive to different groups of chemicals .
That variety , in itself , indicates the range of the plant kingdom 's weaponry .
Dr Sandell and Dr Breslin , though , focused their attentions on just one of these receptor genes , called hTAS2R38 .
The protein derived from this gene is known , from laboratory experiments , to be sensitive to a substance called phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) .
This compound contains a molecular group called thiourea .
And thiourea - containing substances are known from other studies to inhibit the function of the thyroid gland .
Cruciferous vegetables , such as watercress , turnips and — most pertinently — broccoli , are rich in a group of thiourea - containing compounds called glucosinolates .
Dr Sandell and Dr Breslin wondered if there might be a connection .
And , since different versions of hTAS2R38 code for proteins that have different levels of reaction to PTC , they wondered if that might be reflected in the fact that some people like broccoli , and others do not .
The two researchers assembled a group of volunteers and checked which versions of the hTAS2R38 gene they had .
They then fed the volunteers vegetables and recorded their reactions .
All of the vegetables were thought by at least some people to be bitter , but not all of them were cruciferous plants .
The non-cruciferous ones were plants which , so far as is known , do not contain glucosinolates .
Mild and bitter
The results were clear .
All volunteers found the non-cruciferous vegetables equally bitter , but their reactions to the cruciferous ones depended on their genes .
Those with two copies of the version of hTAS2R38 coding for the protein that binds best to PTC ( one copy having been inherited from each parent ) thought broccoli and its cousins the most bitter .
Those who had two copies of the poorly binding version thought they tasted fine .
Those with one of each had an intermediate reaction .
Despite broccoli's bad reputation , the most bitter vegetables , according to this research , are swedes and turnips .
That accords well with work which has shown that eating these vegetables suppresses the uptake of iodine into the thyroid gland .
Iodine is an essential ingredient of thyroxine , a hormone produced by that gland .
The upshot of all this is that the complaints of children ( and , indeed , of many adults ) that green vegetables are horrid contains a lot of truth .
There is no doubt that such vegetables are good for you .
But they are not unequivocally good .
As is often observed in other contexts , there is no free lunch .
See how industry leaders like Lockheed Martin use Celtx to take their scriptwriting and pre-production to another level .
" Before Celtx , we were doing a lot of extra work .
We spent a lot more time thinking about the formatting and communication of our work than focusing on writing and creativity .
Celtx does a great job of freeing you up to just focus on the production .
We use the Multi-Column AV editor for planning and producing videos like InSight : Landing on Mars and really like the nodal - based storytelling of the Celtx game script editor as a new way to visualize interactive media .
We 're always looking for new ways for our team to incorporate Celtx into our workflow . "
In modern Russia there are around 20 - 30 TV channels , but the most important to any Russian middle aged person is “ Channel 1 ” or “ The First Channel ” .
This channel has the most wide coverage area and is being watched regularly by the majority of the population in Russia .
I think that every citizen of Russia who owns TV - set watches “ Channel 1 ” from time to time .
So a few days ago there was a “ Fields Medal ” event , and Russian genius , Dr. Gregory Perelman , the bright mathematician who solved the “ Poincare Conjecture ” refused his award .
It ’s a well known story now , being discussed a lot .
What is interesting – Mr. Perelman has left St. Petersburg where he lived and worked , and nobody knows where is he .
And even the national media number one , “ The First Channel ” could not find him for an interview .
They had to have him in the night news regarding his unclaimed Fields Medal and another 1 million dollar prize – but nobody managed to find him .
So they decided to take a picture of the professor from the source known for anybody now , from Internet .
They dug a little and got Associated Press image that was shown on different other medias .
But editors in “ Channel 1 ” decided that the exterior of the genius is not cool , they could n’t imagine they would broadcast somebody with a brilliant mind and not wearing a tie and a suit .
That are the traces of the Soviet thinking , for many years people were kept very strict and nothing changed now .
Look what they have done :
Could we call this a democracy , when a roughly photoshopped image is being broadcasted to 140,000,000 citizens of the country even without any mentioning about the changes being made ?
That ’s really sad .
But there is also a good side .
This event has n’t passed unnoticed .
People of the internet , I guess the most free part of the modern Russian society noticed this .
Their protest is being now released in “ Changed the cloths of Gregory Perelman ” photoshop contest .
How else free people of un - free country can express their irony ?

P.S. Some people find my English not right sometimes .
I understand that some of my articles might sound in such way due to English not being a native language for me .
I wonder if someone would like to make some sort of editing sometimes to my articles or articles of other authors on this blog .

THE next time R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco asks smokers to walk a mile for a Camel , watch how many of them are in high heels .
Reynolds , eager to increase the sales of its fast - growing Camel brand among women , is introducing a variety aimed at female smokers .
The new variation , Camel No. 9 , has a name that evokes women ’s fragrances like Chanel No. 19 , as well as a song about romance , “ Love Potion No. 9 . ”
But do n’t look for a Jo Camel to join Old Joe the dromedary on Camel packages , displays or posters .
Rather , Camel No. 9 signals its intended buyers with subtler cues like its colors , a hot - pink fuchsia and a minty - green teal ; its slogan , “ Light and luscious ” ; and the flowers that surround the packs in magazine ads .
For decades , Camel has been a male - focused cigarette ; only about 30 percent of Camel buyers are female .
By comparison , for competitive brands like Marlboro and Newport , women comprise 40 percent to 50 percent of customers .
Almost half of adult smokers are women , so that limited Camel ’s potential .
The music industry simulator is in a kind of open beta testing stage .

The work has also been called a songwriting machine , which it is .
About the Music Industry Simulator
Contents
The music industry .
In the music industry 's core lies a cluster of executives .
Every so often one of them commmisions a new work from a producer .
The producer selects a set of musicians and a songwriter , who collaborate on a new song .
When the song is publicly released , it will slip into obscurity unless people vote for it in the charts .
The creators of the song pay attention to its progress in the charts ; if it does well they will are encouraged in their musical direction , otherwise they search for a new sound .
Industry players who consistently do badly are likely to give up , while those who do well inspire a sea of imitators .
Thus the system as a whole drifts gradually towards more successful musical terrain .
Origin of the Players
All of the musicians involved are figments of a software program , each with its own mind and memory .
The initial population is essentially random in character , but subsequent generations reflect evolutionary pressure .
Source code
The source code will be available soon .

I first worked on this project between September and November , 2003 , as digital artist in residence at the University of Waikato Screen and Media Department .
They paid me to do it .
Several people there helped me with ideas and materials , including Bevin Yeatman , Sean Cubitt , July Rea , and Andreas Fuchs .
In September 2004 I picked it up again .
At this point I was sort of informal artist in residence at MediaLab South Pacific .
They lent me a desk and a net connection .
It was Graham Scown 's idea that I work there , but I was also helped by Anna Wilson , Phil Shepherd , Michael Gregg , and Hannah Lander .
The server hardware ( a 1 Ghz Pentium III with 256Mb ram and slow whiny diskdrive ) is owned and hosted by CityLink .
In particular , Simon Blake and Matt Hunt helped me assemble the machine and plug it in .
CityLink have helped me on other projects ( as have MediaLab for that matter ) .
The voices use the singing mode of the Festival Speech Synthesis System , provided to the world by the University of Edinburgh 's Centre for Speech Technology Research .
Some of the voices use Mbrola , which is free for non-commercial use only .
The singing mode was written by Dominic Mazzoni .
The other instruments are played by Timidity ++ , undoubtedly the greatest of all Finno - Japanese music software packages .
The midi patches ( ie , the actual sounds ) are from the former Debian free - patches package , which I understand has many authors .
The music is written first in ABC format , and converted to midi using abc2 midi .
The mixing is done by Ecasound .
Encoding is done using Oggenc and Lame .
The software is written in Python with a small bit of GCC - compiled C , which is blended in via Pyrex .
The Twisted framework is used for the web interface and spread events out across time .
All of the above - mentioned software , except Mbrola , are part of Debian GNU / Linux or Christian Marillat 's multimedia extensions to Debian .
Mark Williams of the NZ Film Archive organised some advance publicity , and offered much enthusiasm ( including plans to form a covers band - contact Mark at the archive [ nzfa.org.nz ] if you 're interested ) .
Lissa Mitchell helped with testing and various other things .
Using the Halogen music charts
Contents
Finding a song
The Chart
On the left hand side of the front page is the top 50 .
The italicised links are song titles .
Clicking on any of these will take you to a page about the song .
If a song has a coloured arrow beside it , it indicates the song 's recent movement in the chart .
New Releases
The upper right column of the main page lists the most recently produced songs .
Again , the song links are italicised .
Random Song link
Near the top right of most pages is a link labeled " random " , which will take you to an arbitrarily chosen song .
News Section
Low down on the right hand side of the main page is a section containing music industry news and gossip .
Any italicised link there will take you to a song .
Finding songs via musicians ' home pages
The musicians have home pages , which you can find via just about any link that is n't italicised .
Musician 's usually list the songs they have had a part in on their home pages .
Listening
There are four ways to listen to a song ; which you chose will depend on your taste and patience , and your computer 's abilities .
Ogg Vorbis
The link labeled " ogg " will give you the best sound , but many people 's computers cannot yet handle ogg vorbis files .
Free players are available from xiph.org and other people .
Mp3 high quality
MP3 is slightly inferior to Ogg Vorbis , but is fairly ubiquitous .
The " mp3 " link will give you pretty good sound quality , but may take a while to download via a dial - up link .
It is encoded at around 96 kbps .
Mp3 mono
The " mono mp3 " file has lower fidelity , but will download in less than half the time .
It is encoded at 40 kbps .
Flash
There is a flash / swf mp3 player built into the page .
If you click on the little green triangle , it will start playing the mono mp3 stream .
It will begin playing the file before it is all downloaded , but may still take some seconds to make a sound .
The flash plugin will work even if you do n't have an mp3 player .
Voting
There are ' up ' and ' down ' links with appropriate arrows .
Clicking on one of these will send the song in the direction indicated .
In a music chart , ' up ' means towards number 1 , not towards a high number .
If you can't decide about a song , it is OK to abstain .
Naturally , you should listen before voting .
IN THE LATEST illustration of the Bush administration ’s disregard for your privacy , the Justice Department is trying to convince a panel of federal judges that the FBI should be free to read your e-mail without obtaining a warrant .
It ’s not all your e-mail -- only messages left on a Web - based system such as Hotmail or on your Internet service provider ’s computers .
A 1986 law forbids the interception and disclosure of e-mail and other online transmissions without a warrant .
But there is an exception .
If the messages are more than 180 days old , they can be obtained merely with a subpoena or a court order , which investigators can obtain more easily than a warrant .
Now the Justice Department is arguing , in a case before an appeals court in Ohio , that even new messages can be obtained without a warrant if their intended recipient has already read them .
The Justice Department views an opened e-mail left on a service provider ’s computer as more like a postcard left on a table than a sealed letter in a drawer .
Which is to say , its owner has no reasonable expectation of privacy .
About a jillion e-mail users would beg to differ .
The Internet is far more popular , and connections to it more persistent , than they were in 1986 .
Yahoo , Google and other Web - based services offer vast storage capacity to users , enticing them to treat their online inboxes as file cabinets .
Part of the utility of these services is that they enable people to keep all their e-mail in one place that can be reached from any Internet - connected computer , not just the one in their home or office .
Advertisement
The change in technology not only makes the Justice Department ’s position absurd , it undermines the law ’s 180 - day limit .
When the law was drafted , e-mail was typically stored by Internet service providers only until a user dialed in and checked his or her account .
It would then be sent to the subscriber ’s computer and deleted from the provider ’s servers .
Lawmakers set the 180 - day threshold to distinguish between wanted but unread mail and messages in an abandoned account .
Now users store e-mail on the Web for years .
Given these changes , U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott was right last month to find that e-mails stored online cannot be read by investigators without a warrant .
( The case involves a business owner accused of fraud . )
The Justice Department ’s view is inconsistent with the 4th Amendment , although it is in line with the administration ’s tendency to trample privacy rights in pursuit of suspected criminals and terrorists .
The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals should rein in the feds and strike down the provisions of the law that are out of sync with the technological realities of the broadband era -- and the privacy expectations of Americans .
Influential website the Huffington Post tried to ban one of its bloggers after he discovered an anonymous heckler on his blog was actually the Post 's technology manager .
In his Huffington Post blog , Peter Rost exposed the identity of the heckler - known as a " troll " in blogging parlance - which prompted the Post to temporarily block his access .
He recounted the incident on a new blog site he created separately to the one co-founded by journalist Arianna Huffington .
" This is a sad day for online journalism , " Dr Rost wrote on his new site .
" I was terminated without any investigation of the statements in my blog post , all of which were referenced using independent sources .
" I presented facts and made no allegations .
Arianna Huffington 's newspaper decided to shut down the whistleblower and proved that her online magazine is no more ethical than the people and organisations she criticises on a daily basis . "
Dr Rost , a former vice - president of drug company Pfizer , became suspicious after his blogs were persistently attacked by a poster called yacomink .
One comment by yacomink - " This thing reads like a sixth grader 's first attempt at a research paper " - was voted a " readers ' favourite comment " within half an hour of its posting , the speed of which aroused Dr Rost 's suspicions .
Dr Rost had blogged at the Huffington Post for about three months and written over 60 blogs .
He was also suspicious of the incident because , out of 1,278 responses , only 18 comments had ever been popular enough to be voted a " readers ' favourite " .
He found yacomink 's IP address and , after a further search , found a web page for Andy Yaco - Mink , which included the following : " Andy Yaco - Mink is the Huffington Post 's technology manager .
He lives in Brooklyn . "
Dr Rost wrote a Huffington Post blog exposing Andy Yaco - Mink as the troll , suggesting that he had probably manipulated the Post 's systems to get his comments placed in the readers ' favourite comments .
He wrote : " In order for the Huffington Post to maintain its credibility , the site needs to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest or rigged rankings . "
This prompted the Post to block his access to the site .
" You have not been ' fired ' but rather asked to refrain from posting as our editorial staff felt that your recent blogs were not in line with the mission of our site , " the Huffington Post wrote in a letter to Dr Rost .
" This was not an Arianna call .
Ultimately , the decision was an editorial one - not one person to be held responsible - really , " concluded the letter .
Dr Rost was later reinstated to the Huffington Post ( click here to see his blog ) , but the incident has occurred shortly after another Huffington Post controversy - when it was forced to admit faking a blog by George Clooney .
The Oscar - winning actor forced the site to retract a blog it had passed off as his own work , when his comments had been collated from an interview .
Clooney released a statement calling Huffington 's methods " purposefully misleading , " and Ms Huffington acknowledged that his so - called blog was actually compiled from Clooney 's recent interviews with the Guardian and CNN's Larry King .

" The more electronic and global we get , the less important the spoken word has become , and in e-mail clarity is critical , " said Sean Phillips , recruitment director at another Silicon Valley corporation , Applera , a supplier of equipment for life science research , where most employees have advanced degrees .
" Considering how highly educated our people are , many can't write clearly in their day - to - day work . "
Some $ 2.9 billion of the $ 3.1 billion the National Commission on Writing estimates that corporations spend each year on remedial training goes to help current employees , with the rest spent on new hires .
The corporations surveyed were in the mining , construction , manufacturing , transportation , finance , insurance , real estate and service industries , but not in wholesale , retail , agriculture , forestry or fishing , the commission said .
Nor did the estimate include spending by government agencies to improve the writing of public servants .
An entire educational industry has developed to offer remedial writing instruction to adults , with hundreds of public and private universities , for - profit schools and freelance teachers offering evening classes as well as workshops , video and online courses in business and technical writing .
Kathy Keenan , a onetime legal proofreader who teaches business writing at the University of California Extension , Santa Cruz , said she sought to dissuade students from sending business messages in the crude shorthand they learned to tap out on their pagers as teenagers .
" hI KATHY i am sending u the assignmnet again , " one student wrote to her recently .
" i had sent you the assignment earlier but i didnt get a respond .
If u get this assgnment could u please respond .
thanking u for ur cooperation . "
Most of her students are midcareer professionals in high - tech industries , Ms. Keenan said .
The Sharonview Federal Credit Union in Charlotte , N.C. , asked about 15 employees to take a remedial writing course .
Angela
Tate , a mortgage processor , said the course eventually bolstered her confidence in composing e-mail , which has replaced much work she previously did by phone , but it was a daunting experience , since she had been out of school for years .
" It was a challenge all the way through , " Ms. Tate said .
Even C.E.O.'s need writing help , said Roger S. Peterson , a freelance writer in Rocklin , Calif. , who frequently coaches executives .
" Many of these guys write in inflated language that desperately needs a laxative , " Mr. Peterson said , and not a few are defensive .
" They 're in denial , and who 's going to argue with the boss ? "
Steven Pinker , a professor of psychology at Harvard , begins his presentation with an image of corpses on a truck , being taken from Auschwitz concentration camp .
The image is one of many characteristic of the 20th century , a century that included brutality under Stalin , Hitler , Pol Pot and the genocide in Rwanda .
The 21st century , which has barely started , already includes the brutality of Darfur and the daily destruction in Iraq .
These sorts of images can lead us to thinking that modernity brings terrible violence .
Perhaps native people lived in a state of harmony that we ’ve departed from .
This , Pinker tells us , is bullshit .
“ Our ancestors were far more violent than we are . ”
We ’re probably living in the most peaceful time of our species ’s existence , a statement that seems almost obscene in light of Darfur and Iraq .
The decline of violence , he tells us , is a fractal phenomenon – we see it over the centuries , the decades and the years .
That said , we see a tipping point in the 16th century – the age of reason – particularly in England and Holland .
Until 10,000 years ago , all humans were hunter gatherers .
This is the group that some believe lived in primordial harmony – there ’s no evidence of this .
Studying current hunter - gatherer tribes , the percent of male adults who die in violence is extraordinary – from 20 to 60 % of all males .
Even during the vilent 20th century , with two world wars , less than 2 % of males worldwide died in warfare .
Moving slightly further forward , we can see that violent punishment was common in the Bible – Moses tells his followers to kill all the men and married women of a village and rape the virgins .
The death penalty was used for murder , idolatry , disrespecting your parents and “ collecting sticks on the sabbath ” .
The Middle Ages were filled with mutilation and torture as routine punishments for trangressions we ’d punish with fines today .
This was merely another charming feature of a time that featured passtimes like “ cat burning ” , dropping cats into a fire for entertainment puposes …
Some of the most creative inventions of the Middle Ages were fantastically cruel forms of corporal punishment .
One on one death has plummeted through the middle ages , with an “ elbow ” of the curve in the 16th century .
Despite a slight uptick in the 1960s – “ perhaps those who thought that rock and roll would lead to a decline in moral values had it right ” – we ’ve seen two orders of magnitude fall in one on one violence from the middle ages to today .
State sponsored violence has also fallen sharply – we ’ve need a 90 % reduction in genocide since the end of the cold war .
State on state conflicts are dropping every decade .
So why do we so mispercieve the violence of our society ?
For one thing , our reporting is better .
AP is more likely to cover a war somewhere on the planet than a 16th century monk .
We ’re subject to a cognitive illusion – memorable events ( brutal murder ) are judged to be more probable than they actually are .
Finally , our standards tend to change faster than our behavior .
We may be offended by capital punishment today because it no longer fits with our vision of ourselves , but it ’s worth remembering that not long ago , that sort of punishment was exceedingly common and there was n’t strong protection of rights in the courts to prevent it from taking place .
So why is violence becoming less common ?
He offers four explanations :
1 ) Hobbes got it right .
“ Life in the state of nature is solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short . ”
In anarchy , there ’s a temptation towards pre-emptive violence , hurting the other guy before he hurts you .
But with the rise of the Leviathan – the State – there ’s a monopoly on violence .
This helps explain why we still see violence in the absence of the state – zones of anarchy , failed states , street gangs .
2 ) In the past , we had a widespread sentiment that life was cheap .
As we ’ve gotten better at prolonging life , we take life more seriously and are more reluctant to take life .
3 ) We ’re seeing more non -zerro sum games , as people discover forms of cooperation that can benefit both parties , like trade and shared peace dividends .
These zero -sum games come with technology , because it allows us to trade with more people .
People become more valuable live than dead – “ We should n’t bomb the japanese because they built my minivan . ”
4 ) Finally , Pinker leans on Peter Singer to speculate about “ the expanding circle ” .
By default , we empathize with a small group of people , our friends and family .
Everyone else is subhuman .
But over time , we ’ve seen this circle expand , from village to clan to tribe to nation to other races , both sexes and eventually other species .
As we learn to expand our circles wider and wider , perhaps violence becomes increasingly unacceptable .
Divorce and remarriage U.S. divorce rates for various faith
groups , age groups , & geographic areas Sponsored link .
Divorce rates in the U.S. : " There is consensus that the overall U.S. divorce rate had a brief spurt after WW2 , followed by a decline , then started rising in the 1960s and even more quickly in the 1970s , then leveled off [ in the ] 1980s and [ has since ] declined slightly . "

However , such gross statistics are misleading .
There are a number of factors involved that obscure the real data :
The normal lifestyle of American young adults is to live together for a period of time in a type of informal trial marriage .
These relationships frequently do not endure .
Couples enter into their first marriage at a older age than in the past .
A growing percentage of committed couples have decided to live in a common - law relationship rather than get married .
This is particularly true among some elderly who fear reduction in government support payments .
The current U.S. divorce rate :
The media frequently reports that 50 % of American marriages will end in divorce .
This number appears to have been derived from very skimpy data related to a single county or state .
However , it appears to be reasonably close to the probable value .
The Americans for Divorce Reform estimates that " Probably , 40 or possibly even 50 percent of marriages will end in divorce if current trends continue .
However , that is only a projection and a prediction . "
7 Divorce rates among Christian groups :
The slogan : " The family that prays together , stays together " is well known .
There has been much anecdotal evidence that has led to " unsubstantiated claims that the divorce rate for Christians who attended church regularly , pray together or who meet other conditions is only 1 or 2 percent " .
8 Emphasis ours ] .
Dr. Tom Ellis , chairman of the Southern Baptist Convention 's Council on the Family said that for " ... born - again Christian couples who marry ... in the church after having received premarital counseling ... and attend church regularly and pray daily together ... " experience only 1 divorce out of nearly 39,000 marriages -- or 0.00256 percent .

A recent study by the Barna Research Group throws extreme doubt on these estimates .
Barna released the results of their poll about divorce on 1999 - DEC - 21 .
1
They had interviewed 3,854 adults from the 48 contiguous states .
The margin of error is ~+mn~ 2 percentage points .
The survey found : 11 % of the adult population is currently divorced .
25 % of adults have had at least one divorce during their lifetime .
Divorce rates among conservative Christians were significantly higher than for other faith groups , and much higher than Atheists and Agnostics experience .
George Barna , president and founder of Barna Research Group , commented : " While it may be alarming to discover that born again Christians are more likely than others to experience a divorce , that pattern has been in place for quite some time .
Even more disturbing , perhaps , is that when those individuals experience a divorce many of them feel their community of faith provides rejection rather than support and healing .
But the research also raises questions regarding the effectiveness of how churches minister to families .
The ultimate responsibility for a marriage belongs to the husband and wife , but the high incidence of divorce within the Christian community challenges the idea that churches provide truly practical and life - changing support for marriages . "
According to the Dallas Morning News , a Dallas TX newspaper , the national study " raised eyebrows , sowed confusion , [ and ] even brought on a little holy anger . "
This caused George Barna to write a letter to his supporters , saying that he is standing by his data , even though it is upsetting .
He said that " We rarely find substantial differences " between the moral behavior of Christians and non-Christians .
Barna Project Director Meg Flammang said : " We would love to be able to report that Christians are living very distinct lives and impacting the community , but ... in the area of divorce rates they continue to be the same . "
Both statements seem to be projecting the belief that conservative Christians and liberal Christians have the same divorce rate .
This disagrees with their own data .
The survey has come under some criticism : David Popenoe , co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University has said that the survey does n't make sense .
He based this belief on his assessment that Christians follow biblical models of the family , making a bond that " the secular world does n't have ...
It just stands to reason that the bond of religion is protective of marriage , and I believe it is . "
Tom Ellis of the Southern Baptist Convention suggests that the Barna poll is inaccurate because the people contacted may have called themselves born - again Christians , without having previously made a real commitment to God .
He said : " We believe that there is something more to being a Christian ... Just saying you are [ a born - again ]
Christian is not going to guarantee that your marriage is going to stay together . "

Some researchers have suggested that religion may have little or no effect on divorce rates .
The apparently higher rate among born - again Christians , and lower rate among Atheists and Agnostics may be due to the influence of financial and / or educational factors .
One reason for the discrepancy of beliefs about divorce rates among born - again Christians may be that their churches are unaware of the true number of divorcing couples in their midst .
Many couples would find it difficult to continue attending services in the same congregation after their marital separation .
Meeting at church would be awkward .
So , they drop out .
Many probably find that the climate in their church is very negative towards divorcing couples .
So , they move to other congregations that are either more accepting of divorce , or are unaware of their marital status .
Barna report : Variation in divorce rates among Christian faith groups : Denomination ( in order of decreasing divorce rate ) % who have been divorced Non-denominational ** 34 % Baptists 29 % Mainline Protestants 25 % Mormons 24 % Catholics 21 % Lutherans 21 % ** Barna uses the term " non-denominational " to refer to Evangelical Christian congregations that are not affiliated with a specific denomination .
The vast majority are fundamentalist in their theological beliefs .
More info .
Barna 's results verified findings of earlier polls : that conservative Protestant Christians , on average , have the highest divorce rate , while mainline Christians have a much lower rate .
They found some new information as well : that atheists and agnostics have the lowest divorce rate of all .
George Barna commented that the results raise " questions regarding the effectiveness of how churches minister to families . "
The data challenge " the idea that churches provide truly practical and life - changing support for marriage . "
Donald Hughes , author of The Divorce Reality , said : " In the churches , people have a superstitious view that Christianity will keep them from divorce , but they are subject to the same problems as everyone else , and they include a lack of relationship skills .
... Just being born again is not a rabbit 's foot . "
Hughes claim that 90 % of divorces among born - again couples occur after they have been " saved . "
Sponsored link :
Variation in divorce rates by religion : Religion % have been divorced Jews 30 % Born- again Christians 27 % Other Christians 24 % Atheists , Agnostics 21 % Ron Barrier , Spokespersonn for American Atheists remarked on these findings with some rather caustic comments against organized religion .
He said : " These findings confirm what I have been saying these last five years .
Since Atheist ethics are of a higher caliber than religious morals , it stands to reason that our families would be dedicated more to each other than to some invisible monitor in the sky .
With Atheism , women and men are equally responsible for a healthy marriage .
There is no room in Atheist ethics for the type of ' submissive ' nonsense preached by Baptists and other Christian and / or Jewish groups .
Atheists reject , and rightly so , the primitive patriarchal attitudes so prevalent in many religions with respect to marriage . "
2 StopTheReligiousRight.org had some scathing comments as well : " We hear an awful lot from conservatives in the Bible Belt and on the TV about how we all should be living .
Certainly a culture that teaches the conservative religious values of the Christian right must have clean living written all over it .
And lots of ripe fruit from their morally superior lives abounding . "
" It does n't .
Far from it .
People that talk the loudest may be the ones walking the slowest .
Joining its history of Biblically correct bigotry and discrimination , it is an area with the highest divorce , murder , STD / HIV / AIDS , teen pregnancy , single parent homes , infant mortality , and obesity rates in the nation .
As a region , the Bible Belt has the poorest health care systems and the lowest rates of high school graduation . "
12 Variation in divorce rates by age : Age group % have been divorced Baby boomers ( 33 to 52 years of age ) 34 % Builders ( 53 to 72 years of age ) 37 % Seniors ( above 72 years of age ) 18 %
Many seniors were married in the late 40's or early 50's at a time when divorce rates were much lower than they are today .
Variation in divorce rates by location : The Barna Group study found : Area % are or have been divorced South 27 % Midwest 27 % West 26 % Northeast 19 % The Associated Press computed divorce statistics from data supplied by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Health .

They found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate , at 8.5 divorces per 1,000 people in 1998 .
Nevada has had a reputation as a quickie divorce location for decades .
People from other states visited Nevada , fulfilled their residency requirements , got divorced and returned home single .
The data showed that the highest divorce rates were found in the Bible Belt .
" Tennessee , Arkansas , Alabama and Oklahoma round out the Top Five in frequency of divorce ... the divorce rates in these conservative states are roughly 50 percent above the national average " of 4.2/1000 people .
11 southern states ( AL , AR , AZ , FL , GA , MS , NC , NM , OK , SC and TX averaged 5.1/1000 people .
( LA data is not available ; TX data is for 1997 ) .
Nine states in the Northeast ( CT , MA , ME , NH , NJ , NY , PA , RI , VT ) averaged only 3.5/1000 people .
Some of the factors that contribute to a high divorce rate in the Bible Belt , relative to Northeastern states are : More couples enter their first marriage at a younger age .
Average household incomes are lower ( OK and AR rate 46th and 47th in the U.S. )
They have a lower percentage of Roman Catholics , a denomination that does not recognize divorce .
Anthony Jordan , executive director of the Southern Baptist Convention in Oklahoma commented : " I applaud the Catholics , " says Jordan .
" I do n't think we as Protestant evangelists have done nearly as well preparing people for marriage .
And in the name of being loving and accepting , we have not placed the stigma on divorce that we should have . "
Some factor in conservative Protestantism -- which is prevalent in the Bible Belt -- may causes a higher level of divorce .
Associated Press ' confirmation of Barna 's results : The Associated Press analyzed divorce statistics from the US Census Bureau .
They found that Massachusetts had the lowest divorce rate in the U.S. at 2.4 per 1,000 population .
Texas had the highest rate at 4.1 per 1,000 .
They found that the highest divorce rates are found in the " Bible Belt . "
According to the Boston Globe : " The AP report stated that ' the divorce rates in these conservative states are roughly 50 percent above the national average of 4.2 per thousand people . '
The 10 Southern states with some of the highest divorce rates were Alabama , Arkansas , Arizona , Florida , Georgia , Mississippi , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , and Texas .
By comparison nine states in the Northeast were among those with the lowest divorce rates : Connecticut , Massachusetts , Maine , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , and Vermont . "
One reason for the higher divorce rates in the Bible Belt may be the lower percentage of Roman Catholics in the South .
Their denomination does not recognize divorce .
Other reasons could be related more to culture than religion : Couples in the South enter their first marriages at a younger age .
Family incomes in the South are lower .
Educational attainment is lower in the South : One in three Massachusetts residents have completed college .
while only 23 % of Texans have .
11 Sponsored links : Divorce among Protestant clergy : A 1997 - AUG survey by Barna among 601 senior Protestant pastors revealed that the vast majority are married ( 95 % ) .
Only 13 % have ever gone through a divorce .
This is about half of the rate among the general population .
" Just 3 % of all current senior pastors are divorced and have not remarried . "
6 Divorce among members of the Unification Church : Michael Inglis , a member of the Unification Church staff , reported on 2000 - MAR - 28 the results of a survey of some of the couples who were married in two mass marriage blessing ceremonies during 1982 .
One was in New York City and involved 2,075 couples ; the other was in Seoul Korea and involved 6,000 couples .
In most , the founder of the church , Reverend Moon , paired up the couples .
Participants in the study were chosen from among those individuals who had worked in the U.S.
If the 294 subjects , 48 % were American citizens , 24 % Japanese , 14 % Europeans , and 14 % other .
Inglis found that : 82.6 % were still married to their original partner .
17.4 % were divorced from their original partner .
3 Data from the Unification Church compares very favorably with those from all other faith groups .
This is in spite of the couples having known each other for a only a very short interval before marriage .
One factor that may have contributed to their marriage stability is that the couples averaged 2.52 children , compared with the American average of 1.6 .
A 1977 study showed that divorce in America is most common in families with large families and among those that are childless ; a moderate number of children contributes to marital stability .
13 Another study in the same year stated that " divorce and separation rates are moderately lower for those who have children than for the childless . "
14 Combating the high divorce rate :
In 1999 , the National Center for Policy Analysis ( NCPA ) reported that in the U.S. : Nationally , there were about 4.2 divorces for every thousand people in 1998 .
The rate was 8.5 per thousand in Nevada , 6.4 in Tennessee , 6.1 in Arkansas , 6.0 in Alabama and Oklahoma .
Of southeastern states , only South Carolina 's rate of 3.8 was below the national average .
By contrast , the divorce rate is less than 3.0 in Connecticut , Massachusetts and New York .
15
In the same year , Mike Huckabee , governor of Arkansas , declared a " marital emergency . "
His goal was to halve the divorce rate in his state by 2010 , from 6.1 per 1,000 people per year to about 3 .
Frank Keating , governor of Oklahoma also initiated a campaign to reduce the divorce rate in his state by a third by 2009 , from 6.0 to about 4 . 4,5 By the end of 2001 , Huckabee 's program in Arkansas appeared to be a failure .
The divorce rate had increased to 6.6 per 1,000 people per year .
Arkansas state ranked 46th in the nation .
By the end of 2004 , the rate had dropped slightly to 6.3 -- still higher that the value when the program began .
By the end of 2001 , Oklahoma 's program appears to be a success .
Their divorce rate was 3.4 .
Some of the approaches being used by governments and religious groups to reduce the divorce rate are : Pre-marital counseling for engaged couples .
Some clergy now refuse to marry a couple unless they have completed such a course .
The Roman Catholic church has done this for many years .
Encouraging couples to accept mediation before deciding to divorce .
Adding public school courses that discuss values and relationships .
Introducing covenant marriages which are more difficult to get into and more difficult to get out of , in comparison with regular marriages .

Even legendary jazz artist and master performer , Wynton Marsalis , could n't help but be impressed by Jobs ' presentation skills .
Just seconds before Marsalis raised his trumpet to play , he paused and said ( without a direct mic ) ... " That was a great presentation . "
The audience laughed at what was clearly a spontaneous gesture .
Marsalis and his band were the " encore " to Steve Jobs ' special presentation and media event in San Jose , California yesterday ( October 12 ) .
And Marsalis was right :
It was a great presentation ... as usual .
Presentations are conversations
What has always made Steve Jobs such a great presenter is that he seems relaxed and informal in tone and style ( yet gracious ) , as if he were having a conversation with a group of friends at home in the backyard .
There are no magic tricks to his success nor is his effective style the result of years of dramatic study .
Yes , his slides are simple and stunning , and his speaking synchs perfectly with the visuals .
That 's very important .
But the essence of his masterful style is something many ( most ? ) people can achieve in their own unique way .
The secret is to communicate in front of a large group the same way you do everyday when you are talking with your spouse or your best friend down at the local Starbucks .
The key is to look at presentations as conversations .
Let your personality shine through
When you talk with your friends about something of deep , mutual interest , do you speak to a deck of bullet points on a slide ?
Do you pace slowly , cautiously ... boringly through your dialog ?
Do your friends or coworkers at the water cooler fall asleep while you talk .
I doubt it .
Most people — even those who give some pretty bad , sleep - inducing PowerPoint presentations — are ( at least relatively ) interesting and alive when they are in conversations at work or with friends .
So what happens in presentations ?
Why do otherwise interesting and intelligent people become so dull and seemingly disconnected during business presentations , class lectures , or while presenting at a conference ?
The causes , of course , are many .
This website is dedicated , at least in a small way , to putting a spotlight on some of the causes and exploring solutions .
In the end , it is up to every professional to become aware of their strengths and weakness and act to improve , improve significantly .
While I never offer panaceas , one thing that will help is if you approach the delivery ( though not the preparation , of course ) the same way you do a conversation with friends .
You have a unique personality ... let it come out naturally in your presentations .
You 'll be amazed at the difference .
One more thing ...
Speaking of letting your personality come out , what was interesting to me about Steve 's presentation this week was the way he joked around and was having such fun making goofy faces and laughing at himself while demoing the new iMac built - in camera .
The fun he was having clearly was felt by the audience as they were laughing right along with him .
Three acts , one more thing , & an encore
Steve started his presentation by saying that " ... like every classic story , I 've divided it into three acts . "
Act I
Act I was on the new iMac and after reviewing how great the current iMac has already been he kicks it up by introducing the new iMac , focusing on three clearly defined areas : ( 1 ) New iMac is thinner , ( 2 ) The video camera is now built in , ( 3 ) New Front Row feature with remote .
Act II
In Act II Steve introduces the new iPod which now plays video content .
But before he introduced the new iPod he reviewed the " old " iPod 's history of success and really built it up , instilling a feeling of " the iPod is already great ... and it just got better . "
Act III
In Act III Steve talks about the new iTunes ( iTunes 6 ) reminding people that iTunes 5 was just released a few weeks ago .
He broke the iTunes section into four parts with part four being the " landmark deal " with ABC / Disney to make TV shows available for download via iTunes and played on your new iPod .
Take a look at some of the slides behind Steve in the photos below to get a feel of the Zen - like simplicity of his visuals .
He has great visuals and a natural interaction with them .
But the real key is his ability to connect and have an interesting conversation with the audience .
Act I ...
the new iMac
Act I is divided into three parts
Jobs enjoys his demo ... and delights the crowd .
Jobs : " I do n't know if there 's ever been a slide that captures what Apple 's about as much as this one ... "
Get it ?
Apple = elegant , simple .
The other guys = ?
Well , you know ...
Reviewing the new iMac .
It 's like the old iMac except for these nice additions ( and the 20 " model is cheaper ) .
No bullet points ?
( gasp )
Act II focus on the iPod .
The " old " iPod is " amazing " ... and now it plays video too .
Evolution of the iPod .
The iPod marcom kicks it up another level artistically .
Act III focuses on iTunes and the " landmark " announcement with ABC / Disney .
The iTunes section is divided into four parts with the TV announcement saved for last .
( BTW , when did " gift " become a verb ?
Perhaps " gifting " is more " impactful " ...hmm ... ) .
Reviewing the video you can now watch on your ( new ) iPod .
That 's cool , but ...
There 's more ...
Pulling off the landmark deal .
Jobs : " Hey , I know these guys ! "
You can now download ( some ) TV shows from ABC the day after they air ...
Passionate .
Enthusiastic .
Conversational .
Real .
More presentations should be like this .
Closing big . " ... because it 's all about the music ... "
" It does n't get any better than this ... "
With music , a little over an hour .
Well done ... again .
The media files out to get their hands on the new products .

Edit - “ do it right the first time ” defined in the comments .
The most valuable thing I have ever learned in programming is to do it right the first time .
I take extra care now to make sure the logic of a program is carefully planned out ahead of time and that the core code is written to the best of my ability .
It takes a lot of discipline , but it results in fewer bugs and gives me a sense of pride on the project from the very beginning ( which is actually more valuable for momentum ) .
Projects
I ’m proud to work on make it easier to come back to them day after day .
If you ’re also interested in becoming a better programmer , I highly recommend checking out these great resources :
We present a user - friendly approach to unifying program creation and execution , based on a notion of “ tangible values ” ( TVs ) , which are visual and interactive manifestations of pure values , including functions .
Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs .
Our goal is to give end - users the ability to create parameterized , composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers .
We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people , and in particular people with artistic / visual creative style .
In realizing this vision , we develop algebras for visual presentation and for “ deep ” function application , where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples , functions , etc.
Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations .
「 第2歩」と書いたからと言って続くかどうかはわからない、なにしろ僕は気まぐれだからね。
とりあえず第1歩で、手でいじれる圏の例が１つは手に入りました。圏論のような抽象的／一般的な理論を納得するには、具体的な例をたくさん知って、具体例に一般論を適用してみるのがいい方法だと思います。
そこで、関手だの自然変換だのに進む前に、もうひとついじり倒せる具体例を出しておきましょう。しりとりの圏よりは少しだけ高級で、行列（マトリックス）を考えます。僕は、高校で2×2行列の計算を無意味にやらされた記憶があるのだけど、今の教育はどうなっているかしら？
ともかく、行列計算の経験は仮定します。
内容：
行列の復 習
行列は、数を四角形に並べたモノです。ここで、「数」は実数だとしておきます。横の並びが行で、縦の並びが列です。このことを忘れてしまう人は次の図を見れば二度と忘れないでしょう*1。
行列のサイズ（行の数と列の数）は非常に重要です。よく「2×3行列」とか「2-3行列」とか書きますが、ここではより明白に「2行3列の行列」、あるいは「3列2行の行列」のように表現します（そのほうが、まぎれがないでしょう）。
行列の演算は掛け算だけを考えます。行列Aと行列Bを掛けた積はA・B、またはB;Aで表します。A・BとB;Aはまったく同じ意味ですが、AとBの順序が逆になっています。なんで2つの記法を使うかは最後で説明します。
行列の圏
行列Aの列の数、つまり四角形の横幅をwidth( A)と書くことにします。同様に、行列Aの行の数＝四角形の縦の長さはheight(
A ) です。AとBの積（掛け算）A・Bが定義できる条件は、width( A ) = height ( B ) でした。また、n行n列の単位行列（対角成分だけが1で他は0の行列）I n がありましたよね。… うーん、これって… なんか圏の匂いがプンプンするぞ。
ちゃんと定式化してみましょう。まず、自然数（0も含める）の全体をN={0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ...}とします（Nを太字にするのは、そういう習慣なのです）。そして、すべての行列からなる集合をMatとします（Matrixから）。
既に、次の2つの関数は定義済みです。
width , height : Mat → N
単位行 列I n は、自然数nに対して行列を対応させる関数とみなせるので：
I : N → Mat
そして掛け算 「・」、または、同じ演算ですが書き方を逆順にした「 ;」があります。
A・B は height ( B ) = width ( A ) のときだけ定義され る2項演算
A ;B は height ( A ) = width ( B ) のときだけ定義され る2項演算
圏論の文脈では、 「 ;」を使ったほうが幾分自然な記述になります。
さてと、以下の等式群は、圏となるための条件ですが、いずれも、行列の掛け算を知っていれば簡単なものです。「・」でなくて「;」を使っているので、その点に気を付けて確認してみてください。
width ( I n ) = height ( I n ) = n （n∈ N ）
) = height ( I ) = n （n∈ ） width ( A ; B ) = width ( A ) 、height ( A; B ) = height ( B ) （ A , B∈Mat、AとBは掛け算可能 ）
( A; B ) ; C = A ;( B;C ) -- 結合法則
n = width ( A ) , m = height ( A ) なら 、I n ; A = A ; I m = A -- 単位法 則
しりとりの圏のときと同じように、圏論一般と行列の圏の対応を表にしておきます。しりとりの例も一緒に載せておきましょう。
圏論一般 行列の例 しりとりの例 対象 自然数 ひらがな文字 射 行列 ひらがな文字列 恒等射 単位行列 長 さ1 の文字列 結合（合成） 行列の掛け算 しりとり結合 対象の集合 自然数の集 合N ひらがな文字の集 合H 射の集合 行列の集 合Mat ひらがな文字列の集 合HStr dom （域） width first cod （余域） height last id （恒等射 ）
I unit
圏の名前付けとか記号とか
圏をちゃんと定義するには、次の構成要素を列挙する必要があります。
さらに、これらがしかるべき条件を満たすことが確認できたら、「圏だ」と言っていいわけです。しりとりの例と行列の例は、確かに圏になっていたわけですね。
特定の圏をきまじめに書くと、(H , HStr , first , last , unit , ;( しりとり結合 ) )
のように書くことになりますが、あまりにも面倒なので、次の習慣に従って記号を節約します。
この習慣に従うと、圏の名前だけを考えれば、残りの記号を考える必要はなくなります。例えば、行列の圏をMatと呼ぶことにすれば、(N , Mat , width , height , I , ;( 逆順の掛け算 ) ) は、( |Mat| , Mat , dom , cod , id , ;) と書けることになります。
ホムセットと矢印記 法
行列の 圏Matで考えることにします。n列m行の行列の全体をMat(n , m)と書きます（列と行をちゃんと区別してね）。この記法を使うと、次の条件はすべて同じです。
Aはn列m行の行列
A∈Mat(n , m )
width ( A ) = n , height ( A ) = m （行列固有の記法 ）
dom ( A ) = n , cod ( A ) = m （圏の一般的な記法 ）
圏論の一般的な習慣では、dom ( A ) = n , cod( A ) = m のとき 、A:n→mという矢印を使った書き方をします。念のためもう一度確認すると：
A∈Mat(n , m ) ⇔ A:n→m
A:n→m ⇔ dom( A ) = n , cod( A ) = m
Mat(n , m ) のように、域( dom ) と余域( cod ) を特定した射の集合はホムセット（hom-set）と呼びます。この呼び名は、かつてMat(n , m) の代わりにHom Mat ( n , m ) のような記法を使っていたからです。
図式順記法と反図式順記法
一般論を少しします。 圏Cの射fは、どれかのホムセットに入ります。別な言い方をすると、適当な対象a , bに対して、f : a→b と書けます。このことは、 「 f∈C( a , b ) ⇔ dom(f ) = a , cod(f ) = b ⇔ f:a→b 」の意味を考えればわかるでしょう。
「 fとgが結合（合成）可能」であることは、次のようないくつかの表現を持ちます。
特に最後の矢印記法 「 f:a→b , g:b→c」に注目すると、「fとgの結合（の結果）」を f ;g と書くのが自然でしょう。そこで、fを左、gを右に書く記法を図式順（diagrammatic order）記法と呼びます。
ところが、歴史的には 「 fとgの結合」 を g・f と書く（実際にはシロマルが多い）方式が長い期間使われてきました（今でも使います）。こちらは反図式順記法になります。
不幸なことに（そして、当然なことに）、現在、図式順記法と反図式順記法の両方が使われていて、混乱することも少なくありません。両方を併用して慣れておくのがよいと思います。
Postings have been quite slow around here … have been busy studying and fighting a nasty URTI .
I ’m afraid postings will suffer in the next couple of months , at least until June , when my baby is born .
But on with another story .
Normally I roll my eyes and do n’t bother with asinine stories , but this one is just too much :
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia – Women should wear chastity belts to prevent rape , incest and other sex crimes , a prominent Islamic cleric in northern Malaysia was quoted as saying Friday .
Abu Hassan Din Al Hafiz , speaking in the northern state of Terengganu , said chastity belts could protect women from a growing number of sex crimes in Malaysia , The Star newspaper reported .
The best way to avert sex perpetrators is to wear protection , ’ Abu Hassan told a crowd of followers .
My intention is not to offend women but to safeguard them from sex maniacs . ’
Yes Mr. Cleric , women must wear chastity belts … is it too much to ask to educate the men over there that women should not be raped ?
I ’m using the word “ men ” loosely here , people who rape women and children are beasts , not humans .
This seems to be a concept that men worldwide do n’t get : you CANNOT rape a women just because you feel like it .
It is in the books you morons – rape somebody and you are going to jail , pure and simple .
And if a woman is raped , it is NOT her fault :
Religious leaders in Malaysia ’s conservative north have in the past blamed sexual attacks on women wearing provocative clothing and make up .
Just in case you do n’t know what a chastity belt is , here is a pic .
I ’m sure the cleric wo n’t mind .

Some young people in China are too busy to find partners
Over the weekend about 5,000 single men and women converged on a Shanghai park for a huge speed dating event , according to Chinese media .
At the beginning of the four - hour party each participant was handed a rose , to be given to the " right " person .
" If you are too shy to approach someone , you could ask ' Cupids ' to deliver the flower or a message , " organiser Yu Jian told the China Daily .
All participants had to be between 20 and 45 , with at least a college education , according to Chinese media .
As well as speed dating , participants could take part in a series of games , and at the end of the evening a king and queen of the night were chosen .
Henny Xu , a 23 - year - old bank clerk , said she had enjoyed the event .
" A big party like this is quite an effective way to seek partners .
I can meet so many people in a short time , " she told the China Daily .
But some young singles in China do not even have time for speed dating .
Yu Su'e went to the party to take digital photos of " suitable men " to show her 32 - year - old daughter .
" I came in place of her .
She was too busy to come , " Yu Su'e told the China Daily .
Soviet - era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation , detentions Larisa Alexandrovna and David Dastych
Published : Wednesday March 7 , 2007 Print This Email This US , Britain asked Poland to join clandestine program POLAND -- The CIA operated an interrogation and short - term detention facility for suspected terrorists within a Polish intelligence training school with the explicit approval of British and US authorities , according to British and Polish intelligence officials familiar with the arrangements .
Intelligence officials identify the site as a component of a Polish intelligence training school outside the northern Polish village of Stare Kiejkuty .
While previously suspected , the facility has never been conclusively identified as being part of the CIA 's secret rendition and detention program .
Only the Polish prime minister and top Polish intelligence brass were told of the plan , in which agents of the United States quietly shuttled detainees from other holding facilities around the globe for stopovers and short - term interrogation in Poland between late 2002 and 2004 .
According to a confidential British intelligence memo shown to RAW STORY , Prime Minister Tony Blair told Poland 's then - Prime Minister Leszek Miller to keep the information secret , even from his own government .
 Miller was asked to keep it as tight as possible ,  the memo said .
The complex at Stare Kiejkuty , a Soviet - era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II , is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union .
Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified  but never named  when the Washington Posts Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIAs secret prison network in November 2005 .
Reached by telephone Monday , Priest would not discuss the allegations in her article beyond her original report .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano would not confirm or deny any allegations about the Polish facility .
He maintained the rendition program was legal and conducted  with great care .
 The agencys terrorist interrogation program has been conducted lawfully , with great care and close review , producing vital information that has helped disrupt plots and save lives ,  Gimigliano said Monday .
 That is also true of renditions , another key , lawful tool in the fight against terror . 
 The United States does not conduct or condone torture , nor does it transfer anyone to other countries for the purpose of torture ,  he added .
US intelligence officials confirmed that the CIA had used the compound at Stare Kiejkuty in the past .
Speaking generally about the agencys program , a former senior official said the CIA had never conducted unlawful interrogations .
 We never tortured anyone ,  one former senior intelligence official said on condition of anonymity .
 We sent them to countries that did torture , but not on this scale . 
The official added that many agency staff had strong feelings about the rendition program .
 Career people were really opposed to this .
All intelligence sources interviewed said the CIA is no longer operating a rendition or secret detainment program .
Polish intelligence officials declined to comment .
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski , the former head of Polish intelligence , told a Polish news agency in 2005 , however , that the CIA had access to two internal zones at the Stare Kiejkuty training school .
Current and former Polish authorities have adamantly denied that Poland played any role in the clandestine program .
US , United Kingdom invited Poland to join program in 2002 In April 2002 , according to British foreign intelligence sources ( MI6 ) , senior officials in the Bush and Blair administrations decided that the Bagram base near Kabul in Afghanistan could not operate successfully in the Bush administrations no holds barred  policy towards suspected terrorists .
MI6 officials say the two administrations then decided to fly high - value suspected terrorists to secret gulags in Eastern Europe .
The CIA - operated flights would pass through the air space of a number of countries  among them Britain , Germany , Spain and Poland .
European Union officials and human rights groups would later say these interrogations may have violated the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Convention against Torture , to which the United States and Poland are both signatories .
After a series of secret meetings chaired by MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett in London and then - CIA Director George Tenet in Washington , Polish intelligence was invited to join the project , British and Polish intelligence sources say .
Authorities singled out a remote and infrequently used airfield in the Northern Polish town of Szymany for transit flights ; a near - by Polish intelligence training school at Stare Kiejkuty would be used as an eventual detention - interrogation center for temporary detention and short - term interrogations .
The White House did not return two calls seeking comment .
Tenet could not be reached .
Rendition programs were first employed by the Clinton administration in order to target suspected elements of al Qaeda .
These covert operations , run out of the CIA , were used intermittently and on a limited basis .
It was not until the Bush Administration that the use of extraordinary rendition became a matter of policy and was employed on a large scale .
The Szczytno - Szymany Airport Szczytno - Szymany used to be a military airfield in northeastern Poland , one of many such airstrips that could accept the large Soviet - made military planes of the Warsaw Pact ; before that , it had served as an airstrip for German Luftwaffe bombers targeting Warsaw in the Second World War .
In 1996 , seven years after Polands communist government fell , the military airfield was turned into a private company : Airports  Mazury - Szczytno . 
However , traffic wasnt heavy enough to provide decent income to the state and private owners of the airfield , so motorcycle and car races were organized on the tarmac ; small - scale production and repairs also buttressed the companys budget .
But after the start of Operation Enduring Freedom  the US military campaign against Afghanistan in response to the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks  everything changed .
In the years that followed , American planes began arriving from Afghanistan , continuing on to Morocco , Uzbekistan and Guantanamo Bay , according to Szymany locals and airport staff .
Then - Szymany airport manager Mariola Przewlocka told European Union investigators the flights were likely linked with the intelligence complex at Stare Kiejkuty , about 12 miles away from the airport .
Przewlocka said that whenever one of the suspected flights was scheduled to land , orders were given directly by the regional border guards emphasizing that the airport authorities should not approach the aircraft and that military staff and services alone would handle landings .
 Money for the services was paid in cash , sometimes as much as four times the normal charge ,  the former airport manager added .
 Handling of the passengers aboard was carried out in a remote corner of the Szymany airstrip .
People came in and out from four - wheel drive cars with shaded windows .
The cars were seen traveling to and from the Stare Kiejkuty intelligence facility , where British and Polish intelligence officials say US agents conducted short - term interrogations before shuffling prisoners to other locations .
Przewlocka also spoke in detail with the Chicago Tribune , whose correspondent traveled to Szymany last month .
 Secret prisons  were likely temporary black sites 
Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union , first identified by the Washington Post , are likely not permanent locations , making them difficult to identify .
What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed , officials say .
Interim black sites   secret facilities used for covert activities  can be as small as a room in a government building , which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short - term detainment and interrogation .
For example , detainees could be shuffled from a temporary black site in one country to a temporary black site in another country , never staying long enough at either to attract notice .
Such an arrangement , sources say , would allow plausible deniability by the host country as well as the US .
Investigators looking for a permanent facility would never find one .
Such a site , sources say , would have to be near an airport .
Washington - based security expert and president of Global Security John Pike says short - term detention in already existing facilities would be sensible tradecraft and a more likely scenario than a network of specific , long term prisons .
 A short - term operation does not develop a big signature and you dont have a continual parade of people ,  said Pike .
 When it becomes noticeable , they move it all . 
 It s a shell game ,  he added .
Pressure from US and Britain to keep quiet
In the wake of the Washington Post expose , member countries of the European Union began to demand answers .
According to British and Polish intelligence officials , foreign journalists , and EU sources interviewed for this article , the countries participating in the US rendition and detention program and their governments were kept largely out of the loop .
Officials say Bush and Blair administration contacts selectively chose politicians in the EU and other countries , keeping their respective governments in the dark .
Having only a select few members of the European Union aware of the program , coupled with the transience of the prison network , made it difficult for European Union investigators to verify allegations of secret detention sites .
A ten -member EU delegation traveled to Poland in November 2006 to investigate Szymany airport and the facility at Stare Kiejstuty .
The teams report indicates that key government officials first agreed to meet with the delegates , but declined to do so after their arrival .
The delegates requested interviews of 20 Polish government officials , journalists and others , but were allowed to speak with only nine .
Of those interviewed , only a handful could offer any substantive information .
One of the more interesting interviews came from former Szczytno - Szymany Airport chairman Jerzy Kos .
According to the report , Kos stated that at the time the airport was under his authority , it belonged to the Military Property Agency and was leased by his company .
Kos stated that after a Boeing 737 landed on Sept. 22 , 2003 , a standard military procedure came into force under which Polish Border Guards determined the character of incoming flights and expedited certain arrivals .
 The military procedure was a simplified one , including provision for no customs clearance ,  Kos told investigators .
He said he had no information about the passengers as procedure was undertaken by soldiers and not the civilian airport staff . 
Kos asserted that during his tenure from 2003 to 2004 , Gulfstream planes transferring through the airport were treated as military flights in the same fashion as the Border Guards had handled the Boeing 737 in September 2003 .
Air traffic controllers had been informed by the Warsaw - based Air Traffic Agency that Gulfstream planes would land at the airport by fax ,  Kos told investigators .
Polish public television journalist Adam Krzykowski added more detail .
Krzykowski alleged that the September 2003 Boeing 737 carried a crew of seven and was joined at the Szymany airfield by five passengers who declared themselves businessmen .
According to the EU report , Krzykowski maintained that all twelve were American citizens . 
 The Boeing flight was not subject to standard border control procedure , but to a simplified procedure [ which ] meant that no customs officers were present during the control and passengers were checked only on basis of a list delivered to the Border Guards ,  he said .
 According to the Border Guards , such a procedure is used when a person has already been checked up on previously . 
The final report of the European Unions investigation into Poland as well as the other countries alleged to be part of the rendition program can be read here .
Most of those the EU sought to question did not cooperate with investigators , including suspected governments , journalists and key officials in the United States .
Dana Priest , the Washington Post reporter who received a Pulitzer Prize for her article exposing the CIAs secret detention centers , declined to speak with EU investigators .
 The Post never allows its reporters to testify to government inquiries no matter what government it is , so there was nothing unusual in that regard ,  Priest said Monday .
The only member of the Bush Administration given leave to discuss the program with the EU was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who said she expected American allies to co-operate and keep quiet about sensitive anti-terrorism operations .
The Reopening of Szymany Airport
The prime - time for Szymany International Airport seems to have ended in 2006 , when the investigation by the European Parliament was finished without a clear result or definitive proof of CIA secret prisons  existing in Poland .
Polish officials refused to cooperate and vehemently denied any role in the CIA program .
The airport company had to suspend its activities , due to a dispute over the ownership of the Szczytno - Szymany airfield .
In November 2006 , the company signed a lease agreement with the Military Property Agency , which still owns the land and the facilities .
This agreement opened the way for financing of the airport by the regional administration and the Polish government .
The Szymany airfield , now in civilian hands and allegedly free of rendition flights ,  will soon become a regional airport .
Its beautiful location in the Masurian Lakes Region will likely kindle its development , and the fame of its history surrounding secret CIA flights could certainly become an attractive tourist - catching slogan .
