PHOENIX — A federal judge has permanently barred Arizona from using a state law to prosecute an online merchant who sells shirts that list names of thousands of troops killed in Iraq .
U.S. District Judge Neil
Wake did not strike down the 2007 law against selling products that use military casualties ’ names without families ’ permission .
But he ruled yesterday that using the law to prosecute Dan Frazier would violate the Flagstaff man ’s First Amendment rights because his “ Bush Lied — They Died ” shirts are “ core political speech . ”
“ It is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display , ” Wake wrote .
“ For example , the state argues that Frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers ’ names .
But Frazier ’s product is his message , and his customers ’ message . ”
Arizona ’s law was enacted with little debate by the Legislature , and Louisiana , Oklahoma and Texas have enacted similar laws .
A spokeswoman for Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said Goddard ’s office was reviewing the ruling and did not immediately know whether it would appeal .
“ I always knew the Constitution was on my side , ” Frazier said in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union .

Remember Troy Eid ?
He 's the Denver US Attorney ( one that apparently survived the US Attorney purge ) who was quick to play down any actual threat of the alleged assassination plot against Barack Obama during the Democratic National Convention , characterizing the men arrested as nothing more than a bunch of " meth heads " .
Media Bloodhound did a lot of research to show that showed that Eid was n't exactly on the up and up with the media about what was going on .
Eid 's statement appears to be patently false .
As reported by the Associated Press : ( Suspect Nathan ) Johnson later told a federal agent that the men talked about assassinating Obama only because he was black , according to a federal arrest affidavit .
Johnson said he also heard Adolf say that he wanted to kill Obama " on the day of his inauguration " and that he would " find high ground to set up and shoot Obama , " the affidavit said .
That 's not merely , as Eid called it , " the racist rantings of drug abusers . "
Rather , coupled with the arsenal found , it shows motive , intent and a plan .
And , to be clear , contrary to what Eid told the press , it was in the affidavit .
Turns out , that kind of research got under Eid's craw , and he wrote an op -ed for the Denver Post complaining about the bloggers who were demanding he explain why he did n't think three men with maps , ammo , weapons , computers and written intent should n't be considered a " credible " threat .

Are you having a hard time stretching your grocery dollars during the current economic downturn ?
You 're not alone .
But before you stop buying fresh fruit , meat , vegetables and other items often perceived as costing a lot , check out these tips from a University of Michigan Health System dietitian .
Holly Scherer , R.D. , says you can follow a few easy guidelines and still buy healthy foods , rather than switching to a diet of potato chips , macaroni and cheese , and a fast - food burger .
She suggests that you make your own coffee , buy fruits and vegetables that are in season , occasionally replace meat with protein sources like eggs and beans , and , no matter how tempting it is , skip the fast - food drive - thru window .
" Hard economic times do n't mean that you have to eat less well , " says Scherer , a health educator with MFit , the health promotion division of the U - M Health System .
" By planning ahead , shopping for sales and trying out those generic or store brands , you really can save a significant amount of money while also providing healthy , well - balanced food for your family .
" Scherer debunks a popular myth : That produce is too expensive .
Wrong , she says .
In fact , if you buy fruit and vegetables that are in - season , the price typically is very reasonable , she says .
Buying fruit or vegetables by the bag instead of individually also tends to be cheaper .
If the produce you want is n't in - season , canned and frozen fruits and vegetables can cost less .
They are just as nutritious as fresh because they are packaged at their peak of freshness .
If you 're feeling especially frugal - and you have a green thumb - try growing your own , she says .
" A great way to get fresh fruits and vegetables right outside your own door is to plant a vegetable garden , or , if you do n't have space , you can plant a few plants in a pot , " Scherer notes .
" You may pay one to two dollars for a vegetable plant , but you 're going to get a very large amount of produce from that .
" Protein can be a tricky thing to buy on a budget .
Filet mignon and fresh lobster are probably out of the picture , but you can still find tasty meat for low prices .
First , Scherer says , it 's better to buy the less - prepared items .
" You can season and marinate your own meat ; you do n't need the store to do that for you , " she says .
You 'll save money , and you can also find nutritious , low - salt ways of preparing meat compared with store - prepared items .
In addition , buying chicken with the bone and skin can cost a lot less , and you can remove those easily to make a skinless boneless chicken breast .
And meat is n't your only option .
Consider replacing meat with a protein substitute a couple times a week .
" You can pay sometimes three times more per ounce for meat rather than buying a substitute such as beans , eggs or peanut butter , " Scherer says .
As with protein sources , buying less - processed grains is the way to go .
Stick with the plain brown rice instead of boxed rice mixes .
Buy big containers of quick - cooking oats instead of individual packets of instant oatmeal .
And it 's a good idea to buy bread , English muffins or whole wheat tortillas when they 're on sale and freeze any extras that you 're not going to use before the expiration date , Scherer says .
One of the biggest cost - savings can result from buying a filter for your tap water instead of buying bottled water , Scherer says .
Also , buying the frozen juice concentrate instead of a large bottle or can of juice can save some money .
For the triple - iced - latte lovers among you , coffee can cost a lot less than $ 4 a cup .
" Making your own coffee at home and adding a specialty creamer or something that makes it a little tastier is a lot less expensive than going out every morning for that specialty coffee drink , " Scherer says .
Instead of buying 100 - calorie packs or individual bags of baked chips or pretzels , buy the bigger box and package them yourself in little snack bags .
You 'll pay about half of what you would if you were buying the single - serve packs , she says . *
Look for the generic or store brand .*
Look for bigger containers and boxes to save some money .
To see if you are really getting a better deal , compare the unit prices of the bigger and smaller containers on the store 's shelf . *
Stock up on non-perishables when they go on sale .*
Avoid the temptation of the cookie aisle and the chip aisle .
" Spend more time in the perimeter of the store , where the fresh products are , and really focus on the fruits and the vegetables and the lean meats and the low - fat dairy , " Scherer says . *
Use coupons , but only for things that you normally would buy - not a lot of high - fat , high - sugar foods . *
Cook at home instead of going out to eat . *
When you do eat out and you know that a restaurant serves large portions , have them bag half the meal right when they serve it and eat the leftovers for lunch the next day .
Some quick and easy recipe ideas that are inexpensive include black bean salad , vegetables and scrambled eggs , and peanut butter and jelly in your brown bagged lunch .
For the black bean salad , cut up some of your favorite fresh vegetables , add them to a can of rinsed black beans with a squirt of lime juice and some cilantro , and serve in a tortilla or with some baked tortilla chips , Scherer recommends .
I would recommend frequenting your local growers for fresh fruit and produce .
Many local farmers have road side stands filled with just - picked produce at a far lower cost than grocery stores .

F*ck Martha Stewart ” 11 Lessons from the Movie “ Fight Club ”
Tyler Durden : “ We ’re consumers .
We are by - products of a lifestyle obsession .
Murder , crime , poverty , these things do n’t concern me .
What concerns me are celebrity magazines , television with 500 channels , some guy ’s name on my underwear .
Rogaine , Viagra , Olestra . ”
Narrator : “ Martha Stewart . “
Tyler Durden : “ F*ck Martha Stewart .
Martha ’s polishing the brass on the Titanic .
It ’s all going down , man .
So f*ck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns . “
The movie fight club is filled with memorable quotes like this one …
But embedded in the movie are also some great lessons that can be applied to everyday life .
1. Listen to people … Do n’t just wait for your turn to talk
There is a scene in fight club where Edward Norton ’s character talks about his rational for attending group therapy sessions for people with cancer or other illnesses .
He says “ When people think you ’re dying , they really , really listen to you , instead of just ( waiting for their turn to speak ) ” ( The sentence is finished by another character in the film . )
The point being .. people DO realize that you are not paying attention when they are talking to you .
Shut off the cell phone or blackberry , do not glance around the room for someone more interesting .
Stand there , make eye contact , and really listen to what someone is saying .
2 . We are victims of consumerism
“ The things you own end up owning you .
Right .
We are consumers .
We ’re the bi-products of a lifestyle obsession ”
We do not NEED all the things we think we need , and NEWSFLASH !
when we get the things we think we need … they probably are n’t making us any happier .
3 . Do something for someone else
There is a scene in the movie where Tyler Durden takes a young store clerk behind the store and puts a gun to his head .
He scares the shit out of the young guy , then he asks him what he wants to do with his life .
He ends up saying that he would like to be a veterinarian .
Tyler then tells him he is keeping his license and he is going to check in on the young man , if he is n’t on his way to becoming a veterinarian in a few weeks … Tyler will kill him .
A bit drastic agreed , but as Tyler Durden explains … ” Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel ’s life .
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted .
” You can bet that Raymond also probably enrolled in school …
We should try to have an impact on someone else ’s life .
Maybe a big life altering impact ( but perhaps a little more subtle than a gun . )
4 . Steer clear of major corporations
The small gang aka the “ fight club ” has a major problem with corporations .
A good deal of their energy is spent trying to bring down these massively powerful corporations .
While this approach they take is rather primitive , it does reinforce a good point .
Corporations are becoming too powerful .
Everywhere you look you see nothing but chain restaurants , chain gas stations , and chain retail stores .
Forget the few dollars you will save at the chain …
Give the mom and pop shop a try .
Chances are , you will get better tasting food , better quality products , and better service .
5. Seize the Day
“ This is your life and it ’s ending one minute at a time . ”
This quote is a somewhat negative way to look at life , but the idea behind it is to live for the moment .
Do n’t put off till tomorrow , what you could do today .
6 . Do that thing that you have always wanted to do
Tyler Durden is threatening to intentionally crash his car , while doing this he asks the passengers in the car what is the one thing they would regret they had n’t done before they died … two of the men have immediate answers “ paint a self - portrait ” , “ build a house ” .
Figure out the answer to this question , then go do it .

7 . Accept things outside of your control
“ I say never be complete , I say stop being perfect , I say let … lets evolve , let the chips fall where they may . ”
We do not have to do / have everything .
Accept your life .
Be proud of it .
8. Challenge the status quo
The question is raised …
Why do they have oxygen masks on a plane ?
The response … ” Oxygen gets you high .
In a catastrophic emergency , you ’re taking giant panicked breaths .
Suddenly you become euphoric , docile .
You accept your fate .
It ’s all right here .
Emergency water landing – 600 miles an hour .
Blank faces , calm as Hindu cows . ”
This is obviously not the rationale explained by the flight crew , and definitely not the commonly held belief .
But …when you think about it …it seems like it could be possible .
Approach all situations creatively , the solution may not be what is obvious and apparent .
9. Persistence is key
Tyler tells Edward Norton ’s character , “ All right , if the applicant is young , tell him he ’s too young .
Old , too old .
Fat , too fat .
If the applicant then waits for three days without food , shelter , or encouragement he may then enter and begin his training . ”
Sometimes we are tested by people or situations .
Be persistent , do n’t let “ quitter ” define you .
10 .
Not everyone is a winner
The current generation that is being raised is a generation where every kid on the team is the “ MVP ” , everyone is picked for every team , everyone is special .
The real world is not like this .
There are winners and losers , and the people that learn from their losses are the ones who end up winners .
Much of what happens in life is a result of the hard work you put in , and the “ luck ” that you create .
11 . Live your LIFE !
“ If you are reading this then this warning is for you .
Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life .
Do n’t you have other things to do ?
Is your life so empty that you honestly can’t think of a better way to spend these moments ?
Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it ?
Do you read everything you ’re supposed to read ?
Do you think every thing you ’re supposed to think ?
Buy what you ’re told to want ?
Get out of your apartment .
Meet a member of the opposite sex .
Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation .
Quit your job .
Start a fight .
Prove you ’re alive .
If you do n’t claim your humanity you will become a statistic .
You have been warned ”
If you have n’t read it or watched it …it ’s okay to be a consumer for a couple minutes to Read the Book or Watch the Movie

A popular Sunni Muslim cleric with a television show and a website that churns out religious edicts and dieting tips agitated centuries - old animosities in the Islamic world recently by referring to Shiite Muslims as heretics seeking to invade Sunni societies .
The bitter , often bloody , divide between the two main branches of Islam has been an undercurrent since the 7th century , but Sheik Yusuf Qaradawi ’s vitriol comes at a fragile time , when Sunni countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt are wary that the predominantly Shiite nations of Iraq and Iran could destabilize the region .
With populist fervor , Qaradawi ’s comments intertwined religious mistrust with political suspicion .
Iran ’s nuclear program and influence with the Shiite - led government in Iraq and the radical group Hezbollah in Lebanon have agitated Sunni governments .
Fighting between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq , which left tens of thousands dead since the U.S. invasion of 2003 , has calmed , but the Sunni Arab minority worries about its future .
“ Shiites are Muslims but they are heretics and their danger comes from their attempts to invade Sunni society , ” said Qaradawi , who was quoted in the Egyptian independent daily Al Masry al Youm .
“ They are able to do that because their billions of dollars trained cadres of Shiites proselytizing in Sunni countries .
. . .
We should protect Sunni society from the Shiite invasion . ”

Those opinions were first published Sept. 6 . Since then , Qaradawi , a man with a polished voice and a gray beard who hosts a show on Islamic law on TV channel Al Jazeera , has been chastised by Shiite scholars and writers in what has turned into a war of polemics and personal attacks played out on websites and in newspapers from Doha to Cairo .
Qaradawi ’s statements are dangerous and may “ push the Muslim people in the direction of more division , ” Ayatollah Mohammed Taskhiri , vice president of the International Union of Muslim Scholars , was quoted as saying in the Iranian press .
The Tabnak News Agency , which is close to Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Council , condemned the comments as a “ calculated conspiracy against Iranian Shiites . ”
Another leading Shiite cleric , Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah of Lebanon , said Qaradawi was instigating fitna , or civil strife .
The protests have not fazed Qaradawi ; he has appeared more defiant .

“ I do not care and I am not shaken by this stir .
I made this statement to answer to the dictates of my conscience and religion and responsibility , ” he said in a second interview with Al Masry al Youm published Thursday .
“ I am trying to preempt the threat before it gets worse .
If we let Shiites penetrate Sunni societies , the outcome wo n’t be praiseworthy .
The presence of Shiites in Iraq and Lebanon is the best evidence of instability . ”
Qaradawi is a prominent moderate cleric , but he has grown skeptical of Shiite intentions .
Two years , ago he suggested that Shiites were using the mystical Sufi order of Islam as a cover to penetrate Sunni society .
His most recent volleys undercut efforts by Islamic leaders to ease religious tensions , and raise questions about his motivations .
Much of the funding for Qaradawi’s Qatar - based media enterprises comes from Sunni nations uneasy over Iran ’s widening influence in the Persian Gulf .
Abul - Fazel Amoee , an Iranian political scientist , said Qaradawi had become an instrument of anti-Shiite propaganda orchestrated by Sunni royals .
He said this parallels the “ deep rivalry between Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran , and the stage of this competition or ideological battle today is the field of Iraq . ”
Sectarian differences should “ not be handled by exchanging outlandish and fanatical statements .
I ’m talking about both sides -- Qaradawi and the Shiites , ” said Abdel Moati Bayoumi , a religious scholar and member of Egypt ’s Islamic Research Academy .
He said divisions between Sunnis and Shiites , which began as a fight over succession after the death of the prophet Muhammad in the 7th century , would weaken Muslim states and serve foreign interests .
Advertisement
Qaradawi ’s attacks on Shiites received both support and derision in cyberspace , where Islam ’s internal battles and other dilemmas , such as relations with the West , are increasingly debated .
The website for Arabic Radio of Iran was buzzing with posts .
“ O , Qaradawi , may God guide you to the right path .
Your statements , which do n’t follow any logic , sow the seeds of sectarianism , ” wrote Ahmed Noaimi , a Shiite from Bahrain .
“ Sunnis and we are brothers in Bahrain .
I do n’t know why this war against Shiites ; we are Muslims at the end .
Why are you making such a statement instead of calling for the unity of both sects ?
Use your brain , respected sir . ”
Another respondent , Abu Idris , wrote : “ May God protect the respected sheik .
He was patient toward what the Shiites have been doing until he felt he had to yell in their faces and draw the attention of their rational people to the danger of what they are doing in the Muslim world . ”

Globular clusters are , well , globe - shaped collections of stars .
Millions of 'em , usually , packed into a ball just a few light years across .
They 're much smaller than galaxies , and in fact galaxies like the Milky Way have hundreds of them orbiting it , like bees swarming around a hive .
The stars in globulars are usually very old , indicating that studying these beasties can tell us a lot about how galaxies form .
So scientists pointed Hubble at a cluster of galaxies -- a gravitationally - bound collections of many , sometimes thousands , of galaxies -- to see what globulars they could see .
What they found was pretty cool .
The cluster they chose was the Virgo Cluster , the nearest such swarm of galaxies .
It 's only 55 or so million light years away , which is practically in our face .
That makes the globulars easier to see , and in their surveys the astronomers say they were able to distinguish something like 90 % of the total numbers of globulars ( from the ground , they 'd look like stars ) -- they bagged over 11,000 globulars in the Virgo cluster , an incredible number ( there are about 2000 galaxies in the cluster ) .
Of particular interest are the dwarf galaxies ( like IC 3506 , pictured above from the Hubble survey ; nearly all the " stars " in that picture are actually globular clusters ) , dinky galaxies that have fewer stars than massive ones like the Milky Way .
Since they 're smaller , they tend to have fewer globulars orbiting them , and are more sensitive to forces around them .
Astronomers found two interesting effects : dwarf galaxies within about 3 million light years of the center of the Virgo cluster had more globular clusters orbiting them than dwarf galaxies farther out , but dwarf galaxies closer in , less than 130,000 light years from Virgo 's center , tended to have few or no globulars at all !
This is being interpreted as meaning that globular clusters tend to form more easily in slightly denser environments such as those near ( but not at ) the center of galaxy clusters .
However , if they venture too close to the core , they have their globulars stripped away .
M87 is a massive elliptical galaxy smack in the heart of Virgo .
It probably has something like a trillion stars , five times the number the Milky Way has .
Over billions of years it 's built up its mass , eating the stars from other galaxies as they fly by ( it also eats entire galaxies ) .
Apparently it 's done that with globulars from dwarf galaxies too , stripping off their globular clusters and keeping them for its own .
That explains why no dwarf galaxies too close to M87 at the center of Virgo have globulars ( and a chemical analysis of the globulars orbiting M87 indicate they are low in heavy elements like iron , suggesting they come from farther out in the cluster ) .
The image there is of M87 .
Take a close look ; just about every single point of light you see there is a globular cluster !
The beam coming from the center is a blast of particles and radiation being emitted from M87's central supermassive black hole ( which is a whole ' nuther story unto itself ) .
Although the Milky Way is not really a part of any cluster ( it is moving toward the Virgo Cluster but is not really a part of it ) our environment is different , and the way we formed is probably different as well from galaxies in Virgo .
But just like comparative anthropology , comparative galaxology ( OK , I made that up , but you know what I mean ) can tell us more about how we got here , and what 's happened since the Milky Way formed 10 billion years ago .
It 's a big puzzle , but we have big pictures to help us figure it out .
Ozone hole 8 % larger this year , meteorologists say
The ozone hole over Antarctica , a doorway for harmful solar radiation , is bigger than last year , a worrying sign to scientists studying global warming , the World Meteorological Organization said .
The area of atmosphere without ozone has grown to 27 million square kilometers ( 10.4 million square miles ) , 8 percent larger than the maximum reached in 2007 , the group said today in an e- mailed statement .
The hole usually reaches its maximum in late September or early October before receding in an annual cycle .
The ozone layer , which shields the Earth from biologically harmful sun rays , has been measured since the 1950s .
The ozone 5 to 6 miles above ground has gained importance among scientists studying how a warmer climate worldwide might alter the layer .
The depletion this year is probably a temporary reversal in a long - term improvement of the ozone layer , said David Parsons , the meteorological organization 's chief for world weather research .
" You can have strong annual variations , due to changes in weather , colder temperatures in the stratosphere and increased water vapor " that can undercut the ozone layer , Parsons said in an interview from Geneva .
" It 's important to keep your eye on the long - term trend , which is that the ozone hole is moving toward recovery , " Parsons said .
Scientists credit the improvement largely to the 1987 international agreement to cut use of chemicals known as CFCs and HCFCs such as from spray cans that enlarged the ozone hole .
The interplay between warmer surface temperatures on Earth and the ozone high in the stratosphere is a growing area of research .
" The observed changes in the stratosphere could delay the expected recovery of the ozone layer , " the statement said .
" Scientists are increasingly aware of the possible links between ozone depletion and climate change . "
Increased emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and vehicles , while warming the atmosphere 's lowest level , or troposphere , actually help cool the stratosphere .
There , lower temperatures speed up the chemical reactions that destroy ozone .
In turn , a cooler stratosphere will affect weather patterns and climate .
" The effects go both ways , " Parsons said .

Former Democratic turned “ Independent ” Senator Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) took a not so veiled shot at Obama ’s patriotism before he introduced John McCain in York , PA today .
“ In my opinion , the choice could not be more clear : between one candidate , John McCain , who ’s had experience , been tested in war and tried in peace , another candidate who has not .
Between one candidate , John McCain , who has always put the country first , worked across party lines to get things done , and one candidate who has not .
Between one candidate who ’s a talker , and the other candidate who ’s the leader America needs as our next candidate , ” The Caucus blog quoted Lieberman as saying .
I am curious about what people like Lieberman and McCain think Obama has done that were not putting his country first ?
Is it because he wants to bring the troops home from a pointless war in Iraq ?
It is because Obama does n’t always wear a flag lapel pin , or could be that the last name Obama does n’t sound American enough for Lieberman ?
Advertisements
I do n’t know about you , but I grew tired of Lieberman ’s act long ago .
I think the Democrats should not allow him to caucus with them anymore when the new Congress comes into session in January .
They should also take his committee chairmanship away from him .
It is obvious that Lieberman is n’t a Democratic leaning Independent .
He has cast his lot with the Republican Party , so that is where he should be .
The McCain camp is now completely quoting from the Karl Rove playbook .
McCain is fear over hope and style over substance .
If this is what Lieberman is supporting , then he does n’t belong anywhere near the Democratic Party .
The greatest science fiction heroes live on the edge , skimming the jagged maw of death every day .
" Scifi hero " is a high - risk profession , so you should n't expect your idols to live forever .
But at the very least , you can hope your hero gets a good death - a hero 's death - instead of going out like a punk .
So it 's too bad that some of our most favorite space adventurers have been stuck with lame deaths .
Here 's our list of the 12 scifi hero deaths that made us feel like instead of our heroes cheating death , death cheated our heroes .
With spoilers .

12 ) Shepherd Book .
I almost mentioned Wash here , since his death in Serenity upset me tremendously - but at least Wash 's death made sense in context .
Wash gets to die heroically , piloting the ship through a crazy dogfight over a scary planet , then gliding a dead ship to a landing ( almost ) everyone can walk away from .
His death is jarring and shocking , and it feels like we get to love him all over again before saying goodbye .
But Shepherd Book on the other hand — he feels like a throwaway character in the movie , and his death is pretty pointless .
He 's just there to mouth a few words about spirituality and then get wasted .
And his death , unlike Wash , is purely there for plot - hammer purposes .
He 's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru — he dies so that Mal can realize that there 's no way to hide from the Operative any longer , and he 's too mad to keep hiding .
It 's the plot - device death that lets Mal turn to the camera and ( pretty much ) say " Now it 's personal . "
He 's Mal 's girlfriend in a refrigerator .
Shepherd Book deserved so , so much more than that .

11 ) Marcus Cole in Babylon 5 .
He 's madly in love with Susan Ivanova , but never gets anywhere with her .
Until finally , he sacrificed his life to save hers , using an alien device to transfer all his life energy to hers .
Says actor Jason Carter :
" The irony of it all is that I gave my life in order that someone else might live who then left the show ! "
Carter laughs , referring to Claudia Christian 's decision to quit as Ivanova at the of B5 's fourth season .
" I mean , what was the point about that then ?
It kind of makes my heroic act a little pointless , I thought . "

Carter actually filmed two versions of the story : one where Cole died , and one where he was cryogenically frozen .
And later , we found out the frosty version of Cole 's fate was the real version , and creator J. Michael Straczynski wrote a story where Cole gets revived and gets to live on a barren planet with a clone of Ivanova .
Aww . ( Runner up : I nearly put Boone from Earth : The Final Conflict in this slot . )

10 ) Pantha .
Actually , she can serve as a stand - in for every great comics character who 's had a throwaway death in a major crossover .
It never fails : some character who used to be popular or star in their own book falls from grace , until he / she turns into cannon fodder .
All in the name of showing how bad - ass the latest bad - guy is , like Eclipso killing off the Will Payton version of Starman , or Max Lord shooting Blue Beetle in the head .
Or Black Goliath randomly dying off in Civil War .
But poor old Pantha may be the worst .
One of the most loved New Titans characters in the 1990s , she 'd fallen into obscurity by the time Infinite Crisis came around .
So she randomly gets in the way of Superboy Prime 's backhand .
He spends a few panels afterwards staring at her rolling head and trying to insist he did n't really mean to do that .
Way to prove you 're not stupid , Superboy Prime .
( Oh , and another comic - book runner up : I almost threw Superman in here , because his 1992 " death " was really cheap and weird .
He and Doomsday just punch each other a whole lot , and then they 're both dead .
Except that they 're not . )

9 ) Carson Beckett .
Actually , there have been so many deaths on Stargate that left us unsatisfied , from Janet to Martouf to Her -ur ( who shoulda been a contender ! ) .
But at least none of those other characters were killed by an exploding tumor , which apparently is the cutting edge in space terrorism .
Watson has a tumor that was due to explode and kill everyone and Beckett insists on removing it instead of putting Watson in isolation .
He gets it out in time , but then it blows up and kills Beckett and the bomb - disposal team .
And yes , I know Beckett later comes back , but it's his clone or something .
8 ) The Lone Gunmen .
They were cool enough to get their own short - lived spin - off series , but then they died ( or possibly faked their deaths ) in an episode that did n't even have Mulder and Scully in it .
In the episode " Jump The Shark , " the Lone Gunmen return to the show after the end of their own spin - off , only to get locked in a room with a virus bomb .

7 ) Trinity in the Matrix : Revolutions .
Mostly , her death is weak because she gets killed and then keeps talking for another ten minutes .
( Thanks to Meredith for the suggestion . )
6 ) Cpl. Hicks in Aliens 3 .
He 's one of the coolest characters in Aliens , stepping up and taking charge after everything goes rotten .
He stands up to the slimy Burke and listens to Ripley when she says they have to wipe out the aliens .
But what does that get him in the third movie ?
An off - screen death at the movie 's beginning , with just his name on a computer screen to confirm that he died .
( Thanks again to Meredith for this one . )

5 ) Louanne " Kat " Katraine .
She was one of my favorite characters on Battlestar Galactica , maybe because she was the only one who ever really called Starbuck on all her shit .
So I was bummed when she got turned into a drug addict , and then it turned out she 's an imposter who stole the name Louanne Katraine and is involved in running contraband .
She may even have helped the Cylons infiltrate human society prior to the attacks .
Even though I usually love Jane Espenson 's writing , I really did n't like the episode " The Passage , " in which Kat suddenly gets a whole new backstory as a smuggler , before being " redeemed " by sacrificing her life in a radiation field .
It felt sort of cheap , as if the show was turning one of its coolest characters into a whole different person before disposing of her .

4 ) Judge Giant .
He was one of the coolest characters in the Judge Dredd universe — until he got shot in the back during a riot in the " Block War " storyline .
It was a quick , throwaway cheap death for such a cool character .
Writer Alan Grant later apologized , according to Wikipedia : " When we wrote the death of Giant , I thought it was a great idea to kill him off in such a casual , natural ( for a judge ) way .
But when the reader outcry came , I was startled and forced to see things from their point of view . "
3 ) Cyclops in X - Men 3 .
This was a cheap death , except that it ended up being very expensive — it totally cost the movie my interest and suspension of disbelief .
I spent about an hour after Cyclops died assuming they 'd faked his death for some reason , and expecting him to pop up at a critical moment .
And when I finally accepted that Cyclops had died off screen , at the hands of his true love , who had gone batshit after being hit with a plot hammer , I was so incredulous I could barely pay attention to all the waffling and wailing over whether Rogue was going to get Mutant - begone treatment or not .
( Did she ?
I can't even remember . )

2) The Sixth Doctor .
When the BBC fired Colin Baker as the star of Doctor Who , they asked him to come back so they could kill him off and regenerate him into a new actor .
Not surprisingly , he said no thanks .
In that instance , the classy thing would have been to introduce the new Doctor already settled in the role , and pretend the Colin Baker Doctor had died off - screen .
( As a bonus , that approach would have allowed you to write out Bonnie Langford 's Mel at the same time . )
Instead , they put a curly blond wig onto the new Doctor , Sylvester McCoy , and had him pretend to be the old Doctor for long enough to blur his face .
And poor old Colin's Doctor died , not saving the universe , but banging his head on the TARDIS console while the Rani was shooting pew - pew lasers at the time machine .
1 ) Captain Kirk .
Actually , I pretty much want to make Captain Kirk numbers one through 10 on this list , since his death in Star Trek : Generations was the gold standard for disappointing ends .
Advertisement
He finally agrees to leave the happy horse - barn paradise to help Captain Picard deal with Malcolm McDowell , who really should n't have posed much of a challenge for one Captain , let alone two .
Maybe if it was Clockwork Orange Malcolm McDowell ( before the treatments ) or even Get Crazy Malcolm McDowell .
But cranky old Malcolm McDowell ?
Why why why ?
McDowell basically beats the crap out of Kirk .
It could have been worse .
It could have been the original version they shot :
Trek runner up : Trip in the final episode of Enterprise .
Why did he have to sacrifice his life when faced with a set of standard - issue thugs ?
Normally , he would have defeated the low - rent space - crooks with one pinky and some technobabble , but suddenly it becomes a matter of life and death because it 's the final episode .
Advertisement
BONUS : I had to add Boba Fett from Star Wars : Return Of The Jedi , becuase as Rickotron and Bonniegrrl pointed out , he totally gets the short end of the lightsaber .
He gets built up as this super - cool bounty hunter , and then he just sort of gets knocked into the mouth of the desert beastie .
Yuck .
And Star Wars runner - up status goes to Mace Windu and all the Jedi who get zapped by Clone Troopers in Revenge Of The Sith .
Check out these maps of GDP
When you see the map , it becomes radically apparent just how firmly Britain was the root of the Industrial revolution .
With the lone exception of Japan , the darkest places on the map are either next to Britain , or former British colonies .
And aside from Saudi Arabia and Chile , all the growth seems to spread outward from those Anglosphere points of infection .
Nowhere , not even Saudi Arabia , has the income density of Western Europe and North America .
This map tells pretty much the same story , but adds a lot of new information :
GDP again seems to spread out from the Anglosphere infection -- but only where there are ports .
Ten thousand years or so after the first humans built sailing ships for trade , the coast still matters immensely .
In fact , there are only two prosperous landlocked countries of any size : Austria and Switzerland .
And at roughly 8 million people apiece , neither of them is what you would call " large " .
It 's telling that three out of four of Europe 's landlocked countries are best known for their bank secrecy laws -- an export that requires little effort to transport .
The energy savings of moving goods by water is so immense that a good coastline is a really good substitute for rich neighbors -- think Chile .
Meanwhile , those who wonder why Africa remains mired in poverty can observe how few dark spots there are along the coasts .
In part this is horrible institutions , but it's also due to the fact that Africa has very few good sites for ports -- the best ones are on the north and south of the continent .
The final map shows growth :
Growth is inversely correlated with wealth , but positively correlated with having rich neighbors .
It 's a pity that geography is so rarely taught in schools above the third grade level -- there 's an enormous amount to learn about societies just from looking at maps .
Update
In the comments , Susan of Texas informs me that schools have started teaching geography again .
I 'm glad to hear that we 're finally rectifying a tragic mistake .
The ' best before ' challenge ...
One man boldly goes beyond the use - by dates on his food
It is lunchtime and I am arguing with my wife .
It is a big one .
We are entering neighbours - can - hear - every - word territory .
Something terrible has come between us : an uncooked piece of chicken .
My wife Emily points out that it is six days past its Use - By date and shouts : ' It 's gone off , idiot ! '
She accuses me of trying to poison my stepson Felix , 16 , who , like me , wants to eat it .
I say she should n't believe everything she reads on the label .
This makes things worse .
Welcome to an unusual experiment .
For two weeks I have decided to eat increasingly out - of - date supermarket - food in an attempt to discover the truth about Use - By and Best Before dates , and prove that Britain is throwing out tons of perfectly good produce .
Taste the difference : Jonathan sees how much his food deteriorates as the Use - By dates go by
According to WRAP , the Waste and Resources Action Programme , we chuck out 6.7 million tons of food every year , most of it fine to eat .
This year we will throw food worth up to £ 10 billion in the bin .
That 's £ 420 for every UK household .
I 'm no Bob Geldof .
I do n't want to save the world but I would like to save the odd sausage .
The amount we waste is immoral .
While we squander mountains of food , up to six million children below the age of five will die around the world this year from malnutrition , according to the United Nations .
One of the reasons for these figures is Use - By dates .
Millions of us throw food out as soon as the relevant date is reached .
This , after all , is what the Government tells us to do .
The Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) advice is clear : ' Do n't use any food or drink after the end of the Use - By date on the label , even if it looks and smells fine ... using it after this date could put your health at risk . '
But how great is that risk ?
I played culinary Russian Roulette to find out .
DAY ONE
I eat two fried eggs on toast , both a day past their Best Before date .
The FSA says Best Before , as opposed to Use - By , is more about quality than safety , so when the date runs out , it does n't mean the food will be harmful .
They make an exception , however , for eggs : ' You should n't eat eggs after the Best Before date ... they can contain salmonella bacteria , which could multiply . '
The eggs , from Tesco , taste great .
DAY TWO
Feeling absolutely fine , I turn my attention to a Marks & Spencer Scottish - salmon fillet , two days past its Use - By date .
I cook it thoroughly and it tastes exquisite .
My wife says I am a moron and that when I get ill she will not be cleaning up .
Funnily enough , I do feel queasy in the next 24 hours .
But only when I see more WRAP statistics .
Every day we bin 4.4 million apples , 5.1 million potatoes , 2.8 million tomatoes and 1.6 million bananas .
Not every week : every day .
You and I are partly to blame , of course , for buying too much .
But so are the Government and supermarkets .
When health chiefs urged us to eat five portions of fruit and veg a day , their motives were honourable but the consequences were unfortunate .
We now buy millions of tons of it but eat only a fraction : 40 per cent of the food we waste consists of fruit and veg .
Meanwhile , supermarkets offer enticing BOGOF deals : Buy One , Get One Free. BOTOA might be more accurate : Buy One , Throw One Away .
DAY THREE
I cook myself a large Sainsbury 's ' Taste The Difference ' steak pie , three days past its Use - By date .
It 's meant for two , but my wife wo n't let me give my leftovers to Felix , so I offer them to the dog , Monty .
Normally the least fussy eater in the world , he declines .
Perhaps dogs know something about expiry dates I do n't .
DAY FOUR
Two excellent Tesco Finest Pork and Fresh Bramley Apple sausages , four days ' past it ' .
My wife says they smell funny .
The late Roy Jenkins was responsible for our system of food labelling .
He was European Commission President when it issued directive 79/112 , laying down rules about date marking on food .
We adopted them in 1980 .
In his day , however , the shelf life of food was shorter .
Now , due to improvements in hygiene and food technology , the Use - By date can be three weeks away .
Indeed , thanks to additives and preservatives , food generally lasts twice as long before it becomes ' date expired ' than it did in the Eighties .
DAY FIVE
One Asda fruit cocktail trifle , five days past its Use - By date .
I 've been a big fan of trifle ever since I was a boy , and this is spoon - licking good .
Gone in six seconds .
Yum .
And , more importantly , no after - effects .
No thanks !
Wife Emily turns her nose up at Jonathan 's aging titbits
DAY SIX
One Asda ' smart price ' Chicken Breast Fillet .
My wife , realising the meat was six days past its Use - By date , reacted like a vampire seeing a crucifix .
I devoured it .
Granted , it lacked a little tenderness , but that may have been because I had roasted the living daylights out of it .
Ill - effects : none .
Cooking , or the lack of it , is crucial in all this .
Microbiologist Doctor Lee Humpheson , who runs a food - testing laboratory , says : ' There is a 100 per cent greater risk from food that has n't been cooked or prepared properly , even if it is really fresh , than from food which is past its Use - By date , but which has been cooked and prepared properly . '
In other words , wash your hands when handling food , do n't use the raw meat knife to spread butter and follow cooking instructions to a ' T ' .
Then , even though your sausages are , say , three days out of date , you will be fine .
Expiry dates are there for a reason , but , according to Dr David Jukes , a senior lecturer in Food Bioscience at Reading University : ' The longer you leave food after its Use - By date has expired , the more its bacteria will multiply , posing a greater risk to your health . '
But how do manufacturers decide on an expiry date in the first place ?
When new products come on the market , tests are run to see at what stage bacteria in the food become harmful .
More tests are then carried out , taking into account the effect of variables such as packaging , transportation and storage temperatures .
Dr Jukes says many supermarkets will err on the side of caution when deciding on an expiry date .
' Inevitably , the food industry plays safe .
Use - By dates have a degree of safety built in , in order to protect the industry . '
So how great is that degree of safety ?
Quite big , if my experience is anything to go by .
DAY SEVEN
One full portion ( 250g ) of Tesco ' Healthy Living ' extra lean steak mince , seven days past its Use - By date .
For the first time , I am alarmed .
The meat has changed colour .
It used to be reddish but is now grey .
My wife cooks it for 45 minutes and adds herbs and spices .
Gorgeous , but slightly rubbery .
Dr Martin Caraher , an expert in food policy at City University in London , says : ' The supermarkets ' main concern is the health of their customers but strict Use - By dates are also in their financial interests .
If customers throw food away , they have to replace it by buying even more .
Use - By dates can be a happy accident for them . '
DAY EIGHT
My first supermarket ready meal : Asda Chinese Chicken in Black Bean Sauce with boiled rice , eight days past its Use - By date .
The sauce is bitter .
This may be what it 's usually like or it may be it's off : having never eaten this dish before , I do n't know .
The next day I feel great .
Ironically , my wife has stomach cramps after eating fresh fish .
I can't help laughing .
As part of my investigation , I also want to highlight how much food is thrown out by supermarkets , as opposed to the customer .
To this end , I meet Alf , an Oxford graduate in his 30s who is a ' Freegan ' - that is , he lives off food that supermarkets throw out .
I join him on a food raid , or ' food liberation exercise ' .
We meet in a town in Kent just after the local Iceland and Sainsbury 's have closed .
Minutes later , having rummaged through six bins , we 've filled four carrier bags with cooked gammon steaks , ham , cheese , bread , cans of butter beans , pilchards , trifles ( joy of joys ) , apples , tomatoes , a toad - in - the - hole ready meal , sausages , grapes ( from Chile ) , carrot cake , sugar , yogurt , Scotch pancakes , pasta , chocolate and fresh mushrooms .
All of it is still in its packaging , much of it is n't even out of date : some has been thrown out because the packaging is slightly damaged .
Breaking the mould : Jonathan tucks in to out - of - date bread under his wife 's disgusted - and worried - eye
DAY NINE
I ask Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson to cook what we raided ( sorry , liberated ) .
He makes pasta and pilchard bake , sausage and mushroom hash with a crushed butter bean topping and gammon steaks topped with cheese and tomato .
It is n't the stuff he serves in his restaurants - it 's more like classy school food - but the fact that it cost nothing makes it taste even better .
Worrall Thompson says : ' You can tell when food has really gone off .
Poultry gets sticky and slimy and smells a bit pungent .
With fish , the skin goes dry , the eyes sunken , and the gills go brown .
Fruit and vegetables go limp and yellow .
' You will often find me down the supermarket snapping up the half - price deals on out - of - date food . '
And what about Freegan Alf ?
' In seven years of liberating food I have never been ill , ' says the Raider of the Lost Bins , over forkfuls of Scotch pancakes with caramelised apple drizzled in yogurt . '
So how do retailers justify throwing out food not even out of date ?
The body that represents supermarkets , the British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) , said : ' Damaged packaging can expose food to contamination .
Retailers work hard to minimise food waste .. . it is ridiculous to suggest retailers run up unnecessary costs by discarding products where they do n't have to . '
Back home , time for another ready meal .
Moussaka , fully nine days gone .
I cook it for three minutes longer than the instructions say , just in case .
Surprisingly scrumptious .
DAY TEN
A Marks & Spencer carrot and orange muffin , ten days past its Best Before date .
Unlike yesterday 's moussaka , the muffin is not scrumptious .
It is stodgy and dry .
But if you were on a hike and this was all you had , you would n't think twice .
DAY 11
Sainsbury 's Lemon and Coriander Houmous , 11 days old .
It is tangy , but that may be the lemon talking .
DAY 12
One portion of Tesco ' Traditionally sliced ' runner beans , 12 days past their Use - By date .
They are more than acceptable .
DAY 13
Today I had planned to eat a bread roll 13 days past its Best Before date but I 'm now feeling cocky about not getting ill , so I up the stakes .
Enter some Hovis brown bread , three - and - a - half weeks past its Best Before date .
Except it is n't brown .
It is mottled green .
And smells of socks .
I toast it and smother it in butter and marmalade .
It is crunchy and tastes just like toast should , although during one mouthful I detect a hint of pepper .
DAY 14
Emboldened , I end my experiment on Day 14 with a bowl of Kellogg 's Sultana Bran cereal , nearly three months past its Best Before date .
Not very crisp but eminently edible .
It is over .
Despite eating food that was increasingly out of date every day for two weeks , I have suffered not a scintilla of tummy trouble .
Friends , family and colleagues are impressed .
The FSA are not .
Their spokeswoman , describing my experiment as ' really risky ' , says : ' You might have been OK eating these products , but others could have become seriously ill .
' We are not taking a nanny state approach .
Our advice about Use - By dates is just that : advice .
But it comes from peer - reviewed scientific studies .
A non-scientific experiment conducted by one person is unlikely to be representative of the public as a whole . '
Fair enough .
But I am not suggesting everyone eats food past its Use - By date .
That would be irresponsible .
Children , pregnant women , ill people and pensioners may be especially susceptible to the bacteria in it .
What my experiment does show , however , is that a lot of that food may be safe for the rest of us to eat .
And we should , arguably , never waste food simply because of the Best Before date .
As the FSA guidelines acknowledge , it almost certainly wo n't make us ill , it just wo n't taste as good .
Even if it is ( relatively ) ancient .
Last week Felix , intrigued by my experiment , proudly presented me with an empty packet of Walker 's salt and vinegar crisps which Granny had given him .
The Best Before date ?
May 17 , 2003 .
' Chewy , but OK , ' was the verdict .

How the law relates to Sell By dates :
The 1996 EU food labelling directive requires perishable foods - dairy products , fish and meat - to be marked with Use By , giving the date up to which food remains safe for consumption .
It is illegal to sell food past this date .
A Best Before date - which can be day and month , month and year , or just year - must be given by law for non-perishable food , i.e. dried or tinned .
Food used before this date will be of best quality , although it is not illegal to sell food , except eggs , past this date .
Each manufacturer is responsible for providing Use - By and Best Before dates based on their own scientific studies - observing time taken for food to grow bacteria - backed up with published data on similar foods .
Dates can differ between manufacturers .
Safe thresholds for bacteria before it causes poisoning , established from studies involving human volunteers , are set by the European Food Safety Agency .
The law does not state length of Use - By dates .
' We monitor via auditing that shows up anomalies but we do rely on manufacturers to be honest , ' says Trading Standards officer David Pickering .
Firms can be fined up to £ 5,000 for a ' Food labelling offence ' .
Tom Nesi , author of the new book Poison Pills : The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal , wants you to know what you 're getting into when you pop a newly approved , heavily marketed prescription drug .
A longtime director of public affairs at the pharmaceutical company Bristol - Myers Squibb , Nesi has more than 30 years ' experience in medical communications and strategy .
Now a writer and consultant , he comes off as no shill for the industry he once served .
His book focuses on the cautionary tale of Vioxx , the prescription painkiller that was pulled from the market after doctors belatedly realized that it caused heart , blood , and kidney problems — including some that were fatal .
His broader objective , though , is to help consumers take advantage of good medicines while sidestepping the harm some can cause .
You say the most expensive drug you can take is a free sample .
How is that ?
They 're very seductive — they 're free .
Merck distributed 17 million samples to 25,000 physicians and 375,000 patients .
The problem is that if you 've been doing fine on a 20 - cent pill , you get the free sample for a month or two , then you have to go to the drugstore to fill the prescription and then it costs you $ 3 a pill .
You argue that in the context of pharmaceuticals , new is not always better .
Why ?
It 's extremely important that people understand that , as extensively as a drug is tested before it 's approved [ by the Food and Drug Administration ] , it 's still tested on a very small population .
It 's also tested on a very select population .
Drug companies do n't go out to try to find the sickest patients to test their drugs on .
[ With older drugs ] , not only is there more data but more usage experience .
Doctors know how to use it — they become familiar with it .
An example in the pain market :
When some of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatories were released , like Motrin and Aleve , they were actually given at doses that were too high .
As the years go by , [ drugs ] can actually become safer .
As a veteran drug marketer , you warn consumers to beware huge marketing campaigns for new drugs .
In fact , you urge people to ask their doctors for proof that new drugs are superior to older ones before accepting a prescription for the newer medicine .
I would say the larger the marketing campaign , the more you should use caution .
I would also say if there are good drugs in a category — in a type of illness that you suffer from — that have been out there for a while , there 's no reason not to use those first .
How long should a drug be on the market before you try it ?
I do n't think it hurts to wait a few years .
If you are in acute need , if you 're just suffering horrible pain , you 've tried everything under the sun and you need a new drug , well , that 's entirely different than if you 're satisfied .
I would say , if you 're satisfied with your current therapy , stay with it .
You caution women , in particular , to find out about a new drug 's safety before taking it .
We know that some drugs interfere with reproduction .
Any woman who is planning to get pregnant , or who potentially could get pregnant , should definitely discuss that with their doctor .
How often do doctors actually recommend their patients stop taking a prescription that works for them and start a newer drug instead ?
And how often do patients ask to change a medication they 're doing well on ?
It happens all the time .
There are whole huge campaigns based on what they call switching behavior .
A classic example that has just earned billions of dollars for no apparent reason :
There was a drug I worked on , a very good drug called Prilosec , for treating heartburn , and AstraZeneca , the company that had the patent , wanted to keep making money after Prilosec went off [ patent ] , so they came up with a successor drug called Nexium , which is " the little purple pill . "
I remember working with a colleague [ who , after looking at the preliminary data , ] was just astounded and said , " Nexium does n't work any better . "
The Vioxx scandal is the main focus of your book .
You contend that while the drug 's maker , Merck , said it was collecting more data on Vioxx , thousands of people may have died .
Is the lesson here to be skeptical when a pharmaceutical company says , " Not all the data are in yet " on a new drug ?
Exactly .
Some studies simply just get dropped .
A lot of data just never gets published .
There are ways of presenting data where not even the most sophisticated investigator could really tell what the data was really saying .
One of the most disconcerting things , we know that there were more deaths among Alzheimer 's patients who took Vioxx .
The Alzheimer 's trials for Vioxx were sort of published , but not with the complete data sets .
This book seems the antithesis , in some ways , of your life 's work .
Why did you write it ?

Al Gore , the presidential nominee turned anti-climate change crusader , threw his support behind Barack Obama today and vowed " to do whatever I can to make sure he is elected " .
Gore previewed the endorsement on his blog before appearing alongside Obama at a rally in Detroit , the US automobile mecca that has come to symbolise the hardships wrought by rising fuel prices .
" Over the next four years , we are going to face many difficult challenges - including bringing our troops home from Iraq , fixing our economy and solving the climate crisis , " Gore wrote .
" Barack Obama is clearly the candidate best able to solve these problems and bring change to America . "
Gore , who fell 573 votes short of the White House in 2000 before winning the Nobel peace prize for his environmental advocacy , also urged his vast network of online backers to donate to Obama .
Gore has enjoyed an enduring appeal to the Democratic faithful , elevating him to dark - horse status during both the 2004 and 2008 presidential seasons .
Gore ultimately endorsed Howard Dean for the party 's nomination four years ago , a choice that bruised his political reputation after Dean lost to John Kerry .
This year most political observers predicted Gore would stay out of the battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton , due to the awkward fallout from the Dean endorsement as well as the unseemly implications of Bill Clinton 's former vice president turning against his wife .
But once Clinton conceded to Obama earlier this month , the path was cleared for Gore to get behind the newly minted nominee .
Gore could become an effective campaign surrogate for Obama - particularly on the issue of combating climate change , where the author of the 1992 book Earth in the Balance can claim a far longer history of activism than Republican nominee John McCain .
Gore could also deliver a strong rebuttal to his running mate in 2000 , Joseph Lieberman , who has since left the Democratic party and is now talked about as a possible vice - presidential choice for McCain .
Still , one role in which the former Tennessee senator has expressed zero interest is as an official adviser in an Obama White House .
While Gore is often mentioned as a potential energy secretary or " climate tsar " for Obama , he emphasised through a spokeswoman earlier this month that he " has long since ruled out any possibility " of returning to Washington politics .

President Bush ignored all other forms of alternative energy in his radio address today , and instead chose to give the false impression that we can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil .
“ The fundamental source of high gas prices is the fact that supply is not keeping pace with demand .
To reduce pressure on prices , we need to increase the supply of oil , especially oil produced here at home .
So in June , I called on Congress to lift the legislative ban that prevents offshore exploration of parts of the Outer Continental Shelf , or OCS .
But the leaders of the Democratic Congress have refused to allow a vote , ” Bush said .
The president used some deceptive language when speaking about the amount of oil offshore , “ First , lifting the ban would allow our Nation to take advantage of a large and reliable source of domestic oil .
Experts believe that these restricted areas could eventually produce about 18 billion barrels of oil .
That ’s almost 10 years worth of America ’s current oil production . ”
He is referring to production not supply .
The 18 billion barrels of oil , if not put on the world market , would last America for 14 months .
Advertisements
Bush also refused to tell the American people how long it will take for offshore oil to lower their gas prices , “ Bringing these resources online will take time , and that means that the need for congressional action is urgent .
I ’ve lifted the executive restrictions on offshore exploration .
“ Yes , it will take time , at least a decade , but the president does n’t want you to know that .
Bush blamed Congress for high gas prices , “ This means that the only thing now standing between the American people and these vast oil resources is the United States Congress .
The sooner Congress lifts the ban , the sooner we can get this oil from beneath the ocean floor to your gas tank . ”
Yes , it will take time , at least a decade , but the president does n’t want you to know that .
This radio address is why I do n’t think the compromise energy bill has a chance of being signed into law .
President Bush has no interest in alternative energy .
Even though the bill does provide for some limited offshore drilling , it also provides billions for alternative energy , and hybrid vehicles , while repealing a $ 30 billion tax break for the oil companies .
Since Bush wants to spread the lie that we can drill our way out of this crisis , so Congress may have to override a veto in order to pass the bill .

• Guantánamo prosecutors had recommended at least 30 years • Hamdan admitted he continued to work for al - Qaida after learning it was a terrorist organisation
This article is more than 12 years old

Salim Ahmed Hamdan , the first al - Qaida suspect to be tried at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp , today was sentenced to five and a half years in prison for supporting terrorism .
Because Hamdan has already served five years at Guantanamo , the 40 - year - old Yemeni national will only have to complete a six - month sentence .
The judge in his case , US navy captain Keith Allred , told reporters at the prison camp that it is unclear what future Hamdan faces in six months but that he would likely be eligible for an administrative review of his status .
No matter what penalty Hamdan had received , he remains subject to possible indefinite detention by the US military .
The defendant admitted before his sentencing that he continued to serve as a driver for Osama bin Laden after realising that he was working for a terrorist organisation .
Hamdan told the six - person military jury at Guantanamo that he continued to work for bin Laden only to support his family and apologised to the victims of al - Qaida attacks .
Pentagon prosecutors dismissed the gesture and asked for at least a 30 - year sentence .
The location where Hamdan will serve his sentence has not been formally announced , although moving him to a site in the US would likely present significant political difficulties .
Hamdan 's conviction brings the White House 's fight to try terrorist suspects full circle .
It was Hamdan whose challenge to the original Guantánamo tribunals prompted a 2006 US supreme court ruling that conspiracy – of which the defendant was accused but not convicted - is not a war crime .
Yet supporters of the tribunal process asserted that Hamdan 's acquittal by the jury of six military officers immunised the Bush administration from criticism that Guantanamo defendants are deprived of basic legal rights .
The tribunal allowed hearsay and inflammatory evidence but Allred blocked the admission of some of Hamdan 's statements extracted through coercion .
At one point near the conclusion of the 10 - day trial , Allred admitted that he may have given unclear instructions to the jury on whether an " enemy combatant " , as the Pentagon designated Hamdan , can murder a uniformed soldier without violating the laws of war .
Neither side moved for a mistrial based on Allred 's instructions , despite the possibility that the murky definition could set a complicated precedent for future prosecutions at Guantánamo .
Defence lawyers did not dispute during the trial that Hamdan provided assistance to bin Laden 's network .
Rather , they argued that Hamdan was a low - level player in the al - Qaida network , not the indispensable aide he was depicted as by the prosecutors .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks who was recently arraigned at Guantánamo , weighed in on behalf of Hamdan .
In written testimony , Mohammed dismissed Hamdan as a mere chauffeur " not fit to plan or execute " .
T- Mobile has sent out invitations for the official announcement of the first Googlephone , the HTC Dream .
The press conference will be held in New York on September 23rd , although the Android - based phone wo n’t hit stores until October ( probably October 20th ) .
From the leaked picture above , it ’s hard to get an idea of the size of the Dream .
The video below was shot at a the Google Developers Day in London yesterday .
It shows the tiny handset — the branding is covered , but it ’s obviously the Dream .
We haved mixed feelings about Android .
The Dream looks excellent , and from a geek ’s point of view , the open nature of the platform is very attractive .
But as with the iPod before , the general consumer will go for the prettiness and ease of use .
If Google and its Androidal partners do n’t manage to make a big splash very soon ( read : great ad campaign ) then we can see the consumer market for smartphones being tied up in the same way as the consumer market for MP3 players .
For business , though , it ’s a different matter .
That slide - out keyboard alone will be enough to sell this to a thousand Crackberry addicts .

The Federal Reserve reports that delinquency rates rose in Q2 in all categories .
( hat tip Rick )
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the delinquency rates at the commercial banks for three key categories : residential real estate , commercial real estate , and consumer credit cards .
Credit card delinquency rates are at 4.9 % , about the same level as the peak of the '01 recession .
Credit card delinquencies peaked at 5.45 % during the ' 91 recession .
Commercial real estate delinquencies are rising rapidly , and are at the highest rate since Q1 ' 95 ( as delinquency rates declined following the S&L crisis ) .
Residential real estate delinquencies are at the highest level since the Fed started tracking the data ( since Q1 ' 91 ) .
Although there is credit deterioration everywhere , the rise in CRE delinquencies is especially significant .
The Fed defines commercial as " construction and land development loans , loans secured by multifamily residences , and loans secured by nonfarm , nonresidential real estate " , and many of the problems are probably in the C&D loans .
My guess is commercial real estate delinquencies will be higher than residential in Q3 , even though residential delinquencies are still increasing rapidly .
Meanwhile , the agreement calls for limits on executive pay at firms that get federal money .
Most important , it “ requires that any transaction include equity sharing . ”
Why is that so important ?
The fundamental problem with our financial system is that the fallout from the housing bust has left financial institutions with too little capital .
When he finally deigned to offer an explanation of his plan , Mr. Paulson argued that he could solve this problem through “ price discovery ”  that once taxpayer funds had created a market for mortgage - related toxic waste , everyone would realize that the toxic waste is actually worth much more than it currently sells for , solving the capital problem .
Never say never , I guess  but you do n’t want to bet $ 700 billion on wishful thinking .
The odds are , instead , that the U.S. government will end up having to do what governments always do in financial crises : use taxpayers ’ money to pump capital into the financial system .
Under the original Paulson plan , the Treasury would probably have done this by buying toxic waste for much more than it was worth  and gotten nothing in return .
What taxpayers should get is what people who provide capital are entitled to : a share in ownership .
And that ’s what the equity sharing is about .
The Congressional plan , then , looks a lot better  a lot more adult  than the Paulson plan did .
That said , it ’s very short on detail , and the details are crucial .
What prices will taxpayers pay to take over some of that toxic waste ?
How much equity will they get in return ?
Those numbers will make all the difference .
And in any case , it seems that we do n’t have a deal .
This has to be a bipartisan plan , and not just at the leadership level .
Democrats wo n’t pass the plan without votes from rank - and - file Republicans  and as of Thursday night , those rank - and - file Republicans were balking .
Furthermore , one non -rank - and - file Republican , Senator John McCain , is apparently playing spoiler .
Earlier this week , while refusing to say whether he supported the Paulson plan , he claimed not to have had a chance to read it ; the plan is all of three pages long .
Then he inserted himself into the delicate negotiations over the Congressional plan , insisting on a White House meeting at which he reportedly said little  but during which consensus collapsed .
The bottom line , then , is that there do seem to be some adults in Congress , ready to do something to help us get through this crisis .
But the adults are not yet in charge .

Sarah Palin is now officially the poster child for the insanity of the neocons .
Interviewed by ABC News , the vice presidential candidate said war with Russia is a possibility .
“ We have to keep our eyes on Russia , under the leadership there , ” she averred .
“ I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally .
If another country is attacked , you ’re going to be expected to be called upon and help … .
For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller , democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable . ”
Palin is wrong on all counts .
First , Georgia is not a member of NATO and is not likely to become so , mostly because the Europeans are more sane than the American neocons , primarily because they live next door to Russia .
Second , Russia did not invade Georgia , Russia defended South Ossetia from an attack launched by Georgia .
In its defensive action , Russia took out Georgia ’s military capacity and that necessitated going into Georgia proper .
Third , Georgia is not a democracy as should be apparent when one looks at Saakashvili ’s reaction to opposition protesters last year — he responded with tear gas , water cannons , rubber bullets , and a “ state of emergency , ” that is to say martial law .
Of course , in Bushzarro world , a government installed by NED and Soros is considered a democracy — and black is white and up is down .
Cheney trekked to Ukraine last week to tell Yushchenko and his color revolution installed gang that the U.S. will support their effort to get into NATO , never mind this is unpopular in the country .
“ It is obvious that so far the majority of people in Ukraine is opposed to NATO membership and wants it to remain neutral , ” reports Ilya Kramnik for RIA Novosti .
“ In the complicated domestic situation , forced entry into NATO may split the country and some of its regions may secede .
Such an outcome is not likely to please either Kiev or Brussels , so there are no grounds to expect Ukraine ’s fast NATO entry . ”
Naturally , the wishes of the people will not be allowed to stand in the way of the neocons and their brazen and clumsy attempts to provoke Russia .
All this NATO business increases the prospect of war between the United States and Russia , as Palin admitted .
“ The problem with NATO expansion is simply this : each expansion calls into question NATO ’s willingness to go to war .
Would the US and Europe and ( importantly )
Turkey really declare war with Russia over Georgia or one of the Baltic States ?
Or even the Ukraine ? ” notes Ian Welsh .
NATO expansion threatens the equilibrium of mutually assured destruction .
MAD [ Mutually Assured Destruction ] requires that both sides have clear and transparent knowledge of what the other side will and wo n’t escalate over .
In the Cold War , both sides knew that an attack on a NATO or Warsaw Pact member by the other side would lead to general war , and understood that that general war could easily escalate to nuclear confrontation , probably started by whoever thought they were losing .
For Palin , or rather her neocon handlers , this is not a big deal .
If you think the prospect of a nuclear war will make the neocons back off , think again .
It ’s not simply hubris or mental illness — the neocons want war , and the bigger the better , because it will make possible the realization of their demented , crypto- fascist philosophy based on the dictatorial musings of the Nazi crown jurist Carl Schmitt .
Total war , even nuclear war , will promote their Hobbesian view of the world where an absolute decider - commander demands absolute submission .
Of course , a little radiation does not bother the neocons , as they have bunks reserved in the fallout shelter .
As Paul Craig Roberts notes , the neocons are determined to have a war with Russia .
“ The Committee on the Present Danger regarded the neocons as crazy people who would get America into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union .
The neocons hated President Reagan , because he ended the cold war with diplomacy , when they desired a military victory over the Soviet Union , ” writes Roberts .
The Republicans will get us into more wars .
Indeed , they live for war .
McCain is preaching war for 100 years .
For these warmongers , it is like cheering for your home team .
Win at all costs .
They get a vicarious pleasure out of war .
If the US has to tell lies in order to attack countries , what ’s wrong with that ?
“ If we do n’t kill them over there , they will kill us over here . ”
It ’s funny , in a perverse sort of way , that the corporate media went around and around about Barack Obama ’s lipstick on a pig comment .
In fact , the lipstick is on Mars , the god of war in Roman mythology .
Our neocon novi homines want their “ dictator in perpetuity , ” their Julius Caesar , to lead them into battle against Russia and China .
McCain is a sorry dictator perpetuo , but it really does not matter who sits atop the throne because the neocons call the shots — and the final shot will come screaming in on a Russian SS - 25 with a thermonuclear payload .
Palin may not realize what she is saying when she talks about NATO and confronting Russia .
But then she really does not need to because she is little more than a cigar store Indian with talking points in hand composed by a coterie of madmen .
She too has a reserved spot in the bunker .

An overview of quick payday loans Sticking to a budget can be tricky at times , particularly if something unexpected turns up .
Quick payday loans may be able to help
Having a monthly budget or spending plan and being able to stick to it is based on the assumption that you know exactly what you need to spend your money on in any given month .
If you are fortunate , then there may also be a bit of slack in your budget which may mean you could be better able to cope , at least a little , with the unexpected .
For many though , things can be pretty tight from month to month .
This could mean that a mini emergency like your car breaking down and needing to be repaired , may leave you wondering how you are going to cope .
Quick payday loans may be an ideal solution for problems like this .
Their role is different to that of a conventional loan .
They can provide some extra cash to help you deal with things until you next get paid .
So : smallish amounts of money , $ 100 - $ 700 are typical sums though more can be available
short timeframes of days or weeks typically until your next payday or possibly the one after that
loans that are repaid , together with interest and charges , in one go
They are not really suitable to deal with long terms debt problems or as debt consolidation tools .
Lenders welcome repeat custom but not on the basis that you need to borrow again because paying back your last loan left you short the next month .
Fast cash loans like this are typically available online .
To apply you ’ll typically need to : be USA resident and over 18
have a job with regular pay dates
have a bank account which has a debit card
be asking for an amount which makes sense in terms of what you can comfortably afford to pay back
What you may not need with loans of this type is a perfectly spotless credit history .
Because these cash advances are for smaller amounts of money , the risks to the lenders are less , so they can be slightly more relaxed about their lending criteria .
Your life may not come to a standstill if you do n’t apply for quick payday loans .
It may make things a whole lot easier for you if you do though .
Conservatives continued to gain ground in the first few days of the election campaign , with a significant lead in public support , according to a newly released poll Thursday .
However , another poll released the same day painted a different picture of parties ' gains in the first week of the election campaign , with the Tories in a " gentle decline " back to minority territory .
The two polls — the first by Canadian Press - Harris / Decima in partnership with the CBC and the second by EKOS Research — offered a glimpse of how the federal parties fared in the days following Sunday 's election call , polling voters from Monday to Thursday .
In the Harris / Decima survey , the Conservatives showed a lead nationally of 41 per cent of public support , followed by the Liberals at 26 per cent , while the NDP were at 14 per cent .
The Green Party trails with nine per cent support , while eight per cent of respondents said they favoured the Bloc Québécois .
" This snapshot that we have here will be good news for the Conservative Party , " the CBC's David Taylor said Friday following the release of the results .
Harris / Decima president Bruce Anderson described the Conservative momentum as " remarkable , " saying the party has gained ground in key subgroups that have eluded them in the past , including urban Canada and women .
Anderson said the boost in support among the groups can be attributed to the party 's " massive " advertising campaign compared to the other parties .
The Tory ads " have largely been right on the mark in terms of what they needed to accomplish , " he said .
Voters pulling back : EKOS
Yet the EKOS poll suggested the Tories were slipping from their " formidable advantage " over the Liberals prior to Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Sept. 7 election call , to a seven - point lead Thursday from a 15 - point lead Monday .
In that same period , the Liberals showed " modest strengthening , " as did the Bloc and Greens .
NDP support remained flat .
EKOS Research Associates President Frank Graves said pollsters have seen this pattern before .
" Whenever the Conservatives start to edge into majority territory , it seems some voters pull back and re-consider their intentions . "
He said it was " remarkable " that Tory support surged the week before the election , typically seen only once a campaign has begun , then slipped back to " something closer to the norm over the last couple of years . "
The poll found Stephen Harper 's Conservatives with 36 per cent of the public 's support , the Liberals with 26 per cent and New Democrats with 19 .
Eleven per cent of respondents favoured the Green party , while eight per cent supported the Bloc .
Tories wo n't bite on majority talk
Harper has repeatedly downplayed talk of a majority during the campaign , saying he still believed the result of the Oct. 14 vote would be a minority government .
Despite the positive numbers in the Harris - Decima poll , Conservative strategist Lisa Samson said her party was taking nothing for granted .
" Every vote counts on Oct. 14 , " Samson told CBC News on Friday from Ottawa .
" It 's one voter at a time , one family at a time . "
When asked about the poll Friday during a campaign event in British Columbia , Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion dismissed the importance of the numbers .
" Polls are like tides ; they come and they go , " Dion told reporters in Burnaby , noting that he was not asked about a previous poll from the day before that placed his party only five points behind Harper 's Conservatives .
Gaffes could still influence voters : Liberal strategist
But Liberal strategist Susan Smith said the Harris - Decima poll might prove to indicate " there is such a thing as the Conservatives peaking too soon , " especially with this week 's high - profile gaffes by the Harper campaign .
On Thursday , the Tories suspended their communications director for questioning the political motives behind comments made by the father of a fallen Canadian soldier .
Earlier this week , Harper was forced to apologize after a crude ad on the Conservative website featured a puffin defecating on Dion 's shoulder .
" We 're in the first week of the campaign , " Smith told CBC News from Ottawa .
" We 're watching stumbles and those things are going to start to set in . "
In the Harris - Decima survey , respondents were asked for their party preference , second choice , their favourite party leader , as well as how they define themselves as voters .
They were also asked whether they had seen campaign advertisements and to what extent they were influenced by them .
The Harris / Decima poll interviewed roughly 300 Canadians every night , as part of a rolling nationwide survey that will continue throughout the election campaign .
The sample represents a total of 1,406 interviews gathered between Sept. 8 and 11 .
The poll 's margin of error is 2.6 per cent , 19 times out of 20 .
The EKOS survey , conducted over the same dates , interviewed around 1,000 Canadians each day , for a total of 4,975 randomly selected voters .
The margin of error is 1.5 per cent , 19 times out of 20 .

First , let ’s set a few things straight : becoming a top WordPress developer is hard work — very hard work .
It ’s going to take a lot of time , energy and determination .
If you ’re looking for an easy checklist or some “ fast pass ” to the top , you ’re going to waste your time .
Being one of the best is hard , and statistically speaking , the odds are stacked against you .

If you ’re looking for an easy checklist or some “ fast pass ” to the top , you ’re going to waste your time .
Being one of the best is hard , and statistically speaking , the odds are stacked against you .
By the way , installing WordPress , reading a few tutorials and customizing a few themes does not make someone a top developer .
They may call themselves an “ Expert ” , and that ’s fine .
They may know more than the average person .
But a top developer moves far beyond the basics , and pushes the very boundaries of what is possible .
They innovate , contribute to the community , and demonstrate mastery in the work they do .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
So I want you to be more than an “ expert ” , I want you to be one of the best .
Why Be A Top Developer
Why not ?
If you work with WordPress ( or plan to start ) , why just settle for being average ?
There ’s too much “ average ” in life already .
“ Normal ” is highly overrated .
There are other reasons , though .
For instance , the top WordPress developers :
Make the most money .
Demand for WordPress development is high and clients are willing to pay more for developers who are the best in their field .
. Demand for WordPress development is high and clients are willing to pay more for developers who are the best in their field .
Get the best clients .
When you are at the top , you have the freedom to say “ No ” to the projects you do n’t want , and “ Yes ” to the projects you do .
.
When you are at the top , you have the freedom to say “ No ” to the projects you do n’t want , and “ Yes ” to the projects you do .
Have the most influence .
Being at the top means you have influence ( and responsibility ) and the capability to shape the future of WordPress as well as the ecosystem that is built around it .
One Hour of Reading a Day
If you ’re going to make it to the top , then you need to spend at least one hour each workday focused on reading and learning more about WordPress — outside of any development work .
There are no shortcuts , and no other ways around it .
Learning and mastering WordPress is going to take time .
If you watch TV , cut it out — more than 90 % of it is n’t good for you anyway .
If you ’re a gamer , sell your games or throw them away .
Reaching the top takes commitment and sacrifice and the best place to start is with the things in life that are n’t doing you any good anyway .
Start with one dedicated , distraction - free hour of reading for each workday .
Shut off instant messages , put your phone on silent , and read .
Take notes on what you learn along the way .
You ’ll find the time goes by faster than you would have expected .
Keep at it , day after day , week after week , and month after month .
And as you start to see success , put in more time for reading .
Alternatively , consider a three - hour block , two to three times a week .
The key is to make a commitment to learning and honoring that commitment by setting aside the necessary time to see it through .
Enrolling in WordPress University
There ’s never been a better time to learn and master WordPress than right now .
There are so many excellent resources available to those willing to put the time and effort into using them .
Before you can start gaining experience , you need some education .
Sure , you could just jump in and start breaking things .
But I suggest you wait , and cultivate the self - discipline it takes to learn — there will be plenty of time to break things later .
As you start your education , it ’s important to begin with the social aspect of your experience .
Hang Out with the Right Crowd
We become like those we associate with .
If you want to be one of the top WordPress developers , start spending time with those at the top .
Read their blogs , follow them on Twitter , give feedback on their thoughts and ideas , go to WordCamps to meet them and listen to their talks .
Read the interviews on CodePoet .
Follow their examples , ask them for advice , follow their advice , and report back .
Here is a small list of WordPress developers to get you started :
Read the Material
The amount of reading material available on WordPress is overwhelming .
There are thousands of people talking about WordPress and it is becoming increasingly difficult to filter through the noise .
There are authorities , however , and when you commit to mastering WordPress , then you should start your journey by finding the highest quality resources and concentrating your efforts just on those .
Here are a few resources to get you started :

Gaining Experience With WordPress
With your education well underway , it ’s time to gain real - world experience — and lots of it .
Your path to the top is lined with trials and difficulties and gaining experience outside the safe playgrounds of your own projects is a critical step in the right direction .
One of the best ways to get started is doing work for others .
Take On Clients
Working for clients , paid or free , is one of the best ways to gain experience .
Clients introduce challenges you would never have to deal with working on your own .
If you ’re just getting started , learn how to get your first client .
While the market focus ( large clients vs. small clients ) will vary , the heart of the matter is get a lot of experience .
The goal is to not just get a few hundred hours working on WordPress , but a few thousand .
You need to put the time in with real - world experience and taking on clients is one of the best ways to do this .
Develop a Public Theme
Build a theme you ’d actually use .
Release it , paid or free .
Listen to the feedback you get from developers and end -users who use your theme .
Ask for a peer review from theme designers you respect .
Update your theme as you get feedback and as your abilities improve .
Work hard to make a theme that you can be proud of .
Develop a Plugin
As you learn and work with WordPress you ’ll eventually find a need that has n’t been met .
When you do , meet it yourself .
Take what you ’ve learned about plugin development and put it into practice .
Write a plugin that ’s secure and that solves a real need , without being another “ me too ” contribution to the already massive plugin community .
Release it , paid or free , and get feedback from the people who put your plugin to use .
Contribute a Patch
Read the Core Contributor handbook and learn how to submit a patch .
It can be a daunting process your first time around , but look for a challenge that you can tackle , and stick to it .
Contributing a patch is an invaluable experience and an important part of being able to consider yourself a top WordPress developer .
Master Debugging
Learning how to write bug - free code is a critical step in becoming a great developer .
Start with the Codex and learn about debugging in WordPress .
Read Andrew Nacin ’s post on 5 Ways To Debug WordPress .
Familiarize yourself with some of the developer oriented plugins , like Core Control , Debug Bar and Log Deprecated Notices .
Joining The WordPress Community
As you continue your education and put what you ’ve learned into practice , the next step is to become an active member of the community .
You may be a fantastic developer , but it does n’t count for much if no one knows you exist .
Spend time investing in the community .
One of the best ways to do so is sharing what you know .
Write Tutorials
I got my start back in 2006 with a simple tutorial I wrote ( be warned , it is a little dated ) .
I took what I had just figured out and poured it into a tutorial to help others and save them the time ( and headache ) I had just experienced .
A lot of people read it , a few wrote back and said thank you , and some people even asked me to do some work for them .
So write tutorials that take the best of what you ’ve just learned and present it to others so they may reap the benefits of your efforts .
It ’s worth it .
Contribute to the Codex
As you spend time reading through the Codex you will notice areas that need improvement .
Learn about becoming a volunteer in the Codex .
Dedicate time to improving the quality of the documentation .
While documentation in the Codex is continually improving , there are still functions and features in the WordPress core that go undocumented .
If an area is beyond your current capabilities , bring it to the attention of others and embrace the opportunity to learn more in the process .
Participate in Forums
Most WordPress beginners start out asking questions on the official support forums .
Start there by answering questions ( even the silly , basic ones — we all start somewhere ) .
From there , become an active member of the WordPress Stack Exchange community .
Answer questions and learn from the answers that other developers are giving .
Present at WordCamps
Attend upcoming WordCamps and look for opportunities to present and give value to the WordPress community .
A true sign of your expertise is your ability to take what you know and teach it to someone else .
Read the Diary Of A WordCamp .
Want even more of a challenge ?
Become an organizer and start a WordCamp near you .
Reward And Responsibility
The reward at the top is worth the effort .
If you ’re building a business around WordPress ( read 7 reasons why you should ) , a mastery of WordPress is a critical step to your success .
In 2011 , according to the official WordPress Survey results , “ 6,800 self - employed respondents were responsible for over 170,000 websites , personally ” .
Of those , the average median hourly rate was $ 50 / hour .
Based on the Pareto principle , the top 20 % of those developers ( less than 1,400 ) are responsible for 80 % of the work done ( and they make more than $ 50 / hour ) .
Now , being in that top 20 % carries with it a high - level of responsibility .
Staying at the top requires a commitment to ongoing education and continual experience .
Never stop learning and improving .
Being at the top also puts a level of responsibility on your shoulders for the health and future of the WordPress ecosystem .
Get involved .
Weigh in on important matters .
Contribute .
Put a percentage of your success back into building up WordPress and ensuring its future .
Conclusion
Becoming a top WordPress developer requires a mindset of continual improvement and a willingness to do the hard work .
It starts with an intentional focus on education and then moves to extensive real - world experience .
Finally , the title of a “ top developer ” demands dedication to the WordPress community , as well as recognition of the responsibilities by those who mold and shape the future of WordPress .
What about you ?
What advice do you have for becoming a top WordPress developer ?
Marcia Cross in L.A. Car Crash ( Photos )
, actress and star on Desperate Housewives is reportedly recovering from a car crash that occurred in Los Angeles on Wednesday , June 11 , 2008 .
Cross was driving her Lexus RX near Wilshire and Berry in West LA around 2 PM when her vehicle collided with a sedan .
While the damage appeared minimal to Cross ’ Lexus , the other driver sustained significant front - end damage , as evidenced by photos from the scene .
Initial reports indicated that no one was hurt in the accident .
Marcia 's children were reportedly not in the car .
According to Access Hollywood , both vehicles had to be removed from the scene by tow truck .
Law enforcement officers were called to the scene but a police report was not filed .
Is this a case of celebrity justice in tinseltown ?
The Hollywood celebrity was apparently none the worse for wear based on the photos that were taken on Friday , June 13th at Brentwood Park with her twin daughters Eden and Savannah .
Check out more accident photos and Marcia and the kids at the park below .

SARAH PALIN WARNS WAR MAY BE NECESSARY IF RUSSIA INVADES ANOTHER COUNTRY
More of the first excerpts from the Charlie Gibson interview here and here .
Here ’s the exchange on Russia :
GIBSON : And under the NATO treaty , would n’t we then have to go to war if Russia went into Georgia ?
PALIN : Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you ’re going to be expected to be called upon and help .
But NATO , I think , should include Ukraine , definitely , at this point and I think that we need to — especially with new leadership coming in on January 20 , being sworn on , on either ticket , we have got to make sure that we strengthen our allies , our ties with each one of those NATO members .
We have got to make sure that that is the group that can be counted upon to defend one another in a very dangerous world today .
GIBSON : And you think it would be worth it to the United States , Georgia is worth it to the United States to go to war if Russia were to invade .
PALIN : What I think is that smaller democratic countries that are invaded by a larger power is something for us to be vigilant against .
We have got to be cognizant of what the consequences are if a larger power is able to take over smaller democratic countries .
And we have got to be vigilant .
We have got to show the support , in this case , for Georgia .
The support that we can show is economic sanctions perhaps against Russia , if this is what it leads to .
It does n’t have to lead to war and it does n’t have to lead , as I said , to a Cold War , but economic sanctions , diplomatic pressure , again , counting on our allies to help us do that in this mission of keeping our eye on Russia and Putin and some of his desire to control and to control much more than smaller democratic countries .
His mission , if it is to control energy supplies , also , coming from and through Russia , that ’s a dangerous position for our world to be in , if we were to allow that to happen .
Did major international media , including wire services Reuters and The Associated Press , clumsily help spread pro-Georgian propaganda during the recent war with Russia ?
Perhaps so , based on possibly staged photos by Reuters photogs David Mdzinarishvili and Gleb Garanich , and George Abdaladze , an Reuters AP shooter .
Several blogs , most notably Byzantine Blog , have highlighted some , ahem , curious details in a series of photos claiming to portray civilian casualties of Russian attacks on the town of Gori .
Danger Room pal Bryan William Jones , himself a photographer , brought our attention to this .
On his own he noticed details in several pics that he says " made me sit up and say WTF ? "
One series of photos from Gori might show bodies changing location and poses , while one photogenic Georgian man appears in several different photo series , shot by different photogs , " grieving " for the dead ... apparently without ever looking at the camera being shoved in his face .
The photos are especially suspect when compared to clearly real snapshots from the conflict , Jones points out .
Of course , Russia has n't exactly been BS - free in this conflict ; Moscow 's claims of 2,000 killed in South Ossetia were later debunked by Human Rights Watch .
The real number : fewer than 100 .
Update , 9/5/08 : Asked for comment yesterday , Reuters photo editor Gary Hershorn just scoffed , " A bunch of bloggers ! "
" I got nothing to say to you .
I 'm not allowed to talk to you , " he added .
This morning Reuters media rep Alexandra Honeysett referred me to an official statement , written in Russian , from Reuters ' Russia head Michael Stott .
She helpfully provided this translation : " Local reports in Russia have inaccurately accused Reuters of issuing staged photographs in its coverage of the conflict in Georgia .
These accusations are completely false and entirely unfounded . "
Reuters has investigated the situation and firmly stands by its reporting and coverage , and adheres to the Reuters Trust Principles , specifically , " that the integrity , independence and freedom from bias of Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved . "
Aside from that , Reuters has no comment , Honeysett said .
The statement includes links to the digital negatives of many of the photographs in question .
While they do provide more context , I 'm not sure the negatives necessarily prove that the photos were n't staged .
All we have here are more photos warranting scrutiny .
Some commenters at this blog are convinced that the accusations of staged photos are way off base .
They point out that using different camera lenses in the same shoot can create the illusion that subjects in the photos have moved , when in fact they 've been in exact same spots all along .
I 'm trying to reach The Associated Press now .
Stay tuned .
Update , 9/6/08 : " We stand behind our coverage of this conflict , " says Jack Stokes , AP spokesman .

ALSO :
Does John McCain have a " hidden agenda " to " kill the UN " ?
That 's what the man who devised McCain 's big set - piece foreign policy proposal says – and he 's delighted it is sailing silently through the presidential election campaign towards success .
This story begins with a Republican presidential candidate who , despite the hype , does n't seem to know much about foreign affairs .
McCain recently talked at length about problems on the " Iraq / Pakistan border " – the countries are a thousand miles apart .
Asked how to deal with Darfur , he mused about " bringing pressure on the government of Somalia " .
Uh – it's Sudan , Senator McCain .
And he keeps expressing his desire to build up US relations with Czechoslovakia , a country that has n't existed for 15 years .
But McCain does know one thing : he does n't like the United Nations .
He championed George Bush 's appointment of John Bolton as US ambassador to the UN – precisely because Bolton scorns the UN as " irrelevant " and " a twilight zone " .
He even announced " there is no such thing as the United Nations " .
It was like appointing Marilyn Manson as ambassador to the Vatican .
This is part of a long seam of thinking on the American right : they opposed Franklin D Roosevelt 's spearheading of the United Nations as a fetter on American power , and have never been properly reconciled to it .
Republican congresses have refused to authorise US dues to the UN – so there is now a backlog of $ 2.8 bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) outstanding .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yet McCain cannot oppose the UN outright – because the American people support it so passionately .
Contrary to the yokel - myth , a typical opinion poll – by Global Public Opinion – just found that 64 per cent of Americans think the UN is doing a good job , compared to just 28 per cent who support George Bush .
Some 72 per cent of Americans want the UN to play a bigger role .
So McCain has decided to build up an innocuous - sounding alternative called a " League of Democracies " .
It would be an alliance of countries the US labels democratic that can be used to legitimise US military actions .
Charles Krauthammer , the conservative journalist who invented the plan , says : " What I like about it is , it 's got a hidden agenda .
It looks as if it 's about listening and joining with allies ... except the idea here , which McCain can't say but I can , is to essentially kill the UN .
Nobody 's going to walk out of the UN .
There 's a lot of emotional attachment to it in the US .
How do you kill it ?
You create a parallel institution . "
Gradually – over decades – McCain hopes it would make the UN wither away .
Any response needs to start by admitting the UN has serious imperfections .
Its structure is absurdly antiquated , with the permanent members of the Security Council frozen as the winners of the Second World War .
The Human Rights Commission became an obscenity , offering places to Sudan and Saudi Arabia .
There have been some horrible scandals in the past decade : UN peacekeepers who commit sexual abuse still are n't properly investigated , and some of them cut corrupt deals with the murderous Congolese militias they were supposed to stop .
Even Kofi Annan 's son Kojo has been involved in some dubious dealings .
Those of us who support the UN should be more outraged by these failures than anyone else .
But the US government has also committed horrible abuses and been riddled with corruption – and nobody suggests the solution is to abolish it .
No : it is to make it live up to its greatest ideals .
In addition to these real flaws , the UN is too often used as a bright blue punch - bag for any old complaint about the state of the world .
For example , the UN is routinely blamed for not intervening in Burma , or Zimbabwe , or Georgia – but the UN has no army of its own ; it is only as good as its members .
Blaming the UN for these failures is like blaming Wembley Stadium when your football team loses a match .
The UN 's positive achievements are almost never mentioned .
It was the UN vaccination programme that abolished smallpox – an agonising disease that killed hundreds of millions of people – from the human condition .
It was the UN that talked Kennedy and Khrushchev back from the brink when they were poised to incinerate the Earth .
The League would not even live up to its limited pro-democracy billing .
If you study McCain 's foreign policy statements , you find that for him " democracy " does n't mean a free and openly elected leader .
No : it means a leader who supports US demands .
You can see this if you compare McCain 's reactions over the past fortnight to two different separatist movements : in Georgia and Bolivia .
When it comes to Georgia , he says it is obscene for South Ossetians to secede from a country they never felt part of , and have never been directly ruled by .
He orders the people there to decline the support of the foul Putin regime next door and remain glued to the government of Georgia , against their will , for the sake of keeping the country together .
However , when it comes to Bolivia , he actively encourages separatism .
The Bush administration – with McCain 's support – has been lavishing cash on separatists in the gas - rich regions of this South American country in the hope that they will declare independence .
Why does McCain think separatism is " evil " in one part of the world , and " necessary " in the other ?
The answer lies in the ground .
In Georgia , the democratic - but - dissident - bashing government lets the US control the oil and gas that pass through .
In Bolivia , the impeccably democratic government of Evo Morales wants to control it on their own .
Morales is asking US gas companies to pay their fair share , and using the proceeds to lift his own people out of poverty .
For that , he is dubbed " authoritarian " .
So there 's McCain 's definition of democracy : if you let us control your resources , you 're a democracy .
If you try to control your resources yourself , you 're a dictatorship .
Those of us who believe democracy is the most precious political value of all should be repelled to see it reduced to a propaganda term .
On an increasingly multipolar planet that has begun to disastrously heat up , the need for a shared set of rules we can all push our leaders to obey is greater than ever .
But how do we make it work ?
We need to look beyond the cagey centrism of Obama – still too determined by America 's oil addiction , and the capturing of its politics by big money – to genuinely radical ideas .
Albert Einstein thought the UN General Assembly should be directly elected , and in turn appoint the Security Council .
This would create an even greater pro-UN momentum all over the world ; and its peoples would immediately look to it in any crisis .
The vision of a Parliament of Man is obviously distant , but it is a shimmering goal to begin progressing towards .
John McCain would slap us back in the opposite direction – towards a Hobbesian chaos regulated only by raw American power .

Political ads hit MTV , Comedy Central McCain and Obama supporters try new tactics in quest for young voters
This Barack Obama campaign debuted on Comedy Central and is a sign that the youth vote will be a deciding vote in this year 's race .

" This is your brain on ... more Photo : MoveOn.org Political Action , Courtesy To The Chronicle Photo : MoveOn.org Political Action , Courtesy To The Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Political ads hit MTV , Comedy Central 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
A national political ad appeared on Comedy Central TV for the first time Wednesday night .
Why has n't that happened before ?
Because nobody thought voters were watching .
But public perception of the channel , the home of such shows as " South Park , " has changed as " The Colbert Report " and " The Daily Show With Jon Stewart " have become must - stops for major political players and the places where many younger , well - informed voters get their news .
GOP candidate Sen. John McCain has made 14 appearances on " The Daily Show , " Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , three .
With that in mind , the online hub MoveOn sponsored a 30 - second pro-Obama spot on MTV on Tuesday and on Comedy Central Wednesday night .
It followed an anti-Obama ad broadcast on MTV last week that was paid for by the conservative group Let Freedom Ring .
That political ad was the first ever to appear on MTV .
The ads are a sign that the opposing sides are trying to court younger voters in unprecedented ways .
The median age of Comedy Central 's overall viewership , 29 , is about half that of the typical viewer of network news shows .
The median age for MTV is even younger , at 22 .
Political analysts caution , however , that running a couple of humorous TV ads alone wo n't win over younger voters .
" The conventional wisdom is that sarcasm plays well with young voters , but that 's not completely true , " said Peter Levine , the director of CIRCLE , a nonpartisan Tufts University think tank that analyzes youth voting behavior .
" The young person who is following the race is concerned about issues .
So I 'd bet that a serious issue ad that addresses the issues they 're concerned about would play better than a joke ad . "
Ridicule tactics
Reaching young voters through humor was the intent behind the ad created by Let Freedom Ring , a conservative independent political group that placed the first ad on MTV last week .
Let Freedom Ring founder Colin Hanna said MTV - where a third of the viewers are n't of voting age - " reaches a young demographic and it's important for some of these people who have been uncritically supportive of Sen .
Obama to come face - to - face with some of his credibility issues .
And when you 're addressing a political candidate 's credibility , ridicule can be very effective . "
With the words " flip - flopper ? " on the screen , the 30 - second spot ridiculed Obama as " worse than a flip - flopper " because he holds " two positions at once . "
The ad also appeared on MSNBC , Fox News and VH - 1 .
( The nonpartisan political research think tank Politifact.com found the ad's charges about Obama holding multiple positions on the Iraq war to be false . )
After the ad ran , MoveOn sent a note to its members saying it was " outrageous " that the first " political ad that millions of young people will see is a negative attack on Barack Obama .
The Republicans ' strategy is clear :
Kill the hope that 's brought millions of new young voters out of the woodwork . "
So it raised $ 150,000 to air a lighthearted ad that spoofs the 1980s anti-drug advertisements that used a frying egg to remind viewers that " this is your brain on drugs . "
" This is your brain , " a young woman says , holding up an egg .
" And this is your brain on hope , " a young man says , holding up a young chick .
The last few seconds are a screen shot of " Obama ' 08 . "
Hanna said the organization plans to have more ads on MTV and possibly Comedy Central .
Some will be issue - driven , without naming a candidate , and others will " draw distinctions between the candidates . "
The two sides might want to soften the way they describe those distinctions , youth experts say : Attack ads - like one the McCain campaign broadcast on several cable channels Wednesday - turn off younger voters .
" Most will say negative does n't work , but if it did n't , no one would use it , " said Jane Fleming Kleeb , executive director of Young Voter PAC , a political action committee that supports Democratic candidates who reach out to younger voters .
" That being said , going negative is not what I would advise a candidate to do with young voters .
Above all , young people want to be part of something bigger than themselves .
This generation of young people believes government does and should have a role in our communities . "
So while the McCain campaign made a splash with a 30 - second ad mocking Obama as a " celebrity , " salting it with images of gossip staples Paris Hilton and Britney Spears , it might not resonate beyond the cable news shows .
Later Wednesday , the Obama campaign released a TV ad titled " Low Road " that showed how nonpartisan third parties have debunked false claims made in McCain ads .
No character assassination
Comedy Central spokesman Tony
Fox said the network would not air any political advertisements that were " character assassinations . "
How does the network define that ?
" That 's a good question .
There 's no checklist , " Fox said , adding that the same department that decides its programming standards would set boundaries for commercials .
Spokesmen for both Comedy Central and MTV said their networks would consider political ads from unaffiliated third parties on a case - by - case basis .
Missing the mark ?
The ads aiming at younger voters have the potential of missing their mark .
While Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly famously derided Stewart 's audience as " stoned slackers " four years ago , quite the opposite is true .
Stewart 's viewers , along with Colbert's , are the most affluent among late - night audiences , with a median income of $ 71,000 , according to Comedy Central 's market research .
The median age of a " Daily Show " viewer is 37 .
And studies have shown that the audience is better educated than O'Reilly's .
But youth voter experts say that mass media advertising alone wo n't work - it has to be combined with real - world connections , as young voters respond best to hearing from other young voters - in person .
" I think you 're going to see a lot more TV ads aimed at younger voters , " said Heather Smith , executive director of the nonpartisan Rock the Vote .
" But peer - to - peer is still the best way to reach a young person . "
Let Freedom Ring 's anti-Obama ad : Let Freedom Ring , a conservative organization , played an ad on MTV last week that ridiculed Democratic Sen.
Barack Obama for allegedly taking two positions on several issues .
The nonpartisan think tank Politifact.com found the ad's charges that Obama held multiple positions on the Iraq war to be false .
MoveOn 's pro-Obama ad in response :
The liberal organization MoveOn bought time on MTV and Comedy Central this week for an ad that spoofed public service ads of the 1980s by talking about how hope is back .
" This is your brain , " a young woman says , holding an egg .
" And this is your brain on hope , " a young man finishes , holding a chick .
The last few seconds are a screen shot of " Obama ' 08 . "

Dry water makes storage a gas
Chemists in the UK have developed a way to convert methane gas into a solid that looks like granulated sugar - making it easier to store .
Professor Andrew Cooper and his colleagues at the University of Liverpool have found that they can trap methane in a material made of silica and water , called ' dry water ' .
They report their findings in Nature News .
Methane is seen as a viable alternative fuel , with experts estimating that deposits worldwide could contain more energy than coal , oil and all other fossil fuels combined .
" There is a huge amount of energy in these resources , " says Cooper .
" The question is how much of that material can we recover . "
Most of that methane is locked inside ice crystals in the Arctic or at the bottom of the ocean , where the pressure is high , the temperature is low , or both , which makes extracting those deposits difficult .
A chunk of white methane hydrate from the ocean depths is ice cold in your hand , but hold a lit match to it and yellow and blue flames rise from the methane released by the melting ice .
Storage issues
Once you get the hydrate to the surface , methane can be difficult and expensive to store and transport , which is where Cooper and his colleagues ' work could prove useful .
To store and transport methane it usually has to be cooled down to about - 113 degrees Celsius , or pressurised around 5000 kilopascals , both of which require large amounts of energy and can be dangerous and flammable .
Storing methane in a water and silica mix that looks and feels like a powder would make it easier and possibly cheaper to store .
Cooper and his colleagues combined dry water - a mixture of water and very fine particles of silica - and methane gas with a blender bought at a local store .
The tiny silica particles increase the surface area of the water and making it easier and faster for the methane gas to become absorbed .
After about 30 minutes the white powder was fully saturated with methane .
They determined that 1 litre of methane gas can be stored in about 6 grams of powdered methane , roughly the same volume as most pressurised containers .
The powdered methane still needs to be held under light pressure and at a temperature of about - 70 degrees Celsius .
Releasing the methane simply requires raising the temperature or decreasing the pressure , says Cooper .
Other gases
Powdered methane could just be the beginning .
Cooper says that the team can store other gases as powders , including hydrogen and carbon dioxide , although under different environmental conditions .
Storing CO2 as a powder could make carbon sequestration easier or bring a hydrogen - powered economy closer to realisation .
Easily trapping gases like CO2 , methane and hydrogen could be useful , but first it has to be economical , says both Cooper and outside experts who are cautious about its expense .
" It 's an interesting result , " says Michael Max , who uses hydrates for desalination at Marine Desalination Systems .
" But we do n't see how this could be developed commercially . "
Max points to Mitsui Group technology that mechanically presses methane hydrate into pea-sized pebbles , making them more stable for transportation and use .
Finding a cheaper way to gather , store and transport methane and other gasses , will eventually open up the use of these alternative fuel resources .
" The economics of this are far from obvious , " says Cooper .
" This is a preliminary result and we have to think hard about the costs involved . "

Gallup : Obama pulls ahead of McCain for first time since RNC RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This GALLUP : " The Sept. 14 - 16 Gallup Poll Daily tracking update shows Barack Obama regaining a slight , although not statistically significant , edge over John McCain , 47 % to 45 % , among registered voters , marking the first time since the week of the Republican National Convention that McCain has not held at least a one percentage point margin over Obama . "
" From a broad perspective , the race remains a statistical tie .
But there has been a general drift towards Obama since McCain moved to a five - point lead over Obama through the weekend after the GOP convention .
" Today 's report includes two days of interviewing conducted after reports of the collapse of Wall Street financial institutions and changes in the stock market began to dominate the news on Monday .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking data show that in each of these individual days ( Monday and Tuesday ) consumer ratings of the U.S. economy have become more negative .
Similarly , in each of these individual days ' interviewing , Obama has led McCain in election tracking .
There is thus a correlation between the bad financial news and Obama 's gains , although the data do not allow us to conclude definitively that there is a causal connection between the two .
Throughout the campaign , Obama has generally held an edge over McCain when voters are asked who could best handle the U.S. economy , although McCain gained on the economic dimension in polling conducted immediately after the GOP convention .

Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a disk of gas and dust circling the sun .
Remnants of crust from Earth 's infancy are hard to come by because most of that material has been recycled into Earth 's interior several times by the plate tectonics that continue to shape our planet 's surface .
In 2001 , geologists found an expanse of bedrock , known as the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt , exposed on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec .
Suspecting that the rocks there could be from one of the earliest periods of Earth 's history , geologists took samples to try and determine their age .
They measured tiny variations in the isotopes ( or species of an element that have different numbers of neutrons ) of the rare earth elements neodymium and samarium in the rocks and determined that the samples were from 3.8 to 4.28 billion years old .
The oldest dates , which came from rocks that geologists call " faux amphibolite , " are thought to be ancient volcanic deposits .
They beat the previously oldest known rocks , which are 4.03 billion years old and come from a formation called the Acasta Gneiss in Canada 's Northwest Territories .
The only dates of crustal material older than the newly - dated Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt are from isolated mineral grains called zircons that are highly resistant to weathering and geologic processes .
The oldest zircons , from grains in Western Australia , are about 4.36 billion years old .
The Nuvvuagittuq rocks are " the oldest whole rocks found so far " though , said geologist Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution , who analyzed the rocks with Jonathan O'Neil , a Ph.D. student at McGill University in Montreal .
The team 's findings are detailed in the Sept. 25 issue of the journal Science .
Their work was supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada , the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Carnegie Institution of Washington .
Examining such ancient rocks " gives us an unprecedented glimpse of the processes that formed the early crust , " Carlson said .
In a recent meeting with Jalal Talabani , President Bush praised the Iraqi president for his work towards allowing Iraqis to " realise [ their ] hopes and dreams " .
It is a comment characteristic of an administration that has been forced to base its presence in Iraq on moral grounds after the shattering of the myth of Iraqi WMD .
Yet actions speak louder than words , and Washington has refused to accept real responsibility for the consequences of its decision to invade Iraq .
Nowhere is this more evident than in the criminal neglect shown towards the Iraqi refugee population .
Today it is estimated at 4.7 million , with more than 2 million people externally displaced , many living in appalling conditions .
That 's twice the population of Birmingham forced to flee the country and live in general destitution .
As a powerful Amnesty report described last month : " The treatment of Iraqis seeking international protection has failed to improve .
In fact , it has taken a sharp turn for the worse . "
That things are getting worse has not stopped the somewhat illusory appearance of action .
Indeed , James Foley , the US ambassador and State Department coordinator for Iraqi refugees , was in Syria last month as part of a four - nation Middle East tour to boost the numbers of Iraqi refugees coming to the US in order to meet the Bush administration 's goal of accepting 12,000 by the end of September .
Yet the US government managed to let in only 1,608 in the 2007 fiscal year , despite a target of 7,000 .
Such numbers are a far cry from the numbers of Vietnamese resettled in America during and after that particular war , when an estimated 800,000 arrived after several waves of immigration .
Why the discrepancy between the two conflicts ?
The main reason is linked to the increase in immigration and border controls sparked by the 9/11 attacks , which provided the initial political capital for the Iraq invasion .
It was 9/11 that spawned the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , which is now an element of the Kafkaesque conveyor belt for refugees .
This sees them interviewed , processed , pre-screened , interviewed by the DHS , out - processed , and then potentially allowed to travel from Iraq to the US .
The bureaucratic absurdity of this system is such that Amnesty reported how US security restrictions bar asylum and resettlement to those who may have provided " material support to terrorist organisations " , which includes those who pay ransoms to militias to have relatives returned .
While the US government finds ways to avoid taking responsibility , Iraqis die - in particular , translators and those who have worked with the Americans .
These are victims of death squads and targeted assassinations , as the New York Times 's George Packer conveyed in his play Betrayed .
In addition , this week US papers reported that the new Iraqi police and military forces were finding themselves abandoned by their US allies after suffering serious injuries , often on operations directed by US commanders .
US officials regularly fudge responding for the bigger picture of responsibility by regularly blaming processing capacity for the constant delays or claiming that responsibility for refugees lies with the Iraqi government .
Yet the Iraqi government is neither sovereign nor effective , and the United Nations has had to intercede to warn refugees that it is not safe to return , despite the official narrative of the successes of the surge .
Perhaps the most effective way of getting out of Iraq and into America may be by not being human .
Since the war began , there have been numerous stories about US servicemen taking home dogs they met in Iraq , from Nubs , who followed a marine across miles of desert when he moved base , to the charity Operation Baghdad Pups , which works hard to get Iraqi dogs access to America .
The continued descent into poverty and despair experienced by still increasing numbers of Iraqi refugees five years after the invasion is a testimony to the fallacy that the military intervention has been about anything other than a ( misplaced ) sense of national interest .
That more attention has been given to dogs than to people is a sad reminder of how , instead of liberating the Iraqis , the war has further dehumanised them .
The small town of Monticello , Minnesota seems an unlikely spot for a battle over city - owned fiber - to - the - home .
The town , which is a distant commute to Minneapolis , thought it could better attract residents and business by building its own fiber - optic network .
After a couple years of due diligence , the town held a referendum ; 74 percent of voters agreed to fund the $ 25 million scheme .
The city sought the needed municipal bonds , but the day before it closed on them , the local telco filed suit to stop the plan .
Its claim : taking out bonds to build a fiber network is illegal .
Bridgewater
Telephone argues that the city cannot use tax - exempt bonds to " enter into direct competition with incumbent commercial providers of telephone , Internet , and cable television services . "
The odd thing about the complaint , a copy of which was seen by Ars Technica , is that it makes almost no argument ; instead , the company simply quotes a short bit of Minnesota law and essentially says , " See , it 's illegal ! " without offering an explanation .
The statute in question says that cities can use bonds to fund nursing homes , garbage collection , parks , playgrounds , " homes for the aged , " and more , including " any utility or other public convenience from which a revenue is or may be derived . "
If the judge finds that fiber - to - the - home is a " public convenience , " the case seems to be over .
" Current expenses " go back to the future
The only further comment that Bridgewater makes is that bond money cannot be used to pay for " current expenses , " a clear sign from the state that towns cannot spend themselves into debt and just keep issuing bonds to pay for the mess .
Bridgewater treats these two words as a law against setting aside a bit of the bond money to cover startup expenses for the new project .
Normally , when a city builds a new swimming pool , for instance , it would set aside a portion of the fees to pay for the initial hiring of lifeguards and the snacks that stock the cafe .
Christopher Mitchell , a director at the Institute for Local Self - Reliance ( which advocates for local control of broadband networks ) , tells
Ars that if the judge accepts such arguments , " then cities can not bond for anything . "
The City of Monticello , which has just replied to the lawsuit , thinks the whole case is ridiculous .
In its response , the city 's attorney says that the telco offers only a " plain misreading of a Minnesota statute " and " pleads no facts that tend in any way to call into question whether the project constitutes a ' utility or other public convenience from which revenue is or may be derived ' . "
As for the " current expenses " issue , the city sounds exasperated with Bridgewater .
" There is nothing ' current ' about the items that Bridgewater / TDS attempts to describe as ' current expenses ' , " says the response .
" Those expenses will be incurred in the future , as part of an effort to secure a benefit that will arise even further in the future when the system is functioning , and that will endure even further into the future . "
Mitchell , who has been involved with the city on this entire issue , tells
Ars that he 's sympathetic to arguments from private companies about having to compete unfairly with cities .
But he points out that cities have to publish their business plans , deployment , targets , and funding , which levels the playing field .
And Monticello did first approach Bridgewater , asking it to deploy fiber in the town ; the answer was no .
( Congress has also started to debate the issue . )
The alternative , Mitchell says as he looks at the rest of the world , is that the US will have to be content with second - rate Internet ; nearly all major fiber deployments around the globe have had government backing or serious support .
The payback on such schemes tends to be too far in the future for companies that have to answer to shareholders on a quarterly basis .
Even Verizon , which might be seen as an exception to the rule , proves the point ; investors were initially quite skeptical of the proposed $ 18 billion - 20 billion payout , and only recently has the company 's move started to look prescient rather than foolishly risky .
As for the Bridgewater claim , Mitchell says that his response upon reading it was , " This ca n't be serious , they 're not even trying to win . "
The timing of the complaint makes it look as thought Bridgewater wants to delay the process .
If so , the company has already succeeded .
In the meantime , Monticello has approved a much smaller fiber loop to connect government and major industrial sites .
Local control , choice of ISP
Assuming the lawsuit can be dealt with , Monticello hopes to build fiber lines to each home and business in town with the goals of :
choice of service provider
competitive rates
local service
local ownership
economic development
economic returns to the community
When 74 percent of town 's voters want to build themselves a fiber network , but the telco demands that they 1 ) not do it , and then 2 ) accept that the telco wo n't do it for years , either , the market ( such as it is ) does n't appear to be functioning well .
Monticello 's solution is to build an interconnect facility of its own where ISPs can come in and link up to any fiber user who wants their service .
The city maintains the lines and the connection facility , but does n't need to become an ISP .
We 're seeing more cities interested in this sort of arrangement as they recognize that fiber is the future but that , unless they are a FiOS town , that fiber wo n't be coming to the homes in their communities any time soon .
Cases like this will help set the parameters for how cities or local co-ops can design , build , and operate such networks .

The Paluxy Dinosaur / " Man Track " Controversy © 1996 - 2020 , Glen J. Kuban http://paleo.cc/paluxy/
For many years claims were made by young - earth creationists ( YECs ) , that human footprints or " giant man tracks " occur alongside fossilized dinosaur tracks in the limestone beds of the Paluxy River , near Glen Rose , Texas .
At one time many YECs argued that such tracks supported their belief that all life forms were created only several thousand years ago , dramatically contradicting the conventional geologic time table that humans did not appear on earth until over 60 million years after non-avian dinosaurs became extinct .
However , the " man track " claims have not stood up to close scientific scrutiny , and in recent years have been abandoned even by most creationists .
The supposed human tracks have involved a variety of phenomena , including metatarsal dinosaur tracks , erosional features , and carvings .
The largest number of " man tracks " are forms of elongate , metatarsal dinosaur tracks , made by bipedal dinosaurs that sometimes impressed their metatarsi ( heels and soles ) as they walked .
When the digit impressions of such tracks are subdued by mud-backflow or secondary infilling , the resulting depressions often superficially resemble large human footprints .
Other alleged " man tracks " including purely erosional features ( often selectively highlighted to encourage human shapes ) , indistinct marks of undertain origin , and a smaller number of doctored and carved tracks ( most of the latter occurring on loose blocks of rock ) .
A few individuals such as Carl Baugh , Don Patton , and Ian Juby , continue to promote the Paluxy " man tracks " or alleged human tracks in Mesozoic or Paleozoic from other localities , but such claims are not considered credible by either mainstream scientists or major creationist groups .
When examined thoroughly and carefully , the Paluxy tracks not only provide no positive evidence for young - earth creationism , but are found to be among many other lines of geologic evidence which indicate that the earth has had a long and complex history .
This web site provides a collection of articles reviewing the history of the Paluxy controversy and relevant evidence , articles on other alleged out - of - order fossils and artifacts , and information and links boarder aspects of trace fossils , paleontology , and the " creation / evolution " issue .
Unless otherwise noted , the articles and illustrations are by myself ( Glen Kuban ) .

The deal would also restrict gold - plated farewells for executives of companies that sell devalued assets to the Treasury Department .
Image Senator Judd Gregg , Republican of New Hampshire , said of the new plan ,  If we dont pass it , we shouldnt be a Congress . 
Credit ... Andrew Councill for The New York Times
President Bush called the measure “ a very good bill ” and praised Congressional leaders .
“ This plan sends a strong signal to markets around the world that the United States is serious about restoring confidence and stability to our financial system , ” Mr. Bush said in a statement .
“ Without this rescue plan , the costs to the American economy could be disastrous . ”
House Republicans had threatened to scuttle the deal , and proposed a vastly different approach that would have focused on insuring troubled debt rather than buying it .
In the end , the insurance proposal was included on top of the purchasing power , but there is no requirement that the Treasury secretary use it , leaving them short of that goal .
It is virtually impossible to know the ultimate cost of the rescue plan to taxpayers , but Congressional leaders stressed that it would likely be far less than $ 700 billion .
Because the Treasury will buy assets with the potential to resell them at a higher price , the government might even turn a profit .
That provision , pushed by House Democrats , was the last to be agreed to in a high - level series of talks that had top lawmakers and White House economic advisers hustling between offices just off the Capitol Rotunda until midnight on Saturday , scrambling to strike an agreement before Asian markets opened Sunday night .
The bill calls for disbursing the money in parts , starting with $ 250 billion followed by $ 100 billion at the discretion of the president .
The Treasury can request the remaining $ 350 billion at any time , and Congress must act to deny it if it disapproves .
The agreement on a bailout plan was greeted with subdued optimism in early Asian trading on Monday .
But shares sank by late Monday morning on renewed worries about the credit crisis , with a decision by HSBC to raise lending rates by 0.5 percent in Hong Kong triggering a drop of 2 percent in the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and 0.9 percent in the Kospi Index in Seoul .

EVEN by the standards of the worst financial crisis for at least a generation , the events of Sunday September 14th and the day before were extraordinary .
The weekend began with hopes that a deal could be struck , with or without government backing , to save Lehman Brothers , America 's fourth - largest investment bank .
Early Monday morning Lehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
It has more than $ 613 billion of debt .
Other vulnerable financial giants scrambled to sell themselves or raise enough capital to stave off a similar fate .
Merrill Lynch , the third - biggest investment bank , sold itself to Bank of America ( BofA ) , an erstwhile Lehman suitor , in a $ 50 billion all - stock deal .
American International Group ( AIG ) brought forward a potentially life - saving overhaul and went cap - in - hand to the Federal Reserve .
But its shares also slumped on Monday .
The situation remains fluid , and investors stampeded towards the relative safety of American Treasury bonds .
Stockmarkets tumbled around the world ( though some Asian bourses were closed ) and the oil price plummeted to well under $ 100 a barrel .
The dollar fell sharply , and the yield on two - year Treasury notes fell below 2 % on hopes the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates at a scheduled meeting on Tuesday .
American stock futures were deep in the red too .
Spreads on risky credit , already elevated , widened further .
With these developments the crisis is entering a new and extremely dangerous phase .
If Lehman 's assets are dumped in a liquidation , prices of like assets on other firms ' books will also have to be marked down , eroding their capital bases .
The government 's refusal to help with a bail - out of Lehman will strip many firms of the benefit of being thought too big to fail , raising their borrowing costs .
Lehman 's demise highlights the industry 's inability , or unwillingness , to rescue the sick , even when the consequences of inaction are potentially dire .
The biggest worry is the effect on derivatives markets , particularly the giant one for credit - default swaps .
Lehman is a top - ten counterparty in CDSs , holding contracts with a notional value of almost $ 800 billion .
On Sunday , banks called in their derivatives traders to assess their exposures to Lehman and work on mitigating risks .
The Securities and Exchange Commission , Lehman 's main regulator , said it is working with the bank to protect clients and trading partners and to “ maintain orderly markets ” .
Government officials believed they had persuaded a consortium of Wall Street firms to back a new vehicle that would take $ 40 billion - 70 billion of dodgy assets off Lehman 's books , thereby facilitating a takeover of the remainder .
But the deal died when the main suitors , BofA and Barclays , a British bank , walked away on Sunday afternoon .
Both were unwilling to buy the firm , even shorn of the worst bits , without some sort of government backstop .
But Hank Paulson , the treasury secretary , decided to draw a line and refuse such help .
After the Fed had bailed out Bear Stearns in March and the Treasury had taken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last weekend , expectations were high that they would do the same for Lehman .
And that was precisely the problem : it would have confirmed that the federal government stood behind all risk - taking in the financial system , creating moral hazard that would take years to undo and expanding taxpayers ' liability almost without limit .
Conceivably , Congress could have denied Mr Paulson the money he needed even if he had been inclined to bail Lehman out .
This left Lehman with no option but to prepare for bankruptcy .
Though the bank has access to a Fed lending facility , introduced after Bear 's takeover by JP Morgan Chase , the collapse of its share price left it unable to raise new equity and facing crippling downgrades from rating agencies .
Moreover , rival firms that had continued to trade with it in recent weeks — at the urging of regulators — had begun to pull away in the past few days .
The inability to find a buyer is a huge blow to Lehman 's 25,000 employees , who own a third of the company 's now - worthless stock ; in such a difficult environment , most will struggle to find work at other financial firms .
It also makes for an ignominious end to the career of Dick Fuld , Lehman 's boss since 1994 , who until last year was viewed as one of Wall Street 's smartest managers .
Merrill 's rush to sell itself was motivated by fear that it might be next to be caught in the stampede .
Despite selling a big dollop of its most rotten assets recently , the market continued to question its viability .
Its shares fell by 36 % last week , and hedge funds had started to move their business elsewhere .
Its boss , John Thain , concluded that it needed to strike a deal before markets reopened .
It approached several firms , including BofA and Morgan Stanley , but only BofA felt able to conduct the necessary due diligence in time .
Not only has Mr Thain managed to shelter his firm from the storm , but he has also secured a price well above its closing price last Friday , $ 29 per share compared with $ 17 .
How he managed that in such an ugly market is not yet clear .
Ken Lewis , BofA 's boss , is no fan of investment banking , but he is a consummate opportunist , and he has coveted Merrill 's formidable retail brokerage .
Still , the deal carries risks .
It will be a logistical challenge , all the more so since BofA is in the middle of digesting Countrywide , a big mortgage lender .
Commercial - bank takeovers of investment banks have a horrible history because of the stark cultural differences .
And it is not clear if BofA has a clear picture of Merrill 's remaining troubled assets .
The takeover of Merrill leaves just two large independent investment banks in America , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs .
Both are in better shape than their erstwhile rivals .
But this weekend 's events cast a shadow over the standalone model , with its reliance on leverage and skittish wholesale funding .
Spreads on both banks '
CDSs , which reflect investors views of the probability of default , soared on Monday .
Wall Street has company in its misery .
Washington Mutual , a big thrift , is fighting for survival under a new boss .
Even more worryingly , so is AIG , America 's largest insurer , thanks to a reckless foray into CDSs of mortgage - linked collateralised - debt obligations .
Investors have fled , fearing the firm will need a lot more new capital than the $ 20 billion raised so far .
Prompted by the weekend bloodletting , AIG brought forward to Monday a restructuring that was to have been unveiled on September 25th .
This was expected to include the sale of its aircraft - leasing arm and other businesses .
It is also reported to be seeking a $ 40 billion in bridge loan from the Fed , to be repaid once the sales go through , in the hope that this will attract new capital , possibly from private - equity firms .
With Lehman left dangling , official attention is now turning to putting more safeguards in place to soften the coming shock to markets and the economy .
The first step has been to encourage Lehman 's counterparties to get together and try to net out as many contracts as possible .
On Sunday the Fed also expanded the list of collateral it will accept for loans at its discount window , to include even equities ; and dealers may lend any investment - grade security , not just triple - A rated , to the Fed in exchange for Treasury bonds .
Markets are also pricing in some possibility that the Fed will cut its short - term interest rate target from 2 % when it meets for a regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday .
That would be an abrupt turnaround from August , when officials figured their next move would be to raise rates , not lower them .
In a sign of how bad things are , even straitened banks are stumping up cash to help the stabilisation efforts .
On Sunday , a group of ten banks and securities firms set up a $ 70 billion loan facility that any of the founding members can tap if it finds itself short of cash .
Even if markets can be stabilised this week , the pain is far from over — and could yet spread .
Worldwide credit - related losses by financial institutions now top $ 500 billion , of which only $ 350 billion of equity has been replenished .
This $ 150 billion gap , leveraged 14.5 times ( the average gearing for the industry ) , translates to a $ 2 trillion reduction in liquidity .
Hence the severe shortage of credit and predictions of worse to come .
Indeed , most analysts think that the deleveraging still has far to go .
Some question how much has taken place .
Bianco Research notes that while the credit positions of the 20 largest banks have fallen by $ 300 billion , to $ 1.3 trillion , since the Fed started its special lending facilities , the same amount has been financed by the Fed itself through these windows .
In other words , instead of deleveraging , the banks have just shifted a chunk of their risk to the central bank .
As spectacular as this weekend was , more drama is on the way .
( CNN ) --
In her first solo appearance on the campaign trail , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin told voters Monday they need to send her and John McCain to the White House so they can " shake things up . "
" In the next 50 days , Colorado , it 's going to be a hard - fought contest here , " Palin said in Golden , Colorado , one of the state 's swing districts .
" We 're taking our case for reform to voters of every background , in every party or no party at all .
And with your vote , we 're going to Washington to shake things up . "
She told voters that should she become vice president , she would focus on energy security , government reform and helping families that have children with special needs .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama was also in Colorado on Monday , holding an event in Grand Junction .
Colorado is a key swing state , with nine electoral votes at stake .
At his Colorado event , Obama attacked McCain 's call for change and said the Republican candidate was using his lines .
" He has argued that what qualifies him to be president is the quarter - century he spent in Washington , " Obama said .
" But now suddenly , John McCain says he 's about change .
He 's even started using some of my lines . "
" Let me tell you something .
Instead of borrowing my lines , he needs to borrow some of our ideas , " he added .
McCain on Monday blamed Obama for the increasingly brutal tone on the trail .
Watch McCain address Florida voters »
" Sen . Obama 's been saying some pretty nasty things about Gov. Palin and me , " he said .
" ... That 's OK .
He can attack if he wants , but all the insults in the world are n't going to bring change to Washington , " he said in Jacksonville , Florida .
Obama 's running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , also hammered McCain 's message of change at an event in St. Clair Shores , Michigan .
Biden , one of McCain 's decades - long Senate colleagues , accused the Arizona senator of being a " sequel " to President Bush 's two terms .
" We 've seen this movie before , " Biden said .
" And we know , the sequel is always worse than the original . "
Watch Biden slam McCain »
" If you 're ready for four more years of George Bush , then John McCain is your guy , " he said , adding that " McCain could easily become known as ' Bush 44 , ' " a reference to Bush being the 43rd U.S. president .
The speech marked Biden 's second visit to Michigan since being selected as Obama 's running mate .
The speech on domestic issues is one of two framing speeches Biden will deliver before the fall debates .
The second will be on foreign policy next week .
Biden , a senator from Delaware , also argued that McCain is " profoundly out of touch " with the issues that average Americans face .
He charged that the only thing that has changed about McCain is the type of campaign he is running .

" When someone running for election changes his views to satisfy the base of the party , that 's not change , that 's just more of the same Washington game , " Biden said .
Biden also addressed the negative tone the race has taken in recent days , arguing that it is because the staff that McCain has hired is the same team Bush used against McCain to launch " unconscionable , scurrilous attacks " in the 2000 race .
" The campaign a person runs tells you everything about the way they 'll govern , " Biden said .
" The McCain - Palin campaign decided to bet the house on the politics perfected by [ former Bush adviser ] Karl Rove . "
Biden said he considers McCain his close friend and someone who has served the country bravely , but added , " America needs more than a brave soldier .
They need a wise leader . "
Obama 's campaign released a new ad Monday that accuses McCain of " deception . "
" What happened to John McCain ? " asks the announcer in the 30 - second spot , " Honor . "
The ad quotes commentators calling the Arizona senator 's ads " vile " and filled with " dishonest smears " from a " disgraceful , dishonorable campaign . "
" After voting with Bush 90 percent of the time , proposing the same disastrous economic policies ... it seems ' deception ' is all he 's got left , " says the announcer .
The McCain campaign quickly responded .
" As Americans face economic uncertainty , it is clear that Barack Obama would sooner hurl insults than discuss his record of seeking higher taxes during a down economy , opposing additional off - shore drilling to reduce energy prices and voting the partisan line nearly 100 percent of the time , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
" This latest ad by Barack Obama is a desperate effort to move away from talking about his thin , but alarming record on the issues , and it is n't going to reform Washington or strengthen our economy . "
CNN 's Alexander Marquardt and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .

A host of commentators explained how it was inevitable they would win : " exceptional case ... small group ... concentration of power ... strategic weak spot ... essential resource ... "
Essential bollocks !
No one claimed inevitable victory before the strike ( or it would n't have happened , would it ? )
The point is that the Shell drivers fought .
They got great solidarity from their fellow tanker drivers from other companies who , in defiance of anti trade union laws , refused to cross picket lines .
When the employers tried to use the law , they realised that for once the union was not going to back down .
The oil trade sector emergency conference called by Unite in London to organise solidarity for the Shell drivers turned into a celebration of their victory .
Unite officials made it clear that despite some writs being served against drivers this was a battle they were determined to win .
One thing that sent the oil barons a message was when the stewards from Grangemouth booked flights to London for the meeting - they and other stewards right across the industry were offering solidarity action , whether or not the employers thought it lawful .
The bosses got the message : the union was not going to blink .
They caved in .
Within hours government ministers were called on to interrupt their Mansion House banquet to pontificate on the dangers of this settlement and remind us of the need to tighten our belts to fight inflation .
They are petrified by the implications .
On the back of the Shell tanker drivers ' victory , Unison officials have said they want to reopen negotiations on their pay deal in the health service next year if inflation keeps going up - everything is up for grabs .
Since I came into this industry I have seen the gross train weight of heavy goods vehicles go from 32 to 38 , now 44 tonnes .
The effective pay load ( what the boss gets paid for carrying ) has gone from about 16 tonnes per lorry to between 28 and 29 tonnes .
My working day was limited to 12.5 hours , of which only eight could be driving .
Now it can be up to 15 hours , of which ten can be behind the wheel .
My pay then , 25 years ago , was about £ 240 for a 60 - hour week .
My take home pay last week for 60 - hours was £ 390 .
That is what moderation leads to : shit wages .
The big difference between me , in general haulage dock work , and the tanker drivers is not one of skill , not one of dedication or productivity .
The difference is they are near 100 percent unionised , we are 20 to 30 percent unionised .
At last our union intends to generalise the lessons of the tanker drivers right across road haulage .
The bosses are always whinging that their profits are squeezed by high fuel costs , never more so than the last six months .
It costs no more per mile to drive a petrol tanker than any other lorry and I do n't notice Shell going bankrupt .
The truth is that for years the bosses have been stabbing each other in the back and rate cutting and subsidising the industry through our low wages .
I hope that the Shell drivers have smashed this argument for good .
The case is becoming incontrovertible .
There is a massive anger growing from the grassroots of the union movement .
Tony Woodley said this was the biggest political fight the union has been involved in since Rover in 2000 ; the GMB union cut funding to 35 Labour MPs ; and the CWU intend to ballot the membership on funding the Labour Party .
All these suggest a tectonic shift in the political consciousness of our class .
The battle is now on to provide a real political alternative .
Everybody loves a winner , so I guess tanker drivers are going to be the flavour of the month .
Let 's just hope that the lessons are learnt by every hospital domestic , refuse collector , office cleaner and civil service worker .
This is not a special case argument .
This is not an argument about an " aristocracy of labour " .
This is a good old - fashioned class battle - and the bosses lost .
That is the significance of the tanker drivers ' dispute .
Roll on the trucking fightback .

( CNN ) -- Authorities in a northern Malaysian city have forbidden Muslim women from wearing bright lipstick and noisy high - heeled shoes , saying the directive is intended to prevent sexual assaults and " illicit sex . "
The national news agency , Bernama , said the directive was issued by the municipal council of Kota Baru and is aimed toward Muslim women working in restaurants and other businesses in the city .
It said the ban will safeguard the morals and dignity of the women as well as thwart rape .
" It states that Muslim women are forbidden to wear thick make - up , like bright colored lipstick and high - heeled shoes that gave a tapping sound , " the news agency said .
" For those who insist on wearing high heel shoes , they can do so but with rubber heels . "
Kota Baru already has a directive calling for Muslim women to wear non-transparent headscarves that cover the chest , long - sleeved and loose blouses and socks .
Anyone not following the regulations can be fined up to 500 ringgit ( $ 153 ) , Bernama said .
Malaysia , a multi-racial society containing many ethnic groups , considers itself a moderate Muslim country .
Muslims comprise about 60 percent of the population .
Buddhists , Christians and Hindus who also make up the religious make up of the country do not face restrictions on clothing or practices .
The city of Kota Baru is the capital of of Kelantan state , which is ruled by the hard - line opposition party , Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party ( PAS ) .
At one time , the party advocated for an Islamic state , but has backed away from the stance in recent months .
PAS was part of a loose coalition of opposition parties that won control of five of the country 's 13 states in national elections held in March 2008 .
The coalition also won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats -- making it only the second time in the southeast Asian country 's history that the ruling party has failed to gain the two - thirds majority needed to amend the constitution .

Ryan shares this delicious summer dish for all of us to enjoy .
Start out by washing and halving your Roma tomatoes .
After halving them , gut out the insides ( seeds , etc. ) with a spoon .
Sprinkle a bit of kosher salt inside each tomato .
Discard guts and lay the halved , gutted tomatoes face down on a clean towel .
Chop up your herbs and garlic and mix with the Ricotta cheese .
Add salt and pepper to taste .
Next , fill each tomato half with a nice heap of the Ricotta mixture .
In a food processor ( or if you do n't have a food processor , you can mash in a plastic baggy with a rolling pin ) crumble about 15 - 20 Ritz crackers .
Or you can use dried bread crumbs from your favorite kind of bread if you want .
Press each ricotta filled tomato half face down into the crackers / crumbs and then place face up on a baking sheet .
Drizzle each tomato with a bit of olive oil .
Place in 400 º oven for 25 - 30 minutes .

Hi , guys .
It ’s P - Dub .
In Austin .
And because he knew I was nine hours away from my kitchen on the ranch so that I may care for for my newly lactating kid sister and her baby , Pastor Ryan swooped in and saved the day by sending along this delicious summer dish for us all to enjoy .
I love it when people save the day !
I try to surround myself with those types as much as I can .
Thank you , Pastor Ryan , for picking up the slack while I traipse around Austin and eat sushi .
Hey , everyone — it ’s Ryan .
Our journey toward more good grub begins in the garden today .
I ’ve been trying to grow some fruits , vegetables , and herbs for the first time this year , and it ’s been a blast .
So let ’s see…how about some fresh Parsley today ?
A handful should do .
And some Basil ?
A handful of that , too .
And we ca n’t have Roasted Ricotta Romas without the Roma tomatoes …
Not quite ripe yet .
Well … you ca n’t win ’em all .
Truth be told , I ’ve been waiting and waiting for our tomatoes to ripen and it just has n’t happened yet .
Looks like storebought will have to do this time .
We ’re also going to need some Ricotta cheese , a ginormous clove of garlic , some cracker crumbs ( because I ’m out of bread crumbs ) , and of course some salt , pepper , and olive oil .
First things first :
We ’ll get started by cutting our Roma tomatoes in half lengthwise .
How many , you ask ?
Well , that ’s entirely up to you .
I ’m going to be using eight tomatoes today .
This will make 16 halves .
Yes , I ’m a math whiz .
And speaking of numbers – let ’s get our oven set to 400° .
Once you ’ve got your Romas sliced in half , it ’s time to find your favorite tomato - gutting device .
Mine happens to be this titanium spork .
Do n’t laugh .
A true sign of manliness is owning a titanium spork .
Ask any man and he ’ll agree .
Now you ’re going to take your titanium spork , or whatever lesser tomato - gutting device you might have , and scoop out the insides of the tomato leaving the external “ shell ” in tact .
Repeat this process approximately fifteen times until you ’ve made an impressive mess .
Sprinkle the inside of each tomato with some salt ( kosher is best ) and then transfer them , face down , to a clean towel .
This will help pull some of the excess moisture out of the tomatoes while we prepare the filling .
Remember our Parsley and Basil ?
Good …we would n’t want to forget them .
It ’s time for mincing .
Have you ever seen one of these babies ?
It ’s called a double - bladed mincing knife and it serves almost no purpose whatsoever .
But it ’s fun to use every now and then .
Mince !
Let ’s do the same with some garlic .
This time I have fresh garlic , but it ’s …not quite normal .
It ’s ginormous .
It ’s called Elephant Garlic and it ’s about 5 - 10 times the size of a regular clove of garlic .
It ’s flavor is n’t quite as strong either .
Normally I would just use regular garlic for this , but what the heck — you use what you have , right ?
How about a size comparison next to one of those Roma tomatoes ?
I told you it was huge !
If you ’re using regular garlic , start off with a few cloves .
Use more if you love the stuff .
Here ’s everything , all minced up .
At this point it ’s time for our Ricotta .
Did you know that the word Ricotta means “ twice cooked ” or “ recooked ” in Italian ?
Some cool facts about Ricotta can be found — –>
Here .
An easy way to measure out how much Ricotta we ’ll need is to simply use one spoonful of Ricotta for each tomato half we have .
Here ’s a little more than a tablespoon and I ’ll repeat this process approximately fifteen times .
Once we ’ve got our Ricotta measured out , we ’ll hit it with a good dose of freshly ground pepper and a couple of good sized pinches of kosher salt .
Ricotta is typically unsalted , so be generous here .
Add in the herbs and garlic and give it a good mix until we have a filling that looks something like this :
Now grab one of those tomatoes and spork your filling into it like so :
Repeat this step approximately fifteen times .
And now for the final touch , we ’re going to need a crust on top .
I ’m out of bread crumbs so I ’ve decided to use up a leftover half - sleeve of buttery Ritz crackers .
Blend , crush , smash , pulverize these tasty crackers until we ’ve got a good breading .
Next , we ’re going to plop our Ricotta - filled tomatoes face down into the cracker crumbs for a nice coating .
Repeat this process approximately fifteen times and lay out those ‘ maters on a sheet pan .
I like to hit each tomato top with a drizzle of olive oil .
Now , just toss your sheet pan full of stuffed tomatoes into a 400° oven and wait for the smells to arrive .
It should take around 25 - 30 minutes for golden - brown deliciousness to occur .
Mmmm .
Check ’em out .
Oooh la la .
{ Faints}
Now toss some more herbs on top for shameless beauty points .
{ Faints again}
Well folks …it ’s been fun , but I ’ve got to go .
Someone ’s gotta eat all these .
Enjoy !
Despite the focus on the housing crisis , gasoline prices and the economy in general , the press has not done a good job capturing the intense economic anxiety  and even dread , in some cases  that has gripped tens of millions of working Americans , including many who consider themselves solidly middle class .
Working families are not just changing their travel plans and tightening up on purchases at the mall .
There is real fear and a great deal of suffering out there .
A man who described himself as a conscientious worker who has always pinched his pennies wrote the following to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont :
“ This winter , after keeping the heat just high enough to keep my pipes from bursting ( the bedrooms are not heated and never got above 30 degrees ) I began selling off my woodworking tools , snowblower , ( pennies on the dollar ) and furniture that had been handed down in my family from the early 1800s , just to keep the heat on .
“ Today I am sad , broken , and very discouraged .
I am thankful that the winter cold is behind us for a while , but now gas prices are rising yet again .
I just ca n’t keep up . ”
In a parallel world , we dream of hitting the gym every day and break a sweat doing our favourite exercises .
However , sometimes life gets the better of us , and we ’re not able to hit the gym .
We ’re here to tell you that this does not mean you cannot stay fit at home .
Doing some basic everyday tasks can boost your fitness levels in the ways you ca n’t even imagine .
Here are few of such fitness activities that you can try immediately at your house .
Shopping
This can excite many shopping enthusiasts .
Yes , shopping is a form of exercise that can increase your fitness level .
Why ?
Because it involves walking around .
Imagine you ’re shopping for clothes or grocery at a mall ; you walk a considerable amount of distance that increases your metabolic rate .
A walk around a shopping mall can burn up to 200 calories per hour .
Now you know where to go if you feel your fitness levels going down .
Cleaning
Whether you ’re vacuuming the floor , cleaning the dust or sweeping , you have some movement in your body that can burn quickly up to 150 calories per hour .
Practising these activities every day not only keeps your house clean but also boosts your fitness levels .
Shovelling the snow
In countries where it often snows , you know how much of a task it can be to clear the snow in the area .
Shovelling off the snow is an aerobic activity that increases the strength of your hand muscles and keeps you fit .
On average it burns up to 200 calories per hour .
Taking the stairs
We all know the benefits of taking the stairs over an elevator , but hardly a handful of them put it to practice .
It works your glutes and hamstrings , whilst burning a massive amount of calories .
Could n’t hit the gym on a leg day ?
You can make it up by taking the stairs wherever you go , work , school , apartment or your own house .
Gardening
Gardening is an underrated activity that most people neglect or “ get it done ” by a gardener .
It involves getting your hands dirty and also planting the seeds and watering , that includes a good amount of walking around and strength .
Gardening regularly not only refreshes your mind but also increases your fitness levels in the long run .
Commuting
We get it if you ca n’t walk to the office , college or school .
But one thing you can practice every day is parking your car or bike a little away from your destination and get that 10 - minute walk .
In this busy schedule and fast - paced life , we hardly have time to walk for 30 minutes every day .
If you can make this a habit , the results can pay off in the long run .
Another alternative is to cycle to work or college every day .
It is an aerobic exercise that can increase your strength and stamina .
Conclusion
If you ’re not able to hit the gym or get enough physical activity every day , you can include the steps mentioned above in your routine and immediately notice the difference in your fitness levels .
The tiny present wrapped inside a slightly larger box , put into a yet - bigger box , and so on , may be a good joke for a birthday or Christmas  but the packaging of many household goods is almost as bad .
One - third of American garbage is packaging materials , according to the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington .
And there 's not necessarily a good reason for it .
Many companies are simply following convention and have n't looked into better ways to package their products , says Terry Grist of the EPA .
Overcrowded landfills are not the only problem associated with excessive packaging .
Simply manufacturing the packaging uses energy and creates pollutants , says Mr. Grist .
Not only is minimal packaging better for the environment , it also costs less to produce .
" Companies can save a lot of money when they reduce packaging , " Grist says .
But to keep excessive packaging from clogging landfills , consumers also need to be alert when they buy products .
Here are a few ways to reduce packaging waste :
 Avoid snacks and other foods wrapped in individual serving sizes .
Instead , buy bigger bags of the snacks and put smaller servings in paper bags .
 Instead of putting a juice box in your child 's lunch bag , buy juice concentrate , mix it in a reusable container , and send a thermos with the lunch .
 Make your own " lunchables . "
Rather than purchasing the prepackaged version , buy a block of cheese , some sandwich meat , and crackers .
 Buy personal hygiene and home - cleaning products in bulk when possible .
 Buy cereal in bags instead of boxes , which usually contain bags inside .
 Buy loose fruits and vegetables instead of those packaged in Styrofoam trays and shrink - wrap .
Fix your own fresh - fruit cups instead of buying cut - up fruit in plastic containers .
 Avoid buying products packaged in blister packs ( molded plastic attached to cardboard . )
Although sometimes blister packs serve a hygienic purpose ( making sure cosmetics or medicines are n't tampered with , for instance ) , they are often unnecessary .
 When you buy clothing in a department store or boutique , ask that the clerk not wrap the garments in tissue paper .
 Ask for loose stamps at the post office instead of prepackaged books .
 Buy concentrates when possible .
Many juices , soups , and cleaning agents are available in concentrate .
 Use fewer individual serving - size bottles of water and juices .
 Buy milk and juice in glass or plastic containers , which can be recycled .
Some of the waxed cardboard containers with plastic spouts cannot be recycled .
Enlarge By Dan MacMedan , USA TODAY Smile : Brian Wilson 's concept album That Lucky Old Sun arrives Tuesday .
" I always liked that song , " he says of the title track , a 1949 hit by Frankie Laine .
Enlarge BEVERLY HILLS  Brian Wilson 's new sun-splashed throwback to the fun , fun , fun '60s started inauspiciously with an even earlier touchstone .
" I always liked that song , " he says of That Lucky Old Sun , first popularized in 1949 by Frankie Laine .
" A couple of years ago , I went to the record store , got Louis Armstrong 's version , brought it home and learned it .
I rearranged it and taught it to my band . "
TIMELINE : Take in the key events in Brian Wilson 's life Wilson 's version became the title track of his critically hailed concept album , in stores today .
Part travelogue and part autobiography , the collection functions as a valentine to Southern California that revisits the singer 's blissful Beach Boys history while also dipping into its darker chasms .
It 's a conceptual cousin to 2004 's long - dormant Smile , which arrived in Billboard at No. 13 , the highest entry for a Wilson or Beach Boys studio disc since 15 Big Ones in 1976 .
It also marks a return to Beach Boys springboard Capitol Records , which anticipates healthy sales and is giving Lucky a high - profile launch .
Nostalgia pervades such L.A. snapshots as Forever She 'll Be My Surfer Girl , California Role and spoken interludes written by Van Dyke Parks , Wilson 's Smile collaborator .
The mood downshifts on Going Home , when Wilson reveals , " At 25 , I turned out the light ' cause I could n't handle the glare in my tired eyes . "
Despite Lucky 's moments of difficult candor , Wilson tackled the project with reborn vitality and imagination , sparked largely by his completion of Smile .
Crafting Lucky " brought up a lot of happy and exciting memories , " he says .
" But there was a little pain involved in squeezing out these songs . "
In Oxygen to the Brain , he sings : " How could I have got so low / I 'm embarrassed to tell you so / I laid around this old place / I hardly ever washed my face . "
And in Midnight 's Another Day : " Took the diamond from my soul and turned it back into coal / All these voices , all these memories , made me feel like stone . "
Though other tunes are breezy and upbeat , Midnight 's Another Day is a personal favorite because " I feel the meaning of the lyrics .
I can really relate to that line about feeling loneliness even though I 'm with people . "
Wilson 's past is familiar to even casual fans .
A string of bouncy beach hits ( Surfer Girl ; I Get Around ; Help Me , Rhonda ; Fun , Fun , Fun ) , followed by " pocket symphony " Good Vibrations and 1966 masterpiece Pet Sounds , which inspired The Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
Then the doubt - doomed Smile , shelved for 37 years .
A three - year bedroom retreat .
The deaths of brothers Dennis in 1983 and Carl in 1998 .
Wilson 's ouster from the band and feud with cousin Mike Love .
Drugs , mental illness , paranoia , isolation , burnout .
" I should have passed on the LSD and marijuana and all that , " he says .
" It kind of screwed my mind up . "
Positive environment
These days , he ping - pongs between gloom and cheer .
Heavily medicated for schizoaffective disorder , he occasionally hears voices or dreads getting out of bed but usually greets the day with boyish enthusiasm .
Mention of his age , 66 , elicits a hearty " Right on ! " " I can still create music , " he says .
" I 'm surprised .
I did n't think I 'd still be this interested . "
Lingering anxieties now compete with a host of positive forces .
He has been happily married for 13 years to Melinda Ledbetter ( " A beautiful gal ! " ) .
They live in a posh two - story home in a gated hillside enclave with their three children : Daria , 11 , Delanie , 10 , and Dylan , 4 .
( Wilson says he seldom sees daughters Carnie , 40 , and Wendy , 38 , from his first marriage . )
He flashes a crooked smile when the family 's pack of 15 dogs — most of them Yorkies , Maltese and poodles — erupts in a chorus of yaps from the patio .
" We love dogs ! " he says brightly , sinking into a sofa and planting his feet , in brown Louis Vuitton loafers , on a coffee table .
" I did n't have pets as a kid . "
Nor , perhaps , enough encouragement , his wife surmises .
" He needs a positive environment , " she says .
" It 's improved his mental state to be with a band that respects him and has such a clear understanding of who he is .
Now he can be creative and not worry about the fallout .
" Based on his disorder , he 'll always feel pressure , " she says .
" It 's something we control by medication and visits to his doctor .
But if he has a bad week , it 's nothing like it was in the past .
I mean , here 's a guy who went to bed for years .
He 's better because he gets all this positive reinforcement from his family , his bandmates , the music community .
" He never realized what he meant to anybody . "
Finishing Smile unleashed buried creative impulses and boosted his self - esteem , she says .
" Everything opened up .
If he 's not making music , he 's not happy .
He did an incredible job on ( Lucky ) .
It 's uplifting , funny .
It makes you cry .
It has every emotion you could wish for .
It 's a way to tell fans what happened to him all these years . "
' He 's still got it '
Lucky got rolling when Wilson and multi-instrumentalist Scott Bennett began composing and recording 18 demos , including a version of Good Kind of Love with Carole King that did n't make the final cut .
Bennett , who joined Wilson 's band after playing guitar on 1998 's Imagination , had seldom been summoned to collaborate the preceding eight years .
" Then Brian got amped and called every day , " he says .
" He liked my small apartment and studio , my studio being a computer and two microphones . "
Revamped for a stage commission by London 's Royal Festival Hall , That Lucky Old Sun had its world premiere there a year ago in six sold - out concerts .
The 10 - song piece with narrated breaks was then recorded .
" The whole thing kept evolving , and I was nervous at every turn that it was losing the charm of the demos , " says Bennett , who thwarted a Phil Spector - esque bloat by mixing the tracks himself .
He also wrote the bulk of the lyrics .
Wilson did n't alter a syllable .
" Brian told me , ' It 's like you 're in my brain . '
Writing as if I 'm Brian was tricky .
It has to be interesting but not so clever that a 66 - year - old guy goes , ' What 's this ? '
" We kept a lot of Brian 's lyrics .
He wrote the lion 's share of the vibe of Oxygen , " he adds .
" It was invaluable to have him address his lost chapters . "
Bennett quickly learned that Wilson functioned best as the alpha male and that his composing and arranging gifts have n't faded .
When Bennett was at an impasse , Wilson 's change of key " was like driving into a vat of butter , " he says .
" That 's the money chord .
He 's still got it . "
Energy and love
So when Wilson pushed for soapy sentimentality in Southern California , Bennett relented .
" It seemed OK to go out in an overtly nostalgic way , " he says .
" He should celebrate his triumphs .
He 's had some dark times , but he 's got phenomenal songs that are going to live forever .
It 's OK to look back . "
The song recalls boyhood days harmonizing with his brothers .
" I think about them every time I 'm on stage singing our songs .
When I sing God Only Knows , I think of Carl .
When I sing Do You Wanna Dance ?
I think of Dennis .
It 's not a good feeling .
I miss them a lot .
Every now and then , I miss the Beach Boys a little bit . "
He sees no chance for a truce with Mike Love , however , whose 2005 lawsuit argued that the band 's future sales were threatened by a Smile - related promotional CD of Wilson 's re-recorded Beach Boys hits , issued free in the U.K .
The suit , dismissed last year as meritless , " made me not like him , " says Wilson , who lavishes praise on his current 10 - member band .
" I trust my band .
They 're better than any band I 've ever worked with .
I pick up energy from them .
And love . "
They 've helped him overcome stage fright with pep talks and neck rubs , and they relish dipping into his Beach Boys catalog .
He loves the oldies , too , with rare exceptions .
" I do n't like singing the lyrics to Sloop John B , " he says .
" You know : ' Drinking all night , got into a fight . '
It 's not my image .
It makes me uncomfortable .
I'm California , positive , social , cars , good vibes . "
And when bad vibes creep in ?
" I 'm getting better at letting go of bad feelings , " he says .
" I force myself to feel a little better .
I still get scared .
John Lennon was killed , and it makes me feel like someone 's going to kill me . "
Wilson escapes his demons with simple pleasures .
He takes his kids to movies , watches cable news ( " They have really pretty girls " ) , enjoys a steak at Herb Alpert 's Vibrato nearby .
He 's happiest sitting at his piano conjuring fresh melodies .
" It 's harder being Brian Wilson the person than Brian Wilson the solo artist , " he says .
" Being myself is the hardest of all .
I just wake up in the morning and say , ' Uh - oh , another day . '
I try to keep walking every day .
I go to the park by myself and listen to an oldies station on the radio .
My music comes on sometimes .
" It 's a good feeling to have the sun beating down on my neck . "

Terrified residents of Gori are reporting stories of looting Violence has flared up in Georgia , where Russian tanks have been seen patrolling the town of Gori .
People leaving Gori say there is looting going on involving South Ossetian separatists .
A convoy of Russian vehicles has been seen on the road to Georgia 's capital but Russia and a Georgian minister have denied it is heading to Tbilisi .
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , says many buildings have been totally destroyed .
A ceasefire is in place , but it seems to be very fragile , correspondents say .
See map of the region Russian tanks seem to be dismantling and destroying Georgian army bases in Gori , reports the BBC's Gavin Hewitt from just outside the town .
Meanwhile , Russian defence officials said the Russian military had shot down a Georgian spy drone over Tskhinvali , overnight and accused the Georgians of continuing military activities despite the ceasefire deal .
We are determined to act on the ground

French foreign minister France wants EU role in Georgia
Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili told the US network CNN that Russian forces were moving towards Tbilisi and planned to encircle the city .
However , Russia denied reports that its forces were heading that way .
Georgian Deputy Interior Minister Ekaterine Zguladze also said that a convoy of Russian tanks had left Gori but was not heading for the capital .
Foreign ministers from the European Union , speaking in Brussels following emergency talks , expressed broad support for proposals to send EU peacekeepers to the area to supervise the French - brokered ceasefire , after a United Nations resolution is passed .
" We are determined to act on the ground , " said French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said the EU was committed to providing humanitarian aid and assistance with reconstruction once the security situation allowed .
A key element of the peace deal calls for all forces to return to the areas where they were before fighting broke out last week .
Checkpoint
In Gori , there are reports of residents being stripped of their belongings at gunpoint at the entrances to the city .
A pall of smoke hangs over the market , but it is not clear if any more fighting has been going on .
Russian and Georgian armoured vehicles are on the Gori-Tbilisi road Residents have spoken of their houses being torched , and the situation may well be worse in outlying villages , Gavin Hewitt reports .
There is also a Russian checkpoint with two Russian tanks outside Gori on the main road leading into the town from Tbilisi , an eyewitness told the BBC .
But the Russian foreign ministry says it has no Russian troops left in Gori , Reuters news agency reports .
The BBC's Richard Galpin , at a police checkpoint about 20 km from the capital on the Tbilisi - Gori road , said he had seen a column of about 60 Georgian military vehicles , including troop carriers and at least two anti-aircraft guns , heading in the direction of Gori .
A source travelling with the column said it was going into a South Ossetian village .
The Georgians said they were " on a humanitarian mission " .
Wrecked city
In Tskhinvali , the South Ossetian capital , the main offices of the local administration are a blackened shell , our correspondent reports .
There are apartment buildings all around with smashed windows , with bullet and shrapnel damage and gaping holes where there used to be windows .
Two Georgian tanks stand on a square near what was the main base of Russian peacekeepers .
Residents who are out trying to clear their wrecked homes say they have no water and no electricity .
Tskhinvali itself is under Russian control now and there are no reports of any serious fighting , but there is no confirmation as to when the Russian troops will withdraw , a Russian military spokesman said .
The US - based group Human Rights Watch said staff who were in South Ossetia on Tuesday had seen ethnic Georgian villages still burning from fires set by South Ossetian militias and witnessed looting by armed militia members .
" The remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic Georgian villages are facing desperate conditions , with no means of survival , no help , no protection , and nowhere to go , " spokeswoman Tanya Lokshina said .
Human Rights
Watch also spoke to ethnic South Ossetian women who had spent several days in the woods after fleeing with children and elderly relatives when Georgian troops entered their village .
Some 100,000 people are estimated to have been displaced by the conflict , which has created huge tensions in international relations .
The AFP news agency quotes General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy chief of staff of Russia 's armed forces , as saying that in total 74 troops had been killed and 171 wounded , with 19 more missing .

I 've been thinking about my business days problem some more .
And this time I turned to Ruby , a language which I am becoming quite familiar with .
This is my naive implementation of streams in Ruby .
Streams are thus functions .
The actual class name is ' Proc ' , a lambda returns a ' Proc ' .
Each call returns a new value .
As for " filter " , it takes a predicate passed as block .
The filter becomes a " decorator " for the stream .
This is a nice example of closures .
The ' value ' parameters becomes the state for the stream .
Also of note , the use of the variable 'f ' to fake recursion of an anonymous function .
Prints the 20 next business days : Note that my " contract " with stream_from is that what I pass it implements succ .
Here 's an example with integer :
And , of course , filters can be chained .
The next Monday that falls on a 17th :
Here 's the same code as before , but with a function cast as a block : I decided consciously to avoid optimizations here .
It did keep my code short and clean .
Besides , you should only optimize based on need .
There 's much more to streams ... combining streams together , maps , more complicated generation of the next value , etc .
So , here 's your next interview questions : " What 's the first 3 prime numbers after 5,000,000,000 which has a 3 as last digit ?
" I leave the code for " prime ? " to your imagination .
The concept of command - line pipes springs to mind .
One of the reason the command line is so powerful , is that you can combine filters together to perform truly complicated tasks .
Another reason is that each filter does only one thing and does it well .
It 's all about thinking in pipes .
Is it Safe Now to Admit Jimmy Carter Was Right ?
Mr. Wheelan is the author of four books on American presidents and American history , the most recent published in January , Mr. Adams 's Last Crusade : John Quincy Adams 's Extraordinary Post - Presidential Life in Congress .
Misunderstood , mocked , and maligned , the 39th president ( 1977 - 81 ) will forever be associated with the Iranian hostage crisis and the botched rescue attempt ; the human rights - inspired Olympic boycott and grain embargo ; inflation ; the infamous rabbit attack ; and , above all , skyrocketing fuel prices .
Americans , who hate to be told they must change , roundly condemned Jimmy Carter ’s memorable “ Crisis of Confidence ” speech of July 15 , 1979 .
In it , Carter outlined a program for achieving energy independence : “ On the battlefield of energy we can win for our nation a new confidence , and we can seize control again of our common destiny . ”
We admirers have long endured ridicule whenever we dared to defend Carter ’s prescient plan for reducing U.S. dependence on oil .
But today , after all the abuse and scorn heaped on Jimmy Carter and his supporters , we find ourselves paying more than $ 4 a gallon at the pump to fill our hulking gas guzzlers .
It turns out that Carter was right after all .
He was right in seeking to raise the fleet auto mileage standard to 48 miles per gallon by 1995 .
( Even U.S. automakers admitted at the time that they could easily achieve 30 mph by 1985 . )
Jimmy Carter was right in exhorting Americans to turn down their thermostats , even if he did look nerdy in a cardigan while urging us to do so .
In his July 1979 speech , he was right when he said , “ I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States .
Beginning this moment , this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 — never . ”
That worthy goal quickly went by the board .
He was right to encourage fuel conservation by proposing a 50 - cents - per - gallon tax on gasoline and a fee on imported oil — in effect , a floor for fuel prices .
Invoking the pioneering spirit of the 1960s ’ moon mission , he was right to recommend a tax on windfall oil profits to finance a crash program to develop affordable synthetic fuels .
Jimmy Carter was correct , too , in setting a goal of obtaining 20 percent of our energy from solar power by the year 2000 .
We balked , and his energy program , which was new and demanding , shriveled up and died .
When oil prices began declining in the 1980s , the justification for change vanished altogether .
The Reagan administration junked the proposed 1995 mileage standard and the rest of the Carter agenda .
Amazingly , amid today ’s record gasoline prices , Congress even now does n’t quite get it .
It was only last December that Congress approved new mileage standards , the first in 32 years .
If they stand , the present fleet standard of 27.5 mpg will rise to 35 mpg — but not until 2020 .
Our leaders ’ idea of promoting alternative energy is touting future , non-existent technologies , and that false savior , ethanol .
Ethanol consumes nearly as much fuel to make as it produces , while collaterally raising food prices and damaging the environment .
The latest panacea is drilling in the Arctic and offshore , a short - term solution of dubious value that is wildly popular among oilmen and congressmen up for re-election , and in the Bush administration — which evidently hopes to use high gasoline prices as a wedge for opening off - limits areas to exploration for its Big Oil constituency .
Meanwhile , Congress has failed to take the simple step of renewing federal tax credits for wind and solar power that will expire at year ’s end .
Every week of congressional foot - dragging on renewing the tax credits further dries up venture capital for critical solar and projects .
Why is Congress deadlocked over this critical issue ?
How have our perceived options become so narrow and skewed ?
It is because without any public debate , a de facto U.S. energy policy has evolved and is now in place : to cling ever tighter to our oil - based economy and its lucrative profits for the scions of the status quo , and to marginalize all who are not on board with this .
And now we are in the exact bind that Jimmy Carter tried to prevent three decades ago , when we were reeling from the concussive effects of oil supply disruptions in 1973 and 1979 .
Acting with promptness difficult to fathom today , our elected leaders then enacted year - around Daylight Savings Time , dropped the speed limit to 55 , and established government price controls .
And , oh so fleetingly , we downsized what we drove .
All gone .
Consequently , the United States last year imported 3.6 billion barrels of oil , three times the 1.2 million barrels imported in 1973 .
We not only are consuming record amounts of oil , we import nearly 60 percent of it , about 13 million barrels per day .
In 1977 , U.S. oil imports totaled 8.5 million barrels a day , or 46 percent of consumption .
Remember , under Carter ’s energy plan we were to hold the line at the 1977 oil import figure , in barrels .
Had we done this , the percentage of U.S. oil imported today would be around 40 percent .
Additional savings from Carter ’s conservation and his alternative energy and synthetic fuel programs would surely have cut oil imports even further .
But it happened so fast , we say .
One hundred years ago , historian Henry Adams , in explaining his “ Law of Acceleration , ” observed that technological change occurs at an ever - quickening pace throughout history .
“ A law of acceleration , definite and constant as any law of mechanics , cannot be supposed to relax its energy to suit the convenience of man . ”
Today , change occurs at such blinding speeds that the rise and fall of technologies and nations happen in a single lifetime .
An energy crisis is again upon us .
Soaring gasoline prices and oil imports are daggers aimed at the heart of our stumbling economy .
It is time to give Jimmy Carter ’s proposals a second hearing .
This is what he said in July 1979 : “ You know we can do it .
We have the natural resources .
We have more oil in our shale alone than several Saudi Arabias .
We have more coal than any nation on Earth .
We have the world 's highest level of technology .
We have the most skilled work force , with innovative genius , and I firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war . ”

Bob Benjamin - 7/16/2008 your article on Carter suggesting that if we had followed his advice we would not be in the situation we are today is so wrong .
First , I like the first statement because that does suggest that we should of been drilling more as demand increased over the years to a point of producing half of the oil we used .
However , living during those times and remembering Jimmy Carter he would of meant that we cut our usage to meet the 50 % mark .
His second suggestion that we put a major effort into alternatives was done , just maybe not to the degree needed .
Those are both good statements .
However , it is the rest of the suggestions that are very disagreeable to me .
First " He was right in seeking to raise the fleet auto mileage standard to 48 miles per gallon by 1995 .
( Even U.S. automakers admitted at the time that they could easily achieve 30 mph by 1985 . ) "
Putting requirements on auto manufactures increase the costs of those manufactures .
Those costs are passed on to consumers .
Additional costs by corporations are handled in two ways .
Raise prices on what you are selling ( causing the consumer to pay more for their car ) , settled for less profits ( which shareholders will not like and that hurts everyone who has invested in them ) , or lay off workers ( again hurts the consumer .
Even with that not happening to the degree Carter wished , GM is close to selling themselves to foreign investors because they can not make it .
So great idea lets give them more constraints .
Next , " Invoking the pioneering spirit of the 1960s ’ moon mission , he was right to recommend a tax on windfall oil profits to finance a crash program to develop affordable synthetic fuels . "
This was tried and there was a Windfall profits tax which during the time imposed was estimated to bring in an additional 300 MM and ended up only bring in 85 mm .
Why because consumers with their good common sense stopped consuming as much because pricing was getting to high .
Supply / Demand equation works when prices go up , demand goes down .
economics 101 .
Next , Requiring Utilities to get 50 % of their power from alternative sources . "
This is the best , Could you imagine what our utility bills would look like if that was done .
WOW , that would of raised costs through the roof .
You suggest in your article that wind power tax credits are slow to come about .
MAybe that is because wind power is extremely inefficient .
Read up on it .
For this to be a viable solution , their has to be wind and lots of it .
Then it would have to be stored for those many days there is no wind .
There is currently no way to build an energy source large enough to hold that wind power so that it can be stored .
So we would need fossil fuel , or oil in reserve to power what was not being consumed .
Dont think that solves the problem .
Getting tired of writing , but it makes sense to drill now and develop alternates now .
As you rightly said ethanol is not the answer , that is just one side of congress who has their own agenda and the americans they serve are not their concern .
Drilling in off - shore and the artic are sensible since it is a sure bet , contigencies should be giving credits to other sources so in time they can be proven to be useful as replacements , but in the mean time we are sure .
New technologies allow for this to be done in a environmentally safe way .
Arnold Shcherban - 7/13/2008
The real truth is that J. Carter as ALL American presidents ( the Right 's darling Reagan included ) made small and big mistakes ( small and big evil things ) along with small and
big correct things .
As far as the US oil dependence and policy in Mid-East are concerned Carter made no more , perhaps even less , mistakes than any other US president after the WWII , considering
the fact that ALL of them were the conductors of Pax Americana policies , just a bit more or less aggressive .
Raul A Garcia - 7/10/2008
While in college in the early 70's I read a popular mechanics article on a great simple device to improve gas mileage on almost any vehicle .
What a shame this happened only incrementally via a number of compromises between the auto co.'s and the government .
The cars are cleaner tis true but there are so many more of them .
The traffic is universally bad .
I have taken to walking more .
I will not relinquish my pickup truck I am a big man - but I use it selectively now .
The road is less romantic for sure .
I actually drive the speed limit !
Ross Kiser - 7/8/2008
Of course , there are some liberals who would like to see industrial civilization grind to a halt .
I think it was Paul Erhlich , who has been erroneously predicting for years that we would run out of resources , who said that a clean , cheap source of energy is like giving a child a machine gun .
Robert Lee Gaston - 7/8/2008
A stopped clock is right twice a day .
Jimmy Carter may have been right once in four years .
That oil is a finite asset controlled by unstable governments that may not have good relations with the United States was first expressed in my lifetime by President Eisenhower .
This was in a speech announcing the “ Atoms for Peace ” program .
Here , Jimmy said nothing new .
Jimmy Carter and the congress let a bad movie set nuclear powered electrical generation back in this country by three decades .
About all Carter did was establish DOE and talk .
I would guess the number of kilowatts of electricity and the number of barrels of oil produced by the DOE is fairly small .
Elliott Aron Green - 7/8/2008
Mike , can you enlighten me as to when Carter ever complained about the lack of human rights in Saudi Arabia or Iraq or the Persian Gulf oil princedoms ??
Further , Mike , the US did have a lot of influence over events in Iran .
See the article from about 1981 on this matter by George Lenczowski in the American Spectator .
It 's interesting that at the time of Khomeini 's takeover , the Anerican press was complaining about the Shah 's denial of civil rights , etc .
All these denunciations of the Shah helped bring in Khomeini who showed the world what denial of rights really meant .
I agree with Lawrence Hughes but would add one more peccadillo to carter 's list .
He and his man Friday , Zbigniew Brzezinski [ now advising Sen Obama ] , got the US involved in fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan .
The downside here was the kind of allies that Zbig and jimmy were working with .
One of them was Osama bin Laden .
After 9 - 11 Zbig was asked whether his doings in Afghanistan had been worth it in view of Bin Laden and 9 - 11 .
He answered Yes , pointing to the fall of the USSR .
But his one - time proteges , bin Laden and Co. may be even more dangerous than the Communists were in their day .
So much for carter 's record on peace and human rights .
Gary W. Daily - 7/8/2008 " Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan summed it up when he said of Carter in 1980 , ' Unable to distinguish between our friends and our enemies , he has essentially adopted our enemies ' view of the world . ' "
I 've looked for a source for this quote which is all over the web and have n't found one .
I 'm not interested in turning this thread away from Carter 's energy program , but does anyone know the 1980 context for Moynihan 's ( if he did say this ) statement .
Michael Davis - 7/8/2008
Here , here .
Brazil just discovered two humongous oil fields in the Atlantic .
Too bad we can drill in these areas off our own coast .
Michael Davis - 7/8/2008 Amen .
Do n't worry .
Nuclear will have to be part of our energy future out of pure necessity .
Since the eco libs do n't like coal , which we have gobs of , they have nowhere else to turn .
Wind and solar sure wo n't plug the gap .
Plus wind power has opponents everywhere ( read : the Cape Cod shore . )
Do n't you love it when libs fight among themselves ?
Lucio Benedetto - 7/7/2008
And why do n't you have the courage to mention nuclear power ?
I 'm all for all forms of alternative energy that mention as well .
But we we can't whitewash the fact that Carter promoted the safe use of nuclear power as well , although he was opposed to methods that involved the use of plutonium or recycling , which might encourage the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
Before we turn him into a hero of solar / ethanol , let 's remember that he did not discount the use of nuclear , which Carter 's party now opposes today .
Randll Reese Besch - 7/7/2008
If we had followed Carter 's lead we would have been in much better position today .
More solar and other alternate cleaner technologies and using less instead of more oil .
We knew the car companies could have created more fuel efficient cars much less hybrids and electric only vehicles would have been much more in use and cheaper to run and purchase .
Too bad our Bush / Cheney Axis of Evil are oil men who have no interest in getting off of that teat just yet .
Drill , drill , drill !
Even with many more dry wells these days and having to drill ever deeper to get oil at a higher cost .
Sour crude that costs more to process also ads cost .
Do the math .
Brazil took a different direction though they still have n't gone to solar just yet .
They need to and soon !
Lawrence Brooks Hughes - 7/7/2008
There have been six or eight times since Rockefeller got started when the world thought it was running out of oil , and each time the geologists went out and quickly found lots more .
This will happen again , although presently known reserves can fill current demand for perhaps 200 years at the present rate of consumption .
Apart from that , your description of civilization coming to a schreeching halt without oil would be accurate .
But there is plenty out there , and more atomic power will be generated to extend its life , too , plus gasification of coal .
Relief from wind and solar sources will be too meager to make any difference .
The extraction and use of more oil and gas is the only cost - effective and quick method of returning to a energy situation which does not threaten the end of the world .
clifford j wirth - 7/7/2008
Global oil production is now declining , from 85 million barrels per day to 60 million barrels per day by 2015 .
At the same time demand will increase 14 % .
This is like a 45 % drop in 7 years .
No one can reverse this trend , nor can we conserve our way out of this catastrophe .
Because the demand for oil is so high , it will always be higher than production ; thus the depletion rate will continue until all recoverable oil is extracted .
We are facing the collapse of the highways that depend on diesel trucks for maintenance of bridges , cleaning culverts to avoid road washouts , snow plowing , roadbed and surface repair .
When the highways fail , so will the power grid , as highways carry the parts , transformers , steel for pylons , and high tension cables , all from far away .
With the highways out , there will be no food coming in from " outside , " and without the power grid virtually nothing works , including home heating , pumping of gasoline and diesel , airports , communications , and automated systems .

Carter 's search for a new approach to energy production and consumption demonstrated his grasp of the fundamental challenges that would confront America in the future .
Unfortunately , his successors since 1980 have succumbed to the allure of petroleum .
Sniffing gas is an impediment to clear thought .
John D. Beatty - 7/7/2008
Every president since Nixon has made that same claim in one form or another , and none have been demonstrated to be right yet .
Our " dependence " on foreign petroleum will last as long as the Congress and the Greens want it to last and has absolutely nothing to do with the hallucinations of incompetent peanut farmers .
Mike Schoenberg - 7/7/2008
Another issue that Carter raised was Human Rights , something that he was bashed over the head by the Wall Street Journal and others on the right .
Seems that Bush used this issue as one of the justifications for invading Iraq .
As for Carter and the Shah , how much influence did we really have over there at the end ?
Richard Landes - 7/7/2008 have to agree with Lawrence Brooks .
at a time when Carter is being made a fool of -- a willing useful idiot -- by Hamas , and writing books that are so riddled with errors that they would never get a passing grade from a serious professor , it seems bizarre to say the least to read an article with this title .
surely one can find a voice for sanity in energy conservation and independence other than Carter .
bizarre .
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 September 13
Explanation :
The small , northern constellation Triangulum harbors this magnificent face - on spiral galaxy , M33 .
Its popular names include the Pinwheel Galaxy or just the Triangulum Galaxy .
M33 is over 50,000 light - years in diameter , third largest in the Local Group of galaxies after the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) , and our own Milky Way .
About 3 million light - years from the Milky Way , M33 is itself thought to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy and astronomers in these two galaxies would likely have spectacular views of each other 's grand spiral star systems .
As for the view from planet Earth , this sharp , detailed image nicely shows off M33's blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions that trace the galaxy 's loosely wound spiral arms .
In fact , the cavernous NGC 604 is the brightest star forming region , seen here at about the 1 o'clock position from the galaxy center .
Like M31 , M33's population of well - measured variable stars have helped make this nearby spiral a cosmic yardstick for establishing the distance scale of the Universe .
This post is from the Beautiful Code series .
One of the first concepts that jumped out at me from Beautiful Code concerned false optimizations — that is , something added to the code which should have been an optimization , but as it turns out , actually causes the code to run slower .
As an example , we ’ll look at some code that implements a binary search , from a chapter written by Tim Bray :
package Binary ;
public class Finder {
public static int find ( String [ ] keys , String target ) {
int high = keys .
length ;
int low = - 1 ;
while ( high - low > 1 ) {
int probe = ( low + high ) >>>
1 ;
if ( keys[probe].compareTo( target ) >
0 )
high = probe ;
else
low = probe ;
}
if ( low == - 1 || keys[ low ].compareTo( target ) != 0 )
return - 1 ;
else
return low ;
}
}
if
Some look at my binary - search algorithm and ask why the loop always runs to the end without checking whether it ’s found the target .
In fact , this is the correct behavior ; the math is beyond the scope of this chapter , but with a little work , you should be able to get an intuitive feeling for it — and this is the kind of intuition I ’ve observed in some of the great programmers I ’ve worked with .
Let ’s think about the progress of the loop .
Suppose you have n elements in the array , where n is some really large number .
The chance of finding the target the first time through is 1/n , a really small number .
The next iteration ( after you divide the search set in half ) is 1/( n/2 ) — still small — and so on .
In fact , the chance of hitting the target becomes significant only when you ’re down to 10 or 20 elements , which is to say maybe the last four times through the loop .
And in the case where the search fails ( which is common in many applications ) , those extra tests are pure overhead .
You could do the math to figure out when the probability of hitting the target approaches 50 percent , but qualitatively , ask yourself : does it make sense to add extra complexity to each step of an 0 ( log 2 N ) algorithm when the chances are it will only save a small number of steps at the end ?
The take - away lesson is that binary search , done properly , is a two - step process .
First , write an efficient loop that positions your low and high bounds properly , then add a simple check to see whether you hit or missed .
private final static class URICache {
private final static int LOAD = 6 ;
private String [ ] cache = new String [ LOAD ] ;
private int position = 0 ;
synchronized boolean contains ( String s ) {
for ( int i = 0 ; i < LOAD ; i++ ) {
// Here I 'm assuming the namespace URIs are interned .
//
This is commonly but not always true .
This won't
// break if they have n't been .
Using equals ( ) instead
// of == is faster when the namespace URIs have n't been
// interned but slower if they have .
if ( s == cache [ i ] ) {
return true ;
}
}
return false ;
}
synchronized void put( String s ) {
cache [ position ] = s ;
position ++;
if ( position == LOAD ) position = 0 ;
}
}
As mentioned , this function simply searches through some strings , using the binary search algorithm , and sees if there is a match .
I just quickly read through the code , and did n’t realize — until Bray pointed it out — that there is no explicit check within the loop to see if the match has been made .
One would expect him to add that in , as an optimization , so that when the target is found , the loop could exit , and not bother continuing with its checks .
But as it turns out , that would be a false optimization ; mathematically , the match is likely to be found late enough in the loop that the extrastatements during every execution of the loop would be more of a performance hit than simply letting the loop execute a few more times .
Or , as Tim puts it : Let ’s look at another example .
This is a snippet of code from Elliotte Rusty Harold , from XOM , used in verifying XML documents .
After verifying an XML namespace ( which is a URI ) , it is cached ; when a namespace is encountered , the parser can look in the cache , to see if it has already been verified , and , if so , not bother verifying it again .
This class is the cache Elliotte uses .
This code is fairly simple .
It ’s a helper class used to maintain a list of namespace URIs that have been captured , and a method which will tell you if a URI is in the list or not .
The surprising thing is that the helper class uses a static array , with exactly six items , and if you try to add a seventh , it simply overwrites the first one ( and so on ) .
Why not use a hash map , or a table ?
Something dynamic , which could grow as large as necessary ?
Why a statically - sized array ?
Again , the answer is simple performance , because Elliotte Rusty Harold has seen enough XML documents to know that rarely will any document have more than six namespaces defined in it .
So by using a statically - sized array , instead of something more dynamic , he gets a boost in performance in the majority of cases .
In the case where a document does have more than six namespace URIs , validation will simply take a little longer for that document , because some namespace URIs may have to be verified twice .
( If the parser comes across a URI which has already been verified , but has been overwritten in the cache , then it would have to be re-verified .
Of course , if the URI has n’t been overwritten , it still wo n’t have to be re-verified . )
This was counter - intuitive for me , at first ; it seems like the “ Right Thing ” would be to always make the size of your list dynamic , to deal with as many elements as are necessary .
In fact , at first glance , it almost seems like a rookie developer ’s mistake , to use a statically - sized list .
But in this case , it was done on purpose , and for very good reason .
So again , he ’s not doing something that he does n’t have to do , even though , at first glance , it would seem like an optimization .
Without thinking about it , I ’d have made the size of the array dynamic , so that I ’d never have to verify a URI that had already been verified , but Elliotte thought more deeply about it , and realized that making the code more complex in that manner would not have been an improvement .
And he ’s right ; that array will be accessed much more often than it ’s added to , so he was able to optimize for the majority of cases , with a small potential performance hit in the minority of cases .
This is the story of how an Impeach for Peace organizer ( D. L. Corvin ) was , and hundreds of others were unlawfully arrested on the 4th day of the RNC while protesting with the Anti-War Committee .
D. L. Corvin —
I was arrested for the Misdemeanor charge of “ Presence at an Unlawful Assembly ” last night at the RNC in St. Paul .
The following is my first attempt to describe what happened literally .
At about 7:00 p.m. on Thursday , September 4th , I joined the Anti-War march near the Capital building on the edge of downtown St. Paul .
I had a sign which read “ Neither ( R) eason ( N ) or ( C ) ompassion ” on one side and “ Warning : The Change You Deserve ” with a skull and crossbones on the other .
As I was arriving , somewhere between two and three hundred protesters had already started moving away from their spot at 12th and Cedar , where I understand the police had prevented them from marching into the downtown “ free speech zone ” .
Protesters continued to chant together as we marched .
I filmed events as they happened .
There were a huge number of police officers :
Some on bicycles , some on horseback , some on other vehicles , and many dressed in riot gear .
All attempts to get into the downtown area were cut off by large groups of police officers and their vehicles .
Periodically , the officers would rush ahead of the crowd in trucks , cars , motorcycles , and bicycles ; I assume this was to prevent them from entering downtown .
I was feeling very intimidated , but I wanted to continue to participate in the march .
After about a half hour to forty - five minutes of this , the police started to detonate what looked to me like flash grenades .
Protesters continued to chant “ Whose streets ?
Our streets ! ” and “ The people , united , will never be defeated ! ” I could see a considerable amount of smoke at times , although whether this was from tear gas or something else was unclear to me , and I was able to avoid it .
The blasts from flash grenades intensified sometimes in what appeared to be an effort to reroute the protesters , although no directives were issued about what we should do or how to disperse .
Some of the protesters panicked and started to run .
I heard officers yelling and threatening protesters , including one cop who yelled what sounded to me to be something like “ get down and put your hands on your head or you will be killed . ”
I also heard one say “ Get your hands up or get sprayed . ”
It was hard to hear over the sound of panic and the helicopter overhead .
At this point I was very afraid that I might be assaulted and seriously hurt , but I was not sure what to do , and it was not clear how best to leave the situation .
Some people passed me stating that “ we ’re trying to find a bus ” and noting that they were n’t part of the march .
Later in the evening I would have the chance to talk to a photo journalist who said he had been blocks away from the march , but had been pushed in with it with no way out .
After a little while , when the crowd arrived at Marion Avenue , officers started herding protesters south .
They announced into a megaphone : “ This is an unlawful assembly .
Go southbound or be subject to arrest . ”
What appeared to be flash grenades continued to detonate .
It was around this time that I saw a flash and felt an abrupt impact on my upper right cheek .
I believe that I had been struck with some kind of shrapnel from a flash grenade .
Fortunately , this shrapnel narrowly missed my eye .
I asked another protester if I was bleeding and he said I seemed to be all right .
Finally , police officers they pushed us south onto the I - 94 bridge over Marion near St. Anthony Avenue , where we ran into line of officers in riot gear which stretched across the length of the bridge to the south .
We were completely trapped here .
After some confusion , protesters began to sit down .
Police officers stated clearly through megaphones that we were to put our hands on our heads and that if we were to take them off or stand up , we would be shot .
We were also told that we were all going to be arrested .
After a while , things started to seem somewhat less dangerous .
At this point , I began a long process of waiting .
At around 8:35 , I spoke with ImpeachForPeace.org cofounder Michael Rudolph .
I spoke with him , while holding the phone from a position with my hands on my head , until an officer ordered me to put the phone away at about ten minutes to 9:00 .
I was informed by Mr. Rudolph that the permit for the evening ’s Anti-War March was “ suddenly , arbitrarily and inexplicably shortened to an hour by Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher . ”
Soon started to arrest people , but they seemed to be doing it quite slowly for reasons of which I never became aware .
I was one of the last fifty people or so to be arrested .
I estimate it took about three and a half hours before I was finally put on a police bus .
Protesters sang and talked to pass the time .
Some had medical needs , which as far as I could tell appeared to have been mostly ignored , and others had to use the restroom .
Those that did have to use it were instructed to urinate into plastic bottles ( and some did ) .
I heard from police at one point that a gun had been found on one of the protesters .
An officer also stated that no protesters had assaulted any police officers .
The police officer who cuffed me with plastic bands was somewhat friendly , and he helped me to make some phone calls to significant people before processing me .
He refused , however , to allow me to bring my sign , which remained on the street .
I was photographed , my other possessions were taken , and I was arrested .
After being routed to a bus , where I waited for some time , I was taken to Ramsey County Jail .
I waited there again for quite a while before being taken inside .
I was fingerprinted and my cuffs were removed , and I was finally allowed to urinate .
Subsequently I was placed in a cage with perhaps twenty other protesters .
Over the next several hours , I was moved with other protesters from one cage to another with no obvious pattern .
At around 5:30 a.m. , after about 9 hours of waiting , I was finally released onto the street .
I was able to walk back to my car from here and make phone calls .

Genetic study investigates the origin of the anus
Flatworms feeding on coral MATTHEW OLDFIELD , SCUBAZOO / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
It may not be the sort of thing to discuss over dinner , but research is opening a lively debate on the origin of the anus .
Today , two evolutionary biologists have published genetic evidence in Nature1 that they claim refutes the leading theory of anal evolution .
Their work suggests that the anus may have evolved multiple times in many different organisms , and they propose that , in some lineages , the anus may have formed through a fusion of the gut with the reproductive organs .
The first organisms to benefit from guts got by with just a mouth , through which food went one way and waste the other .
However , as the organisms grew in size and length , having one hole for everything became impractical .
" A long gut makes sorting food and waste through a single opening inefficient , " says Andreas Hejnol , a researcher at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu and one of the study 's authors .
" So they needed to evolve an anus . "
Orifice politics
" The very simple question is how to get from one opening to two , " says Detlev Arendt , a researcher at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg , Germany .
The question may be obvious , but it is not easy to answer .
Punching a new hole on the opposite end from the mouth is unlikely from an evolutionary standpoint , says Arendt .
So he and others have suggested that over time , the mouth elongated and then separated into a mouth and anus .
Once the body included a gut with two ends , the anus could migrate to the far end of animal .
“ The issue remains open . ” Detlev Arendt
EMBL
Hejnol and his co-author Mark Martindale , also at the University of Hawaii , think otherwise .
They compared the patterns of gene expression during development at each end of Convolutriloba longifissura , a simple flatworm with a cul - de- sac for a gut , to those seen in more complex worms which have a mouth and an anus .
C. longifissura and the other worms expressed the same genes while building their mouths .
But perhaps more importantly , some genes that are expressed in the hindguts of several other species are also expressed at the posterior end of C. longifissura , rather than in the mouth .
The findings suggest that the anus did not develop from the mouth , but may instead have evolved in a different way .
Alternative route
Another way for nature to make an anus , Hejnol says , is from reproductive tissue .
There is a gene expressed in the anuses of some of the more complex worms that is also expressed in the reproductive tract of C. longifissura .
This suggests that the reproductive tract may have evolved first and then joined with the gut .
Many more - complex organisms such as birds , reptiles , and amphibians share a single opening for all their non-eating business , and this work may point to its origin .
But Arendt disagrees .
C. longifissura are fast - evolving creatures , he points out , and so what is now a reproductive tract may have started out as an anus , rather than the other way around .
He would like to see a follow - up study of slower - evolving creatures before he will be won over .
" I 'm not convinced at all , " he says .
" The issue remains open . "
Claus Nielsen , professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , agrees that the question is not yet answered .
But he thinks that the new work will stimulate future discussion about the anus and its origins .
" It 's interesting and it makes you think , " he says .
In 1960 , somebody wanted to buy the house , so they went to the Second Savings Bank of Berkeley ( " Two branches to serve you ! " ) and asked for a mortgage .
The banker knew Hearst Ave , and could find the house , and knew the applicant , who had banked there a while .
The banker hired a known appraiser to verify the value of the house .
After checking the applicant 's credit , they took 20 % down and granted a mortgage , which they kept in portfolio .
In 1980 , someone else bought the house .
They went to Big East Bay S&L ( " Branches from Richmond to Walnut Creek ! " ) , who had a vague idea of the area and could find Hearst Ave. on a map , and who hired an appraisal firm to send somebody to verify the value of the house .
After checking the applicant 's credit , they took 10 % down , required Private Mortgage Insurance , and granted a mortgage , which they sold to Fannie Mae.
Fannie
Mae in turn bundled a bunch of mortgages and sold them to investors .
BEBS&L stayed on to service the loan .
In 2000 , somebody else bought the house .
They went to National Mortgage Chain , whose managers had heard of Berkeley , and who hired an appraisal firm to validate the value of the house .
They let the applicant have a " no doc " loan with 5 % down .
They bundled a bunch of these and sold them on the securities market , and hired a servicer .
In 2004 , the homeowner refinanced .
The market was up so he took out equity and got a 90 % loan on the estimated new value .
He went to Jose the Mortgage Broker who wrote a subprime 4 % 3/1 with 6/2 caps no -doc loan with a big commission for himself .
The mortgage company he turned it over to hired an appraiser who was more than a bit generous in estimating the value .
The mortgage company ( " we 've heard of California " ) bundled the loan and sold it to an investment bank , who mixed it up with other bundles and sold pieces of them on the securities market .
The buyers of securities arranged credit default swaps from a hedge fund .
The hedge fund sold the CDS ten times over .
The security holders bought CDSs on five times the portfolio value , figuring that a default would trigger " The Producers " - like profits .
The homeowner then defaulted when the rate reset up from 4 % to 10 % .
But the CDSs were backed up only by other worthless CDSs .
Bialistock and Bloom got caught .
But they asked for a bailout , citing the old maxim , " if I owe you a thousand dollars , I have a problem ; if I owe you a billion dollars , you have a problem . "
So all that 's left to argue over is the size of their golden parachute .
A Springfield M14 augmented with Sage International 's Enhanced Battle Rifle chassis , turning it into what some call the " SOPMOD M14 " , although it 's technically called the " M14 EBR " .
The M14 EBR is basically the M14 rifle , but with Picatinny rails and a pistol - grip and horizontal stock .
Sage International also makes chassis systems for a Ruger Mini - 14 and even the M1 Garand .
Enjoy .
This is a list of predictions about the end of the world which , clearly , never came true .
For the sake of fairness I have included five predictions based on religious beliefs , and five based on science or pseudo - science .
10 Montanus
Montanus was an early “ heretic ” in Christianity who predicted that the end of times were upon the world .
Joined with two “ prophetesses ” , Montanus claimed to be the embodiment of the Holy Spirit and began to preach a third testament .
Montanus ’ beliefs became fairly widespread and caused a great deal of confusion and dissent within the early Christian church .
Tertullian , the Christian writer ( pictured above ) rejected mainstream Christianity and converted to montanism .
Montanus was eventually condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD .
Interesting Fact : Montanus taught that Turkey would become the “ New Jerusalem ” and that all of Christianity would settle there before the final judgement .
9 Charles Wesley
Charles Wesley , one of the founders of the Methodist church believed that the world was going to end in 1794 .
This view concurred with that of the Shakers who also predicted that year as the end .
Despite his error , Charles ’ brother John also later made a prediction of the end times ; John predicted that 1836 would be the year that the Great Beast would come to earth , marking the beginning of the end .
Interesting Fact : Despite being a founding member of Methodism , Charles Wesley begged an Anglican minister to bury him in an Anglican graveyard , stating : “ Sir , whatever the world may say of me , I have lived , and I die , a member of the Church of England . ”
8 Jehovah ’s Witness Predictions
The Jehovah ’s Witness religion has made a number of predictions about the end of the world .
The first was 1914 – they based their prediction on prophecies from the Book of Daniel .
After the end did not come , they changed the meaning of the prediction and stated that it was the date that Jesus would begin to rule invisibly ( yes – invisibly ) .
Some other years that the group have predicted the end of the world to come are : 1914 , 1915 , 1918 , 1920 , 1925 , 1941 , 1975 and 1994 , etc .
One member of the cult actually built a house for the Jewish prophets to live in when they returned to earth as part of the end times .
Interesting Fact : Charles Taze Russell ( pictured above pretending to understand Ancient Greek or Latin ) – the founder of the cult sold “ Miracle Wheat ” at extremely inflated prices , promising wheat of miraculous proportions .
7 The Great Disappointment
Between the years of 1831 and 1841 , William Miller ( a Baptist minister ) , predicted the return of Jesus and the end of the world based on prophecies in the Book of Daniel ( Daniel 8:14 ) .
“ My principles in brief , are , that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth , cleanse , purify , and take possession of the same , with all the saints , sometime between March 21 , 1843 and March 21 , 1844 . ”
The day came and went and the Millerites kept their faith .
After further discussion , the date of the end of the world was changed to April 18th .
Again the day came and went .
Again the date was changed – this time to October 22 , 1844 .
Miller continued to wait for the end until his death in 1849 .
Interesting Fact : The Millerite religious movement eventually became the Seventh - day Adventist Church .
They believe that the prediction was correct , but that it referred to an event in Heaven not on earth .
They continue to believe that to this day .
Members of the Bahá ’í Faith also believe the prediction – they think it referred to the coming of a forerunner of their own religion , the Bab .
6 Joanna Southcott
Joanna Southcott was a self - proclaimed English mystic , born in 1750 .
She was originally a Methodist , but she became convinced that she had supernatural powers and declared herself the woman spoken of in Apocalypse — in the King James Version , Revelation 12:1 - 6 : “ And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars ” .
Joanna predicted that she would give birth to the Messiah – hailing the end of the world , on 19 October , 1814 .
The world did n’t end on that date , but two months later it did end for Joanna who died .
Her followers kept her body for some time in the hopes that she would raise herself from the dead .
They finally handed her over to authorities when she began to decay .
Interesting Fact : Joanna left behind a sealed box which she claims contained a series of prophesies .
The box is not to be opened until 24 Anglican Bishops gather together for that purpose .
Will the secret of Joanna ’s box every be revealed ?
5 1910 Halley ’s Comet
Even though Haley ’s Comet had been visible many times before without any reported deaths , the passing of the comet on May 18 , 1910 was thought to be a deathly threat to people because of poisonous gas coming from its tail .
It is not only religious misapprehension that can cause apocalyptic panic .
This may have been the first time science caused this grave fear .
Interesting Fact : Mark Twain was born in 1835 .
Haley ’s comet had made an appearance this same year .
He has been quoted as having said he would “ go out with comet . ” Mark Twain died in April of 1910 .
4 Planetary Conjunction
Respected meteorologist Albert Porta predicted that on December 17 , 1919 a conjunction of six planets would “ cause a magnetic current that would pierce the sun , cause great explosions of flaming gas and eventually engulf the Earth . ”
This prediction led to some mob violence and a few suicides .
It also caused Albert to lose his job as a “ respected ” meteorologist and he ended up working for a local paper writing the weather column .
Interesting Fact :
The study of meteorology dates back to Ancient times with the first book on the subject being written by Aristotle in 350 BC .
The book was called “ Meteorology ” .
3 The Jupiter Effect
The Jupiter Effect came out in 1974 and was written by two astrophysicists , John Gribben and Stephen Plagemann .
It was about all nine planets aligning on March 10 , 1982 to create a gravitational pull that would cause a huge increase in sunspots , solar , flares , and / or earthquakes .
Many credophiles took this as a prediction .
Although author Gribben even came out and said it was a theoretical “ what if ” festival without much of any real substance behind it , people believed it was going to happen and would not be deterred .
Interesting Fact :
While the effect did not cause major catastrophe , there was some influence by the planets , with high tide calculated at 0.04 millimeters higher than normal .
2 Hale - Bopp Comet
The comet Hale - Bopp was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months .
Amateur astronomer , Chuck Shramek “ observed ” a companion object following the comet .
He then called the Art Bell radio show to report his findings .
This led many to believe a variety of “ end of the world ” theories .
The internet helped spread the word even faster .
The Heaven ’s Gate cult felt this was their signal to commit mass suicide in March of 1997 .
The cult believed the companion object was a spaceship coming to pick them up only to be reached by leaving their Earthly vessels behind .
Interesting Fact :
You can watch a fascinating video clip of the Heaven ’s Gate cult on youtube .
The video is here .
1 Year 2k
Nostradamus , arguably the best - known seer of all time predicted July of 1999 to be the chosen date of Armageddon .
A “ great King of Terror ” was to descend from the sky .
When that did n’t come true the doomsayers began spreading rumors that the Cassini space probe was going to crash on Earth .
The Cassini probe was filled with radioactive fuel .
If this was spilled in a crash it would fulfill the prediction in Revelation 8:11 “ And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter . ”
And of course , no one can forget the years leading up to 2000 in which doomsayers the world over predicted catastrophe for man due to the Y2 K bug .
Interesting Fact : Nostradamus was , by profession , an apothecary – which , in modern terms , is a pharmacist .
Engineers have made a new tiny DelFly Micro air vehicle .
This successor to the DelFly I and II weighs barely 3 grams , and with its flapping wings is very similar to a dragonfly .
Ultra-small , remote - controlled micro aircraft with cameras , such as this DelFly , may well be used in the future for observation flights in difficult - to - reach or dangerous areas .
The DelFly Micro is a ' Micro Air Vehicle ' ( MAV ) , an exceptionally small remote - controlled aircraft with camera and image recognition software .
The Micro , weighing just 3 grams and measuring 10 cm ( wingtip to wingtip ) is the considerably smaller successor to the successful DelFly I ( 2005 ) and DelFly II ( 2006 ) .
The DelFly Micro , with its minuscule battery weighing just 1 gram , can fly for approximately three minutes and has a maximum speed of 5 m/s .
Ultra -small remote - controlled , camera - equipped aircraft are potentially of great interest because they could eventually be used for observation flights in difficult - to - reach or dangerous areas .
Principle derived from nature
The basic principle of the DelFly is derived from nature .
The ' dragonfly ' has a tiny camera ( about 0.5 grams ) on board that transmits its signals to a ground station .
With software developed by TU Delft itself , objects can then be recognised independently .
The camera transmits TV quality images , and therefore allows the DelFly II to be operated from the computer .
It can be manoeuvred using a joystick as if the operator was actually in the cockpit of the aircraft .
The aim is to be able to do this with the DelFly Micro too .
Miniaturisation
The development of the DelFly is above all the story of continuing miniaturisation of all the parts , from the DelFly I ( 23 grams and 50 cm ) via the DelFly II ( 16 grams and 30 cm ) to the present DelFly Micro ( 3 grams and 10 cm ) .
The DelFly II drew huge attention in 2006 because it could fly horizontally ( 21 km / hr ) as well as hover , just like a hummingbird , and also fly backwards .
The DelFly Micro , incidentally , cannot do this just yet .
In a few years time , the new objective of the project , the DelFly NaNo ( 5 cm , 1 gram ) will have been developed .
The Micro is an important intermediate step in this development process .
A second objective for the future is for the DelFly to be able to fly entirely independently thanks to image recognition software .
Pictured : Moses the massive hound who was rescued by firefighters from a cat flap
This is the enormous 13 and a half stone dog who was stuck for two hours after getting his head wedged in a cat flap .
Huge hound Moses Chan had to be rescued by firefighters after squeezing his big head into the tiny hole .
The 14 - month - old Dogue de Bordeaux , who measures more than 5ft tall on his hind legs , had been trying to copy his owner 's four cats , but did n't realise how big he was .
Barking mad : Moses Chan was left lodged for two hours after squeezing his head into a cat flap
' I can't believe I have a blonde dog who thought he could fit in such a tiny gap , ' said owner Lisa Saberi , who has only had Moses a week .
' He seems to think he 's a cat .
He is always trying to play with them and he tries to eat their food if I 'm not watching . '
Lisa , 29 , had left Moses to run around in the garden while she went to the shops with her 13 - year - old daughter , Natasha and son Hayden , 10 .
Pet Rescue :
It took firefighters 45 minutes to set Moses free from the cat flap
But Moses got fed up with being outside and when he saw cats Hunni , Clover , Paddy and Marley going through the cat flap he decided to do the same .
Luckily next - door neighbour Reece Young , 12 , heard Moses whimpering for help and quickly realised what was wrong when he peered over the fence and could only see the back end of the big dog sticking out the door .
He quickly tried to free the huge dog but had no luck so called his mum , Jackie , who came home and phoned the fire brigade .
Puppy love : Moses with owner Lisa Saberi , 29
Lisa , from Welwyn Garden City , Bucks , a mature student at Ruskin Anglia University , Cambridge said : ' I wondered what was going on when I got back .
I could n't believe Moses had been so silly .
' He looked so sad and sorry for himself I was really concerned , but it was a very funny sight .
You could just see this huge head . '
It took 45 minutes for the firemen to rescue Moses by drilling holes around the plastic cat flap .
The poor pooch was then taken to the vet with a grazed neck but is now on the mend .
Lisa added : ' He was very worn out and distressed , but he 's much better now .
I 've taken the cat flap out and will board up the hole so it wo n't happen again . '

Now that Hurricane Gustav has made it through Cuba , and entered the Gulf of Mexico as a strong Category 3 storm – with sustained winds of 120 mph – it ’s high time that you go out and fill up your car , truck or SUV .
Based on the current projected storm path , Gustav will very likely make landfall somewhere between Galveston , Texas and Gulfport , Mississippi .
In terms of gas prices , this is important because this area of the Gulf Coast is home to many of the region ’s oil refineries .
These facilities account for nearly 40 % of the United States ’ refining capacity .
Keep in mind , when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the Gulf Coast region , it did so as a Category 3 storm .
Should Gustav do as many forecasters are predicting and strengthen to a Category 4 before making landfall – meaning it would have sustained winds between 131 and 155 mph – chances are good that we could see even more damage to oil production facilities and refineries than what we did back in 2005 .
This certainly does not bode well for prices at the pump .
In the days following Hurricane Katrina ’s landfall , the national average price for a gallon of gasoline shot up by nearly 20 percent , and climbing above $ 3 for the first time ever .
Should oil production facilities and refineries suffer similar damage from Hurricane Gustav , the price of gasoline would easily jump back above $ 4 per gallon , and would very likely shatter the record high prices set back in mid-July .
And , in the worst case scenario , where damage is even more catastrophic , we could see the national average gas price climb above $ 5 .
This would certainly have profound economic consequences , with many Americans already having a tough time with soaring food and energy costs .
See why it ’s so important to go fill up now ?
So , let ’s hope for everyone ’s sake – for those who live and work in the storm ’s path , and for the rest of us who will be dealing with the fallout – that Gustav weakens over the Gulf ’s open waters , and somehow does far less damage than what ’s currently anticipated .
In the meantime , to hedge your bets , go fill up your car now .
" If AIG fails tomorrow morning , it 's the same thing written all over this market , " Cheslock said .
" I do n't think anyone is going to want to take any positions overnight . "
US stocks closed sharply loweras worries about AIG — on top of the crises at Lehman and Merrill — sparked a 500 - point drop in the Dow .
Markets in Asia and Europealsosold off , though Tokyo and several other Asian money centers were closed for holidays .
The dollar sank against the yen and the euro .
Oil prices , responding to the turmoil in financial markets more than Hurricane Ike , plunged to $ 92 a barrel .
But AIG 's survival remains uncertain , and investors are worried that there are other companies that may need to raise capital to cover mortgage - related losses .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Monday the U.S. financial system remained sound despite current stresses and he was prepared to take further actions if necessary to maintain stability .
" So far , the efforts of the US government have failed to bring any stability to the financial markets , '' said Kathy Lien , director of currency research at Global Forex Trading .
Advice for Investors
Besides AIG , investors were also watching these developments late Monday :
— Lehman Brothers , which filed for bankruptcy Sunday to became the largest casualty of the global credit crisis , is in advanced talks to sell its investment management business , including the crown jewel , Neuberger Berman .
— Bank of America 's purchase of Merrill Lynch for $ 50 billion in stock will create a banking giant that offers everything from fixed - income trading to credit card lending .
The events of the past few days signal a seismic shift in Wall Street 's power structure , with big name investment banks biting the dust and major banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase becoming the survivors .
" It 's a return to pure capitalism , the survival of the fittest — the government can't and wo n't bail everybody out , " said Justin Urquhart Stewart , investment director at 7 Investment Management in London .
" This shows the U.S. government is saying ' enough ' after saving other institutions , and that they see Lehman as a private affair , " said Marie - Pierre Pillon , head of equity and credit research at Groupama Asset Management in Paris .
" I think today and tomorrow there will be a panic on the markets . "
I ’ve begun creating a site for a friend of mine who will sell diving , Asian Diving Vacation ( please do n’t bitch about the way it looks at this point , it ’s a work in progress , the only reason I ’m linking to it at this point is because there is also a lot of bitching about demos going on , so here you go demo freaks ) .
I ’m using MODx because it simply rocks for the purpose , we do n’t need any strange modules that would require something from the giant repositories of Drupal or Joomla .
There will be a lot of information on the site and I hate drop down menus because they do n’t keep state when you browse , a tree view would though .
The one I chose is made by Jörn Zaefferer .
Treeview requires jQuery cookie by Klaus Hartl to remember its state .
First of all you have to uninstall the QuickEdit module because it will inject MooTools into the HTML and that could cause problems with jQuery and / or some of its plugins .
I do n’t want to remap the jQuery function either .
Before we begin in earnest you might want to check out the prior MODx tutorial if you ’re a beginner .
Yet again I ’m using YAML as the layout template , by just dropping the whole framework in a subfolder of the templates folder : C:\wamp\www\asd\assets \templates\asd is the full path to it on my machine .
The CSS below makes use of treeview images which I simply copied to the asd / examples / images folder .
Let ’s start out with the modified layout_2col_left_ 13.html example which I ’ve chosen for this project :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " > < html > < head > < title > [ ( site_name ) ] - [ * pagetitle * ]</ title > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> <!-- ( en )

As you can see we have two trees , one for the English content and one for the German content .
To get a better picture of what ’s really happening we need to check the contents of the asd.js file :
function hideShow ( id , target_id ) { treeView ( target_id ) ; $ ( " #" +id).click ( function ( ) { if ( $.cookie( target_id ) != ' shown ' ) { $ ( " # " +target_id ) .
show ( ' slow ' ) ; $.cookie( target_id , ' shown ' ) ; }else{ $ ( " # " +target_id ) .
hide ( ' slow ' ) ; $.cookie( target_id , ' hidden ' ) ; } } ) ; if ( $.cookie( target_id ) != ' shown ' ) $ ('#'+target_id ) .hide ( ) ; } function treeView ( wrapper_id ) { $ ( " # " +wrapper_id + " ul : first " ) . attr ( 'css ' , ' treeview ' ) .
treeview ( { collapsed : true , unique : true , persist : " cookie " , cookieId : wrapper_id + " treeview " } ) ; } $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { hideShow ( ' english - select ' , ' treemenu- english ' ) ; hideShow ( ' german - select ' , ' treemenu - german ' ) ; } ) ;
We begin with setting each tree menu with its own cookie to remember the state , we also add the treeview class , more on that later in the CSS part .
Next we implement our own custom toggle function to hide each menu and remember the state while we ’re at it .
Finally we hide everything that is n’t shown , hopefully that will initially hide all trees from a new visitor so that she can choose language by herself .
The above code is somewhat buggy when browsing two languages at the same time , at least initially .
Fixing this is low priority as dual language browsing should be a rare event .
So far the only CSS work that has been done is through some additions to layout_2col_left_13.css , starting at about line 30 :
body { padding : 0 0 0 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 0 ; } #page{ background : # 680805 ; border : 0 px ; margin : 0 0 0 0 ; } #page_margins { background : # 680805 ; /*border : 10 px # 680805 solid ;*/ border - top:0 px ; } #main{ background : # 680805 ; color : # fbbc4e ; padding : 0 0 0 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 0 ; } #header { background : # 680805 url (../../images/top_bg_image.jpg ) no -repeat ; height : 130 px ; padding : 0 0 0 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 0 ; width :960 px ; } #nav{ padding : 0 0 0 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 0 ; } #nav_main{ padding : 0 0 0 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 0 ; } #col1_content a{ color : # fbbc4e ; } # col1_content{ border - right : dashed 1 px ; border - color : # fbbc4e ; } # col3_content { color : # fbbc4e ; padding : 20 px 10px 0 20 px ; } #col3_content h2{ color : # fff ; } .normalText strong{ color : # fff ; font - weight : bolder ; font - size : 14 px ; } . treeview , . treeview ul { list - style - image : none ; list - style - position : outside ; list - style - type : none ; margin : 0 pt ; padding : 0 pt ; } . treeview ul { background - color : # 680805 ; margin - top : 4 px ; } . treeview .hitarea { background : transparent url ( ../../images/treeview-famfamfam.gif ) no -repeat scroll - 64 px - 25 px ; cursor : pointer ; float : left ; height : 16 px ; margin - left : - 16 px ; width : 16 px ; } * html .hitarea { display : inline ; float : none ; } . treeview li { margin:0 pt ; padding : 3 px 0pt 3 px 16 px ; } . treeview a.selected { background - color : #EEEEEE ; } #treecontrol { display : none ; margin : 1em 0 pt ; } . treeview .hover { color : red ; cursor : pointer ; } . treeview li { background : transparent url ( ../../images/treeview-red-line.gif ) no -repeat scroll 0pt ; } . treeview li.collapsable , . treeview li.expandable { background - position : 0 pt - 176 px ; } . treeview .

There is a lot of treeview specific stuff , if you forget something here the plugin might not work properly .
If you do “ Show CSS ” in WebDeveloper at the treeview demo page you will see all CSS that is required for any setup to work .
Since I ’m not using folders I ’ve thrown that part out .
I ’ve also been able to turn on nice urls in Tools ->
Configuration , step two is opening ht.access and editing it according to the instructions in it .
After that is setup do n’t forget to link for instance images properly in your articles , this is the way it looks for me at the moment : [ ( base_url ) ] assets/images/image.jpg

Racing sled dogs could be considered the Lance Armstrongs of the canine world , for their strength and endurance .
New research sheds light on how they do it .
Sled dogs are best known for " mushing " each March in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race , the world ’s longest sled race .
The canine competitors cover 1,100 miles ( 1,770 km ) from Anchorage to Nome , Alaska , sometimes in just nine days .
The dogs often trek through heavy blizzards and endure temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 40 degrees C ) .
The chilly conditions are necessary for the dogs , which would overheat in balmier climes .
That 's because dogs can't sweat , except through their paws , and they generate a tremendous amount of heat purely from the burning of calories during the race .
Michael Davis of Oklahoma State University ’s Center for Veterinary Health Sciences has studied the sled dogs for the past 10 years .
He runs check - ups on the dogs before and after races as well as during controlled experiments for which he sets up races with groups of sled dogs .
The secret to the dogs ' feats of day - to - day endurance lies in their ability to " reprogram " their bodies ' responses to stress after just one day of competition , something humans can't do .
Davis plans to present his recent findings this week at a conference of the American Physiological Society in Hilton Head , S.C.
If you were to attend a race , Davis said , you might be surprised that the dogs are not all purebred Siberian Huskies .
Rather , they are mutts , with a mix of Husky , Alaskan Malamute , Pointer and other breeds .
Ultra athletes
Davis found that just like human athletes , conditioned sled dogs show body damage during their first day of exercise .
For instance , when any athlete , canine or Homo sapiens , pounds the pavement or icy ground for miles , bits of muscle enzymes and proteins leak out from their cells .
Scientists say this is a sign of cell damage .
Our cells do recover in a day or so , but as soon as we go for another run , the same damage happens all over again .
For sled dogs , that 's not the case .
" If you then take them out and do exactly the same exercise the following day and the day after that , and the day after that , you do n't continue to get that leakage [ of enzymes and proteins ] , " Davis told LiveScience .
He added , " In the course of just a day or two , they manage to adapt their system so that exercise that was injuring a muscle cell here and there on the first day is no longer injuring muscle cells . "
Davis found the sled dogs somehow reprogram their bodies after that first or second day of training with an athletic armor of sorts to prevent other bodily stresses as well .
Hungry canines
The four - legged fur - balls also have appetites rivaling any human athlete .
During race season , the dogs , which weigh a mere 55 pounds ( 25 kg ) , consume 12,000 calories a day , Davis said .
For comparison , Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps reportedly eats some 10,000 to 12,000 calories a day during competitions .
But Phelps boasts at least three times the weight of a race dog , Davis said .
" The challenge is getting 12,000 calories into a little dog like that and it has to be very calorie - dense , " he said .
" While they 're racing , they 're eating a diet that is pushing between 60 and 70 percent fat . "
( Every gram of fat contains nine calories , compared with the 4 calories in a gram of protein or carbohydrate ) .
Whatever it is that allows sled dogs to chow down on so much fatty food and stay healthy could be beneficial to humans .
And so results of Davis ' findings have implications for humans who have become obese or developed Type 2 diabetes .
" If you feed a diet that 's very high fat to a human , a lot of humans become obese and they develop type 2 diabetes .
And the dogs do n't , " Davis said .
" There is no such thing as an obese Type 2 diabetic sled dog despite the fact that they 're eating a diet that should produce that . "
Kanye
West answers the prayers of all his devout worshippers and re-records latest single , after it is accused of having no beat or rapping
Kanye
West may have an ego the size of a blimp , but he too seems susceptible to criticism .
Less than a week after the rapper / producer released his new song , Love Lockdown , online , he is already re-recording it .
The new recording is understood to have taken place in Hawaii , after Kanye posted bail from a scuffle with Los Angeles paparazzi .
" Your prayers have been answered ! "
Kanye wrote on his blog .
" There 's a new version of Love Lockdown coming .
We used new taiko drums and I re-sung it ... it 's being mastered now ... "
It remains to be seen whether Japanese taiko drums will be enough to redeem a track roundly scorned by hip - hop fans across the 'net .
Rather than rally behind the MTV Video Music Awards - premiered song , fans were bewildered by its diffuse , auto - tuned style .
" There must not be anyone in Kanye 's inner circle or in the Def Jam building with both the cojones and the authority to tell Kanye West that ... Love Lockdown should [ never ] have been released , " wrote influential hip - hop blogger Byron Crawford .
" The result is a song so awful I 'm wondering if radio stations are even gonna be able to pretend that it 's good enough to put into heavy rotation . "
His comments were echoed by a critic at the Underwriter blog .
" Ask me about any other song Kanye has produced and / or performed ; I 'll probably defend it as either great , good or misunderstood .
This one is just weird , and seems similar to the news of [ Governor Sarah ] Palin being picked [ by John McCain ] for VP , not very well planned out and intended for shock value .
...
Speaking of which , where 's the rap ?
Eff that , where 's the beat ? "
Even 50 Cent - whom Kanye soundly trounced in a chart battle last year , - was able to score some points , mocking Love Lockdown with an out of tune rendition in Albany , NY .
But at least when it comes to the autotune , Kanye is unrepentant .
" If you do n't like auto - tune , " he wrote on his blog , " too bad cause I love it and have been using it since the College Dropout ! !! "
Extra exclamation marks are n't going to be able to save this one , sir .
When it comes to the drag races , most of the fans do not think hauling front but , if one still made with safety not think the Mini Cooper S. But tuners from ABF Performance did not let that situation to stand in the path , so they got a Mini and it has amounted to an extreme level of performance .
With a time of 10.48 seconds in only a quarter miles , ABF Mini Cooper S is officially the fastest Mini in the world .
This was possible due to extreme diets , the installation of slick - ROMs , a turbocharger and an intercooler .
Thus , before little benefit now 650 HP and weights only 795 kilograms .

HAIFA , Israel ( Reuters ) - paralyzed for the past 20 years , former Israeli paratrooper Radi Kaiof now walks down the street with a dim mechanical hum .
Radi Kaiof stands near a wheelchair using an electronic exoskeleton at a development center in the northern city of Haifa August 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Baz Ratner
That is the sound of an electronic exoskeleton moving the 41 - year - old ’s legs and propelling him forward -- with a proud expression on his face -- as passersby stare in surprise .
“ I never dreamed I would walk again .
After I was wounded , I forgot what it ’s like , ” said Kaiof , who was injured while serving in the Israeli military in 1988 .
“ Only when standing up can I feel how tall I really am and speak to people eye to eye , not from below . ”
The device , called ReWalk , is the brainchild of engineer Amit Goffer , founder of Argo Medical Technologies , a small Israeli high - tech company .
Something of a mix between the exoskeleton of a crustacean and the suit worn by comic hero Iron Man , ReWalk helps paraplegics -- people paralyzed below the waist -- to stand , walk and climb stairs .
Goffer himself was paralyzed in an accident in 1997 but he cannot use his own invention because he does not have full function of his arms .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The system , which requires crutches to help with balance , consists of motorized leg supports , body sensors and a back pack containing a computerized control box and rechargeable batteries .
The user picks a setting with a remote control wrist band -- stand , sit , walk , descend or climb -- and then leans forward , activating the body sensors and setting the robotic legs in motion .
“ It raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight , ” Goffer said .
“ It ’s not just about health , it ’s also about dignity . ”
EYE CONTACT
Kate Parkin , director of physical and occupational therapy at NYU Medical Centre , said it has the potential to improve a user ’s health in two ways .
“ Physically , the body works differently when upright .
You can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs , ” Parkin said .
“ Psychologically , it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact . ”
Iuly Treger , deputy director of Israel ’s Loewenstein Rehabilitation Centre , said : “ It may be a burdensome device , but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it . ”
The product , slated for commercial sale in 2010 , will cost as much as the more sophisticated wheelchairs on the market , which sell for about $ 20,000 , the company said .
The ReWalk is now in clinical trials in Tel Aviv ’s Sheba Medical Centre and Goffer said it will soon be used in trials at the Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute in Pennsylvania .
Competing technologies use electrical stimulation to restore function to injured muscle , but Argo ’s Chief Operating Officer Oren Tamari said they will not offer practical alternatives to wheelchairs in the foreseeable future .
Other “ robot suits ” , like those being developed by the U.S. military or the HAL robot of Japan ’s University of Tsukuba , are not suitable for paralyzed people , he said .

NY Times
Perhaps no episode burnished Mr. McCain ’s image as a reformer more than his stewardship three years ago of the Congressional investigation into Jack Abramoff , the disgraced Republican Indian gambling lobbyist who became a national symbol of the pay - to - play culture in Washington .
The senator ’s leadership during the scandal set the stage for the most sweeping overhaul of lobbying laws since Watergate .
“ I ’ve fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes , ” the senator said in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination this month .
But interviews and records show that lobbyists and political operatives in Mr. McCain ’s inner circle played a behind - the - scenes role in bringing Mr. Abramoff ’s misdeeds to Mr. McCain ’s attention — and then cashed in on the resulting investigation .
The senator ’s longtime chief political strategist , for example , was paid $ 100,000 over four months as a consultant to one tribe caught up in the inquiry , records show .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign said the senator acted solely to protect American Indians , even though the inquiry posed “ grave risk to his political interests . ”
As public opposition to tribal casinos has grown in recent years , Mr. McCain has distanced himself from Indian gambling , Congressional and American Indian officials said .
But he has rarely wavered in his loyalty to Las Vegas , where he counts casino executives among his close friends and most prolific fund - raisers .
“ Beyond just his support for gaming , Nevada supports John McCain because he ’s one of us , a Westerner at heart , ” said Sig Rogich , a Nevada Republican kingmaker who raised nearly $ 2 million for Mr. McCain at an event at his home in June .
Only six members of Congress have received more money from the gambling industry than Mr. McCain , and five hail from the casino hubs of Nevada and New Jersey , according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics dating back to 1989 .
In the presidential race , Senator Barack Obama has also received money from the industry ; Mr. McCain has raised almost twice as much .
No one has hard numbers , of course , but based on how much it ’s talked about on the web , Ubuntu appears to be the most popular Linux distribution for home use ( as opposed to for servers ) .
Every tech news article about Linux mentions Ubuntu and will often recommend Ubuntu to new users .
Many YouTube videos about how to do something on Linux will feature Ubuntu .
Ubuntu is the top distro on DistroWatch ( again , just meaning there ’s a lot of interest in it — not necessarily that the largest number of Linux users are choosing it over other distros ) .
How did this come to pass ?
Seriously .
I was there … not from the very start but from very close to the beginning .
The very first release was Ubuntu 4.10 , nicknamed Warty Warthog .
I started with the next release , Ubuntu 5.04 ( Hoary Hedgehog ) .
My first experience with Ubuntu was not the best .
The CD froze up part way through the installation , which led me to use Mepis for a month instead .
But I came back to Ubuntu .
Why ?
On the surface , to a new user , Ubuntu would seem like a bad choice .
It does n’t come with popular proprietary software .
It does n’t have additional CDs ( meaning , for software installation , you probably need a broadband connection ) .
Its documentation Wiki ( especially at the time I started using it , less so now ) is a mess .
I figured in 2005 that distros like Mepis and Linspire would thrive and be at the forefront of bringing Linux to ex-Windows power users , if not “ the masses . ”
After all , in Ubuntu , I could n’t ( in Hoary ) edit the applications menu , get numlock to stick , install Nvidia drivers , or add software repositories without resorting to the command - line , which was a very daunting thing for me to use when I first started on Linux .
The word terminal was a scary word to see .
In retrospect , I do n’t know why I was so scared of it , but I was .
And , yet , only a month after using Mepis , I moved to Ubuntu and stuck with it for three years .
No , it did n’t come with Flash , Java , Nvidia drivers , Skype , Adobe Reader , or MP3 playback .
It just had something .
The amazing thing is that even back when Ubuntu was barely functional ( no easy - codec - installation or restricted - drivers - manager or Ubiquity installer ) it was getting buzz .
What got it off the ground ?
As far as I can tell , these are what Ubuntu had going for it :
Unlike giants Red Hat and Novell , Canonical was targeting home users first with its catchy ( if slightly misleading ) “ Linux for Human Beings ” slogan .
Servers were secondary .

Servers were secondary .
Unlike homebrews Mepis and PCLinuxOS , though , Ubuntu had the backing of some serious money ( Mark Shuttleworth’s ) .

The free CDs worldwide ( including shipping ) is a nice gimmick that set Ubuntu apart , even if a lot of those CDs were given away to people who later threw them in the trash .
worldwide ( including shipping ) is a nice gimmick that set Ubuntu apart , even if a lot of those CDs were given away to people who later threw them in the trash .
The Ubuntu Forums is a good compromise in that it has knowledgeable users but is generally free of the elitism and noob - disdain of other , more difficult distros ’ forums .
As a matter of fact , this was one of the major deciding factors for me .
Much as I liked Mepis and much as their forums were friendly , they just did n’t have enough knowledgeable users to support me in all my questions .
The Gentoo forums were far too intimidating for me .

I think this goes along with the forums being less intimidating , but associating the Ubuntu “ Humanity Towards Others ” philosophy with the distro seemed to give it a purpose and a flavor beyond mere technology .

The lack of confusing options really helps new users .
You do n’t have to know what KDE and Gnome are or choose what applications to install or which of five text editors to use .
Ubuntu picks one application per task as default .
If you want to switch to different applications later , that ’s up to you when you ’re more familiar with Linux programs .

Even though the Wiki is n’t the strongest representative of this , the Ubuntu documentation is pretty easy to follow .
When I started with Hoary , the Ubuntu Guide was the best around , and since then a series of screenshot - heavy and video tutorials have sprung up to help new users who feel lost .
I ’m a little conflicted on the single CD nature of Ubuntu .
Even though I think not having additional CDs hurts the idea of Linux for Human Beings ( since it really assumes users have a broadband connection or never want to install new software ) , I also found the multiple - CD distros confusing when I was a new user .
I did n’t think of Mandriva as the first CD for installing the operating system and the second and third for only additional software .
I thought I needed all three to install Mandriva .
So I steered clear of Debian , definitely , which I think had fourteen CDs at the time .
I am quite proud of the Ubuntu developers ’ work .
Even though I have minor complaints , I like what I ’m seeing : more point - and - click options , less need for the terminal , prettier artwork , easy codec installation .
Yes , there are bugs .
There will always be bugs .
But Ubuntu is a solid distro with a large userbase to support and welcome you if you want to come .
It was a dark horse rising up and now appears to be the de facto distro for new users .
If you ’re too lazy to install the proprietary codecs yourself , though , you can use a Ubuntu variant like Linux Mint , which includes them by default .

1 Wozoco Apartments ( Amsterdam - Osdorp , Netherlands )
A zoning law and blueprint flub were the inspiration for this apartment complex .
Dutch housing regulations require apartment construction to provide a certain amount of daylight to their tenants –but MVRDV architects forgot to plan for that .
Their solution ?
To hang thirteen of the 100 units off the north facade of the block .
The ingenious design saves ground floor space and allows enough sunlight to enter the east or west facade .
2 Floating Castle ( Ukraine )
Supported by a single cantilever –and quite discussed at Panoramio , this mysterious levitating farm house belongs in a sci- fi flick .
It ’s claimed to be an old bunker for the overload of mineral fertilizers but we ’re sure there ’s a better back story … alien architects probably had a hand in it .
3 Habitat 67 ( Montreal , Canada )
Apartments connect and stack like Lego blocks in Montreal ’s Habitat 67 .
Without a traditional vertical construction , the apartments have the open space that most urban residences lack , including a separate patio for each apartment .
4 Free Spirit Spheres ( British Columbia , Canada )
Free Spirit Spheres can be hung from the trees as shown , making a tree house .
They can also be hung from any other solid objects or placed in cradles on the ground .
There are four attachment points on the top of each sphere and another four anchor points on the bottom .
Each of the attachment points is strong enough to carry the weight of the entire sphere and contents .
The spheres are made of two laminations of wood strips over laminated wood frames .
The outside surface is then finished and covered with a clear fibreglass .
The result is a beautiful and very tough skin .
The skin is waterproof and strong enough to take the impacts that come with life in a dynamic environment such as the forest .
5 Cube House ( Rotterdam , Netherlands )
Living in a tilted house is much easier than it looks — just ask the people living in these the Kijk - Kubus homes .
Architect Piet Blom tipped a conventional house forty - five degrees and rested it upon a hexagon - shaped pole so that three sides face down and the other three face the sky .
Each of the cube houses accommodates three floors : a living space including a kitchen , study and bathroom , the middle floor houses bedrooms and the top is the pyramid room that can act like an attic or viewing deck .
These houses are quite expensive , but you can satisfy your curiosity by visiting the museum show house .
6 Gangster ’s House ( Archangelsk , Russia )
One - time Russian gangster Nikolai Sutyagin ’s home is certainly unusual .
The eccentric former convict ’s seemingly accidental 15 - year project begun in 1992 stands 13 floors , 144 feet high .
He claims he was only intending to build a two - story house – larger than those of his neighbours to reflect his position as the city ’s richest man .
7 Mushroom House ( Cincinnati , Ohio )
So disparate in materials and shapes this hodgepodge house looks like its been welded and glued together .
But this is no hobo - construction , it was designed by the professor of architecture and interior design at the University of Cincinnati , Terry Brown , and was recently on the market for an estimated $ 400 K .
8 Upside - Down House ( Syzmbark , Poland )
This upside down design seems totally nonsensical–but that is exactly the message the Polish philanthropist and designer , Daniel Czapiewski , was trying to send .
The unstable and backward construction was built as a social commentary on Poland ’s former Communist era .
The monument is worth a trip be it for a lesson in history or balance .
9 Pod House ( Rochester , New York )
We assumed this oddball home was UFO - inspired , but it turns out the weed Queen Anne ’s lace is where it got it ’s roots .
Its thin stems support pods with interconnecting walkways .
10 Heliotrope Rotating House ( Freiburg , Germany )
Green to the extreme , Architect Rolf Disch built a solar powered home that rotates towards the warm sun in the winter and rotates back toward its well - insulated rear in the summer .
A house that spins in circles does n’t sound too stable to us , but for the environment it is worth the risk .
Fannie Mae Slips from Obama Lobbyist Litany
by Josh Gerstein
Tue , 16 Sep 2008 at 2:15 AM
There was a curious omission Monday when Senator Obama lit into Senator McCain over the presence of lobbyists in the upper echelon of his campaign .
" Listen , it 's great that he now wants to talk about putting corporate lobbyists in their place .
But he needs to explain why he put seven of them in charge of his campaign , " Mr. Obama told a crowd in Grand Junction , Colo .
" Lobbyists for the insurance industry and for the oil industry and for Freddie Mac and for foreign governments .
And if you think those lobbyists are working day and night for John McCain just to put themselves out of business , well , I 've got a bridge to sell you up in Alaska . "
The Democratic nominee repeated almost exactly the same words in a speech in Pueblo , Colo , later in the day .
It 's a good riff , to be sure , but it should be noted that Mr. Obama decoupled Freddie Mac from the other agency almost always mentioned in the same breath : Fannie Mae .
Both were effectively nationalized earlier this month , at unknown cost to the taxpayer .
And news accounts about the lobbying ties of Mr. McCain 's aides usually mention the two quasi - governmental agencies in tandem , see e.g. , this or this ,
Why is Mr. Obama leaving Fannie Mae out of his lobbyist riff ?
It could n't be because the man he first selected to oversee his vice presidential vetting process , James Johnson , was once Fannie Mae's CEO ?
In retrospect , while Mr. Obama 's aides were none too happy about stories in The New York Sun and other newspapers highlighting Mr. Johnson 's ties to Fannie Mae and other figures in the subprime lending crisis , those stories did the Democratic nominee a huge favor .
Mr. Obama 's economic message would be even more hampered today had he not jettisoned the ex-CEO back in June and instead allowed him to see through the vice presidential selection process .

A line of massive boulders on the western shore of Tonga may be evidence of the most powerful volcano - triggered tsunami found to date .
Up to 9 meters ( 30 feet ) high and weighing up to 1.6 million kilograms ( 3.5 million pounds ) , the seven coral boulders are located 100 to 400 meters ( 300 to 1,300 feet ) from the coast .
The house - sized boulders were likely flung ashore by a wave rivaling the 1883 Krakatau tsunami , which is estimated to have towered 35 meters ( 115 feet ) high .
“ These could be the largest boulders displaced by a tsunami , worldwide , ” says Matthew Hornbach of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics .
“ Krakatau ’s tsunami was probably not a one - off event . ”
Hornbach and his colleagues will discuss these findings at the Joint Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America ( GSA ) , Soil Science Society of America ( SSSA ) , American Society of Agronomy ( ASA ) , Crop Science Society of America ( CSSA ) , and the Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies ( GCAGS ) , in Houston , Texas , USA .*
Called erratic boulders , these giant coral rocks did not form at their present location on Tongatapu , Tonga ’s main island .
Because the island is flat , the boulders could not have rolled downhill from elsewhere .
The boulders are made of the same reef material found just offshore , which is quite distinct from the island ’s volcanic soil .
In fact , satellite photos show a clear break in the reef opposite one of the biggest boulders .
And some of the boulders ’ coral animals are oriented upside down or sideways instead of toward the sun , as they are on the reef .
Hornbach says the Tongatapu boulders may have reached dry land within the past few thousand years .
Though their corals formed roughly 122,000 years ago , they are capped by a sparse layer of soil .
And the thick volcanic soils that cover most of western Tongatapu are quite thin near the boulders .
This suggests the area was scoured clean by waves in the recent past .
Finally , there is no limestone pedestal at the base of the boulders , which should have formed as rain dissolved the coral if the boulders were much older .
Many tsunamis , like the one that struck the Indian Ocean in 2004 , are caused by earthquakes .
But the boulders ’ location makes an underwater eruption or submarine slide a more likely culprit .
A chain of sunken volcanoes lies just 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) west of Tongatapu .
An explosion or the collapse of the side of a volcano such as that seen at the famous Krakatau eruption in 1883 could trigger a tremendous tsunami .
Another possibility is that a storm surge could have brought the boulders ashore .
But that scenario is n’t likely .
No storms on record have moved rocks this big .
Another possibility is that a monster undersea landslide caused the tsunami .
But Hornbach ’s analyses of adjacent seafloor topography point to a volcanic flank collapse as the most probable source of such a wave .
“ We think studying erratic boulders is one way of getting better statistics on mega- tsunamis , ” Hornbach says .
“ There are a lot of places that have similar underwater volcanoes and people have n’t paid much attention to the threat . ”
The researchers have already received reports of more erratic boulders from islands around the Pacific .
Future study could indicate how frequently these monster waves occur and which areas are at risk for future tsunamis .
The boulders are such an unusual part of the Tongan landscape that tales of their origins appear in local folklore .
According to one legend , the god Maui hurled the boulders ashore in an attempt to kill a giant man-eating fowl .
And though many other Pacific islanders follow the custom of heading uphill after earthquakes , Tongans have no such teachings .
Such lore may be useless for near - shore volcanically - generated tsunamis , which arrive too quickly for people to evacuate .
Instead , most of Tongatapu ’s settlements are huddled together on the northern side of the island — away from the brunt of the tsunami threat .
* The abstract “ Unraveling the Source of Large Erratic Boulders on Tonga : Implications for Geohazards and Mega - Tsunamis ” will be presented on 5 October 2008 .
On Tuesday , a federal judge in Manhattan will hear arguments on whether the file should be made public .
U.S. attorneys have agreed to release testimony from 35 of the 45 witnesses who appeared before the grand jury in 1950 and 1951 .
But they oppose opening material from witnesses who are still living , could not be found , or want their testimony kept secret .
We Are Change LA
September 24 , 2008
Sumner Redstone , CEO and majority shareholder in CBS , Viacom and its vast subsidary empire , meets We Are Change L.A .
On September 18 , 2008 , Paramount Studios in Hollywood hosted a red carpet gala entitled “ Hollywood Salutes Israel ” held in honor of the 60th anniversary of the state of Israel , which a number of celebrities attended .
While folks were maintaining an outreach and visibility presence on the street , Stewart Howe obtained press passes for himself and Jeremy Rothe - Kushel to attend the red carpet event on behalf of WeAreChangeLA Media .
Sumner Redstone granted a quick interview and gave his take on the role of the media– over which he holds greatly concentrated power .
Sumner is also asked about 9/11 and false - flag terrorism , in which he raised questions about the role of Saudi Arabia .
He also stated that he was n’t aware of , but also refused to believe that Mossad assets were filming and celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11/01 .
Sumner also states that while countries like the U.S. and Israel , and the rest of the civilized world should avoid embracing terrorism to fight their enemies , “ extreme measures ” may have to be used to combat the War on Terror .
We Are Change LA was also able to interview LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and actor Jason Alexander from “ Seinfeld . ”
Remember , if you are n’t happy with the job the media is doing or the questions they are n’t asking , step on up , uncover the stories , ask the questions and transmit it to the world .

Corpus callosum : 1st edition of open science round - up
September 19 , 2008
The idea for an open science round - up is not new .
An open science carnival was suggested over at Plausible Accuracy and the carnival on scientific life , Praxis , has included quite a bit of open science .
What I ’ve produced here is not strictly a carnival , but a round - up of all sorts of material on the web focused on open science issues and themes ( there is a little overlap with Praxis so feel free to ignore the redundant links ) .
For the most part , this round - up is concerned with writings , papers , and websites from the last couple weeks that have to do with open communication , open access , open data , open research , and the tools and policies that affect these endeavors .
The hope is that by collecting these materials regularly we can make connections and communicate more easily on the subject .
That is why , for now at least , I ’ve called it Corpus Callosum .
Conferences , workshops , and meetings
To start , I think it ’s exciting how many workshops and meetings there have been in the last one or two months .
Not only has the content been fascinating , but there is also the feeling that momentum is gathering .
The meeting that arguably kicked off this latest flurry was the Policy and Technology for e-Science satellite meeting of the Euroscience Open Forum , which took a great step forward by creating a set of clear guidelines defining open science .
Additional blog posts about the meeting are summarized over at Science Commons .
The discussion continued a few weeks later at two unconferences , BioBarCamp ( FF room ) and SciFoo , with commentary at Science in the Open ( biobarcamp , scifoo ) , Ouroboros , Public Rambling , and I was lost .
Soon after that was the Southampton Open Science workshop ( FF room ) initiated by Cameron Neylon at Science in the Open , with blog notes by Branwen Hide at Research Information Network on some of the tools that were discussed .
JC - Bradley at UsefulChem summarizes his jaunt through various ( open-ish ) science meetings in the UK during this time and is accompanied by Cameron in an open science endurance event .
Most recently was Science in the 21st Century ( FF room ) in Toronto , which discussed the ways in which technology influences the practice and communication of science .
Videos for the talks are archived at the Perimeter Institute ( PIRSA ) .
BackReaction summarizes the summary .
Inspired by the meeting , WebGoddessCathy writes about reasons to share science .
Uncertain Principles , normally unenthusiastic about Open Access , is pleasantly surprised by John Willinsky ’s talk about making OA accessible to the public readership ; a number of other topics also inspired blog posts , including discussions of “ Journals of stuff I like ” and open notebook software .
If you missed the meeting , you can catch up by tackling this daunting reading list compiled at Confessions of a Science Librarian .
At the same time as Science in the 21st Century was the Access to Knowledge ( A2K3 ) meeting in Geneva .
Victoria Stodden , a research fellow at the Stanford Law School , won the Kaltura prize ( open source and collaboration themes ) for her paper , “ Enabling reproducible research ” ( warning : PDF ) .
Dr. Stodden also posts about a talk given by Tim Hubbard on open science .
Now it seems there is a bit of a lull as people catch their breath and regroup .
One of the next meetings is the Open Science workshop at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing in January 2009 .
Speakers are confirmed and the organizers are ( well , Cameron is ) drafting a 5 - page introduction that will be published in the conference proceedings ( send feedback if you ’d like ! ) .
How and why to be open
So there ’s all this talk about open science – what does this mean , who is doing it , and how do we start ?
Well , the principles for open science from Science Commons is a good guideline , and a paper published in PLoS Medicine earlier this month from Piwowar et al provides recommendations for leadership .
Research Remix follows up on these recommendations by posting a letter to her department suggesting a BHAG ( Big Hairy Ambitious Goal ) for openness , and highlighting the US National Center for Research Resources strategic plan to facilitate information sharing among biomedical researchers .
Dave de Roure gives his take on guidelines for the new e-science at the Digital Curation blog .
And John Wilbanks implores us , regarding code at least , to “ ship it or share it “ .
In terms of policy and funding , Peter Lee writes about the movement towards the privatizing patent regulation and the “ biomedical research commons ” , while the Positive Tech Journal considers the possibility of crowdsourcing funding for science .
Sometimes it ’s easy to get caught up in the furor and lose sight of why we become open in the first place .
Cameron reminisces about the serendipity leading to his own decision to make his research open , Chris Patil is inspired enough by BioBarCamp and SciFoo to make a public promise to go open , and coffee research goes open inspired by talks at Science Blogging 2008 .
Cameron , JC - Bradley , Peter M-R and Egon Willighagen get together to do a real - time open science hackfest , and at some point during all this , Cameron and JC - Bradley sit down with Nature for an interview on their thoughts on open science ( Cameron ’s clarifications here ) .
But the devil is in the details .
Science in the Open muses on the distinction between recording and presenting experiments in open notebooks , and Bench Press shares tips and experiences from making the transition to electronic online notebooks , with the strong advice : “ whatever you can make electronic , make it so . ”
Tools for open science
These days it seems like every week brings another dozen new “ web 2.0 ” and “ science 2.0 ” tools .
Some of the latest to create buzz are Mendeley , yet another system for managing and sharing research papers ( both online and downloadable desktop versions available ) , SciVee postercasts which combine interactive poster viewing with a short video clip of the author presenting the work , OpenScience.org writes about Exhibit , which helps you put your data online , and Laboratree makes their official launch and press release .
And BBGM notes , FriendFeed continues its success as a homebase for many life scientists on the web .
A couple websites that may be of interest are SpreadingScience , which focuses on educating people and scientists about science 2.0 , and the World Association for Young Scientists ( WAYS ) website for facilitating global access to science and collaboration .
WAYS has some interesting blog posts , including this interview with Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger , who has founded what could be considered a more transparent and reliable version of Wikipedia , Citizendium – anyone can contribute , but they must use real names and “ experts ” ( Ph.D. holders ) can approve the contributions .
Citizendium also partners with universities around the world to offer academic credit for high - quality entries in a program called Eduzendium .
Wikis have been around for a while but they have only recently started being used for science .
This approach makes sense given that the small number of curators responsible for maintaining traditional knowledgebases is clearly insufficient for the amount of data now being produced ; rather , take advantage of the vast communities of scientists ( i.e. experts ) by allowing any of them to contribute their individual knowledge .
This crowdsourcing strategy towards annotation has met with only limited success however , as this Nature News article on “ wikiomics ” discusses .
The problem is always : how do you get scientists to contribute ?
There are at least two facets to this problem – contributing to a wiki requires time ( though arguably not that much ) , and there are no incentives to contributing .
Ouroboros writes about open access annotation , and , specifically , Gene Wiki ( PLoS paper ) , a Wikipedia portal which hopes to ameliorate the barrier to contribution by pre-populating the wiki with “ stubs ” .
Mememoir takes another angle through its WikiGenes knowledgebase ( Nature Genetics paper ) by providing clear authorship attribution , tracking , and peer review .
Wikis are n’t alone in sometimes having a barrier to adoption / contribution .
So - called web 2.0 and science 2.0 tools like the ones mentioned above often face resistance from the majority of scientists , not to mention stiff competition .
The SpreadingScience blog writes about the 5 step process for a person ( or organization ) to adopt innovation and Expression Patterns gives her thoughts on how to get scientists to adopt web 2.0 technologies .
A New York Times article wonders how many web services one person can use .
And stepping back even further , Peter Suber Gavin Baker blogs about , this liveblog post on Joho on a talk by James Boyle on the nature of openness .
Other developments
The US government DOE goes a little more open with increased access to scientific information in the release of science .gov 5.0 .
At the same time , Open Access is threatened in Congress .
A Blog Around
The Clock urges you to call your congressman to bury this specific anti-Open Access bill , the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act .
In the news , Phylogenomics comments on an MSNBC article called “ The Era of Scientific Secrecy Nears its End ” and points out an interview with Open Access reporter Amy Harmon at the New York Times .
For some fun , Open Economics goes to town on some agricultural data , revealing some interesting historical trends , and Grand Text Auto begins an experiment in open peer - review , as author Noah Wardrip - Fruin names a blog readership as the ideal reviewers for his forthcoming book .
Closing thoughts
With that , I ’ll wrap up this round - up .
I ’m not sure what will happen with future issues yet – if someone wants to volunteer to host the next one , please do !
– but it would be great to keep it going .
To close , I ’ll share a quote from a talk I heard yesterday that seemed very appropriate given the recent attention towards structuring the until now very broad and scattered open science discussion .
The talk was actually about vocal learning in songbirds and presented findings showing that canaries have innate rules guiding their song behavior but that they have tremendous range and versatility in the sounds they can learn and produce , leading to remarkable creativity .
Towards the end , the speaker paused for a moment to say ,
“ I feel that there is some deep social message here …
Something like , if you want to have great creativity and innovation you must give complete freedom , but if you want to reap the benefits you must provide a framework . ”
Just so .

Many thanks go to Chris Patil for the encouragement , to Neil Saunders for his RSS experiment , to Daniel Mietchen who brought WAYS to my attention , and to the many people on FriendFeed who make it simply the best place to get the latest news and posts about open science .
I was refreshing it and finding new items to include here all the way up until I pressed “ publish ” .
Honda 's US vehicle sales dropped 9.2 % in July , a far cry from the devastating plunges suffered by Ford ( F ) and General Motors ( GM ) , but still worse than expected .
Honda is still benefitting from selling more fuel - efficient cars than its American rivals , but now it has another problem :
It ca n't make enough of them to meet demand ( Reuters ) :
Honda Motor Co ( HMC ) said on Monday its output of passenger cars would fall short of demand at least through the rest of the business year to next March as fuel prices force customers to look for smaller cars .
" We do n't have enough Accords , Civics and Fits in the United States , " [ Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Hojo ] told Reuters .
While Honda looks to increase capacity and capitalize on North America 's new - found appetite for fuel efficient cars , there is no quick fix .
The shortage of supply and inventory will last through the end of the business year .
As $ 125 oil wreaks havoc on automakers , even good news ( strong demand for cars ) , never trumps the bad .

Cheye Calvo , mayor of DC suburb Berwyn Heights , was raided by a SWAT team after 30 lbs of marijuana was delivered to his home .
They broke down his door , shot his two black labradors , and interrogated him and his wife as their dogs bled to death .
Turns out Calvo says he had no idea about the package , which was still outside , unopened and perhaps waiting for its real recipient to pick it up .
Police say they still had sufficient cause to break in ( even though they did not have a " no - knock warrant " ) .
Who Is Sarah Palin , Really ?
Editor ’s Note : Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has had quite a ride during her first few weeks of national attention – getting on the cover of major newsmagazines , scoring high TV ratings for her convention speech and her first network interview , and receiving credit for breathing new life into John McCain ’s presidential campaign .
But Palin remains an enigma to many , leading historian Lisa Pease to look back at Palin 's early days as mayor of Wasilla , a town of about 6,000 people :
We 've seen the speeches , the rumors , and the spin .
But who is Sarah Palin , really ?
The Bible says , in essence , by their acts you shall know them .
So it 's fitting we turn our glance to Palin 's first executive role as mayor of the tiny hamlet of Wasilla , Alaska .

Only 10 days after she had been elected mayor , Palin seized the reins in the most brutal of ways : she asked all of the city 's top officials to resign as a " loyalty test . "
'' Wasilla is moving forward in a positive direction , '' Palin explained .
'' This is the time for the department heads to let me know if they plan to move forward or if it 's time for a change . ''
[ Anchorage Daily News , Oct. 26 , 1996 ]
She also quickly instituted what a local paper characterized as a " gag order " that required all city department heads to get the mayor 's approval before talking to the press .
Palin explained she only wanted department heads to hold off talking until they better understood the goals of her new administration .
After less than four months in office , Palin summarily fired the city 's police chief and library director .
Neither had received any warning .
Mary Ellen Emmons , the library director , who had served the community in that position for over seven years , believed the firings were politically motivated .
Both Emmons and Irl Stambaugh , the city 's police chief , had supported Palin 's opponent in the mayoral race , long - time mayor John Stein .
“ I 've been in law enforcement for 26 years and I take pride in what I 've gained , ” Stambaugh told the Anchorage Daily News [ Jan. 31 , 1997 ] .
“ I would never do anything to undermine the city or the police department . ”
Palin , when questioned by the Anchorage paper , said she had n't actually fired them .
Stambaugh then read to her over the phone the letter he had received from her office , which said , “ Although I appreciate your service as police chief , I 've decided it 's time for a change .
I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla .
Therefore I intend to terminate your employment . ”
“ If that 's not a letter of termination , I do n't know what is , ” Stambaugh said .
Palin ultimately decided to keep the librarian , but fired the man with 26 years of law enforcement experience .
And whether she kept the librarian in part due to the public 's growing outrage at her actions , prompting talk of a recall petition , is not known .
Stambaugh fought back , and slapped a lawsuit on the city .
While most officials serve at the pleasure of the mayor , he had negotiated a contract that ensured he could not be fired without “ cause . ”
Palin said she fired him because she did n't feel he was loyal to her .
Stambaugh 's suit alleged he was fired because he advocated closing bars early to combat alcohol - related traffic accidents , for supporting a concealed - gun law that the NRA supported , and for being a large male ( over six feet tall ) that Palin , so he had been told , found intimidating .
( Stambaugh ultimately lost his suit . )
In late 2000 , the residents of Alaska faced a state - wide initiative to cap property taxes .
While Palin's name was listed on the initiative 's Web site as being in support of the cap , when questioned shortly before the vote , Palin , perhaps responding to growing citizen concerns about the measure , said she 'd seen more problems in it recently , especially for rural cities and boroughs who might rely upon such taxes , and refused to be a spokesperson for the measure .
While claiming she was glad the measure was on the ballot , Palin was coy about how she 'd eventually vote .
When pressed for her answer by a reporter , Palin replied , after giving several evasive statements , " I 'm so sorry I 'm such a weasel . "
Lisa Pease is a historian who has studied the Kennedy assassinations and other enduring political mysteries .

A record 1.6 million barrels a day in American refined petroleum products were exported during the first four months of this year , up 33 per cent from 1.2 million barrels a day over the same period in 2007 .
Shipments this February topped 1.8 million barrels a day for the first time during any month , according to final numbers from the Energy Department .

This is an interesting phenomenon :
One contributor to the recent drop in crude prices has been the rise in US gasoline and diesel stocks due to falling demand :
These rises in stocks are even more impressive when you consider that , so far in 2008 , US product exports are running at 1.6 million bpd -- up by 312,000 bpd over 2007 ( Source : EIA ) .
Stocks continue to build even though large volumes of gasoline and diesel are being exported .
When I was 18 and newly arrived in the US , I used to wonder around enjoying new features like the rule of law and great libraries everywhere .
Once while bumming out in North Denver I went into the Regis University library determined to read about physics .
I had tried that once before , back in my high school , with poor results .
As a teenager I had been obsessed with " understanding " physics and chemistry , especially atomic and quantum theory .
I did n't know enough math to study the subjects deeply , but I wanted a conceptual grasp , however incomplete , that was at least half - way consistent and clear .
My high school books and classes left me with the strong feeling that I simply did not get physics .
Try as I might , I could not accept the bizarre results of quantum mechanics , wave - particle duality , or how Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle could even be science .
I was baffled .
When I brought it up with teachers , they had ready - made analogies to " teach " what happened in this sub-atomic world .
" Think of the solar system , " " think of springs connected to each other , " " well , it 's like this , suppose you have ... "
These analogies did n't help at all .
" You think too concretely , that 's why you can't visualize it , " told me a teacher .
So I 'd sit there and try things , think nonverbally , think in wild shapes , somehow think differently to see if I could imagine a sub-atomic particle and " get it . "
No go .
I wondered whether programming had perhaps damaged my mind by making it inflexible .
I went to the school library and found a more advanced physics book , a bit tattered but no matter .
I quit reading when I realized the book still assumed the existence of the ether .
" Screw this , " I thought .
So I flipped off the science bit , kept to my computers , and carried on .
But here I was in the USA , land of opportunity and well - stocked libraries .
Looking in the physics section I saw " The Feynman Lectures on Physics " sitting there , three volumes .
I had a vague idea of who Feynman was , so I picked up the books and went straight to Volume 3 , Chapter 1 , Quantum Behavior .
In the very first page he comes right out and says :
Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about .
They do not behave like waves , they do not behave like particles , they do not behave like clouds , or billiard balls , or weights on springs , or like anything that you have ever seen . (...)
Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience , it is very difficult to get used to , and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone -- both to the novice and the experienced physicist .
Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to , and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not , because all of direct human experience and human intuition applies to large objects .
We know how large objects will act , but things on a small scale just do not act that way .
I felt a rush of enthusiasm reading this .
It was so humble and visceral and honest .
This was science in a way I had never seen before , simultaneously more rigorous and human .
That first page alone drove a sledgehammer to my worldview and started rebuilding it .
Perhaps childishly , I thought of the Hacker 's Manifesto : " we 've been spoon - fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak . "
I had just found one hell of a juicy stake .
At one point Feynman asks students to imagine the various electromagnetic fields and waves in the classroom : coming from the earth 's interior , carrying radio and TV signals , traveling from warm foreheads to the blackboard , and so on .
Then he says :
I have asked you to imagine these electric and magnetic fields .
What do you do ?
Do you know how ?
How do I imagine the electric and magnetic field ?
What do I actually see ?
What are the demands of the scientific imagination ?
Is it any different from trying to imagine that the room is full of invisible angels ?
No , it is not like imagining invisible angels .
It requires a much higher degree of imagination (... ) .
Why ?
Because invisible angels are understandable . (...)
So you say , " Professor , please give me an approximate description of the electromagnetic waves , even though it may be slightly innacurate , so that I too can see them as well as I can see almost - invisible angels .
Then I will modify the picture to the necessary abstraction . "
I 'm sorry I can't do that for you .
I do n't know how .
I have no picture of this electromagnetic field that is in any sense accurate . (...)
So if you have some difficulty in making such a picture , you should not be worried that your difficulty is unusual .
Volume 2 , pages 20 - 9 and 20-10
Surely you 're joking - you do n't know ??
I could hardly believe what I was reading .
I had been hoping for a better explanation - a masterful analogy of weights on springs that would allow me to really understand physics .
Instead , here was a Nobel laureate telling me that he did n't really understand it either - not in the definite , make - believe fashion of high school science .
Feynman lifted the veil for me - all my sanitized textbooks and uninspired teachers presented science with finality and devoid of context , as if the gods had handed down a few scientific models to us .
Analogies that were meant to " help understand " reality had in fact supplanted it ; it was not simplification , but a gross distortion of what science really is .
This fake teaching would never say that atomic behavior is " peculiar and mysterious " because " human intuition applies to large objects . "
No , its entire aim was to pretend that science is not mysterious .
Feynman embraces the whole of science : its beauty , its methods , the history and relationships of its ideas , how our minds react to it , and above all how it stands before the ultimate judge , nature .
He 's at once fiercely empirical yet mindful of the crucial human context surrounding scientific ideas .
The lectures are not only great technical writing but also a deep look into how we think about the world , into reason and the nature of knowledge .
Of course , much of the work is to be done with paper , pencil , and math .
Back then I did n't even know calculus , so I could n't really follow all the equations .
But the books still gave me what I was looking for , and then some .
Now I have an undergrad in math , which puts me roughly in the 18th century , but better equipped to learn on my own .
Some day I hope to take time off and hit physics again .
If you want to read more of his stuff , Feynman wrote an insightful essay on engineering and there 's the classic Cargo Cult Science , both online .
Amazon has the lectures along with other books , and so might your local library . :)

Jewish voters complain of anti-Obama poll
Jewish voters are complaining of a poll that , after confirming their religion , asks a series of questions that appear aimed at alarming Jewish voters , including linking Barack Obama to Palestinian terrorist groups .
Debbie Minden of Pittsburgh described receiving the call from " Research Strategies " late yesterday afternoon .
And a Key West woman , Joelna Marcus , reportedly received a similar - sounding call from the same group , according reports from the Obama - backing organization JewsVote.org and from a liberal blog .
Minden , a psychologist who lives in the Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill , said the poll -- which came from an identified number -- began with relatively inocuous questions about what organizations she belongs to , whether she prefers CNN or Fox News , and how Obama and McCain compare on a range of issues , from national security to hte economy to education .
The caller also asked whether she was Jewish .
" It sounded like a real poll , " Minden , 56 , asaid .
Then the caller asked , as she recalled : " Would it change your mind about Obama if you knew that his church was anti-Israel ?
Would it change you rmind if you knew that the leaders Hamas had endorsed Obama ?
Would it change your mind if you knew he had met with the leaders of Hamas ? "
She also said one question asked whether it would change her mind if she learned he were a Muslim , though she did n't recall the precise wording .
The poll lasted about 15 minutes , she said .
Marcus gave a similar account to JewsVote 's Mik Moore , who wrote in an email that Marcus was asked if her opinion of Barack Obama would change if she knew that he had given money to the Palestinian Liberation Organization .
Marcus could n't immediately be reached .
If you 've gotten a similar poll , or know someone who has , please get in touch .
UPDATE : Jewish readers in New Jersey and Philadelphia report getting the call , as did The New Republic 's Michigan - based Jonathan Cohn , who took notes , and lists the negative messages :
Obama has had a decade long relationship with pro-Palestinian leaders in Chicago the leader of Hamas , Ahmed Yousef , expressed support for Obama and his hope for Obama 's victory the church Barack Obama has attended is known for its anti-Israel and anti-American remarks Jimmy Carter 's anti-Israel national security advisor is one of Barack Obama 's foreign policy advisors Barack Obama was the member of a board ( sic ) that funded a pro-Palestinian chartiable organization Barack Obama called for holding a summit of Muslim nations exlcuding Israel if elected president

There are stories making the rounds about how Barack Obama is set to expand George W. Bush ‘s faith - based programs — and allow groups to hire / fire based on religion :
Reaching out to evangelical voters , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is announcing plans to expand President Bush ’s program steering federal social service dollars to religious groups and — in a move sure to cause controversy — support some ability to hire and fire based on faith .
Before you jump to any conclusions and lash out against Obama , MSNBC reports that this is n’t entirely accurate :
( Note : The Associated Press initially reported Obama supports “ their ( faith - based organizations ’ ) ability to hire and fire based on faith . ”
NBC reports the campaign says Obama ’s plan would prevent organizations from discriminating based on faith .
The Associated Press changed its wording to say , “ some ability to hire and fire based on faith . ”
The campaign says this second version is still inaccurate . )
In fact , Obama only “ supports letting religious institutions hire and fire based on faith in the non-taxpayer funded portions of their activities . ”
Obama ’s plan is one most non-religious people , I imagine , could get behind .
What is his campaign actually pushing for ?
Here ’s what they are in favor of ( PDF ) :
Obama ’s initiative will be governed by a set of core principles for federal grant recipients .
In order to receive federal funds to provide social services , faith - based organizations : Cannot use federal funds to proselytize or provide religious sectarian instruction .
or provide religious sectarian instruction .
Cannot discriminate against nonmembers in providing services .
They must remain open to all and cannot practice religious discrimination against the populations they serve .
They must remain open to all and cannot practice religious discrimination against the populations they serve .
Must comply with federal anti-discrimination laws , including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
Religious organizations that receive federal dollars cannot discriminate with respect to hiring for government - funded social service programs .
Can only use taxpayer dollars on secular programs and initiatives .
and initiatives .
Must prove their efficacy and be judged based on program effectiveness .
They will be expected to demonstrate proven program outcomes to continue to receive funding .
Obama will fund programs that work and end funding for programs that do not — whether they are large or small , well - established or new , faith - based or otherwise .
I understand many of us would prefer him not giving money to “ faith - based ” groups at all , but with these conditions , they may as well be non-religious organizations .
So let him talk up his faith and get the religious votes .
It ’s not like he ’s doing them any special favors .
*** UPDATE 1***: In addition , notice the words he used in the speech :
I ’m not saying that faith - based groups are an alternative to government or secular nonprofits .
And I ’m not saying that they ’re somehow better at lifting people up .
What I ’m saying is that we all have to work together – Christian and Jew , Hindu and Muslim ; believer and non-believer alike – to meet the challenges of the 21st century .
…
Now , make no mistake , as someone who used to teach constitutional law , I believe deeply in the separation of church and state , but I do n’t believe this partnership will endanger that idea — so long as we follow a few basic principles .
First , if you get a federal grant , you ca n’t use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you ca n’t discriminate against them — or against the people you hire — on the basis of their religion .
Second , federal dollars that go directly to churches , temples , and mosques can only be used on secular programs .
And we ’ll also ensure that taxpayer dollars only go to those programs that actually work .
*** UPDATE 2***: Americans United is still against this “ expansion ” on principle :
Rev. Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , criticized Obama ’s proposed expansion of a program he said has undermined civil rights and civil liberties .
“ I am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the Bush administration , ” he said .
“ It ought to be shut down , not continued . ”
Well , yes , it should be shut down altogether , I agree .
But realistically , Obama ca n’t get rid of the faith - based program without pissing off large numbers of religious voters .
So his alternative is to keep it and make it as secular as possible .
Which seems to be where he ’s going with it .
*** UPDATE 3***: Americans United says a bit more in this press release .
Note the headline and sub - headline at the top :
Obama Support For Expansion Of ‘ Faith - Based ’ Program Is Disappointing , Says Americans United But Watchdog Group Says Candidate ’s Opposition To Religious Discrimination In Hiring And Publicly Funded Proselytism Are Steps In Right Direction … “ I am disappointed , ” said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn , Americans United executive director .
“ This initiative has been a failure on all counts , and it ought to be shut down , not expanded . ”
However , Lynn said he was pleased to hear Obama express support for church - state separation and say that he would bar government - funded proselytism and religious discrimination in hiring when tax dollars are involved .
“ It is imperative that public funds not pay for proselytizing or subsidize discrimination in hiring , ” said Lynn .
“ Obama has promised that he will not support publicly funded proselytism or discrimination in hiring , and that ’s an important commitment . ”
*** UPDATE 4***: American Atheists apparently did not get the memo on anything written above .
In an email , they write :
Frank Zindler , Acting President of American Atheists , said that Obama
was “ horse trading the constitutional separation of government and
religion for votes . ”
“ This makes it official — the Democrats are trying to outdo their
Republican colleagues in using religion and the lure of more taxpayer
money to turn houses of worship into voting blocks , ” said Zindler .
“ Obama wants to continue the discriminatory policy of taxing millions of
Atheists , Freethinkers , Humanists and other Americans who profess no
religious beliefs , and give that money to organized religion .
That ’s
unfair , that ’s discriminatory , and it endangers our First Amendment
freedom . ”
Dave Silverman , Communications Director for American Atheists , said that the Obama pledge to continue Bush ’s programs is a risky economic and social experiment .
“ The faith - based initiative allows religious groups to use our money in programs that are poorly monitored , have little or no accountability , and drain resources for their more effective secular counterparts , ” said Silverman .
“ This is pandering to religious groups , and offers the lure of free government cash in exchange for political support . ”
*** UPDATE 5***: The Council for Secular Humanism joins in on the attack parade in their own press release :
The Council for Secular Humanism regrets that Senator Barack Obama has seen fit to affirm a willingness to extend the unconstitutional faith - based diversion of tax dollars to religious institutions as begun by President Bush .
“ This is basically religious pandering , ” said Ronald A. Lindsay , executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism . …
“ We find it regrettable that the current climate in the United States requires candidates , who obviously should know better , to promise grave compromises of the wall of separation between religion and government in order to even stand a chance of being elected to high office , ” continued Lindsay The Council is disappointed that Obama ’s plan appears to allow federal funds to flow directly to houses of worship .
“ Not only does this impermissibly entangle religion and government , Obama ’s plan threatens the autonomy of religious bodies by allowing government intrusion directly into the activities of the house of worship , ” said Lindsay .
“ The audits , compliance reviews , and reporting requirements that the government will have to perform to account for the funds will threaten the autonomy and integrity of the house of worship . ”
*** UPDATE 6***: The right wing Heritage Foundation is blasting Obama for his proposal !
You know if they ’re mad , he did something right :
… even worse , Obama ’s plan says that when a faith - based organization takes federal dollars , it would lose its ability to preserve its faith - based character through maintaining hiring standards consistent with its mission .
It could be forced to hire an atheist .
In other words , it would strike at the heart of the faith - based initiative .
*** UPDATE 7***: The Secular Coalition for America weighs in :
The Coalition calls for the next administration to end , not re-invent , the flawed and failed experiment called the faith - based initiative .
Twisting our Constitution to fit a “ new and improved ” version ca n’t change the fact that funneling tax dollars to religious organizations is , at its core , unconstitutional .
…
Because the current program is rife with problems , the Secular Coalition for America thanks Senator Obama for recognizing the constitutional dangers of faith - based programs : using federal funds to proselytize , religious tests for aid recipients , and religious discrimination in hiring practices .
Unfortunately , it appears that Obama still fails to understand that constitutional mandates quite simply prohibit “ federal dollars that go directly to churches , temples , and mosques . ”
Direct federal funding of houses of worship , regardless of how the funds are used , is a violation of the separation of church and state .

Marginal Oil Production Costs Rising
Rising marginal production costs for additional barrels of oil put a pretty high long term floor on oil prices .
Last year analysts estimated it cost around $ 60 a barrel to produce light oil from here .
The most recent estimate from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers ( CAPP ) now puts that number at $ 75 to $ 90 .
Comparatively , Saudi Arabian crude is said to cost around $ 1 a barrel .
The oil tar sands in Alberta are not the only expensive place to produce oil .
The deep water Gulf of Mexico oil has a similar cost .
Peter Robertson , vice chairman of Chevron , recently told lawmakers that the cost of new production in the deep water Gulf of Mexico could exceed $ 95 a barrel .
I would expect Tupi and other deep water fields off of Brazil to have similar or even higher costs .
One can find a similar trend across the fossil fuels extraction industries .
Chesapeake Energy , a big natural gas outfit , reports more than a doubling in the cost of natural gas extraction from 2Q 2003 to 2Q 2008 .
A deep recession could cause prices to fall below marginal costs .
But prices will eventually rise up to or above marginal production costs .
The age of cheap fossil fuels has ended .
We can't enter a new era in cheap energy prices without breakthroughs in solar , nuclear , and biomass energy .
The Economist has a good write - up of a recent PLoS
One study that found that the perceived ‘ human - ness ’ of another player in a game altered the extent of activation in brain areas associated with understanding others ’ mental states .
The participants were asked to play the prisoner ’s dilemma game in a brain scanner and were introduced to four opponents – software on a laptop , a laptop controlled by robotic hands , a humanoid robot and a real human .
In reality though , the other players ’ moves were all randomly generated .
Dr Krach and Dr Kircher chose the ‚ Äúprisoner ‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù game because it involves a difficult choice : whether to co-operate with the other player or betray him .
Co-operation brings the best outcome , but trying to co-operate when the other player betrays you brings the worst .
The tendency is for both sides to choose betrayal ( thus obtaining an intermediate result ) unless a high level of trust exists between them .
The game thus requires each player to try to get into the mind of the other , in order to predict what he might do .
This sort of thinking tends to increase activity in parts of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex and the right temporo - parietal junction .
The scanner showed that the more human - like the supposed opponent , the more such neural activity increased .
A questionnaire also revealed that the volunteers enjoyed the games most when they played human - like opponents , whom they perceived to be more intelligent .
Dr Krach and Dr Kircher reckon this shows that the less human - like a robot is in its appearance , the less it will be treated as if it were human .
That may mean it will be trusted less ‚Äîand might therefore not sell as well as a humanoid design .
It ’s an interesting extension of a type of study first pioneered by psychologist Helen Gallagher and colleagues where she asked people to play ‘ paper , scissors , stone ’ supposedly against human and computer opponents in a PET scanning study .
Like with this recent study , all ‘ opponents ’ were actually just a series of randomly generated moves but the participants showed significantly greater brain activation in the frontal cortex when playing against the supposedly ‘ human ’ opponent than versus the computer .
The philosopher Daniel Dennett suggests that attributing mental states is a particular way of thinking about something that he calls the ‘ intentional stance ‘ .
For example , we might play a chess computer and treat it if it was ‘ intending ’ to take our our bishop , or as if it ‘ believed ’ that getting the Queen out would be an advantage , but this says nothing about whether the machine actually has intentions or beliefs .
Of course , we can apply this to humans , and just because we find it useful to talk about others ’ beliefs , it does n’t mean belief is necessarily a scientifically sound concept .

Until recently , spaceflight has been the preserve of nations .
The USA and USSR battled away in the space race of the 1950s and 1960s , and China recently jumped into the expensive game by sending people into orbit .
But thanks to the Ansari X Prize , private rocketeers have been working hard to end the state monopoly on spaceflight .
Unfortunately , it 's not all smooth launching , as Space X discovered with the loss of its Falcon 1 rocket yesterday .
Falcon 1 DemoFlight 2 prior to liftoff .
The March 20 , 2007 test flight reached
an altitude
of approximately 290 km .
The dawn of the last century saw industrial magnates like Carnegie and Rockefeller use their amassed wealth to fund causes they felt worthwhile ; the modern equivalent would have to be the dotcom moguls , and standout among them might be Elon Musk , founder of PayPal .
Musk is involved with a number of efforts to break paradigms , many of which are now being done for profit along with the good of mankind .
One venture is the Tesla Roadster , an electric - powered sports car derived from the Lotus Elise , and another is Space X , a company that aims to " reduce the cost and increase the reliability of space access by a factor of ten . "
Unfortunately for Space X , the loss of another rocket was the third unsuccessful attempt with the Falcon 1 , a liquid fueled ( oxygen and kerosene ) two - stage launch vehicle that will form the basis of its model line up .
Space X has n't just lost a rocket , though .
The flight was carrying a trio of small satellites belonging to NASA and the DoD .
Perhaps less seriously , but probably more newsworthy , the ashes of over 200 people were also on board , including a pair of rather well known astronauts , one actual , one fictional .
They were Gordon Cooper , one of the original Mercury 7 , and " Scotty " himself , James Doohan .
Falcon 1 flight 3 was lost during the attempted separation of the second stage .
The previous attempts were stymied by a fuel leak ( flight 1 ) and a loss of control following second stage separation ( flight 2 ) .
In a statement to employees , Musk said that he would never give up and noted that the company has significant resources behind it .
" As a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit , SpaceX recently accepted a significant investment , " he wrote .
" Combined with our existing cash reserves , that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching Falcon 1 and develop Falcon 9 and Dragon .
There should be absolutely zero question that SpaceX will prevail in reaching orbit and demonstrating reliable space transport .
For my part , I will never give up and I mean never . "
Virgin Galactic
Developing a private orbital delivery system for unmanned payloads is one thing , but building a machine that takes people into space without the backing of a government is another .
For a very large fee , you can go into space with the Russians , but the multimillion dollar ticket excludes pretty much everyone save the aforementioned dotcom billionaires .
Richard Branson , the bearded hypemachine from the UK , is attempting to capitalize on this gap in the market with Virgin Galactic .
That company recently revealed the mother vehicle ( White Knight Two ) for its two - stage system , which builds on the lessons learned from SpaceShip One , winner of the Ansari X Prize .
White Knight
Two will carry the second stage , SpaceShip Two , which will actually take the passengers into space .
A ride on SpaceShip Two will cost around $ 200,000 ( as of now ) and over 200 people have signed up .
One hopes they have a better trip than Scotty and pals .
See , nothing to worry about .
A pollster whose mathematical model has correctly predicted every winner of the White House popular vote since 1988 is banking on a decisive victory for Democrat Barack Obama in November .
Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz said Wednesday that according to his “ time for change ” model , Obama would secure 54.3 percent of the popular vote against 45.7 percent for Republican John McCain .
That margin would virtually guarantee a crushing victory for the Democrat in the state - by - state electoral college that actually selects the next president , Abramowitz said .

The presidential campaign of John McCain is setting some pretty lofty expectations for Obama ’s poll bump coming out of the Denver convention .
McCain ’s Director of Strategy Sarah Simmons wrote a memo that suggests that Obama will get a 15 point poll bump from the convention .
“ Monday marks the beginning of the Democratic National Convention in Denver .
A combination of factors makes this particular convention historic on many levels .
Democrats have just completed an incredibly compelling primary cycle that has both energized and divided the Democratic Party .
Because of the unique nature of the Democratic primary , we believe Obama will receive a significant bump from his convention , ” the memo said .
It compared Obama to Bill Clinton ’s bump in 1992 , “ This cycle mirrors Bill Clinton ’s Democratic convention in 1992 : A historic 16 - point bump .
Barack Obama is more similarly situated to Bill Clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history .
Bill Clinton was a new candidate on the national scene ; he was running in a “ change ” oriented election cycle and the economy was voters ’ top issue — a dynamic he was able to capitalize on .
He received a 16 - point bump coming out of his convention . .. ”

Simmons thinks that Obama will give a great speech on Thursday that will get massive media coverage , “ Obama ’s stadium address on Thursday — the 45th anniversary of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s “ I Have A Dream ” speech — will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage .
On Thursday , Obama will give a great speech , as has been his trademark .
The press will sing his praises and remark on his historic address and Obama ’s place in history .
For example , The Associated Press today published an article comparing the historic nature of the addresses – a week before Obama ’s speech .
This coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls . ”
She concludes that Obama will get a 15 point bounce , “ We believe Obama will see a significant bump , and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 - point bounce out of a convention in this political environment . ”
There is a bit of gamesmanship involved in this estimate .
If the post convention polls show a smaller bounce , then the McCain people can point to it as a sign of Obama ’s vulnerability .
On the other hand , if Obama hits their number , they can say that this is what they expected .
I think their analysis is fairly right on .
The only problem they face is if Obama gets a truly massive bounce of 20 points .
That level of a bounce would be historic , and it would likely signal some real problems for McCain this fall .

Enlarge By Jack Gruber , USA TODAY Ringing out the Summer Games : More than 1,000 silver bell dancers performed at the closing ceremonies in Beijing .
For NBC , it 's goodbye , Beijing ; hello , London .
The torch is out , the drums are stilled , and the network is off to Britain for the next Summer Olympics — and a new set of challenges .
On the plus side , it wo n't face pressure to examine British politics or similar criticism for its shilling willingness to take everything in China at face value .
And on the negative ?
Start with a far less adaptable time difference , which means you can begin rehearsing your prime - time tape complaints right now .
What should NBC do to prepare ?
Here 's a 2012 to - do list : • Pat yourself on the back .
It 's only fair to pause first for a compliment .
Yes , NBC could have done more to bring China into the coverage , but its coverage of the events themselves was beautifully shot and for the most part sensibly packaged and presented .
Throw in the options provided by cable and the Internet ( which are only likely to expand ) , and you have the best overall Olympic experience ever provided by a U.S. network .
• Package truthfully .
We understand why you want to hide the results of events you 're planning to air later .
But do n't lie to us and pretend the events have n't happened , and do n't lie to the West with an on - screen " live " notice that applied only in the East .
You have four years to find a way to remove that mark .
You can do it .
• Or maybe convince people live does n't matter .
In TV math , five hours is actually greater than 12 .
Events held in the morning in China fell into prime time in America , enabling NBC to have something live in most time zones every evening .
But when it 's prime time here , it 's the middle of the night in London , and there 's no way the British are hosting swimming finals at 4 a .m.
Brace for tape .
Will we see any major events in real time ?
Possibly , if NBC decides to show them twice : live in the afternoon , on tape at night .
Do n't expect that to happen , unless NBC can persuade advertisers to pay top dollars for a show that 's not just taped , but a repeat .
• Stiffen up your backbone .
Like skating in the winter , gymnastics always seems to provoke controversies — and NBC once again seemed under - prepared for them .
It took the network too long to comment on charges of favoritism and far too long to do any useful reporting on the age question .
• Re-sign Bob Costas .
It 's hard to imagine a better NBC anchor choice ; Costas seemed to become looser and freer as the Games went on .
Plus , he interacted well with Mary Carillo and Cris Collinsworth , who made up for a lack of Olympic knowledge with an intimate knowledge of what it takes to be a world - class athlete .
•
And the answer is … What is the point of sticking a microphone in the face of some poor guy who just lost a medal and asking him how he feels ?
And stop using microphones to snoop on team huddles , as NBC did at the gymnastics events .
It 's creepy .
And very un -British .

If you are not well - versed in the wide variety of peppers , you probably do n't know the level of spice each type of chili pepper contains .
Whether it's a poblano ( dried are called ancho ) , jalapeño , habanero , or serrano , each has different degrees of heat , which is determined by how much capsaicin ( a compound responsible for the pungency ) is present in the pepper .
Luckily , this capsaicin can be measured in Scoville Heat Units , or SHU , on the Scoville scale .
This scale lists the peppers by how may SHU are in each pepper , from the thousands for milder peppers all the way up to the hundreds of thousands and even millions for the spiciest varieties .
The presence of capsaicinoids in chili peppers is an irritant , but it is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoriant effects from ingesting capsaicin .
Fans of chiles attribute this to a pain - stimulated release of endorphins .
A different reaction makes capsaicinoids useful as analgesics : applied topically , the heat of the ​chili gives relief to muscle pains and some forms of neuropathy . ​
How the Scale Works
The Scoville Heat Scale is a measuring tool developed by a pharmaceutical company employee named Wilbur Scoville in 1912 .
His original method was called the Scoville Organoleptic Test and used human tasters to evaluate how many parts of sugar water it takes to neutralize the heat .
The pepper would be ground up and then mixed with the sugar water .
The testers would taste the pepper - water mixture , and the sugar water would then be increased until the pepper was no longer hot to the taster .
The peppers would be given a numerical value based on the number of times the dilution was added to mask the heat .
For example , if a pepper is rated at 15,000 SHU , it took 15,000 additions of sugar water for the taster to no longer feel the burn .
Unfortunately , this procedure was not very reliable and completely subjective .
Nowadays , human tasters are spared , and a new process called High - Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) measures the number of capsaicinoids ( capsaicin ) the pepper contains in parts per million .
The American Spice Trade Association ( ASTA ) uses HPLC and then assigns an ASTA Pungency Unit as a measurement of the heat detected .
These units are then converted into SHU — 1 ASTA unit is equal to 15 Scoville units .
Although the current method of measuring chili pepper heat is much more reliable than the previous technique , there is still room for variation .
The conditions in which the pepper grows will affect the level of spice in the pepper ; so if the same type of pepper was grown in different types of soil with varying amounts of sunlight , the amount of capsaicin will differ .
There is also some question on the accuracy of the conversion of from ASTA units to SHU .
From Mild to Inedible
The Scoville scale measures the heat level in all kinds of peppers , from sweet bell peppers and pimentos ( which have almost no SHU ) to the Carolina Reaper , which can hit above 2 million SHU .
A few of the peppers on the high end of the scale are not for human consumption — they are just way too hot to eat .
( Although you will find people who try them as a challenge or a dare . )
Even so , chili pepper aficionados are locked in intense rivalry to create the world 's hottest pepper .
Since 2011 , when the competition began to heat up ( pun intended ) , the title of hottest pepper has changed hands a number of times as new crosses and genetic mutations have emerged .
In 2013 , the Carolina Reaper was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world 's hottest pepper , and peaks at 2,200,000 SHU .
Hot Pepper Scale in Scoville Units
On the Scoville scale , different pepper varieties are categorized into heat ratings , with 0 being the mildest and 12 representing the highest heat .

So bizarre , so immense is the Burning Man Festival that it is , as its adherents take pride in claiming , a difficult thing to describe .
But let me try .
Annually , during the last week of August , some 50,000 people descend upon Nevada 's remote Black Rock Desert , 110 miles north of Reno -- the type of place that gives meaning to the idiom " middle of nowhere . "
There they engage in a weeklong bacchanal that mixes Woodstock with Mad Max and , in toto , resembles a kind of surreal , sprawling state fair .
Burning Man is not for the timid .
The camping conditions are horrible ; daytime temperatures reach well over 90 degrees Fahrenheit , and two eight - hour dust storms struck during the course of this year 's festival , reducing visibility to 10 feet and covering everything with silt .
Public nudity is in vogue , and the practice of toplessness ( and sometimes bottomlessness ) extends from small - town teenage girls -- one was seen calling out , loudly , for the services of a body - painter -- to the 60 - somethings clutching each other in a fully nude embrace at the " Polyamory Paradise " camp .
Finally , the place is utterly saturated with drugs .
Everything is available , from alcohol and cannabis to Ecstasy and research chemicals with names like 2C - I .
Uncomfortable with at least a few of Burning Man 's debaucheries , but curious about this fabled slice of the American counterculture , I decided to go , joining a camp that included two semi-itinerant Wesleyan grads , a McKinsey consultant , the daughter of a British peer and an editor of National Review .
Burning Man lures some very strange types to its brand of escapism , but they are strange affluent types .
After entering the festival gates , one passes into a demonetized society where the rides on the giant seesaws , the rounds of miniature golf , the costumes , the body - paint jobs and everything else are dished out gratis .
Still , merely to participate in this bout of unreality comes with a high price tag .
Gate admission is $ 295 , and the rental RVs in which many " Burners " stay go for $ 2,500 for the week .
And then there is the cost of airfare , gas , food and other substances .
Flying from Montana , staying in a tent and splitting expenses , I spent just north of $ 1,000 .

Others may stumble , but not you , on hiccough , thorough , laugh and through .
Well done !
And now you wish , perhaps , to learn of less familiar traps ?
Beware of heard , a dreadful word , that looks like beard and sounds like bird .
And dead -- it 's said like bed not bead -- and for goodness ' sake do n't call it deed !
Watch out for meat and great and threat ( They rhyme with suite and straight and debt ) A moth is not the moth in mother , nor both in bother , broth in brother .
And here is not a match for there , nor dear and fear for bear and pear .
And then there 's dose and rose and lose -- just look them up -- and goose and choose , and cork and work and card and ward , and font and front and word and sword , and do and go and thwart and cart -- come , come I 've hardly made a start .
A dreadful language ?
Man alive .
I 'd mastered it when I was five .

In the midst of the election season the tensions are running high and candidates are being put to the test with their knowledge of U.S. history , geography and trivia .
There have been some embarrassing gaffes from both sides ; Obama 's Auschwitz / Buchenwald confusion and McCain 's reference to an imaginary Iraq / Pakistan border to name but a couple .
But how much does the average person know about the U .

Meanwhile , in the spirit of the season , here are some interesting tidbits about some past U.S. presidents ...
- 6th President John Quincy Adams ( March 4 , 1825 – March 4 , 1829 ) , customarily took a nude early morning swim in the Potomac River .
- 8th President Martin Van Buren ( March 4 , 1837 – March 4,1841 ) was the first President born after the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4 1776 making him the first President born a U.S. citizen .
Van Buren was delivered on December 5 , 1782 .

- 16th President Abraham Lincoln ( March 4 , 1861 – April 15 , 1865 ) was the tallest President .
He stood 6 feet , 4 inches ( 193 centimeters ) tall .
- 20th President James A. Garfield ( March 4 , 1881 – September 19 , 1881 ) was able to write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other
- 22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland ( March 4 , 1893 – March 4 , 1897 ) ( March 4 , 1885 – March 4 , 1889 ) discovered a malignant cancer on the roof of his mouth in 1893 against the backdrop of a market crisis involving free silver coinage .
To avoid further market panic , he and his doctors snuck aboard a cruise boat and performed surgery to remove the growth .
The public were told that he was on a fishing trip and first discovered the truth in 1917 .

- 26th President Theodore Roosevelt ( September 14 , 1901 – March 4 , 1909 ) gave the teddy bear its name .
On a hunting trip to Mississippi , a number of Roosevelt 's aides chased an American Black Bear until it was exhausted before clubbing it and tying it to a willow tree so that the president could make a kill on what had so far been an unsuccessful hunt .
The president refused to kill the old bear for sport , ordering that it be put down to end its suffering .
The anecdote inspired a cartoon that was run in numerous papers of Roosevelt sparing a cute , large - headed bear cub .
A New York shopkeeper , Morris Michtom , saw the cartoons and came upon the idea of selling toy bears under the name " Teddy 's Bear " .
The rest is history .
- 29th President Warren Gamaliel Harding ( March 4 , 1921 – August 2 , 1923 ) , who became infamous for his White House poker games where the whiskey flowed freely despite Prohibition and for his keen interest in burlesque , also died under mysterious circumstances against the backdrop of a scandal .
Harding 's administration was accused of transferring naval oil reserves in Wyoming into private hands in return for bribes in what became known as the Teapot Dome scandal .
After returning from holiday in Alaska as news of the disgrace was breaking out , Harding developed fatigue , symptoms of food poisoning and pneumonia before dying suddenly .
Some speculate that he was poisoned by his wife .
- 35th President John F. Kennedy ( January 20 , 1961 – November 22 , 1963 ) gave a speech in West Berlin in 1963 during the Cold War with the Soviet Union that emphasized the importance of the " free world " fighting the " Communist world " .
In an attempt to communicate with the Berliners in German , Kennedy 's speech included the phrase " Ich bin ein Berliner , " or " I am a Berliner . "
While his audience understood his meaning , that West Berlin represented the beginning of the free world , Kennedy had actually said something along the lines of " I am a popular local pastry product . "
By including the article " ein " before " Berliner " Kennedy introduced himself as a jam filled cake nicknamed ' the Berliner ' .

- 40th President Ronald Reagan was the oldest elected president at 69 years old .

A Year of Heavy Losses
A year ago , financial companies were flying high .
But as problems in the mortgage and credit markets have grown , the stocks of many Wall Street firms have been hard hit .
Some of the biggest companies have been bought out , taken over by the government or gone bankrupt .
Bigger Bling for the Beautiful With beauty can come better treatment -- but how far can it take you ?
Sept. 9 , 2008  --
All of us like to look at beautiful people , but does beauty really bring you privilege ?
A few people say no , beauty is a curse !
ABC's " The Bachelor , " the show where women compete to win the affection of a handsome man , often provides insights into the way these incredibly beautiful people think .
On one show one jilted contestant tearfully complained that there were plenty of disadvantages to being beautiful .
Watch the story Wednesday on " 20/20 " at 10 p.m. ET
" People are mean to me because of the way I look .
People hate me because I 'm beautiful , " she said .
" It 's a curse as much as it is a blessing to be pretty . "
The ' Beauty Penalty '
She might have a point , according to researchers Rick Wilson at Rice University and Catherine Eckel at the University of Texas at Dallas .
In a study called " Judging a Book by Its Cover : Beauty and Expectations in the Trust Game , " the researchers found what they call a " beauty penalty . "
" The beauty penalty is a kind of backlash that we had n't anticipated finding , " Eckel told " 20/20 . "
" People have very high expectations of the level of trust of beautiful people .
When beautiful people fail to live up to those expectations , they 're punished more harshly than people who are not beautiful , " Eckel said .
Wilson said pretty waitresses , for example , might be penalized with small tips .
" A beautiful waitress may provide extremely good service but not nearly the level that you might expect because of your expectations -- you may think that such a person ought to be providing fabulous service , " he said .
" And as a consequence , you penalize the person for not living up to your own expectations . "
Rob Shuter , executive editor of OK ! , the fastest growing celebrity magazine , says beauty helps everyone .
His magazine celebrates beautiful people like Lauren Conrad and Audrina Patridge of shows like MTV's " The Hills . "
Even politicians , Shuter says , benefit from their looks .
Sarah Palin for example .
Shuter says Palin would never have been nominated for vice president if she were n't good - looking .
She is a former beauty contestant .
The Right Look Is Everything
We saw some of the advantages of good looks as we watched the beautiful people sweep into an exclusive nightspot one night as others waited .
Roxy Summers , night life editor of heavy.com , a pop culture music and video Web site , arranged for " 20/20 " to videotape at the 205 Club in New York 's SoHo .
If you did n't have the right look , you were n't getting in .
" The door staff picks and chooses who are the beautiful people and who is going to create the look for the night , " Summers said .
And , as 205 's doorman Henry Binge confirmed , beauty opens doors .
" A beautiful face , of course , is gonna get everywhere for sure , " Binge said .
" It 's not about just beauty -- but beauty helps . "
Summers , however , had little sympathy for the people who could n't get in .
" I do n't really feel bad at all for the people outside .
I mean , you can't let everybody in . "
Beauty , Evolution at Work ?
We want to associate with beautiful people because we think their lives are so much better than ours , said Rutgers University anthropologist Helen Fisher .
" It 's just remarkable the attributes we give to a human being who is good looking , " Fisher said .
" We think that they are smart .
We think that they 're funny .
We think that they 're friendly and warm , and social and popular . "
But does that make sense ?
" I suppose it is stupid , but natural selection has evolved all kinds of mechanisms in order to win , and this is one of them , " Fisher said .
By natural selection , she means thousands of years of evolution .
Good looks are often a sign of health and fertility , so evolution has conditioned us to prefer certain looks .
" Do n't forget , it 's survival of the fittest , and if you have four children and I have no children , you live on and I die out , " she said .
" So this game of attraction really matters . "
Fisher pointed out that we could n't help our reaction to beauty .
It 's just automatic .
" When men take a look at a good - looking woman , all kinds of parts of the brain become active so that they can feel better .
They want her , " she said .
The Bigger the Diamond
Steve Jeffes , author of " Appearance Is Everything , " agreed .
To confirm a hunch , he questioned jewelers , who told him that very beautiful women who wear diamond rings will almost always wear larger diamonds -- more than one carat -- than less attractive women who also wear diamond rings .
But Fisher offered some hope , thanks to nice clothes , makeup and plastic surgery .
" What 's nice about it is that we live in a culture where you can begin to level the playing field .
Where both men and women can actually make themselves better looking , " she said .
They sure do .
It 's the basis for the " Extreme Makeover " TV shows .
When Heather Waghelstein appeared on the show in 2004 , she was a 33 - year - old aspiring actress who had difficulty landing roles or a boyfriend .
Among the procedures Waghelstein received from " Makeover " were a chin implant , a face - lift , liposculpting , Lasik eye surgery , tooth bonding and a hair transplant .
She told " 20/20 " that the makeover had changed her life .
" My relations with the opposite sex definitely changed .
I got a lot of attention when I came home , " she said .
" I would go out to bars with my friends and have drinks bought for me . "
Had she ever been bought drinks before her makeover ?
" Not at 11 o'clock at night , " Waghelstein said .
" At 3 o'clock at night , maybe I did , but there 's a difference . "
So many good things come from good looks -- including privilege .
" Men are more willing to move your furniture if you 're a beautiful girl , " Fisher said .
" They 're more willing to donate blood to you .
They 're more willing to stop on the side of the road and help you change your tire . "
Beauty Privilege Put to the Test
" 20/20 " has run tests that demonstrate that .
We once hired two actresses , one pretty , one kind of plain , loaded their arms with a stack of books , and asked them to drop the books in front of people walking by them in New York 's Greenwich Village .
Fewer than half the people who passed helped the plain - looking actress .
But when it was the prettier actress ' turn , 70 percent of the people nearby pitched in to help .
One man even came back with a shopping bag for the pretty girl 's books .
Then we went to Bazookas , a New Jersey sports bar known for having pretty servers .
We made up an actress to look homely and gave her a waitress job .
Would she then make less in tips than the other women ?
Sure enough , customers gave the homely actress smaller tips .
Her tips came to 17 percent of her checks .
The other servers averaged 25 percent .
People just respond well to good - looking people .
One customer told us , " It 's not fair , but I mean , that 's the way it is . "
Fisher says beauty bias is everywhere .
It 's called the " halo effect . "
" People assume that a person who 's very good - looking is doing a better job than in fact they are doing .
So they rise up in the company , and they have more status .
They have more power , " she said .
It 's unfair , especially if you 're not one of the " beautiful people . "
" It 's just not a fair world , " she said .
Well , here 's a bizarre story from the land of the Chowdah heads : Nick Kaczur , the New England Patriots offensive lineman , has according to the Boston Globe been secretly helped the DEA nab a major illegal prescription drug supplier .
Kaczur was arrested last April for illegal possession of oxy and then helped the police nab the dealer who was supplying him :
Kaczur — a 28 - year - old , 315 - pound offensive tackle — wore a hidden recording device during three different drug transactions in May at gas stations in Foxborough and North Attleborough and a supermarket parking lot in Sharon , according to the lawyer , the two people , and federal court documents .
At each of the three transactions , Kaczur paid $ 3,900 in cash to buy 100 OxyContin pills , a potent prescription pain reliever .
Federal agents arrested the alleged dealer , Daniel Ekasala , moments after the third transaction with Kaczur , said Ekasala 's lawyer .
He was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday on three counts of possession of oxycodone ( the main ingredient in the prescription drug OxyContin ) with intent to distribute .
He is due to be arraigned today in federal court .

From the Financial Times : Bank of China flees Fannie - Freddie
Bank of China has cut its portfolio of securities issued or guaranteed by troubled US mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by a quarter since the end of June .
The sale by China ’s fourth largest commercial bank , which reduced its holdings of so - called agency debt by $ 4.6bn is a sign of nervousness among foreign buyers of Fannie and Freddie ’s bonds and guaranteed securities .
The differences , or spreads , between Fannie 's and Freddie 's debt yields and Treasury yields have widened considerably since the start of the housing crisis because of jitters about the highly leveraged companies ' stability .
Last September , Fannie issued three - year debt at 0.55 % over Treasury yields .
Last week , it paid 1.23 % over Treasury yields .
This selling is probably why the spread between Fannie and Freddie debt yields and Treasury debt is so high .
From the WSJ last week : Deflating Mortgage Rates
So there was probably more foreign selling in July and August .
Editor 's Note :
This story was originally published in the February 1999 edition of Scientific American .
We are posting it in light of recent news involving Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch .
Individual investors and professional stock and currency traders know better than ever that prices quoted in any financial market often change with heart - stopping swiftness .
Fortunes are made and lost in sudden bursts of activity when the market seems to speed up and the volatility soars .
Last September , for instance , the stock for Alcatel , a French telecommunications equipment manufacturer , dropped about 40 percent one day and fell another 6 percent over the next few days .
In a reversal , the stock shot up 10 percent on the fourth day .
The classical financial models used for most of this century predict that such precipitous events should never happen .
A cornerstone of finance is modern portfolio theory , which tries to maximize returns for a given level of risk .
The mathematics underlying portfolio theory handles extreme situations with benign neglect : it regards large market shifts as too unlikely to matter or as impossible to take into account .
It is true that portfolio theory may account for what occurs 95 percent of the time in the market .
But the picture it presents does not reflect reality , if one agrees that major events are part of the remaining 5 percent .
An inescapable analogy is that of a sailor at sea .
If the weather is moderate 95 percent of the time , can the mariner afford to ignore the possibility of a typhoon ?
The risk - reducing formulas behind portfolio theory rely on a number of demanding and ultimately unfounded premises .
First , they suggest that price changes are statistically independent of one another : for example , that today ’s price has no influence on the changes between the current price and tomorrow’s .
As a result , predictions of future market movements become impossible .
The second presumption is that all price changes are distributed in a pattern that conforms to the standard bell curve .
The width of the bell shape ( as measured by its sigma , or standard deviation ) depicts how far price changes diverge from the mean ; events at the extremes are considered extremely rare .
Typhoons are , in effect , defined out of existence .
Do financial data neatly conform to such assumptions ?
Of course , they never do .
Charts of stock or currency changes over time do reveal a constant background of small up and down price movements — but not as uniform as one would expect if price changes fit the bell curve .
These patterns , however , constitute only one aspect of the graph .
A substantial number of sudden large changes — spikes on the chart that shoot up and down as with the Alcatel stock — stand out from the background of more moderate perturbations .
Moreover , the magnitude of price movements ( both large and small ) may remain roughly constant for a year , and then suddenly the variability may increase for an extended period .
Big price jumps become more common as the turbulence of the market grows — clusters of them appear on the chart .
According to portfolio theory , the probability of these large fluctuations would be a few millionths of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth .
( The fluctuations are greater than 10 standard deviations . )
But in fact , one observes spikes on a regular basis — as often as every month — and their probability amounts to a few hundredths .
Granted , the bell curve is often described as normal — or , more precisely , as the normal distribution .
But should financial markets then be described as abnormal ?
Of course not — they are what they are , and it is portfolio theory that is flawed .
Modern portfolio theory poses a danger to those who believe in it too strongly and is a powerful challenge for the theoretician .
Though sometimes acknowledging faults in the present body of thinking , its adherents suggest that no other premises can be handled through mathematical modeling .
This contention leads to the question of whether a rigorous quantitative description of at least some features of major financial upheavals can be developed .
The bearish answer is that large market swings are anomalies , individual “ acts of God ” that present no conceivable regularity .
Revisionists correct the questionable premises of modern portfolio theory through small fixes that lack any guiding principle and do not improve matters sufficiently .
My own work — carried out over many years — takes a very different and decidedly bullish position .
I claim that variations in financial prices can be accounted for by a model derived from my work in fractal geometry .
Fractals — or their later elaboration , called multifractals — do not purport to predict the future with certainty .
But they do create a more realistic picture of market risks .
Given the recent troubles confronting the large investment pools called hedge funds , it would be foolhardy not to investigate models providing more accurate estimates of risk .
Multifractals and the Market
An extensive mathematical basis already exists for fractals and multifractals .
Fractal patterns appear not just in the price changes of securities but in the distribution of galaxies throughout the cosmos , in the shape of coastlines and in the decorative designs generated by innumerable computer programs .
A fractal is a geometric shape that can be separated into parts , each of which is a reduced - scale version of the whole .
In finance , this concept is not a rootless abstraction but a theoretical reformulation of a down - to - earth bit of market folklore — namely , that movements of a stock or currency all look alike when a market chart is enlarged or reduced so that it fits the same time and price scale .
An observer then cannot tell which of the data concern prices that change from week to week , day to day or hour to hour .
This quality defines the charts as fractal curves and makes available many powerful tools of mathematical and computer analysis .
A more specific technical term for the resemblance between the parts and the whole is self - affinity .
This property is related to the better - known concept of fractals called selfsimilarity , in which every feature of a picture is reduced or blown up by the same ratio — a process familiar to anyone who has ever ordered a photographic enlargement .
Financial market charts , however , are far from being self - similar .
In a detail of a graphic in which the features are higher than they are wide — as are the individual up - and - down price ticks of a stock — the transformation from the whole to a part must reduce the horizontal axis more than the vertical one .
For a price chart , this transformation must shrink the timescale ( the horizontal axis ) more than the price scale ( the vertical axis ) .
The geometric relation of the whole to its parts is said to be one of self - affinity .
The existence of unchanging properties is not given much weight by most statisticians .
But they are beloved of physicists and mathematicians like myself , who call them invariances and are happiest with models that present an attractive invariance property .
A good idea of what I mean is provided by drawing a simple chart that inserts price changes from time 0 to a later time 1 in successive steps .
The intervals themselves are chosen arbitrarily ; they may represent a second , an hour , a day or a year .
The process begins with a price , represented by a straight trend line ( illustration 1 ) .
Next , a broken line called a generator is used to create the pattern that corresponds to the upand - down oscillations of a price quoted in financial markets .
The generator consists of three pieces that are inserted ( interpolated ) along the straight trend line .
( A generator with fewer than three pieces would not simulate a price that can move up and down . )
After delineating the initial generator , its three pieces are interpolated by three shorter ones .
Repeating these steps reproduces the shape of the generator , or price curve , but at compressed scales .
Both the horizontal axis ( timescale ) and the vertical axis ( price scale ) are squeezed to fit the horizontal and vertical boundaries of each piece of the generator .
Interpolations Forever
Only the first stages are shown in the illustration , although the same process continues .
In theory , it has no end , but in practice , it makes no sense to interpolate down to time intervals shorter than those between trading transactions , which may occur in less than a minute .
Clearly , each piece ends up with a shape roughly like the whole .
That is , scale invariance is present simply because it was built in .
The novelty ( and surprise ) is that these self - affine fractal curves exhibit a wealth of structure — a foundation of both fractal geometry and the theory of chaos .
A few selected generators yield so - called unifractal curves that exhibit the relatively tranquil picture of the market encompassed by modern portfolio theory .
But tranquillity prevails only under extraordinarily special conditions that are satisfied only by these special generators .
The assumptions behind this oversimplified model are one of the central mistakes of modern portfolio theory .
It is much like a theory of sea waves that forbids their swells to exceed six feet .
The beauty of fractal geometry is that it makes possible a model general enough to reproduce the patterns that characterize portfolio theory ’s placid markets as well as the tumultuous trading conditions of recent months .
The just described method of creating a fractal price model can be altered to show how the activity of markets speeds up and slows down — the essence of volatility .
This variability is the reason that the prefix “ multi - ” was added to the word “ fractal . ”
To create a multifractal from a unifractal , the key step is to lengthen or shorten the horizontal time axis so that the pieces of the generator are either stretched or squeezed .
At the same time , the vertical price axis may remain untouched .
In illustration 2 , the first piece of the unifractal generator is progressively shortened , which also provides room to lengthen the second piece .
After making these adjustments , the generators become multifractal ( M1 to M4 ) .
Market activity speeds up in the interval of time represented by the first piece of the generator and slows in the interval that corresponds to the second piece ( illustration 3 ) .
Such an alteration to the generator can produce a full simulation of price fluctuations over a given period , using the process of interpolation described earlier .
Each time the first piece of the generator is further shortened — and the process of successive interpolation is undertaken — it produces a chart that increasingly resembles the characteristics of volatile markets ( illustration 4 ) .
The unifractal ( U ) chart shown here ( before any shortening ) corresponds to the becalmed markets postulated in the portfolio theorists ’ model .
Proceeding down the stack ( M1 to M4 ) , each chart diverges further from that model , exhibiting the sharp , spiky price jumps and the persistently large movements that resemble recent trading .
To make these models of volatile markets achieve the necessary realism , the three pieces of each generator were scrambled — a process not shown in the illustrations .
It works as follows : imagine a die on which each side bears the image of one of the six permutations of the pieces of the generator .
Before each interpolation , the die is thrown , and then the permutation that comes up is selected .
What should a corporate treasurer , currency trader or other market strategist conclude from all this ?
The discrepancies between the pictures painted by modern portfolio theory and the actual movement of prices are obvious .
Prices do not vary continuously , and they oscillate wildly at all timescales .
Volatility — far from a static entity to be ignored or easily compensated for — is at the very heart of what goes on in financial markets .
In the past , money managers embraced the continuity and constrained price movements of modern portfolio theory because of the absence of strong alternatives .
But a money manager need no longer accept the current financial models at face value .
Instead multifractals can be put to work to “ stress - test ” a portfolio .
In this technique the rules underlying multifractals attempt to create the same patterns of variability as do the unknown rules that govern actual markets .
Multifractals describe accurately the relation between the shape of the generator and the patterns of up - and - down swings of prices to be found on charts of real market data .
On a practical level , this finding suggests that a fractal generator can be developed based on historical market data .
The actual model used does not simply inspect what the market did yesterday or last week .
It is in fact a more realistic depiction of market fluctuations , called fractional Brownian motion in multifractal trading time .
The charts created from the generators produced by this model can simulate alternative scenarios based on previous market activity .
These techniques do not come closer to forecasting a price drop or rise on a specific day on the basis of past records .
But they provide estimates of the probability of what the market might do and allow one to prepare for inevitable sea changes .
The new modeling techniques are designed to cast a light of order into the seemingly impenetrable thicket of the financial markets .
They also recognize the mariner ’s warning that , as recent events demonstrate , deserves to be heeded :
On even the calmest sea , a gale may be just over the horizon .
What he should have said was “ Yes ! ”
Wow , the background in this comic sure looks familiar ;)
Well , I ’m back to two comic weeks .
Now I just need to get the comics done on time .

On Thursday , Gwen Ifill will reprise her 2004 role as moderator for the debate between the major - party vice presidential candidates by posing the questions for this year 's pair of running mates .
But when the veteran PBS journalist convenes the nationally televised encounter , she will do so in hobbled condition .
Ifill broke one of her ankles last week while navigating a staircase .
The mishap was debate - related ; she was toting research material for it when she missed a step .
But the injury wo n't keep her from traveling to St. Louis for the faceoff between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden .
Ifill recently talked with the Associated Press about the challenge awaiting her .
The story took note of the unprecedented interest in the debate , spurred both by Palin 's newness to the national scene and questions about how she 'll perform .
Here 's the lead to the AP piece :
Being selected the moderator for a vice presidential debate is something like opening a suitcase on " Deal or No Deal " and finding $ 1,000 .
Nice prize , but it 's no jackpot .
Not this year .
The Oct. 2 showdown between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin will likely put Gwen Ifill before the biggest TV audience of her life .
Indeed , the political world ( that includes us ) would be shocked if the viewership does n't easily exceed the somewhat paltry numbers for Friday 's initial debate between John McCain and Barack Obama .

It 's all Robert Louis Stevenson 's fault .
Treasure Island 's popularity spawned a genre of pirate novels , and those novels were made into pirates movies , which gave rise to comic books and Halloween costumes .
Then Disney went and adapted one of their amusement park rides into a movie , and the result was actually good .
So call it the fault of Robert Louis Stevenson and Johnny Depp .
When I say " it , " I mean the romanticizing of pirates .
Hollywood and pirate novels would have you believe that pirates were swashbucklers living a life of pleasure on the seas , fighting only when they had to .
They make it easy to see past the fact that they were stealing gold and other valuables by making the people they were stealing it from seem worse than them .
Well , I enjoy Talk Like a Pirate Day as much as most other geeks , but I think it 's important to add a dose of reality .
So I 'm here to dispel some of the more popular myths about pirates , and to confirm a few as well .
__1 . Pirates only fought as hard as they had to .
__Sure , they preferred to take their prizes without a fight , but when they fought , they were ruthless — the better pirates were , anyway .
Jack Sparrow could never have become a captain of a real pirate ship ; he 'd 've been killed by his crewmates for a coward .
2. Pirates buried their treasure so nobody else could find it .
This probably happened occasionally , but was the exception , not the rule .
Pirates did n't expect to live very long , considering the business they were in , so planning for the future was n't high on their list of concerns .
Since pleasure right now was their only real desire , they'd take any treasure they got to a pirate - friendly port and spend it all on liquor and women as quickly as ever they could .
Besides , what crew would stand for their captain burying the treasure they 'd won together ?
3 . Pirates made their victims walk the plank .
There 's no evidence this was done much , if at all .
Pirates ' preferred means of punishment was keel - hauling , which meant tying their victims to a rope and dragging them under the ship .
Considering that ships ' hulls tended to accumulate debris from the water , this tended to result either in wounds ( if the victim was dragged quickly ) or drowning ( if slowly ) .
Either way , considerably worse than walking the plank , I 'd say .
4. Pirates obeyed a code of honor .
There were codes among the crew on most ships , mostly to keep order .
The codes determined how to divvy up the loot , how bad behavior was to be punished , and such .
But pirates were about as likely to care about their prisoners invoking any sort of code as you would be if an ant you were about to step on were to do so .
There 's a story of a pirate ( WARNING : not for the faint of stomach ) , trying to find a village 's gold , cutting out one prisoner 's heart to feed to another .
And Blackbeard is known to have cut off women 's fingers to obtain their diamond rings .
In general , the more ruthless a pirate was , the higher regard other pirates had for him .
5 . The most famous pirates were the best ones .
The reason you 've heard of most well - known pirates is because they were captured and either killed immediately ( as with Blackbeard , for example ) , or brought to trial , where their exploits were written down .
It 's reasonable to assume that a pirate who managed to avoid capture entirely was better than one who could n't , do n't you think ?
6. Pirates said " Arrrr " and " Mateys " and such .
I 'm sure this wo n't surprise you , but no , they did n't .
They had particular ways of speaking , especially among the British pirates , but the phrases we associate with pirates came from Hollywood .
7. Women were considered too weak to be pirates .
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies , despite being unrealistic in virtually every other way , actually got this one right .
Anne Bonny and Mary Read were the most famous , but there were actually quite a few female pirates .
Many of them disguised themselves as men , but it seems that was more to protect themselves than for any other reason .
8. Pirates disappeared a long time ago .
There are still pirates around today , particularly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans .
Worldwide losses from piracy are estimated at between $ 13 and $ 16 billion US dollars per year .
Modern pirates , like those of centuries ago , kidnap , murder , and mutilate their victims , to say nothing of stealing their ships and cargo .
9 . Pirates flew the Jolly Roger , wore eyepatches , kept parrots as pets , and had peg legs .
This one is very likely true !
There 's evidence that the famous skull - and - crossbones flag was flown by many pirates , after they took down the national flag that had lured their prey close enough to capture .
There are accounts of parrots being kept as pets by some pirates , and , given the nasty business piracy was , it 's quite likely that some needed eypatches and had peg legs .
The idea that some pirates wore eyepatches without needing to , as Mythbusters tested plausible , is highly unlikely , considering that the loss of depth perception would almost certainly have outweighed the gain of night vision below decks .
So , in summary , there 's nothing wrong with talking like a pirate , or dressing up as one for Halloween .
Just keep in the back of your mind that you 're talking more like a Hollywood pirate than a real one , and that real pirates were horrible people you would n't want to be within 20 yards of , and not just because they hardly ever bathed .
It 's fun to pretend the myths are true — just remember that you 're pretending .

" As with any contract , the parties to the agreement may modify the covenants by mutual agreement only . ”
– Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson
Hank Paulson ’s God Complex just got bigger .
The Director of Government Bailouts , and head of the Socialism Departmant at Treasury has informed Congress to back off his turf .
" All your legislation belongs to us ! "
Now , last I checked , it was Congress that had the power of authorization disbursements , and that Treasury does not have the authority to spend 5.3 trillion dollars .
Comrade Paulson does not seem to understand the way the different branches of government work in the United states , and is apparently unfamiliar with a little parchment called the Constitution .
Perhaps we can get Ron Paul to explain how these things work to our friend from the People ’s Republic of Goldman .
Bill King : " Hank is trying to euchre the market into believing that if Congress tries to change the law , the executive branch would then sue Congress for breach of contract .
Good luck with that at the Supreme Court . "
Nice try , comrade , but no such luck .
The issue here is authorization .
I cannot write a contract to sell you home , car , etc to a third party , without your authorization .
Otherwise , its fraud .
The party with the legal title and ability to convey those goods or services on the one side , or indebtedness or money on the other side of the transaction requires authorization .
The original Bazooka legislation did not give Treasury ablank check to do whatever they want .
A decision , for example , to add Fannie and Freddie to the budget " would n’t automatically translate into explicit government backing for the companies ’ combined $ 1.7 trillion in unsecured debt and $ 3.5 trillion of mortgage guarantees . "
To do so requires Congressional legislation to change the companies ’ legal status .
That ’s where any of the changes — like reducing the absurd pay packages for the current idiots running Fannie / Freddie — would come in .
Here ’s Bloomberg ’s excerpt :
" The U.S. Treasury said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ’s debt and mortgage - backed securities are " protected ” by the government ’s stock purchase agreement that put the mortgage finance companies under federal control .
" The holders of senior debt , subordinated debt , and mortgage - backed securities issued or guaranteed by these GSEs are protected by the agreement without regard to when those securities were issued or guaranteed , ” the Treasury said today , referring to the so - called government - sponsored enterprises .
The federal government took over the two largest sources of money for U.S. home loans on Sept. 7 , placing them under conservatorship and establishing procedures for buying their senior preferred stock if liabilities exceed assets .
The federal takeover did n’t address whether the companies ’ $ 5.2 trillion in debt should be included in the budget , or whether it carries an explicit government guarantee .
In an interview this week with Bloomberg Television , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson cited " incongruities ” in the law , saying " we should be clear , is there a government guarantee or is n’t there ? ”
I do not believe Treasury has purchased any stock yet , but that can change in an instant .
Long live Bailout Nation !

Ferocious fear - mongering rhetoric , possible cancellation of presidential election as financial terrorists threaten Americans with chaos unless power - grabbing bailout bill is passed
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , September 25 , 2008
From shying away from even mentioning such terms as “ recession , ” “ unemployment ” or “ bank failures , ” Bush , Bernanke and Paulson are now vigorously invoking the fear of financial meltdown as part of a campaign of economic terror to blackmail the American people into accepting the power - grabbing “ bailout , ” while John McCain , who last week said the fundamentals of the economy are strong , is now all but threatening to cancel the election should the proposal not receive swift passage .
Bush ’s speech last night was a throwback to his March 2003 stump before the invasion of Iraq – replace words like “ weapons of mass destruction ” with “ financial panic ” and the tone of the two is not dissimilar .
Bush rammed home the fear by appealing to people ’s personal anxieties .
“ More banks could fail , including some in your community .
The stock market would drop even more , which would reduce the value of your retirement account .
The value of your home could plummet .
Foreclosures would rise dramatically , ” barked the President .
“ And if you own a business or a farm , you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit .
More businesses would close their doors , and millions of Americans could lose their jobs . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Bernanke and Paulson spewed similar rhetoric during Tuesday ’s Senate Banking Committee meeting .
Compare their dire proclamations with their outright refusal to even entertain the notion of a recession as little as seven months ago .
Now Paulson tells us that people “ should be scared ” and that the only solution is for taxpayers to foot the bill to the tune of $ 700 billion dollars – a number we now learn was simply pulled out of thin air by the Treasury – while the Federal Reserve swallows up all manner of new regulation powers .
It seems that almost overnight these three stooges have gone from behaving like sedated zombies to end - times doomsayers .
Furthermore , John McCain , the man who as recently as last week proclaimed that “ the fundamentals of the economy are sound , ” is now canceling presidential debates , and some fear greasing the skids for the postponement of the presidential election itself , by insisting he and Obama “ return to Washington ” in order to put their weight behind the bailout .
As the George Washington Blog notes , McCain is basically implying , “ Vote for the bailout or I ’ll pull out of the election ” .
The financial terrorism being perpetrated by Bush , McCain , Bernanke , Paulson and the rest of these criminals in threatening Americans with unbridled chaos unless they acquiesce to political demands , and the coordinated ferocity with which it is being delivered , is necessary for the crooks because they are desperate to get the bailout passed before Congress really has a chance to digest exactly what it stands for .
This is what ’s called the “ shock doctrine , ” the accelerated passage of what is essentially dictatorial legislation without proper scrutiny by means of exploiting a temporary state of fear .
This is not just about $ 700 billion of taxpayers ’ money and the continued sacking of the dollar , it ’s about the imposition of a giant new infrastructure of control and regulation on behalf of the private , run for profit , Federal Reserve .
Bush even alluded to it last night , stating that Paulson ’s bailout would mean the “ Federal Reserve would be authorized to take a closer look at the operations of companies across the financial spectrum . ”

But this is merely scratching the surface .
As Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , said , “ This massive bailout is not a solution .
It is financial socialism and it ’s un-American . ”
In fact properly defined , one could label it “ national socialism , ” otherwise known as fascism .
As professor of economics at New York University Nouriel Roubini framed it , welcome to the United Socialist States of America and “ the most radical regime change in global economic and financial affairs in decades ” .
The plan was drawn up months ago , lying in wait for the right crisis to see it enacted , just as the Patriot Act was prepared well in advance of 9/11 .
The Treasury ’s fact sheet about the bailout states , “ The Secretary will have the discretion , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , to purchase other assets , as deemed necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets . ”
This gives the government and the Federal Reserve carte blanche to do whatever they want to long as it is done in the name of stabilizing financial markets , they can nationalize any company or industry and use taxpayer money , above and beyond the initial $ 700 billion , for whatever purpose is deemed necessary , without any oversight .
Paulson ’s bailout plan is also unreviewable by any court , it will remain in perpetuity .
Paulson ’s draft bailout plans says : “ The Secretary ’s authority to purchase mortgage - related assets under this Act shall be limited to $ 700,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time . ”
As Chris Martenson writes , “ This means that $ 700 billion is NOT the cost of this dangerous legislation , it is only the amount that can be outstanding at any one time .
After , say , $ 100 billion of bad mortgages are disposed of , another $ 100 billion can be bought .
In short , these four little words assure that there is NO LIMIT to the potential size of this bailout .
This means that $ 700 billion is a rolling amount , not a ceiling . ”
“ The bill would bar courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority , ” reports Bloomberg .
The Bush administration seeks “ dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts , to try to resolve the crisis , ” said Frank Razzano , a former assistant chief trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission now at Pepper Hamilton LLP in Washington .
“ We are taking a huge leap of faith . ”
“ It sounds like Paulson is asking to be a financial dictator , for a limited period of time , ” said historian John Steele Gordon .
Reporter Larisa Alexandrovna calls it “ the final stages of the coup , ” noting , “ This manufactured crisis is now to be remedied , if the fiscal fascists get their way , with the total transfer of Congressional powers ( the few that still remain ) to the Executive Branch and the total transfer of public funds into corporate ( via government as intermediary ) hands . ”
The legislation would provide billions to foreign central banks in addition to private foreign banks .
The proposed move represents a total shift of U.S. taxpayers ’ funds into the hands of powerful private interests , some of which do not even represent American companies .
The bailout bill represents the most fascist centralization of power in America since 9/11 and the Patriot Act – and many would argue that it even trumps that .
The fiscal terrorists hope to ram through their agenda by appealing to people ’s fears about the economy , their jobs , their houses and their pensions .
But the temporary pain brought on by a Wall Street crash and a severe recession would be nothing compared to the long term death knell that the bailout bill would mean to the free market and economic liberty in America .

This is the first in a series of occasional articles exploring alternative cultural life around Southern California .
--
If YOU think the meager little baton that Harry Potter has been waving around for going on six movies now is something special , you ’ve never seen a real wand .
The genuine article -- adorned with feathers , stones and a message in the runic alphabet -- was on display at a “ Healing Faire ” in , of all places , Studio City , this month .
It was the creation of Jude Bradley , an actual witch .
Or Wiccan , to use the appropriate term .
She was not wearing a pointed hat , and there was no black in her wardrobe ( she was wearing jeans , in fact ) .
She did say that she grew up in the Boston area and had spent a decent amount of time around Salem , Mass . , a town that of course has some history with witches .
Maybe too much , in fact .
Advertisement
“ It ’s become very commercial , ” said Bradley , who in addition to custom wands also makes meditation sachets and can do tarot - type readings with a regular deck of playing cards .
At the Unitarian Universalist Church on Moorpark Street she was in the company of various other New Age spiritualists , technologically savvy psychics , massage therapists and purveyors of therapeutic oils at this low - key event held as a fundraiser by the Los Angeles chapter of Pagan Pride , an organization that is striving to legitimize the practice of pagan religions and defend them against detractors .
They are completely serious , well - coordinated , and yes , they have some foes , including at one time current Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr .
In 1999 , Barr , then a Georgia congressman , sought to prevent pagans and Wiccans in the armed forces from engaging in religious practices on military bases ( he ’s since backed down from that position , perhaps fearing he ’d lose the pagan / Libertarian vote ) .
Last year , the loose - knit movement won a decade - long struggle when the Veterans Administration approved the pentangle , a key symbol of Wiccans , for use on headstones .
There are many forms of pagan practice , however , so the campaign has now shifted to allowing symbols associated with other unrecognized faiths .
On Oct. 5 , the local pagan community will gather in El Monte for its annual Pagan Pride Day celebration .
Last year , 1,500 people attended the event in Los Angeles , and an estimated 40,000 turned out worldwide .

Contemporary paganism does n’t draw its inspiration from the multiple - gods worship of ancient Greece and Rome so much as from less classical , earthier antecedents ( although pagans can and do worship different gods and goddesses ) .
Think Druids , or the shamanistic traditions of Native Americans .
Satanism , being associated with the post - Christian world , is not usually considered part of the neo-pagan movement although neo-pagans , being exceedingly tolerant , would probably not object to Satanists being allowed to do their thing , as well .
If all this puts images of Stevie Nicks , gauzy clothing , crystals and amulets in your mind , well , those are all present .
But Pagan Pride L.A. also has a public affairs officer , Brian Ewing , who holds down a day job as an employment lawyer .
They ’re not living in pre-Christian times , either : Their Web presence is extensive , and they do n’t shy away from modern technology .
The psychic at the Healing Faire , Debbie Reasbeck , had brought with her several thousand dollars ’ worth of computers and software specifically designed for the analysis of auras .
Place your hand on a sensor and a PC with a camera mount extrapolates your life force , displaying it as a penumbra of colors surrounding your body .
( It can also scrutinize your chakras . )
Reasbeck pointed out that her focus is as a healer .
She practices the art of reiki , which is based on unblocking congested life - force energy .
Obviously , you do n’t need to be a pagan to have a life force , so her work can appeal to just about everybody .
“ If you let your chakras shut down , it can affect your body , ” said Reasbeck , who maintained that she has been psychic for most of her life ( she first realized that she had the ability in second grade ) .

Not surprisingly , the path to paganism is n’t always clear , and it can be lonely .
“ I ’m a solitary witch and always have been , ” Bradley said , when asked if she practices as part of a group .
“ This has always been a bit of closeted community , but it ’s getting better .
A lot of people are involved with Earth religions . ”
A fellow Wiccan , Glenda Tamblyn , who had brought bath salt “ enchantments ” to the event , seconded Bradley ’s impressions .
“ It ’s not like you wake up one day and decide you have a different path to follow , ” she said .
Tamblyn ’s craft can be tricky .
“ Different oils and plants have different energies , ” she explained .
She used lavender as an example , saying that a little can be relaxing .
“ But a lot of lavender is a stimulant , ” she added .
“ You gotta find a balance with the lavender . ”
If the correct proportions are achieved , “ the essence of the plant will have the power to stimulate you spiritually and physically . ”

People who are curious about pagan theories of wellness , along with assorted other paraphernalia of alternative health culture , can engage in one - stop shopping at DragonMarsh , a shop in Riverside that has been dealing in everything from costumes for theme weddings to a vast repository of teas , herbs , and spices for 20 years .
Events manager Eric Du’Marn and spiritual oils specialist Amy Rose Blackstone held down the store ’s booth at the Healing Faire .
“ We encourage a lot of different paths in the neo- pagan life , ” Du’Marn said , when asked about the spiritual predilections of his staff of six .
He added that DragonMarsh has been participating in Pagan Pride events for the last “ seven or eight years . ”
He ’s not above using a bit of spiritual assistance for personal gain , especially since Blackstone can create a “ money blend ” oil .
“ I use a bit on the back of my hand , ” he said , “ when I go to Vegas . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Mindful of his low approval ratings , President George W. Bush has sometimes likened himself to Harry Truman , an unpopular president when he left office and now admired for his handling of the Cold War .
But in the grips of what some experts are calling a once - in - a- century financial meltdown , Bush could soon find himself struggling to avoid comparisons to a very different president -- Herbert Hoover , who presided at the start of the Great Depression .
With Wall Street ’s upheaval spreading fear among investors worldwide , analysts agree there is plenty of blame to go around -- not only for the current administration , the Federal Reserve and Congress but for their predecessors as well -- for letting the situation deteriorate to this point .
Yet , since a president must ultimately bear the weight of history ’s judgment , Bush is seeing another piece of his legacy slip away .
“ The question is , on whose watch did this whole mess happen ? ” said Terry Madonna , a political historian at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania .
“ Where was the financial regulation ?
Where was the oversight ?
Where were you ? ”
This crisis is the last thing Bush needed in the twilight of his presidency when his Republican party is battling to keep the White House in the November 4 election .
The U.S. economy has been on the ropes for months , bordering on recession , and despite security gains in Iraq , the war remains deeply unpopular with the American public .
Bush ’s approval ratings of around 30 percent in opinion polls are among the worst of any modern U.S. president near the end of his term .
Surging energy prices , growing joblessness and big federal deficits have also helped tarnish the public perception of his tenure .

TREADING CAUTIOUSLY
Despite deep investor anxiety , no one is calling this the beginning of a depression like the one ushered in by the stock market crash of 1929 .
But Bush is treading cautiously in the face of growing financial turmoil while his loyalists seek to deflect criticism that his own deregulatory zeal has contributed heavily to it .
The White House insists that Bush is deeply engaged , though he has delegated direct management of the crisis to his top economic advisers .
He scrapped a political fundraising trip on Thursday and instead hunkered down in the White House where he made a brief appearance -- two minutes and four seconds -- to assure Americans he was prepared to go beyond the “ extraordinary measures ” already taken to calm the situation .
It was , however , the first time Bush had commented in public on the matter since Monday .
He had even gone as far as canceling a previously scheduled statement on Tuesday , perhaps out of concern that he would have only spooked the markets further .
All week , Bush has ignored reporters ’ shouted questions about related developments , including the government - engineered rescue of insurance giant American International Group , the latest in a series of unprecedented moves that failed to stabilize see- sawing markets .
He has not held a full - scale news conference since July 15 -- an omission White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said was out of concern that reporters would try to draw him into the presidential campaign battle between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain .
‘ KATRINA-ESQUE ’
“ Bush ’s response to the financial crisis has been Katrina - esque , ” said Douglas Brinkley , a political scientist at Rice University in Houston , referring to the widespread perception the president was out of touch with the situation when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 .
“ It ’s a very fast world and we look for a president to step out in public and get ahead of events .
Instead we get delays and wishful thinking , ” said Brinkley , author of “ The Great Deluge , ” a book critical of the administration ’s handling of Katrina .
Bush spent Monday heavily involved with a state visit by Ghana ’s president and much of Tuesday touring parts of Texas hit by Hurricane Ike .
But some have praised Bush for keeping a relatively low profile and leaving the heavy lifting to experts like Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke .
For its part , the White House has insisted that Bush is in regular contact with his team and is on top of all key financial developments .
“ He does always keep an eye on the markets and he wants to keep updated on that throughout the day , every day , ” Perino told reporters .
WASHINGTON
Carly Fiorina , the woman John McCain sent out to defend Sarah Palin and rip anyone who calls her a tabula rasa on foreign policy and the economy , admitted Tuesday that Palin was not capable of running Hewlett - Packard .
That ’s pretty damning coming from Fiorina , who also was not capable of running Hewlett - Packard .
Carly helpfully added that McCain ( not to mention Obama and Biden ) could n’t run a major corporation .
He could n’t get his immigration bill passed either , but now he ’s promising to eliminate centuries of greed on Wall Street .
The Wall Street Journal reported that McCain was thinking about taking Palin to the U.N. General Assembly next week so she can shake hands with some heads of state .
You ca n’t contract foreign policy experience like a rhinovirus .
To paraphrase the sniffly Adelaide in “ Guys and Dolls , ” a poy - son could develop a cold war .
The latest news from Alaska is that the governor keeps a tanning bed in the Juneau mansion .
As The Los Angeles Times pointed out , when Palin declared May 2007 Skin Cancer Awareness Month in Alaska , the press release explained that skin cancer was caused by “ the sun and from tanning beds . ”

President Bush secretly approved orders in July that for the first time allow American Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government , according to senior American officials .
The classified orders signal a watershed for the Bush administration after nearly seven years of trying to work with Pakistan to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda , and after months of high - level stalemate about how to challenge the militants ’ increasingly secure base in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
American officials say that they will notify Pakistan when they conduct limited ground attacks like the Special Operations raid last Wednesday in a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border , but that they will not ask for its permission .
“ The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable , ” said a senior American official who , like others interviewed for this article , spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the missions .
“ We have to be more assertive .
Orders have been issued . ”

A Swedish woman may have been locked up in a small cabin for nine years by her partner , Swedish newspaper reports say .
The woman , 68 , who is seriously ill and weighs less than 40kg , has been taken to hospital , media reports say .
Her partner has been arrested and charged with offences relating to her imprisonment .
He denies the charges .
Police declined to comment further until after a court hearing in Eksjo , in the southern region of Smaland , later on Friday .
The reports appeared in the Smalands - Tidningen newspaper and the national daily Svenska Dagbladet .
Although police have not revealed details , a request for a public defence lawyer contained information suggesting the woman could have been confined for nine years , Smalands - Tidningen reported .
It said the man - also in his 60s - had initially been investigated for allegedly abusing his partner .
Police spoke to witnesses and then brought the man in for questioning .
The alleged offences are said to have occurred near Eksjo .
� What a Shock | Main | Latest Battleground Polls : Concerned Christian Conservatives Conservatively Expressing Christian Concern That McCain / Palin Is Guilty of Aggravated Skull - Fucking With Intent to Distribute � America Is Suddenly Bursting With Concerned Christian Conservatives Expressing Conservatively Christian Concern over McCain / Palin
People may be confused why in every post I say I 'm a concerned Christian .
Astroturfing .
David Axelrod is called the " Master of Astroturfing . "
Astroturfing is the dishonest PR technique of inserting PR messages straight from the PR shop out into the public , but in the guise of " concerns " of " real citizens " who are " independent " and have " no relationship " whatsoever to the PR campaign .
It tries to disguise itself as a " grassroots " phenomenon -- but it 's artificial and inorganic .
Hence , " Astroturf . "
And David Axelrod is notorious for making extensive use of this controversial tactic -- and was notorious for it even before he begain running Barack Obama 's campaign .
Axelrod is working his astroturf magic by seeding comments throughout the internet containing his talking points .
His new technique is to have the pro-Obama , anti-McCain / Palin talking points coming , supposedly , from " Christians " or " lifelong Republicans . "
It 's not just the internet of course .
Letters to the editor from concerned conservative Christians are being printed too .
From Best of the Web : The Lebanon ( N.H. ) Daily News carries a letter to the editor from Christopher Tarsa , who makes the case for crossing party lines to support Barack Obama :
As a Republican and strong McCain supporter in 2000 , I was disappointed and saddened in 2004 when McCain permanently traded in his maverick credentials and sold out his principles to support George W. Bush .
I now find it equally disturbing to see him gamble our security and future with a reckless choice for a running mate .
Gov. Sarah Palin clearly has a bright future in politics .
She may even have the depth and diversity of experience to be a vice - presidential candidate four years from now .
The McCain ticket , with all of its newfound " freshness " and despite all of the claims , has quickly devolved into the politics - as - usual that we have come to expect in the last eight years .
McCain and Palin quickly emerged from the rhetoric of their convention as the uniters of dividers .
I talk politics with a lot of people from all walks of life .
I find it compelling that many of the ordinary Republicans I talk to understand that their families cannot afford another four years like the last eight .
We all deserve better .
But the paper appends a tagline that rather undercuts Tarsa 's claim to speak " as a Republican " : Tarsa is chairman of the Lebanon County Democratic Committee . "
Apparently party lines run right through Christopher Tarsa .
I 'm surprised the paper noted this big McCain supporter 's actual party affiiation .
But note the letter follows the pattern of the classic Astroturf sockpuppet : 1 ) Claim to be either a Christian , a Republican , or a former McCain backer .
2 ) Claim to have a basic emotional affinity for McCain , Palin , or Republicanism ( " Gov. Sarah Palin clearly has a bright future in politics " ) and say some weakly " supportive " things in order to convince people you " think like them " and are basically " on their side " before you ...
3 ) Push all the Obama HQ - approved talking points against the ticket , often expressing smears against McCain or Palin that you 're merely " concerned " will begin to weight down the ticket when the " story begins to break . "
I like that last tactic -- see , they 're not pushing these unsourced , unverified claims on you .
They 're not asserting they 're true or anything .
They 're just worried that when the " story gets out " it will hurt the ticket .
They 're just " raising questions " that they , as Concerned Conservative Christians , are conservatively Christianishly concerned by .
Robert , down the page ( in the Jesus Was a PR Flack post ) , is very concerned , for example , that McCain is not really pro-life and that he 's lying about it .
He 's worried McCain will make his real pro-choice politics explicit .
And he frets that this will then harm McCain 's standing with Concerned Christian Conservatives such as himself .
It 's transparent , it 's absurd , it 's blatantly dishonest , it 's scandalous in its contempt for fair play , nevermind the contempt shown for the intelligence of the American voter , and , most important of all , it 's a big juicy story about shabbily dishonest political skullduggery the MSM should be covering but of course will not .
And , as a concerned Christian conservative , I support the media 's brave and honest digging into Sarah Palin 's history while studiously avoiding Barack Obama's .
PS : The media is in a uniquely advantageous position to report this story .
As many of these Concerned Christian Conservatives are posting on the media 's comment boards , any MSM organization out there could begin looking at the IP's of Concerned Christian Conservatives to see if they originate from DC or Chicago .
Or if they 've been suspiciously anonymized .
And they could even just ask Axelrod if the campaign is doing this -- getting them on record before they begin checking .
But they wo n't .
They know damn well Axelrod is doing this -- but they approve of the technique .
And , as a Concerned Christian Conservative conservatively concerned by Christian commenters conservative Christian concerns , I applaud them !
PPS : Did n't McCain do this too ?
Yes and no .
" No " being the more important answer .
It is true that McCain 's website encouraged readers to put out the McCain message out on blogs , and to refute smears against him , and etc .
He was rapped for this encouragement -- including by me .
Not for its actual dishonesty .
More for the Ron Paul - esque pure annoyance factor .
But his encouragement was not a dishonest one .
He did not encourage his readers to pose as " liberal leaning former Hillary voters " who " think Obama is a nice guy and has a good sense of oratory " but who is " simply not prepared to lead . "
He encouraged his real readers -- real people -- to just push the McCain message out there -- but , crucially , not to disguise the partisan leaning of the commenter pushing the message .
In Obama 's case , it 's not merely supporters of Obama pushing his message .
Seattle Slough does this every week , but no one accuses him of hiding his liberal bent .
No , in Obama 's case , he has PR professionals busy , busy , busy at their keyboards , falsely claiming to be Republicans or Christians , all working off the same basic three - part script .
1 , Claim to be conservative or Christian , 2 , say some weakly charitable things about McCain and / or Palin to " prove " you 're not a partisan , 3 , stick the dagger in and then break it off .
And once again , as a Christian conservative filled with concerns ( as well as some chagrin -- did I mention my chagrin ? ) , although I will concede that John McCain served his country well and Sarah Palin is an attractive candidate , I must express my Christian conservative concerns that they are Nazis who hunt , kill , butcher and eat human beings .
I do n't know about your Bible , but mine says I can't even eat fucking shelfish * , never mind people .
*
True , this is in the " Jew Section . "

The ( Almost ) Complete Paul Anka Integrity Kick Top Top Tens Greatest Hitjobs
Meanwhile , partly as a result of withdrawals from savings units in the Southwest , the Federal Home Loan Bank system faces a cash squeeze that is likely to require emergency Federal Reserve lending .
[ Page D5 . ]
The Congressional unit 's numbers are significant because they represent the first official Congressional statement that the estimates of the total cost of the savings cleanup by President Bush were too low .
Overly Optimistic
Members of Congress have repeatedly voiced concern that the sketchy budget analysis of the Bush plan released so far by the White House seemed to use overly optimistic assumptions on the future course of interest rates and growth of deposits at banks and savings institutions and understate the actual cost .
In hearings scheduled for next week , top Administration officials , like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the budget director , Richard G. Darman , are likely to be called on to defend their estimates .
The Congressional unit said its report was preliminary because '' details of the President 's plan have just recently become available , and in the absence of specific legislative language , C.B.O. is not certain about a number of features . ''
But it said that based on its preliminary analysis , total Treasury funds needed in the first five years of the plan would be $ 31 billion , and $ 43 billion in the second five years .
It added that it would cost an additional $ 5 billion to pay '' interest on the borrowings needed to finance the $ 31 billion Treasury contribution . ''

Journalists and St. Paul citizens assembled outside St. Paul City
Hall today to deliver more than 60,000 letters to Mayor Chris Coleman and prosecuting attorneys demanding that they immediately drop charges against all journalists arrested this week as they covered the Republican National Convention
By Friday morning , dozens of journalists , photographers , bloggers and videomakers had been booked by the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s office in what appears to have been an orchestrated round - up of media makers covering protests during the convention .
“ From the pre-convention raids to the ongoing harassment and arrests of journalists , these have been dark days for press freedom in the United States , ” said Nancy Doyle Brown of the Twin Cities Media Alliance , who delivered the letters on behalf of the nonpartisan media reform group Free Press .
Stories That Will Never Be Told
She was joined by a crowd of local activists and journalists , including Amy Goodman and Nicole Salazar of Democracy Now ! , KFAI -FM radio host Andy Driscoll and Mike Bucsko , executive director of the Minnesota Newspaper Guild .
“ Tragically , there are stories that the world needed to hear this week that will never be told , ” Brown said .
“ They wo n’t be told because reporters working on them were sitting in the back of squad cars , were stripped of their cameras , or were face down on the pavement with their hands cuffed behind their backs . ”
On Thursday , the final night of the convention , it appears that authorities ratcheted up their attacks on both protesters and credentialed journalists , lobbing tear gas and percussion grenades into crowds and arresting student journalists , local TV photographers , Associated Press reporters , and two MyFox journalists , among others .
Other journalists have also been pepper - sprayed , and reporters with I - Witness were held at gunpoint during a “ pre-emptive ” raid aimed at disrupting protesters last weekend .
Mayor Chris Coleman has refused to reply to my repeated calls and e-mails asking for his response to allegations that journalists were specifically targeted by authorities .
Post - Mortem
A crowd of journalists — many of whom were arrested earlier in the week — entered City Hall and delivered the letters into the hands of St. Paul Deputy Mayor Ann Mulholland and City Attorney John Choi , who briefly told them that the legal system will sort out their concerns .
The mayor and public officials “ need to do a post - mortem to examine the circumstances ” of these arrests , said Bucsko , who represents reporters at the Star Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer Press .
“ I hate to think that journalists were being targeted , ” adding that it appeared that “ there was discrimination based upon their jobs . ”
The signatures were collected in less than 72 hours as people nationwide expressed their outrage over St. Paul ’s attempts to stifle the many journalists documenting events surrounding the tightly scripted spectacle in the city ’s Xcel Center .
Wellstone ’s Worst Nightmare
Groups including the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Association of Black Journalists , the National Association of Hispanic Journalists , The Newspaper Guild , the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , Reporters Without Borders , the Society for Professional Journalists and the Writers Guild of America , East have also sounded the alarm over the unusually harsh treatment by city authorities .
“ The city of St. Paul has a black eye right now , and I must say that Paul Wellstone would be rolling in his grave , ” said Denis Moynihan of Free Speech TV , who spoke outside City Hall today .
“ Mayor Coleman must salvage the damaged reputation of the state and the city by dropping charges against all journalists immediately . ”

ISPs and authorities increasingly use Deep Packet Inspection hardware to block access to BitTorrent sites , or spy on users ' browsing habits .
To offer its users more privacy , is oHunt has now added SSL encryption , making it impossible for your ISP or the authorities to monitor your activities on the BitTorrent site .
Last week ,
The Pirate Bay announced that it will allow its users to browse the site securely , this in response to the new wiretapping law that was recently approved in Sweden .
Long before this law was passed , another BitTorrent site , isoHunt , decided to offer their users a similar service .
One of the reasons for is oHunt to implement SSL encryption , however , was a recent block by the Dubai government .
is oHunt founder Gary Fung told TorrentFreak : “ We decided to implement SSL to avoid eavesdropping on search , to bypass slow proxies , and to get around blocks like in Dubai . ”
Earlier this year , Dubai started to block access to several BitTorrent sites , including is oHunt .
With SSL , however , the site can be reached again , without any problems .
There seems to be quite a demand for secure browsing as according to a poll on isoHunt , more than 80 % of the users indicated that they will browse the site on an encrypted connection from now on .
Not only is isoHunt now accessible via SSL , its sister site TorrentBox , and the TorrentBox forums can also be reached over an encrypted connection .
In the weeks to come , the isoHunt team will monitor how many users are browsing over SSL .
“ We ’ll be evaluating how much extra load this places on our servers over the next few weeks , and if there ’s a large outpouring of people preferring to browse isoHunt or TorrentBox securely , we ’ll be investing in some dedicated hardware to handle the SSL connections . ”
For now , SSL is a great , and much needed , solution to censoring ISPs .
Dubai is not the only country that blocks BitTorrent sites .
Turkey does the same , so does a Danish ISP , and earlier this year the Kuwait government ordered ISPs to block access to 20 BitTorrent sites .
If Barrack Obama wins the presidency , the price of oil could fall by $ 40 per barrel .
The financial markets will discount the possibility before hand , at least partially .
There are three ways in which this could happen :
1 ) As was the case during the Clinton administration , Obama might be more inclined to intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the value of the dollar .
The U.S. has not intervened in the FX market since Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin did so in September 2000 when the Treasury sought to support the Euro , then costing about 80 cents per dollar ( yes , the cost has almost doubled since then ) .
Intervention or the threat of intervention could shave $ 20 off the price , based on the divergence in price between oil quoted in dollars versus that of other currencies .
2 ) Obama will speak in a more concilatory tone toward nations in the Middle East .
If he does , some of the risk premium would likely be extracted from the oil price .
3 ) Energy conservation and investment in energy infrastructure are likely to increase if Obama wins , as it will be part of his mandate .
Announcements of a nationwide effort to both decrease consumption and increase the supply of energy would have an announcement effect on the energy markets , lowering energy prices and burning speculators .
Points 2 and 3 are probably the most bankable ideas , but the mere threat of point 1 is still enough to impact the markets .

Going overdrawn can be an expensive business .
In the UK , unauthorised overdrafts averaged £ 680 m on any given day in 2006 – just over £ 10 per bank account .
According to the Office of Fair Trading , the charges levied by banks on those overdrafts were £ 1.5 bn , a tasty return of more than 220 per cent .
Banks also make money by paying risible interest on positive balances – an incentive to keep your current account lean and , Doh ! , to overdraw accidentally – and by other obscure charges .
The Office of Fair Trading does n’t like it and nor do many customers – although they rarely express their displeasure by switching bank accounts .
There are two common responses .
People either grumble about money - grabbing banks or point out , smugly , that if only others would manage their affairs responsibly , they would n’t incur any of these charges .
There ’s a certain amount of truth in both responses .
Yes , banks are money - grabbing , but healthy competition would keep the greed in check .
And , yes , careful customers are being subsidised , heavily , by careless ones .
The trouble is that the whimsicality of the pricing makes it hard to find out which bank is offering a good deal .
Most people realise that overdraft charges are steep , just as they realise that popcorn in cinemas is expensive and mobile - phone companies will all but pick your pocket if you make calls overseas .
Knowing this does n’t make it easy to find the best product , which means competition wo n’t work well .
When competition works poorly , many customers lose out – even those who bring their own snacks to the cinema and use public phones on holiday .
So what ’s the solution ?
One possibility is for regulators to step in and set price ceilings in such cases , or to ban more complex offerings .
But once the tourism office starts fixing the price of a can of Heineken in your hotel fridge , that spells ossification and bad news for consumers in the long run .
Another possibility is better financial education – unobjectionable in itself , but an indirect attack on the problem of complex tariffs .
The severity of that problem was clear when two economists , Chris Wilson and Catherine Waddams Price , tracked the attempts of customers to switch to cheaper electricity tariffs .
Most picked up less than half of the available gains , and a quarter made themselves worse off .
I have heard one really good – and , I believe , genuinely new – solution , presented in the book Nudge , by Cass Sunstein , a law professor , and Richard Thaler , an economist with a particular focus on flaws in people ’s decisions .
They advocate a system of mandatory electronic disclosure .
Regulators would specify a standard electronic format in which banks would have to disclose all their fees and charges , and how they intersected with what the customer had actually done .
( The idea could also work for credit cards , mobile phone services and others . )
Each year , customers would receive an electronic file itemising exactly what they had done and exactly what it had cost them .
Thaler and Sunstein anticipate – correctly , I suspect – that if such electronic files existed in a standard format , other companies ( Morningstar ?
Google ?
Microsoft ? FT.com ? ) would quickly set up their own services .
You would take your electronic bank account statement , upload it to Google Consumer , and be told in plain English how your bank had screwed you , and which bank would do a better job , given your particular banking habits .
Even those who could n’t or would n’t use such electronic advice would benefit from the sharpening of competition it would engender .
Implementing the idea may not be easy – but for those of us who think competition can occasionally be given a helping hand , it seems worth trying .

" Oh would some power the giftie gie us , to see ourselves as others see us , " wrote Robert Burns in To a Louse .
But democratically elected governments face incessant scrutiny .
So it is unusual to see one exposing itself voluntarily to the glare of critical inspection .
But that is what the British government did when it submitted its report to the United Nations ' committee on human rights under section 40 of the international covenant on civil and political rights .
The committee 's conclusions offer insights that should intrigue all who care about freedom of speech .
The UN is concerned that the application of the law of libel in English courts has " served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest " .
It is referring to the chilling effect of the phenomenon known as libel tourism , which has allowed powerful interests to obstruct the publication abroad of books and articles by suing for libel in English courts .
In 2004 the Saudi investment banker Khalid bin Mahfouz won a default defamation judgment in the high court against the American academic Rachel Ehrenfeld over allegations contained in her 2003 book Funding Evil : How Terrorism is Financed .
At the time of the trial the book had sold only 23 copies in the UK .
Ehrenfeld described the process of libel tourism exploited in that case as " a form of intellectual terrorism " .
Her American lawyers called it part of the most important challenge to free speech in the past 50 years .
That same year another author , Craig Unger , had publication of his book House of Bush : House of Saud :
The secret relationship between the world 's two most powerful dynasties , scrapped in the UK .
His publishers were concerned that the Saudi Royal family would use British libel law to sue for damages .
British lawyers and politicians have paid little attention to the points of principle at stake .
They should wake up , not least because the internet now means that material published in one country can be deemed to be nigh universally available .
In these circumstances libel tourism has the potential to turn English courts into censorship enforcement agencies for litigants with secrets to hide and money to burn .
It poses a wholly unacceptable threat to academic freedom and freedom of speech .
The UN committee is also critical of the Official Secrets Act 1989 on the grounds that it can be used to prevent whistleblowing by former public servants .
The case of David Shayler , the former MI5 agent , is one such example .
Shayler was sentenced to six months ' imprisonment under sections 1 and 4 of the act after writing about the activities of the security services in the Mail on Sunday .
The 1989 act was designed to improve the 1911 version which banned publication of details as arcane as the brand of crockery used in the Home Office unless its release was authorised .
It is helpful to be reminded that the revised legislation remains potentially oppressive .
There is no public interest defence for civil servants who leak information about what the government is doing in our name .
The House of Lords confirmed this in the Shayler case .
So , does Britain stand condemned as a haven for censorship , secrecy and oppression ?
The picture is not so stark .
The failings highlighted by members of the UN committee were carefully identified for them by diligent British civil servants .
Bravo ladies and gentlemen .
And now that you have offered ministers the blessing Robert Burns prized , we journalists must do our duty to the public sphere by maintaining pressure on them to liberalise the law .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
It really is the economy , stupid !
Economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post - war U.S. presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for Barack Obama in November .
Three separate studies showed the Democratic presidential hopeful winning between 52 and 55 percent of the popular vote on November 4 , based on current gloomy economic estimates .
Any further darkening in the economic outlook -- many analysts think things will get worse between now and November -- would reinforce that election outcome .
“ The economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the Republicans , ” said Ray Fair , an economics professor at Yale university who built the earliest of the models in 1978 .
His model , which assumed tepid U.S. economic growth of 1.5 percent and a 3 percent rate of inflation , predicted the Republican candidate John McCain ’s share of the vote would be 47.8 percent , handing Obama 52.2 percent .
“ It is a decent margin but it is not a landslide , ” said Fair , who ran the numbers in April .
“ It would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008 . ”
U.S. economic activity doubled in the second quarter to a 1.9 percent annualized pace .
But previous data was revised lower to show output contracted 0.2 percent in the final three months of last year , the weakest performance since 2001 , and expanded only slightly at the start of 2008 .
“ It ’s the economy , stupid ! ” was a phrase extensively used during Bill Clinton ’s successful 1992 presidential campaign against George H.W. Bush to remind voters that a recession occurred during Bush ’s administration .
Fair ’s model , and a version built by St. Louis - based forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers , blend political factors with economics to scientifically nail down the view that voters care first and foremost about their own wallets .

Indeed , opinion polls consistently find that the economy is the most important issue for U.S. voters .
HEADWINDS
Macroeconomic Advisers ’ model incorporates whether the candidate is from the incumbent party , approval ratings and the length of time the incumbent party has held the White House to capture the extent voters may have tired of them .
Adding in its own estimates for U.S. economic growth , the unemployment rate and the change in energy prices , it finds that McCain will get just 45 percent of the vote .
“ This model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times , ” Macroeconomic Advisers said .
“ The weak current state of the economy , and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the McCain campaign , if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past , ” they said in a note to clients .
The third work is a “ Bread and Peace ” model devised by Douglas Hibbs , a retired economics professor from the University of Goteborg in Sweden , who remains a senior fellow at the Center for Public Sector Research there .
He finds that U.S. presidential elections are well - predicted by just two fundamental forces : the weighted average per capita growth of real disposable income and the number of U.S. military deaths in foreign combat .
“ Average per capita real income growth probably will be only around 0.75 percent at Election Day .
Moreover , cumulative U.S. military fatalities in Iraq will reach 4,300 or more , ” he said in a June update of his model .
“ Given those fundamental conditions , the Bread and Peace model predicts a Republican two - party vote share centered on 48.2 percent . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it is getting out of the retail gas business in the United States as sky - high crude oil prices squeeze margins .

Those branded service stations may be the most public aspect of Exxon ’s business , but they account for a small part of the company ’s profits .
Out of the roughly 12,000 Exxon Mobil branded stations in the United States , Exxon , the world ’s largest publicly - traded oil company , owns about 2,220 .
Exxon plans to sell those service stations over several years .
They include about 820 stations that it also operates .
The company will maintain the Exxon and Mobil brands , Exxon spokeswoman Prem Nair said .
Consumers will still be buying gasoline at stations that carry the Exxon and Mobil names , but they will not be owned by the company .
Service stations have struggled , even with $ 4 - a - gallon plus gasoline prices because they have not been able to pass along to customers their additional costs from soaring crude oil .
According to federal data , gasoline prices are up about 31 percent over the last year , and oil prices have nearly doubled over the same period .
“ We are in a very , very challenging market .
Margins are reduced , ” said Nair .
“ We feel the best way for us to grow and compete is through our distributor network . ”
In the current environment , the company ’s profits from its retail unit are “ somewhere close to a rounding error , ” said Mark Gilman , an analyst at the Benchmark Co .
He said Exxon was following competitors like Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc in moving away from ownership of service stations .
“ The retail gasoline business is a highly volatile and typically low return kind of business and thus the decision , ” Gilman said .
Exxon made more than $ 40 billion in 2007 , most of which came from its oil and gas production around the world .
“ I think the decision came that it ’s more of a headache than its worth , ” said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Fadel Gheit .
Although the company does not release profit margin figures for its retail arm , Gheit estimated the stations ’ margin was between 10 percent and 15 percent , about one - third its margin on crude oil production .
“ The question is who is going to buy them , and how much are they going to pay for them , ” Gheit said .
The moods that Mr. Wallace distilled so vividly on the page  the gradations of sadness and madness embedded in the obsessive , recursive , exhausting prose style that characterized both his journalism and his fiction  crystallized an unhappy collective consciousness .
And it came through most vividly in his voice .
Hyperarticulate , plaintive , self - mocking , diffident , overbearing , needy , ironical , almost pathologically self - aware ( and nearly impossible to quote in increments smaller than a thousand words )  it was something you instantly recognized even hearing it for the first time .
It was  is  the voice in your own head .
Or mine , at any rate .
When , as an undergraduate with a head full of literary theory and a heartsick longing for authenticity , I first encountered David Foster Wallace , I experienced what is commonly called the shock of recognition .
Actually , shock is too clean , too safe a word for my uncomfortable sense that not only did I know this guy , but he knew me .
He could have been a T.A. in one of my college courses , or the slightly older guy in Advanced Approaches to Interpretation who sat slightly aloof from the others and had not only mastered the abstruse and trendy texts everyone else was reading , but also skipped backward , sideways and ahead .
It was impressive enough that he could do philosophy  the mathematical kind , not just the French kind .
But he also played tennis  Mr. Wallace , in fact , had competed seriously in the sport  and could quote lyrics from bands you only pretended you ’d heard of .
Without even trying , he was cooler than everyone else .
All this shone through Mr. Wallace ’s fiction .
He had the intellectual moves and literary tricks diagrammed in advance : the raised - eyebrow , mock - earnest references to old TV shows and comic books ; the acknowledgment that truth was a language game .
He was smarter than anyone else , but also poignantly aware that being smart did n’t necessarily get you very far , and that the most visible manifestations of smartness  wide erudition , mastery of trivia , rhetorical facility , love of argument for its own sake  could leave you feeling empty , baffled and dumb .
Another way of saying this is that Mr. Wallace , born in 1962 and the author of an acclaimed first novel at age 24 , anchored his work in an acute sense of generational crisis .
None of his peers were preoccupied so explicitly with how it felt to arrive on the scene as a young , male American novelist dreaming of glory , late in the 20th century and haunted by a ridiculous , poignant question : what if it ’s too late ?
What am I supposed to do now ?
This is a common feeling for those of us born in the 1960s ( for the record , I ’m four years younger than Mr. Wallace ) .
If you were , let ’s say , a faculty brat in the 1970s , living in a provincial college town  Champaign , Ill. , in Mr. Wallace ’s case or Chapel Hill , N.C. , in mine  you felt a weird post - traumatic vibe from many of the adults you met .
And , if , as an adolescent or an undergraduate , you found your way into books , you kept seeing  on syllabuses , at the campus bookstore , on your parents ’ shelves  the monuments of the previous era , most intriguingly the masterworks laid down by brave exemplars of experimentalism , iconoclasts who disassembled the worn machinery of the novel and put it back together in crazy , ingenious ways : William Gaddis and John Barth , Thomas Pynchon and Kurt Vonnegut .
These guys  and most were guys  pointed the way forward .
Update 9/15/2008
For anyone interested in the techniques discussed in this article , I put together AYM CMS which is a reusable template for building complex static websites using Django templates .
For a project I am working on I needed to create a simple website : some screenshots , some static pages , etc .
The initial inclination is to just do static websites in static html and css , and that time honored solution has worked well for a couple of decades at this point , but I wanted something a bit better .
Recently I have been building increasing complex build scripts for my static websites , which inject rendered markdown into a static template , or generate their own thumbnails .
This approach allows the benefits of static pages ( insanely scalable on even the worst imaginable hardware ) , while negating most of the disadvantages of writing static html ( too much human time consumed by updates and modifications ) .
Yesterday while staring down the prospect of copy - pasting a generic html template half a dozen times ( and hoping I did n't need to make any modifications later ) I thought to myself : " Damn it , I 'll just use Django templates . "
And what a sweet thought that was .
Prerequisites
This example will require that you have both Django and PIL installed .
Getting Started
First , go ahead and create a folder to store this project in .
I am calling mine my_cms .
mkdir my_cms cd my_cms
Next we 're going to create a handful of folders : mkdir templates mkdir static mkdir deploy mkdir images
Then we 'll create a very simple settings .py file in the my_cms directory .
import os , datetime ROOT_PATH = os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) # setting up directory paths TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( os . path .
join ( ROOT_PATH , ' templates ' ) ) STATIC_DIR = os .
path .
join ( ROOT_PATH , ' static ' ) DEPLOY_DIR = os .
path .
join ( ROOT_PATH , ' deploy ' ) IMAGES_DIR = os .
path .
join ( ROOT_PATH , ' images ' ) # setting up some helpful values STATIC_URL_FORMAT = u" / static / %s " STATIC_THUMBNAIL_FORMAT
= STATIC_URL_FORMAT
% u" thumbnail / %s " STATIC_IMAGE_FORMAT = STATIC_URL_FORMAT
% u" image / %s " THUMBNAIL_SIZE = ( 128 , 128 ) EMAIL = u" your_email_address@gmail.com " # creating default rendering context CONTEXT = { ' email ' : EMAIL , w ' : datetime.datetime.now ( ) , } PAGES_TO_RENDER = ()
The settings stored in this settings .py folder will be used in both build script , and in particular the CONTEXT dictionary will be passed to templates as they are rendered , so it makes a great place for settings and pieces of data that may change frequently .
Now we 'll write the initial version of our build script .
Since we have n't created any content yet it 'll be a bit plain , but here are the steps it will take : Create a deploy directory .
Create a deploy / static directory .
Copy all contents of static / into deploy / static .
Create a deploy / static / thumbnail directory .
Create a deploy / static / image directory .
For all images in images / , create thumbnails and images in the deploy / static / thumbnail and deploy / static / image directories respectively .
Render a list of templates we supply , and copy them into the deploy / directory .
Putting it all together , the build .
py script will look like this : import os , shutil from django.
template .loader import render_to_string from django.conf import settings from PIL import Image os .
environ [ ' DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE ' ] = u" settings " def main ( ) : # retrieving default context dictionary from settings context = settings .
CONTEXT deploy_dir = settings .
DEPLOY_DIR print u" Removing existing deploy dir , if any ... " shutil .
rmtree ( deploy_dir , ignore_errors =
True ) print u" Creating deploy / dir ... " os .
mkdir ( deploy_dir ) print u" Copying contents of static / into deploy / static ... " deploy_static_dir = os .
path .
join ( deploy_dir , ' static ' ) shutil .
copytree ( settings .
STATIC_DIR , deploy_static_dir ) print u" Copying and creating thumbnails for files in images /... " deploy_thumb_path = os .
path .
join ( deploy_static_dir , ' thumbnail ' ) deploy_image_path = os .
path .
join ( deploy_static_dir , ' image ' ) os .
mkdir ( deploy_thumb_path ) os .
mkdir ( deploy_image_path ) images = [ ] images_dict = {} images_dir = settings .
IMAGES_DIR thumb_format = settings .
STATIC_THUMBNAIL_FORMAT
image_format = settings .
STATIC_IMAGE_FORMAT
thumbnail_dimensions = settings .
THUMBNAIL_SIZE for filename in os .
listdir ( images_dir ) : # only process if ends with image file extension before_ext , ext = os .
path .
splitext ( filename ) if ext not in ( " .png " , ) : continue print u" Copying and thumbnailing %s ... " % filename filepath = os .
path .
join ( images_dir , filename ) im = Image .
open ( filepath ) im .
save ( os .
path .
join ( deploy_image_path , filename ) , " PNG " ) im .
thumbnail ( thumbnail_dimensions , Image .
ANTIALIAS ) im .
save ( os .
path .
join ( deploy_thumb_path , filename ) , " PNG " ) # create dict with image data image_dict = {} image_dict [ ' filename ' ] = filename image_dict [ ' thumbnail ' ] = thumb_format % filename image_dict [ ' image ' ] = image_format % filename images .
append ( image_dict ) # before_ext is ' hello ' in ' hello.png ' images_dict [ before_ext ] = image_dict context [ ' images ' ] = images context [ ' images_dict ' ] = images_dict print u" Rendering pages ... " pages = settings .
PAGES_TO_RENDER for page in pages : print u" Rendering %s ... " % page rendered = render_to_string ( page , context ) page_path = os .
path .
join ( deploy_dir , page ) fout = open ( page_path , ' w ' ) fout .
write ( rendered ) fout .
close ( ) # completed build script print u" Done running build .
py. " if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ()
Admittedly its a bit on the long side for a snippet ( 76 lines of code ? yikes ) , but nothing there is terribly complex , and we wo n't have to make any changes to it in the future ( we 'll just edit settings. py instead ) .
Before we start writing out templates , lets throw a couple of random images into the images / folder so that we can test the thumbnail creation parts .
I used an old picture of mine whose filename was bridge.png .
It does n't matter too much what you use , though ( although the script is only setup to accept .png files , at the moment ) .
A screenshot would be fine .
Now we just need to start writing our templates to take advantage of this shiny new build system .
First we 'll write a base template , with the filename base .
html in the templates / directory .
< html > < head > < title > { % block title %} My CMS { % endblock %} </ title > < link rel= " stylesheet " href= " static/style.css " > </head > < body > { % include " header.html " %} { % block content % }{ % endblock %} { % include " footer.html " %} </ body > </html >
Then we 'll create a header .
html file in templates / . < h1 > Welcome to my Simple CMS </ h1 > and a footer .
html file in templates / .
< div class= " footer " > < p >
Last updated at {{ now | time : " H:i " }} .
Mail < a href= " mailto : {{ email }} " > this address < / a > with questions .
</ p> </div >
Admittedly we could have just as easily used the now template tag instead of storing the now variable in our template 's context .
I did it that way just to give an example of adding dynamic - static context to the templates .
Finally , lets write the index.html template .
{ % extends " base.html " %} { % block content %} { % with images_dict .
bridge as image %} < a href= " {{ image . image }} " > < img class= " thumbnail " src= " {{ image .
thumbnail }} " > </a> { % endwith %} < p >
This is some simple static text .
</ p> < div class= " thumbnails " > { % for image in images %} < a href= " {{ image . image }} " > < img class= " thumbnail " src= " {{ image .
thumbnail }} " > </a> { % endfor %} </div > { % endblock %}
Now to render the index .html page we add it to the PAGES_TO_RENDER tuple in settings.py .
PAGES_TO_RENDER = ( u" index.html " , ) and then go to the command line and type : python build .
py
And that will build the website in the deploy / directory .
Finally , the base .
html template is already setup to include the static / style.css CSS file , so lets throw together some really simple CSS as an example .
Create the my_cms / static / style.css file .
body { background - color : black ; color : white ; }
And then run the build script again : python build .
py
And the files in deploy / will be displayed using the new CSS file .
And with that , we 're done .
Relative Versus Absolute Paths
Its worth noting that when loading the page off the local file system ( as opposed to throwing it into the root directory of a webserver like Apache or nginx ) the current path to the static directory wo n't work .
That is beacuse it is expecting the static folder at / static / , which happens to be your filesystem 's root directory , not where you are serving files from .
If you keep your webpage urls flat ( i.e. have pages like / index.html , /help.html , /about.html , etc ) , then you can change the STATIC_URL_FORMAT setting in settings.py to u" static / %s " instead of u " / static / %s " , and it will display correctly even when not deploy in the root directory .
Expanding on the Idea : Thumbnail Gallery
With the current version of this build script there is already some helpfulness occuring .
Each time you add an image to the image folder , then you get a free thumbnail as well , and also get it added to both the images list and the images_dict dictionary .
With those two tools you can display images by filename ( minus the extension , because who wants to remember those ? ) , or display their thumbnail instead .
You can create a screenshot gallery of all your site 's images ( useful if you were creating a application showcase website , for example ) doing something as simple as dropping screenshots into the images / directory and adding this code to a template :
< div class= " gallery " > { % for image in images %} < div class= " thumbnail " > < a href= " {{ image . image }} " > < img src= " {{ image .
thumbnail }} " > </a> </div > { % endfor %} </div >
For many webpages , that 's all the dynamic functionality that you really need .
And now that you 're serving static files you 're dinky little vps is n't going to commit suicide if there are more than ten concurrent visitors to your website .
Expanding the Idea : Automated Builds
For many websites , you 're caching the pages for half an hour anyway , so for those thirty minutes your Django setup is essentially a mediocre file server .
Instead you can use a static solution like this script , and run a cron job that updates the static media every thirty minutes ( or even everytime there is a file modified in or added to the directory ) .
Although this is certainly a poor solution for highly dynamic sites , for many sites such an approach may be sufficient .
Expanding the Idea : Rendering Markdown
One of the downsides of the simplest approach to this problem is that you 'll be stuck writing in HTML instead of a more pleasant markup like Markdown or Textile .
But it does n't have to be that way .
Imagine a simple reworking of the Markdown filter to be used as a tag instead :
{ % markdown %} Render ** all this !** to Markdown ! { % endmarkdown %}
It would take a couple of lines to implement , and would open up doors that are actually worth walking through .
You could even extend that idea to something like the syntax highlighting template filter , and have easy syntax highlighting in your static websites .
I 'm sure you 've already thought of more ideas of your own on how to improve upon this skeleton .
There is a lot of low hanging fruit to making better static pages .

LA PORTE —
The children were eating hamburgers at a kitchen table when the state came to take them away .
Their grandmother , a cafeteria lunch lady who bakes the kolaches at La Porte Elementary , carefully wrapped up the unfinished meals and placed them in the freezer for when the children return .
If Juvenile Court Judge John Phillips has his way , that day will never come .
Yolanda and Arnold Del Bosque have taken care of their grandchildren since infancy , until a few weeks ago when Phillips ordered the 1 - and 2 - year - olds removed from the home and placed into foster care , where they could be adopted out to strangers .
The judge 's ruling , which Child Protective Services argued against , was n't prompted by any allegations of abuse or neglect , but apparently in large part by his belief that the Del Bosques , who are in their 50s , are too old to be parents .
At a hearing last month , according to a transcript , Phillips said the boys , Rafael and Luis Sierra , would need guidance in their late teens and 20s " and the stark reality is there 's a very good chance " their grandparents " will be dead at that time . "
The words stung Yolanda , 59 , and her husband of 19 years , Arnold , a 52 - year - old retired truck driver , as they listened in court .
" I do n't know when the judge became God , " a tearful Arnold told me last week as he sat at a glass kitchen table smothered with legal bills and court papers aimed at fighting the judge 's ruling .
" I did n't know there was an age limit on being a grandpa or grandma . "
Like the uneaten hamburgers in the freezer , the Del Bosques ' lives are frozen in time .
The children 's rooms in the couple 's tidy trailer home remain untouched , still stocked with storybooks , Barney tapes , a Fisher Price potty .
Arnold refuses to remove the car seat from the back of his ' 92 F - 150 .
Beyond childhood
The Del Bosques ' prospects for getting the kids back are n't rosy .
Although they threw a barbecue benefit to pay for an attorney , the money quickly ran out — but not before Judge Phillips blocked the attorney 's attempts to intervene in the case and request a jury trial , despite the fact that both requests were timely filed .
In the transcript of the Aug. 14 hearing , Phillips does n't discuss why he denied the request .
But he went on at length about his feelings on grandparents being parents .
The judge argued that " the best interest of the child " does n't just cover the period of childhood , but spans an entire lifetime , until death .
Maybe even farther .
It was n't just the welfare of these two boys he was looking out for , Phillips explained , but that of the unborn children they may have someday .
Making Yolanda and Arnold parents would " effectively eliminate a possibility that the children of these children will have grandparents , and I think that by itself is unfair . "
The judge concluded : " I would n't be so drastic to accuse the grandparents of being selfish because I think that they love these two children , but now you know how I feel .
And I 'm not in a position nor am I willing to debate that issue because it 's something that I 've thought about for a long time . "
Old drug problem
I tried to interview the judge for this column , but his court coordinator Michael Millard said Phillips would n't talk because the case is pending .
The judge 's clerk would n't let me review the case file .
A final trial is set for today that could lead to the termination of parental rights for the boys ' mother and father , Yolanda 's son from a previous marriage , because of drug abuse .
Millard indicated that age was n't the real reason for removing the children from their grandparents ' home .
" Apparently , there was some additional information that was found out " about the Del Bosques , Millard said .
To be sure , the Del Bosque case , like most CPS cases , is complicated :
The couple struggles financially , Arnold Del Bosque is on disability because of his diabetes and , although he has no criminal history , he volunteered to caseworkers early on that he had a drug problem 20 years ago and sold cocaine for a while to support his habit .
But the case got much more complicated after the judge made his feelings known about the grandparents ' age .
Changing their tune
Suddenly , the Del Bosques say , court appointees , who had filed glowing reports about their parenting and their " stable , nurturing home " after more than a dozen visits began to change their tune , citing cryptic allegations from drug - using relatives and claims about the couple 's health , family life and drug use that were flat wrong .
On Aug. 14 , both CPS and court - appointed guardians strongly supported the children staying with their grandparents .
But , in a motion to keep the grandparents from intervening a few days later , the children 's appointed attorney , Michelle Bush , argued that allowing them to stay with the Del Bosques " would significantly impair " their " physical health and emotional development . "
Bush cited " holes in the floor and roach infestations . "
( I saw neither when I visited . )
She listed among Arnold 's " extreme health problems " heart failure and epilepsy , neither of which he says he 's ever had .
She said the family was too poor and had " minimal to no family support , " even though the Del Bosques have a large extended family .
And , somehow , Arnold 's admission of a drug problem " 20 years ago " was represented in Bush 's report as using and / or dealing " for twenty years . "
A couple of days ago , even CPS , which had argued against the removal of the children , called me to stay it had changed its recommendation , citing " additional information " from various sources .
It 's possible that today 's hearing could reveal some validity in these mysterious allegations .
I 'll be there to see , as will Barbara Stalder , an attorney with the University of Houston 's legal aid clinic , who agreed this week to take the Del Bosques ' case .
" When you have glowing reports about these individuals , who they 've had more than a year to evaluate , and then at the eleventh hour , you 've got these other allegations being thrown in there , I 'm sorry , it 's a smokescreen , " she told me .
It 's still unclear if the judge in any way pressured his appointees and others involved in the case to drop their support of the Del Bosques or their opposition of his removal of the children .
But the judge 's bias against grandparents being parents seems clear .
And that flawed philosophy should n't be allowed to break apart the only real home these boys have known .

MUMBAI , India 
Here in the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower , what you think of the new India may depend on whether you are the person having soap squeezed onto your hands or the person squeezing the soap .
In every men ’s washroom at the Taj is a helper .
As you approach the sink , he salutes you .
Before you can turn on the tap , he does it for you .
Before you can apply soap , he presses the dispenser .
Before you can get a towel , he dangles one .
As you leave , he salutes you again and mutters : “ Right , sir .
O.K. , sir .
Thank you , sir . ”
Step outside , and you see sedans reeking of new affluence .
Inside are drivers , many of them asleep because they work 20 - hour shifts , waking up at 6 a .m. to catch a train , taking the boss to and from work , then to his dinner , then to drinks , then dropping him off at home at 1 a.m. and catching a taxi to go back to the tenements .
At 1 a.m. back in the boss ’s apartment , the hallways are often littered with servants and sweepers who work inside by day but sleep outside by night .
They learn to sleep on cold tile , with tenants stepping over them when returning from evenings out .
A brilliant student , Jonathan sailed through grade school .
He completed his assignments easily and routinely earned As. Jonathan puzzled over why some of his classmates struggled , and his parents told him he had a special gift .
In the seventh grade , however , Jonathan suddenly lost interest in school , refusing to do homework or study for tests .
As a consequence , his grades plummeted .
His parents tried to boost their son's confidence by assuring him that he was very smart .
But their attempts failed to motivate Jonathan ( who is a composite drawn from several children ) .
Schoolwork , their son maintained , was boring and pointless .
Copyright holders should n't have to prove that an unauthorized distribution of their work occurred in order to collect damages , according to the Motion Picture Association of America .
The group made its argument in an amicus brief filed on Friday to Judge Michael Davis , the judge overseeing the Jammie Thomas trial , after he asked for feedback from the industry before deciding whether to order a mistrial .
Both sides realize that the stakes are high and are throwing everything they 've got Judge Davis ' way .
At the time of the Jammie Thomas trial , Thomas was found liable for $ 9,250 in damages per song for a collection of 24 songs that she made available online , for a total of $ 222,000 in total damages .
Since there was no direct way to know if anyone else had downloaded even one of the 24 songs ( aside from the downloads made by the investigators ) , Judge Davis told the jury to make its decision based on the fact that Thomas had a handful of files shared .
In May , however , Davis said that he may have made a " manual error of law " when instructing the jury .
He then asked the attorneys for both cases ( as well as other " interested parties " ) to submit amicus briefs in order to help him decide how to proceed on the case .
In its filing , the MPAA says that the mere act of " making available " a copyrighted piece on a P2P network should serve as sufficient evidence of copyright infringement .
The group " urges the Court not to impose any requirement of actual distribution " because it argues that the Copyright Act allows content owners a broad right of distribution , not just control over actual distributions .
Therefore , anyone who makes files available over P2P networks should be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of actual distribution , even if proof of that actual distribution does n't exist .
" The only purpose for placing copyrighted works in the shared folder is , of course , to ' share , ' by making those works available to countless other P2P networks , " wrote the MPAA .
It sees arguments to the contrary as mere technicalities designed to make it harder for rightsholders to prosecute infringers .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation shot back with its own amicus brief , arguing that the Copyright Act does not grant a " making available " right to copyright owners .
It also said that trade groups should n't be allowed to claim that an actual distribution took place based solely on downloads from their own investigators .
According to the MPAA , providing this level of evidence is just too hard .
" It is often very difficult , and in some cases impossible , to provide such direct proof when confronting modern forms of copyright infringement , whether over P2P networks or otherwise , " writes the group .
" Understandably , copyright infringers typically do not keep records of infringement .
Mandating that proof could thus have the pernicious effect of depriving copyright owners of a practical remedy against massive copyright infringement in many instances . "
It 's clear from the MPAA's and the EFF 's briefs that the Jammie Thomas case wo n't be fading into memory any time soon .
Another hearing on the case is scheduled for August , at which time Thomas may get the new trial that she has been asking for since last October .

Which was when one of Nike ’s prototype Olympic track shoes , code - named Flywire , went to pieces .
A test athlete on the 400 - meter Michael Johnson test oval , told to push the top - secret racing spikes to their limit , had done just that .
“ The shoe blew out on the side of his forefoot , ” says Sean McDowell , Nike ’s design director for Olympic footwear , “ like a balloon . ”
But in that breakdown three years ago , Nike caught a whiff of engineering ambrosia : a loophole in the Universal Law of Sports Technology , which says unequivocally that you can build something infinitely light or infinitely strong but not both ; that there are I - beams and there are feathers , and you ca n’t build one from the other .
No exceptions .
Except in this case .
“ He said it was the most amazing 300 meters he ’d ever experienced , ” McDowell says of the test runner ’s reaction to his first strides in the ethereal prototype .
“ Like he was running naked .
Like he had spikes growing out of his feet . ”
Before that day , the lightest pair of track shoes ever made — Michael Johnson ’s golden Nike spikes — weighed 112 grams .
Even now , they are considered a marvel of shoe engineering because they were designed to hold together just long enough for Johnson to make it across the finish line , and maybe a few meters more .
But the Flywire prototype that disintegrated on that Oregon track weighed 67 grams per pair , or a little over 1 ounce each .
They were an astonishing 41 % lighter .
Flywire , which will debut at the Beijing Games , uses only the barest exoskeleton of wispy , high - tech filaments — roughly 7 linear feet of thread , affixed to an ultrathin fabric scrim — to provide its structure and shape ( think of a space - age Roman sandal ) .
With the usual need for supporting material reduced almost to zero , the shoe is not only featherlight , but also radically simple , fast , and cheap to build .
So while it promises to improve racing performance , it also hints at dramatically lower production costs for everyday shoes — a construction technique that springs directly from a designer ’s imagination , flows through a computer chip , then flowers in three dimensions in a matter of seconds .
“ It opens up new frontiers , ” says Jay Meschter , Flywire ’s lead designer .
“ Analog stitching is gone .
This is a digitally programmed shoe .
Everybody realizes this is a smarter way to build shoes , and it ’s just going to pervade everything we do . ”

Nike is not alone in its Olympic cries of “ Eureka ! ” Adidas , Mizuno , Gill Athletics ( the world ’s largest manufacturer of track - and - field equipment ) , Speedo , and many others have been working feverishly to rewrite the Universal Law of Sports Technology .
And by August , all of them will have performed another amazing feat : collapsing the timeline that separates a new Olympic concept — often representing millions of dollars in up - front R&D costs — from its return on investment .
Suddenly , Olympic innovators will be able to make the long jump between the design studio and the cash register .
About a week before the lights go up on the opening ceremonies , you ’ll be able to find a pair of Flywire HyperDunk basketball shoes at a Niketown near you .
What you ’ll discover on these pages are 18 technological masterworks — from archery bows to BMX gear — and a behind - the - scenes look at how they were created , including a rare tour of Nike ’s supersecret Innovation Kitchen .
Each item represents a dramatic technological insight , a critical increment of leverage over the competition .
Such improvements are hard enough to come by but even rarer in the tradition - bound context of the Olympics .
Take Adidas , for example :
With just two years until the opening ceremonies in China , the German giant was struggling to conjure a new track spike for its star Texan runner , the 400 - meter gold medalist Jeremy Wariner .
After watching hours of super - slow - motion footage of Wariner ’s quirky gait , the company decided to replace his Pookie spike , which helped Wariner win in Athens ( and nearly every 400 - meter race he has entered since ) .
Called Lone Star and sporting a crown insignia to signify Wariner ’s leadership in the sport , the new shoe has the following unorthodox feature :
It lists to port .
“ Most middle - distance races are won in the turns , ” explains Mic Lussier , the French - Canadian leader of the Adidas Innovation Team , or aIT , which developed the shoe .
And track runners never , ever turn to the right .
So Lussier ’s 50 biomechanical engineers , industrial designers , and electromechanical experts set about making asymmetrical spikes for Wariner .
The skewed shoes would be founded on ultralight carbon plates made of microscopic nanotubes 20 times stronger than steel .
And they would “ redirect the line of force that loads on the outside of his right foot , ” Lussier says , “ and send it inward , toward his big toe . ”
In other words , Wariner ’s new right shoe would accelerate to the left .
“ The idea is based on the same asymmetrical suspension you see in a Nascar stock car , ” Lussier says .
“ It ’s really quite amazing . ”
Even before he pulled the trigger on his company ’s pneumatic javelin gun , Gill Athletics ’ vice president of engineering , Jeff Watry , knew he had created a breakthrough Olympic spear .
Still , he was curious to see just how far his new design could fly , so he disconnected the catapult ’s regulator and hooked the gun directly to the factory ’s compressed air .
advertisement
“ Uh - oh , ” he said to his team as they watched the javelin disappear over the company ’s headquarters in Champaign , Illinois .
“ That ’s farther than we thought . ”
The new 800 - gram OTE Composite FX landed a quarter mile away , in a pond behind another company ’s warehouse .
Watry ’s bench testing had already shown him that the OTE ( one of two primary javelins you ’ll see during the men ’s event in Beijing ; the other is made by the $ 7 billion Swedish materials - technology company Sandvik AB ) had struck a near - perfect balance between weight and strength .
But his challenge was not to make something light and aerodynamic ; it was to design something light and aerodynamic that would n’t destroy the athlete throwing it .
When an elite thrower releases a javelin correctly , it “ goes through a point , ” flying out of the hand in a straight line at a 40 - degree incline , as if it were being thrown through a bull ’s - eye : no wobble , no flutter .
But a javelin shaft typically vibrates for two seconds after it ’s released , and since vibration hinders aerodynamic lift ( by disturbing the flow of air around the shaft ) , many engineers began experimenting with javelins built of pure , vibration - absorbing carbon .
There was only one problem : Pure - carbon javelins may not vibrate , but they “ kill your thrower , ” Watry says .
Instead of being released as a two - second - long flutter , all that energy is directed backward , into the athlete ’s body — with dire consequences .
“ The guy would last about three months before his shoulder blew out , ” Watry explains .
Shoulder and elbow injuries may be endemic to the sport , but all - carbon shafts made it downright unhealthy to throw a spear .
Watry ’s solution :
He made an aluminum shaft ( for elbow - friendly flexibility and “ softness ” ) and wrapped it in a spirally woven carbon sheet — a giant toothpick swaddled in a carbon - fiber fishnet stocking .
The 50 - 50 mix of materials reduced the forces exerted on the thrower ’s elbow , and cut the OTE ’s vibration time by 10 % , a big margin by Olympic standards .
If that all sounds like a lot of labor for an item that will sell only about 30 copies ( at $ 785 a pop ) in the next year , remember :
The Olympics are the mother of all loss leaders , and if everything goes well , Watry says , Gill - branded javelins will be on all three levels of the medal stand this summer .
That ’s the hottest 60 - second spot on television for the company ’s vast product line .
Speedo ’s brand image hit a high - water mark in 1972 when a mustachioed Mark Spitz won seven gold medals in the company ’s star - spangled nylon - elastane briefs .
But the Nottingham , England — based company ’s success in the Olympic pool had begun with its first world record in 1932 — and has been constant since .
For example , during three consecutive Olympics , from 1968 to 1976 , the brand was worn by an estimated 70 % of medalists , including 27 of 29 gold medalists in Mexico City .
advertisement
If there has been a dark side to Speedo ’s hegemony , it lies in its product ’s minimalism .
The mere word “ Speedo ” conjures images of plump , pallid Germans basking on the Côte d’Azur in unter - size beachwear .
Today , however , Speedo looms large .
In February , the company introduced a full - body swimsuit so fast it has inspired regulatory scrutiny , international controversy , athlete - sponsorship defections , and — in Italy , not surprisingly — fist shaking .
The controversy springs from the way Speedo outfoxed the rule governing swimsuits : FINA , the sport ’s international federation , bars suits that create buoyancy .
No suit may “ lift ” a swimmer or make her lighter .
No air bubbles .
No fins or spoilers .
Given two swimmers of equal power , however , the smaller one slips through the water faster .
So Speedo ’s new LZR ( pronounced “ laser ” ) Racer does n’t lift ; it squeezes , exploiting a swimming - pool loophole in the Universal Law of Sports Technology .
If the law insists that you can have something lighter or stronger , but not both , Speedo decided to make its swimmers “ lighter ” by making its suit stronger , using a NASA - tested black sheathing that compresses the body with 70 times more force — 7 kilograms per meter — than the nylon - elastane standard .
And the suit does n’t just make swimmers smaller , it makes them sleeker , too : Speedo used the powerful material to remold athletes into a more ideal hydrodynamic shape .
Working in water flumes in New Zealand and test facilities in Australia , and using computational fluid dynamics software invented by Ansys , the company determined where a swimmer ’s “ form drag ” ( turbulence caused by a body ’s shape ) is most acute .
It then inserted slippery , polyurethane panels to compress and reshape those body parts — buttocks , breasts , upper thighs — most responsible for the drag .
When the LZR Racer appeared at the world short - course championships in Manchester , England , in April , the swimming world went off the deep end .
While the LZR Racer was FINA - approved and available to any athlete who wanted one ( including you , as of this fall ) , it was clearly faster than offerings from competitors such as TYR , Adidas , Mizuno , and Nike .
There were rumors of elite athletes jilting their sponsors on the pool deck and slipping into a Speedo .
Italian coach Alberto Castagnetti claimed use of the suit was the equivalent of “ technological doping . ”
Head American coach Mark Schubert says Americans sponsored by other brands will have “ a black - and - white decision ” when they get to Beijing : “ The money or the gold medal . ”
German swimmer Thomas Rupprath went so far as to suggest apostasy — that his country ’s swimming federation dump German - made Adidas suits in favor of Speedo’s .
“ Otherwise , ” he says , “ we will sink completely into mediocrity . ”
As of late May , 41 world records had been set since the LZR Racer was introduced : 37 of those swimmers were wearing it .
The Italian swim coach claimed Speedo ’s suit was the equivalent of “ technological doping . ”
Nowhere do the extreme technical precision and naked commercial yearning of Olympic research coexist more naturally than at Nike .
And this year , Nike is producing Olympic gear on a larger and vastly messier scale than at any other time in its history :
The company will introduce 68 event - specific shoes for all 28 sports and their various disciplines in Beijing ( up from 11 sports in Athens ) ; new high - temperature - specific apparel for USA Track & Field and USA Basketball uniforms ; and outfits for more than 120 individual countries and federations .
Nike ’s global manager for Beijing , Kris Aman , is charged with preparing the company for the Games and beyond .
In what he calls a “ two - headed monster of process management , ” Nike has decided to offer nearly all of its Olympic innovations to everyday consumers in September .
( Nike ’s primary competitor , Adidas , will also offer many of its Olympic shoes at retail this August , through distributor Eastbay Inc . )
But the new Olympic idea with the biggest commercial potential is Flywire — not because every kid will want the shoe , but because Flywire reinvents how shoes are made .

The inspiration for the new construction came from the cables on a suspension bridge .
Rather than cords of steel , Flywire uses thin , strong - as - steel threads of Vectran , placed in fan - shaped clusters of between 10 and 20 strands , each about 3 inches in length .
The strands are positioned at key points — the forefoot , the heel , and so on — and anchored to the shoe only at the ends ; a scrim between the foot and the filaments keeps out rocks and debris but has no larger structural role .
Up close , you can see through a Flywire shoe in the same way you can see through a house that ’s just been framed with two - by - fours .
Predictably , a shoe made of thread and a slip of fabric is incredibly light .
“ When I tossed one up in the air , ” NBA MVP Kobe Bryant says of his Flywire - based HyperDunk , “ I was n’t sure it was going to come back down . ”
The surprise lies in how strong the new construction is — and how Flywire could change Nike , maybe even the shoe industry itself .
Flywire lead designer Jay Meschter ’s stroke of genius was to stop thinking of a shoe as something assembled and start thinking of it as something that is , well , printed .
When Meschter connected the two ideas of filaments and strength , his mind leaped to embroidery machines , which , he realized , print out lines and shapes using colored thread stitches rather than ink .
If Meschter could stitch in 3 - D form the cabling that holds up a suspension bridge , and anchor the ultrathin “ cables ” around a foot shape , he’d be able to create an ultralight shoe in the same time it took to stitch somebody ’s name on a shirt .
“ When we worked out the kinks , ” he says , “ we realized what makes this so exciting :
This embroidery machine is literally a printer for shoes .
Most of [ a Flywire shoe ’s ] design can take place in a computer ; you make decisions on - screen about where you ’re placing reinforcement , and then you trial the shoe as a ‘ printout . ’ ” No more laboriously handcrafted one - off prototypes .
No more fabrics painstakingly selected for the right blend of weight and strength .
Now , if a new shoe needs tweaking , all a designer has to do is add another filament to the design and hit PRINT .
The impact of Flywire could be huge .
There have been rumors that the new technique is so inexpensive it could allow Nike to return some of its manufacturing to the United States from China , the company ’s largest manufacturing and materials source , drastically reducing labor and manufacturing costs .
And like most miracles of design , Flywire did not spring from some gleaming white mountaintop — it came limping out of a cruddy backwater , a tiny subset of a subcube on the Nike campus called the Innovation Kitchen .

To find the Kitchen , look for this welcoming sign on the right side of the lobby of the Mia Hamm building : NOBODY GETS IN TO SEE THE COOKS .
NOT NOBODY NOT NOHOW POSITIVELY NO TOURS
When the doors swing open , the first color you see is blood red .
It ’s probably paint , of course , but the crimson entryway is nevertheless a reminder that about 90 % of the concepts hatched here are mortally wounded before they get to the lobby .
Inside , the Kitchen is a disaster area : a jumble of blown - out test spikes , a rejected pair of Bryant ’s new HyperDunks , tickets to a Clapton concert , a René Magritte poster .
But this ratty little warren of offices — the only place in Nike ’s hypermanicured campus where you ’ll find chaos — has been the source of some of the company ’s greatest hits : Michael Johnson ’s golden spikes , Cathy Freeman ’s famous speed suit , and every Air Jordan since the Kitchen was founded in 2001 .
Rumor has it that tens of millions of dollars have been spent on the Kitchen since its inception .
A number of people inside the company still ask why it exists .
“ What are you guys doing , man ?
Where ’s the stuff ? ” says the Kitchen ’s VP of special projects , Tinker Hatfield , recounting the challenges he still gets occasionally from Nike business - unit directors who question ( or even resent ) the Kitchen ’s freedom from the normal quarterly business cycle .
In fact , the Kitchen was first created to counter the negative effects of Nike ’s enormous growth .
After the company stumbled in the late 1990s , it was divided into six discrete business units ( basketball , women ’s fitness , running , and so forth ) , each responsible for its own profit and loss .
“ A natural casualty of [ dividing up the company ] is fewer resources going to new product design , ” Hatfield says , “ because one of the easy ways in the short term to make your division ’s numbers look good is to cut back on innovation . ”
The Kitchen was created as an antidote to fiscal prudence run amok .
“ You have to remember , we ’re very strategically shot into an orbit around planet Nike , ” Hatfield adds , “ but not too far out .
In the end , innovation is not helpful unless there ’s a way to tie it to a powerful company that helps drive it somewhere . ”
Innovation is n’t helpful unless it ’s tied to a powerful company that drives it somewhere .
Right now , that somewhere is Beijing , where athletes will be flying citius , altius , fortius in defiance of the Universal Law of Sports Technology .
Their “ faster , higher , stronger ” ethos may stir our souls — we mortals thrill to their victories and agonize at their defeats — but the unromantic truth is that the guys who made all this cool stuff moved on a while ago .

“ I do n’t sit there biting my fingernails when I watch somebody compete at the Olympics , ” Hatfield says .
“ I hope they do well , but we ’re working four or five years out , especially for these really meaningful performance innovations . ”
He pauses for a moment , a wry smile playing across his face .
“ There ’s a certain amount of swashbuckling that goes on in this process , ” he confesses .
“ You have to be a bit of a cold - blooded killer . ”

For some sneak footage that was shot at an early demonstration , watch below .
The Dream is expected to be officially launched in New York next Tuesday , when Google and mobile phone carrier AT&T will hold a joint press conference .
As well as the slide - out qwerty keyboard pictured above , the Dream is expected to have a built - in global positioning system and run the suite of Google applications , including g-mail , Google maps and , if course , Google ’s new web browser , Chrome .
This morning technology site ChrunchGear quoted an unnamed person involved with the development of the phone as saying the Dream would cost $ US200 under contract with AT&T .
That will put the Google phone on a crash course with Apple ’s iPhone , which sells for $ US199 under contract .
According to The Times of London , the manufacturer of the handset , Taiwanese company HTC , expects to ship 600,000 to 700,000 units of the new phone this year , while analysts have a more conservative estimate of 300,000 to 500,000 units .

The written word is a part of every day life .
At its most basic , writing is a way of communicating .
This is the one inalienable characteristic of writing itself , whether you ’re communicating with a colleague or friend or you ’re actually communicating with yourself – though a shopping list , for instance .
Aside from the fact that writing is an inescapable part of every day life , there are many good reasons you should make a good session of writing part of your daily routine , even if it ’s just a few hundred words .
You do n’t have to be a pro to reap the benefits of creating the written word .
1. Remove stress from mind , place on paper
Writing can be therapeutic .
It can be a way to vent all the pent - up frustrations burdening your mind into a far less volatile form , paper ( or screen ) .
You can address your anger , fear , worry and stress without bludgeoning the person who embodies those emotions for you with a paperweight .
Writing can serve as a form of cathartic stress relief where you finally get to say what you ca n’t say out loud , in real life .
Just do n’t let your vented feelings get into the wrong hands , or you may end up paying some pretty hefty blackmail cash .

2. Sweep Your Mind
A daily writing habit gives you regular time to sweep your mind for forgotten tasks and ideas that have been fermenting in the back of your head without your knowledge .
It allows you to take the unordered thoughts floating around your head like lost puppies in zero gravity , and turn them into ordered plans and actions .
This is the fundamental principle that the mindsweep and weekly review are based on : getting everything you can think of out of your head , and into a written format .
This simple process can save your life when things are getting overwhelming and complicated .
3. Keep Your Writing Skills Sharp
Write every day to keep your skill with the written word sharp .
Like any skill , the ability to communicate clearly , concisely and aesthetically degrades without practice .
As a result , many people who do n’t write regularly can freeze up , lost for words , on something so simple as an email to a friend .
Writing every day , even in a stream - of - consciousness , unedited format will maintain and gradually improve your writing skills , and since dealing with the written word is a fundamental part of daily modern life , there ’s nothing bad about that .
4. Make Some Pocket Money
If you ’re not a professional writer , pocket money is probably all you ’ll ever want to earn from your words .
But if you ’ve got a knack for it and just had a great dinner at a new restaurant and written about it for your daily pages , then is n’t it better to have a shot at getting that review published instead of letting the piece do absolutely nothing ?
Advertising
These days , it ’s easy to submit to many publications without spending considerable time and money doing so .
While you ’re unlikely to get too many bites without a good track record as a writer , it ’s certainly easy enough to be worth the effort , and your wallet will be pleased .
5. Turn the Noise Off
Get away from the constant low - quality input and output systems of day - to - day life , such as meaningless small - talk and weather conversations , text messaging , Twitter , checking the mailbox , and most email and many websites .
You receive and create barrages of useless distractions that do n’t help you or the people you know ; sitting down to write lets you get away from it all .
It ’s important to keep the noise to a minimum so you can focus on creating and receiving strong material , things that are really worth reading and writing .
6. Enhance Your Communication Skills
Use daily writing to enhance your communication skills .
In this culture , communication is so often hampered because we do n’t know how to express ourselves , whether it be verbal or written .
Writing regularly can hone the skill of self - expression , something that is useful in written communications such as email , and that can translate into improved verbal communication .
If you have trouble communicating what you want or asking tough questions , regular writing will give you a mind for structuring words quickly to achieve the desired affect in a diplomatic way .

7. Know What You Want
Part of the reason so many people do not get what they want in life is because they do not know what they want from it .
Certainly not the main reason that people do n’t get what they want , but in so many cases it is the obstacle .
How can you get what you want or achieve your dreams if you ’re not 100 % clear on what they are ?
Writing each day gives you time to think carefully and reflect on what you want to achieve the most , and develop a clearer , achievable image and plan for that result .
8. Develop Your Analytical Skills
Writing regularly develops your analytical and rational skills .
Working through your problems with a piece of paper encourages you to think things through clearly , in both linear ( sequential ) and non-linear ( creative ) ways .
The best solutions come from a mix of both logical and creative thinking .
Many people tend to panic and react emotionally to their problems , but if you ’re used to solving them by processing each component of the problem in writing , you ’ll develop a better approach and skillset .
You ’ll at least pause to think through the situation before hitting the panic button next time something comes up !
9. Get Away from Technology
In # 5 we talked about turning the noise off for a while , which comes from all sorts of sources – not just tech - related sources .
But another problem of ours is our dependence on technology , and it seems that everything that can be done on a computer , is done on a computer .
Advertising
If you opt to use a pen and paper instead of a computer , you give yourself valuable time away from technology to gather your thoughts without constant , meaningless interruptions and distractions .
But more importantly , you give yourself time with the tactile and real .
10 . Meet Yourself All Over Again
In a fast - paced society it ’s easy to forget things like what you believe in and what you ’re doing this ( whatever this may be ) for .
Letting words flow out of your brain unedited can introduce you to a part of yourself you ’d been censoring from yourself to cope with everyday life .
Why did you start down the path you ’re currently on ?
This is an important question whether you consider your current path to have begun on the weekend , or a decade ago .
Discontentment , disillusionment , and unhappiness often come from forgetting why we ’re doing something ( or , on a different track , not having a good reason for living a certain way ) and it is important to keep those simple reasons at the forefront of your mind or you run the risk of letting your life become a series of boring , menial actions .
It ’s not only important to remind yourself of your motives for your current actions ; it ’s important to monitor your actions to see if they align with your life goals so that you can change them .
Sometimes , the only way to keep such a close monitor on your actions and goals is to write about them every day .

A deal to partially nationalise European banking and insurance giant Fortis has been agreed .
The move came after talks between the European Central Bank and the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg .
Ministers from the three countries agreed to put 11.2bn euros ( $ 16.1bn ; £ 8.9 bn ) into Fortis to save the bank .
However , European bank shares fell sharply on worries that other banks could have problems , and on concerns over the US $ 700 bn bail - out plan .
One of the biggest casualties was Fortis ' rival Dexia .
Shares in the bank had plunged by almost a third at one stage after a newspaper report said that it was seeking extra funding .
A spokeswoman for Dexia , which acts as banker for French local government , insisted that the group was in no immediate danger of collapse .
The French and Belgian governments have already announced they will step in to support Dexia .
Savers ' not abandoned '
World stock markets fell on Monday even after the US $ 700 bn bank bail - out deal .
Investors are worried that cleaning up the mess of bad debts will affect economic growth for the foreseeable future .
As part of the weekend deal to rescue Fortis , the bank will have to sell its stake in Dutch bank ABN Amro which it partially took over last year .
The Dutch government has not yet named any potential buyers .
Belgian Prime Minister
Yves Leterme said the bail - out showed Fortis would not be allowed to fail , after its share price plunged in recent days .
Mr Leterme said : " We have taken up our responsibility , we did not abandon the savers . "
Too big The Fortis deal will see Belgium contribute 4.7bn euros , the Netherlands 4bn euros and Luxembourg 2.5 bn euros .
We are giving people security , Fortis will be stronger
Wouter Bos
Dutch finance minister
Iceland bails out Glitnir bank Bradford & Bingley nationalised Each government will take a 49 % share in Fortis in their countries .
The rescue by the ECB and the three countries came after no serious bidder could be found for the whole of the Fortis group .
The presence of ECB chief Jean - Claude Trichet at the talks to save Fortis underlined the seriousness of concerns about the integrity of the eurozone 's financial system .
Fortis was seen as too big a European bank to be allowed to go under .
In Belgium the bank is the country 's biggest private sector employer and more than 1.5 million households or about half the country bank with the group .
It employs 85,000 staff worldwide .
Chairman resigns European financiers said that US financial crisis was partly to blame .
" What is happening in the US has most certainly had an impact on the financial sector in the rest of the world , " said Dutch central bank head Nout Wellink .
" Due to rumours , Fortis became a bank in a special position , " he said .
Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said : " We could not have intervened - but the question was whether Fortis would have survived . "
" We are giving people security , Fortis will be stronger , " he said .
Fortis was seen as too big to be allowed to fail Under the deal Fortis chairman , Maurice Lippens , will resign and will be replaced by an outside candidate .
Mr Lippens has been criticised by shareholders for concealing problems at the bank .
The bank 's interim chief executive Herman Verwilst has also stepped down and his replacement Filip Dierckx has already taken over .
Asset sale Insolvency fears saw the company 's shares fall to their lowest level in more than a decade before the deal was announced .
The shares have lost more than three - quarters of their value in the past year .
Fortis , which has its joint headquarters in the Belgian capital Brussels and in Utrecht in the Netherlands , has denied any solvency problems were imminent .
The bank 's problems have their origin in its participation - along with Britain 's Royal Bank of Scotland and Spain 's Santander - in the 70bn euro purchase of the Dutch bank ABN last year .
Fortis has been weighed down by the 24bn euros it paid for its share of ABN .
Before this bail - out Fortis said it needed to raise around 5 bn euros as it absorbed ABN 's Dutch retail banking arm .
It had said it could meet the shortfall by selling other assets , but has so far found it hard to find any buyers .
Last month , Fortis announced its profits for the first six months had fallen by 41 % to 1.6bn euros ( £ 1.2 bn ) against a year ago .

As climate change is credited as one of the main drivers behind soaring food prices , the Global Crop Diversity Trust is undertaking a major effort to search crop collections — from Azerbaijan to Nigeria — for the traits that could arm agriculture against the impact of future changes .
Traits , such as drought resistance in wheat , or salinity tolerance in potato , will become essential as crops around the world have to adapt to new climate conditions .
Climate change is having the most negative impact in the poorest regions of the world , already causing a decrease in yields of most major food crops due to droughts , floods , increasingly salty soils and higher temperatures .
Crop diversity is the raw material needed for improving and adapting food crops to harsher climate conditions and constantly evolving pests and diseases .
However , it is disappearing from many of the places where it has been placed for safekeeping — the world 's genebanks .
Compounding the fact that it is not well conserved is the fact that it is not well understood .
A lack of readily available and accurate data on key traits can severely hinder plant breeders ' efforts to identify material they can use to breed new varieties best suited for the climates most countries will experience in the coming decades .
The support provided by the Global Crop Diversity Trust will not only rescue collections which are at risk , but enable breeders and others to screen collections for important characteristics .
" Our crops must produce more food , on the same amount of land , with less water , and more expensive energy , " said Cary Fowler , Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust .
" This , on top of climate change , poses an unprecedented challenge to farming .
There is no possible scenario in which we can continue to grow the food we require without crop diversity .
Through our grants we seek , as a matter of urgency , to rescue threatened crop collections and better understand and conserve crop diversity . "
Through a competitive grants scheme , the Trust will provide funding for projects that screen developing country collections — including wheat , chickpea , rice , barley , lentils , coconut , banana , maize , and sweet potato — for traits that will be essential for breeding climate - ready varieties .
These projects involve 21 agricultural research institutions in Argentina , Bangladesh , Brazil , India , Israel , Mali , Nigeria , Niger , Pakistan , Papua New Guinea , Peru , the Philippines , South Africa , Sri Lanka , and Syria .
Scientists will be screening chickpea and wheat collections in Pakistan for traits of economic importance for farmers ; characterizing rare coconuts in Sri Lanka for traits of drought tolerance and tolerance to other pests and diseases ; screening for salinity tolerance in sweet potatoes in Peru ; and identifying drought - tolerant bananas in India .
Much of the screening will take place within collections where many of the unique samples are at risk .
Therefore , in addition to its efforts to bolster the development of climate - ready crops , the Trust will provide funding to save unique crop collections that are at risk of disappearing .
Crop collections need to be re-grown at regular intervals , and fresh seed harvested and placed in seedbanks to ensure long - term conservation and availability .
The Trust is working with more than 60 countries to " regenerate " unique collections of crops critical for food security , and to ensure that they are duplicated elsewhere for safety in a collection that meets international standards , as well as in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault .
Worldwide , there are a handful of crop collections that can be said to meet international standards .
And even these few , despite their role in protecting the foundation of our food supply , lurch from one funding arrangement to the next without ever having any real long - term security .
The Trust is now endowing these , the world 's most important collections , ensuring their conservation and availability for the future of agriculture .
Crops already being safeguarded by the Trust 's pledge of financial security include banana , barley , bean , cassava , faba bean , forages , grass pea , lentil , pearl millet , rice , sorghum , taro , wheat and yam .
These are housed in collections managed in trust for humanity at eight agricultural institutions that are supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) and by the Secretariat for the Pacific Community .
" Secure funding on this sort of time - scale has been unheard of in this field .
Crop collections are all too often amassed and then lost according to changing funding fashions and priorities , " said Daniel Debouck , Head of the Genetic Resources Unit at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture ( CIAT ) , one of the agricultural institutions supported by the CGIAR .
" Genebanking is not something you can turn on and off , and a shortfall in funding of just a few months can result in the permanent loss of unique varieties .
We need to be sure that we will have sufficient funding year after year after year .
The Trust is now providing that security . "
" The contents of our genebanks — some 1.5 million distinct samples — are the result of a 13,000 - year experiment in the interaction between crops and environment , climate and culture , " said Fowler .
" If we are wise enough to conserve these collections , we will have a treasure chest of the very traits that crops used in the past when they successfully adapted to new conditions — the traits they will need again in the future to adapt as climates and environments change . "
The Global Crop Diversity Trust
The mission of the Trust is to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide .
Although crop diversity is fundamental to fighting hunger and to the very future of agriculture , funding is unreliable and diversity is being lost .
The Trust is the only organization working worldwide to solve this problem , and has already raised over $ 140 million .

When New England Patriots offensive lineman Nick Kaczur was arrested in upstate New York in April , he had 202 OxyContin pills labeled as being made in Canada , according to police reports , The Boston Globe reported .
Kaczur was arrested in New York on April 27 after police said a small amount of OxyContin was found in his truck following a traffic stop .
Kaczur then helped federal authorities arrest the man who was allegedly supplying him with the drug , according to the alleged dealer 's attorney .
Next week , Kaczur is scheduled to be arraigned in Whitestown , N.Y. , town court on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree , a misdemeanor .
OxyContin , a powerful and potentially addictive prescription painkiller , is also sold as a street drug as its effects mirror those of heroin .
According to police reports , Kaczur , who was returning from his hometown of Brantford , Ontario , had the pills in his pocket when he was pulled over on April 27 on the New York State Thruway in Whitestown , just west of Utica .
A spokesman for the company that makes the pills and a drug industry specialist said the pills , each marked CDN on one side , were made in Canada and imprinted to help prevent cross - border smuggling of OxyContin , according to The Globe .
The attorney for the suspected drug dealer , Daniel Ekasala , said his client was not the source of the pills police found in Kaczur 's truck .
Ekasala , who allegedly sold OxyContin to Kaczur three times while Kaxzur was a cooperating witness for federal officials , has pleaded not guilty to three counts of possession of oxycodone with intent to distribute .
Ekasala 's attorney , Bernard Grossberg , disputed Kaczur 's assertion that Ekasala sold him pills marked CDN , according to the report .
" Those are Canadian pills , and Ekasala is not the source of those pills , " Grossberg said , according to The Globe .
" It just begins to raise questions about Kaczur 's credibility . "
Kaczur 's attorney , Steven J. Comen , declined to comment on the report .
" Out of respect for the ongoing legal process , we cannot comment at this time , " he said , according to The Globe .
Friday , Patriots spokesman Stacey James said " I will confirm that he is still on the team , but we are not providing additional comment , " the newspaper reported .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .

The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Corynne McSherry sez , " Judge Davis issued an order today rejecting the RIAA 's effort to rewrite copyright law to include a form of ' attempted infringement . '
Based on this order , the first p2 p case ever to make it to a jury verdict is now headed for a * second * trial .
Even more interesting , the Court devotes several paragraphs to a plea to Congress to lower penalties for noncommercial , individual infringers . "
Joining the ranks of federal district judges in Arizona and Massachusetts , District of Minnesota Chief Judge Michael Davis today concluded [ 44 - page PDF ] that simply making a music file available in a shared file does not violate copyright law , and ordered a new trial in Capitol Records v. Jammie Thomas .
The case made headlines last year as the first peer - to - peer file - sharing case to go all the way to trial .
In October 2007 , a jury held Thomas liable and awarded $ 222,000 in damages to the record companies , based in whole or in part ( it was n't clear ) on an instruction that merely making a file available violates a copyright owner 's distribution right .
Earlier this year , Chief Judge Davis said he was concerned that he might have made a mistake with that instruction and asked for more briefing on whether Thomas deserved a new trial .
EFF , joined by Public Knowledge , the United States Internet Industry Association , and the Computer and Communications Industry Association filed an amicus brief urging the Court to reject the RIAA 's making available theory .
Meet a deer little handful called Rupert who was delivered by Caesarean section after his mother was killed by a car
He is growing up without a mother 's love .
But this tiny muntjac fawn appears to have a lucky streak nonetheless .
He was born three weeks early after his mother was hit by a car .
Vets battled to save her but she died soon afterwards .
Orphan : Muntjac fawn Rupert was delivered by Caesarean section after his mother was killed by a car .
He was just six inches tall and weighed 500 grams
Sleepy head :
The male has short antlers , usually four inches or less , and uses them to push enemies off balance so he can wound them with his two - inch upper canine teeth .
The small deer is also called the barking deer
The little orphan , delivered by Caesarean section , was just six inches tall and , at 500 grams , weighed little more than a bag of sugar .
It looked like he , too , would face a tough fight for survival .
But staff at Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital in Buckinghamshire believe Rupert , as he has been named , will make a full recovery after his dramatic arrival .
At five days old , he is being kept in an incubator and has just opened his eyes .
Wee thing : Rupert is growing into quite a handful .
The muntjac grows to 37 inches in length , and weighs between 22 and 40 lbs when fully grown
Les Stocker , founder of Tiggywinkles , said : ' Rupert 's mother had very severe injuries .
We brought him out and got him breathing and then he went into an incubator on oxygen .
He is now being fed by a tube . '
' Deer are very , very tricky but this one has spirit .
He 's an extremely feisty little guy and quite pushy , ' he added .
Muntjac are the oldest known deer , appearing 15 - 35 million years ago , with remains found in Miocene deposits in France and Germany .
First steps :
An unspecified species of muntjac was introduced to the grounds of Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire in the 19th century by the then Duke of Bedford
Alien species : Larger numbers of muntjac escaped from Whipsnade Zoo , and they are the more likely ancestors , in addition to other releases
The present - day species are native to south - east Asia and can be found from India and Sri Lanka to southern China , Taiwan , Japan and Indonesian islands .
Reeves 's Muntjac has been introduced to England and is now common in some areas there .
Inhabiting tropical regions , the deer have no seasonal rut and mating can take place at any time of year .
However , this behaviour is retained by populations introduced to temperate countries .
Males have short antlers , which can regrow but they tend to fight for territory with their tusks .
Widespread : Muntjac colonies exist throughout England below Derbyshire , and the population continues to grow .
Small groupings of muntjacs have been seen in large urban parks in the Islington , Highgate , East Ham , Finchley and Greenwich areas of London

Add this to my " Things to hyperventilate over " list : British police are on the lookout for something called a WASP Knife , a weapon that injects a ball of compressed gas into its victim that then expands to the size of a basketball , instantly freezing and exploding their internal organs .
The blade , which was designed to help hunters and divers bring down large wild animals quickly , could possibly be bought on the internet by serial killing - minded crooks .
Look at what it does to a watermelon !
The WASP website states " the effects of the compressed gas not only cause overinflation during ascent when used underwater , but also freezes all tissues and organs surrounding the point of injection on land or at sea . "
It 's like a freeze ray out of a superhero movie ...
Only it 's real , and thus infinitely scarier .
Somebody hold me .

The Trans Antarctic Mountains are clearly visible from the flight deck of a ski-equipped cargo plane flying from McMurdo Station to Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica , December 11 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Deborah Zabarenko
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) -
One of the last shipments to a U.S. research base in Antarctica before the onset of winter darkness was a year ’s supply of condoms , a New Zealand newspaper reported Monday .
Bill Henriksen , the manager of the McMurdo base station , said nearly 16,500 condoms were delivered last month and would be made available , free of charge , to staff throughout the year to avoid the potential embarrassment of having to buy them .
The base only has a skeleton staff through the long winter .
“ Since everybody knows everyone , it becomes a little bit uncomfortable , ” Henriksen told the Southland Times newspaper .
About 125 scientists and staff are stationed at McMurdo base , the largest community in Antarctica , during the winter months when there is constant darkness .
The first sunrise will occur on August 20 and McMurdo ’s population will start to increase again in September when supply flights resume , peaking at more than 1,000 during the summer period .
Easy Ruby development , the Eclipse way
RDT is now Aptana RadRails , but still offers Ruby developers a powerful IDE
The name of the Ruby Development Tools ( RDT ) plug - in and where to find the code have changed , but the basic function and licensing terms have remained essentially unchanged .
If you are new to the idea of developing Ruby applications on Eclipse , start with Neal Ford 's article titled " Using the Ruby Development Tools plug - in for Eclipse " to learn how to create Ruby files , how to customize the Ruby editor , how to set up the Debugger and run Ruby from Eclipse , as well as initiate tests from Eclipse .
In this article , we expand on Ford 's article and look at :

Getting started
RDT , now called now called Aptana RadRails V1.0.3 , is available at Aptana.com .
To download a new version or update your Eclipse plug - in , follow Aptana 's RadRails instructions , which will be familiar to Eclipse users .
Note that if you have not installed an Aptana plug - in into your Eclipse workspace before , you should follow Aptana 's instructions for Plugging Aptana into an existing Eclipse configuration .
Also consult Aptana 's RadRails documentation during installation to see resolutions to OS - specific issues .
Code folding
Almost all Integrated Development Environments ( IDEs ) , such as Eclipse , support the concept of code folding .
Code folding allows you to collapse sections of a source - code file while working in other parts of it .
This allows you to manage larger amounts of code within one window without losing the trees for the forest .
To turn on or off code folding in RadRails , simply make sure you 're in the Ruby perspective and select Window > Preferences .
The Preferences window should pop up .
Scroll down the left - hand pane until you reach the Ruby plug - in options and expand it with Ruby > Editor > Folding .
You should see something like Figure 1 .
Figure 1 . Eclipse Window Preferences allow you to customize the look , feel , and feature set of Eclipse perspectives
Be sure to check Enable folding when opening a new editor and select OK .
In " Using the Ruby Development Tools plug - in for Eclipse , " we created a Ruby project .
If you have not done so already , create a project .
If you do not want to refer to that article , the code is shown in Listing 1 .
Create a Ruby file that consists of what is shown in Listing 1 .
We also need the Ruby class called hr.rb .
Listing 1 . hr.rb
class Employee def initialize ( name , salary , hire_year ) @name = name @salary = salary @hire_year = hire_year end def to_s " Name is # ( @name ) , salary is # ( @salary ) , " + " hire year is # ( @hire_year ) " end def raise_salary_by ( perc ) @salary += ( @salary * 0.10 ) end end class Manager < Employee def initialize ( name , salary , hire_year , asst ) super ( name , salary , hire_year ) @asst = asst end def to_s super + " , \tAssistan info : # {@asst} " end def raise_salary_by ( perc ) perc += 2007 - @hire_year super ( perc ) end end
You should see a series of minus signs like those in Figure 2 when viewing the class in Eclipse .
Each of these minus signs represents a folding point .
By selecting them , you can fold the code at this point .
Try selecting the fold points for all the methods in the Employee class in hr.rb .
Figure 2 . RDT support for code folding in Ruby
If you selected all the method fold points for the Employee class , you should see something like Figure 3 .
Figure 3 . Methods in the Employee class folded
As you can see , code folding allows you to manage and control your work environment , letting you focus on code you are interested in .
If you go back to the Preferences screen to look at the Ruby code - folding settings , you will also notice that you have the option of having the RDT fold comments , methods , or inner classes on initial opening of files .
Many people find this a way to see the basic structure of a class quickly without getting distracted by large amounts of code .
Nevertheless , as you will see in the next section , there is an even easier way to get an overview of your code .
Outline view
In " Using the Ruby Development Tools plug - in for Eclipse , " the outline view was mentioned as one method of navigating to elements in a Ruby source file .
The outline view also allows you to quickly see a tree - like representation of your classes , inner classes , methods , variables , etc .
If , for some reason , you do not see the outline view in your Ruby perspective , you can easily open it up by going to Window > Show View >
Outline , which will open a dockable outline view of your code .
For the hr.rb file , you should see something like Figure 4 when the Outline is expanded fully .
Figure 4 .
The outline view showing an expanded tree visualization of the hr.rb file
Each one of the symbols and colors of the symbols has a specific meaning that may or many not be obvious .
If it is not , you can find information on this easily by going to Window > Preferences and selecting Ruby > Appearance >
Members Sort Order , which provides a key to the outline view and lets you adjust and sort the order of how the outline view symbols are represented .
You should see something like Figure 5 .
Figure 5 . Members Sort Order
The code outline view is a powerful tool for helping you understand how your code is structured .
But what do you do when you forget what a function or class does ?
In the next section , we learn how to access Ruby documentation from Eclipse .
The Ruby Interactive view
Unless you possess an incredible memory , chances are you will forget some of the classes , methods , and modules Ruby offers .
Ruby supplies documentation as well as Ruby Interactive ( RI ) , an interactive documentation reader that lets you search and find information in the Ruby docs quickly .
To use RI with Eclipse , you need to configure the RadRails plug - in to access it by going to Window > Preferences and selecting Ruby > RI /rdoc .
Here you will see two fields : RDoc path and Ri path .
Each expects the full path to the rdoc and ri scripts , which , if your Ruby install is on the C drive , would be something like C:\ruby \bin\rdoc and C : \ruby \bin\ri respectively , as shown below .
( Mac OS X and Linux® users will need to adjust their paths accordingly . )
Enter the correct paths and select OK .
Figure 6 . Setting up the Ruby Interactive documentation reader
Once you have done this , you should be able to see an RI tab in the lower portion of your Eclipse Ruby perspective .
If you for some reason do not , simply go to Window > Show View and select RI , then select that tab and type Array in the input field .
The RI will try to find a match for what you are looking for or you can simply scroll through the available options and click on an item .
In the case of Array , you should see something like Figure 7 .
Figure 7 .
Example output of a query into RI for Array class
The RI view can be very helpful by allowing you to stay focused and within your development environment , instead of switching to a Web browser or another application to view the documentation .
Sometimes though , you 'll run into a problem you just cannot solve at the moment or do not have the time to deal with .
Oftentimes , developers leave themselves a comment in the code , but these are easy to forget .
In the next section , we look at using task tags to mark items for follow - up .
Task tags
One of the more useful views in Eclipse and the RadRails plug - in is the Tasks view .
We can use the Tasks view as your own or a project - based to - do list , which allows you to tag code with items like ToDo , FixMe , Optimize , etc .
You can configure your own task tags by going to Window > Preferences , then Ruby > Task >
Tags .
You should see something like Figure 8 .
Figure 8 . The Task tags area , which allows you to create new custom tags to mark up your code
You can use a tag just by adding it to your code , such as # ToDo : Implement give_bonus method .
Try adding that comment in the hr.rb file in the Employee class and save it .
Now select the Task pane in the lower bottom of your Eclipse view , or if for some reason you do not see it , go to Window > Show View >
Task and you should see something like Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Viewing a task
Completed Priority Description Resource Path Location Creation Time TODO : Implement give_bonus method hr.rb RubyTest line 7 1173676801984
The ability to define your own task tags can very powerful in a team - development environment .
Task tags allow the team to define specific types of tag - related tasks that they know will be seen by other developers , even if they do not look at the specific code that contains the task .
This allows a team to communicate inside of the code itself , instead of requiring e-mail or other forms of communication that are easy to miss .
In the next section , we look at another perspective that allows you to navigate a project and find information quickly .
The Ruby browser
There are a number of new features in this release of the RadRails plug - in , including the Ruby Browsing view .
To get to this view , simply go to Window > Open Perspective >
Ruby Browsing where you should see something like Figure 9 .
The perspective contains multiple views of Ruby elements .
The project shows all projects in your workspace .
In the Types view , you will see all the classes and types in your Project , and in the Members view , you will see the specific elements of a classes selected from the Types view .
Double - clicking on items will cause the RadRails plug - in to open the file associated with that element and focus on the element .
Figure 9 .
An example of the Ruby browsing view
Being able to browse through Ruby resources quickly offers you another way to increase your productivity .
In the next section , we will look at what else has been added to the RadRails plug - in that will help you develop Ruby code .
What else is new ?
The Aptana RadRails plug - in adds several enhancements to previous version of the plug - in , including code completion .
For example type an E anywhere in your hr.rb file , then press Ctrl + Space , and the RadRails plug - in code - completion function will pop a list of classes , modules , globals , methods , and variables .
The latest version of RDT also adds new items , such as more distinct highlighting of globals , as well as instance / class variables ; the ability to turn on and off auto - closing of things like strings ; JRuby support ; SQL Editor ; better debugging , brackets , and braces as well as other items .
Aptana 's RadRails
Pro version adds even more functionality , including the new Ruby profiler support built into the IDE .
With the significant enhancements to the Aptana RadRails , it really comes into its own as a serious tool for developing Ruby applications .
RadRails combined with other Eclipse plug-ins offers a world - class IDE with features comparable to almost any other commercial product .
Summary
This article outlined some of the additional functionality and improvements in Aptana RadRails .
As you can see , the RadRails plug - in provides a capable IDE for the Ruby developer .
Better yet , Eclipse offers not only a tool to work with Ruby easily but a tool with which to work with other languages .
Eclipse provides a ubiquitous and common platform for development , which allows you to increase your efficiency by focusing on a language instead of learning a new IDE each time you change languages .

Adam Minter , of the ShanghaiScrap blog ( and an Atlantic author ) , has noticed a heartbreaking and consequential bit of sloppiness in a NYT report today out of Beijing .
The Times quoted a Beijing resident on what is , given the attack on police in the largely - Islamic Xinjiang region of China , perhaps the most sensitive topic of the moment : the Chinese government 's efforts to quash what it considers mounting terrorist potential from its Muslim Uighur minority .
The Times understandably grants its source anonymity on this topic , given the potential risks to him if he were identified -- and then carelessly identifies him !
Minter quotes the crucial passage from this Times story today :
The owner of the Xinjiang Kashgar Restaurant near the main Olympic venue said he shut down Tuesday [ of last week ] after repeated visits from officials who cited health concerns .
He said several other Muslim restaurants nearby had received similar visits .
The owner , a Uighur , spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear that he would be further harassed by the authorities .
The passage is still in the story at the NYT 's site as of two minutes ago -- although once the info has been published at all , I guess whether it stays up is moot .
I know that very restaurant and went past it today on my trip out to the Olympic venue .
Poor guy .
This can't have been intentional , but the results are the same as if it were .
And no one within the NYT system looked at these two sentences and said , Wait a minute ... ?

Smoke rises from the U.S. Embassy in San'a , Yemen , on Wednesday after a car bomb hit the front gate of the compound .
( ( SABA / Associated Press ) )
An attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen that left 16 people dead is a reminder America is still at war with extremists , U.S. President George W. Bush said Wednesday .
He made his comments in Washington , just hours after attackers armed with automatic weapons , grenades and at least one suicide car bomb assaulted the embassy in the capital city , San'a .
It was the fourth time in recent years that the compound has come under attack in Yemen , a country that has struggled to quash al - Qaeda extremists .
Yemen is said to be the ancestral homeland of al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
" This attack is a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives , " Bush said .
" One objective of these extremists is to kill , to try to cause the United States to lose our nerve and to withdraw from regions of the world , " Bush said .
' We want people to lead normal lives '
The embassy last came under attack just six months ago , when three mortar rounds aimed at the embassy hit a high school for girls next door .
A Yemeni security guard was killed and more than 10 girls were injured .
Bush said the U.S. wo n't give in to the extremists .
" Our message is that we want to help governments survive the extremists , " Bush said .
" We want people to lead normal lives .
We want mothers to be able to raise their sons and daughters in a peaceful environment so they can realize the hopes and dreams of a better world . "
One of the deadliest attacks on Americans abroad came in 2000 , when 17 U.S. sailors were killed when suicide bombers with alleged links to al - Qaeda blew themselves up on an inflatable raft next to the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden .
Failed attempt to breach compound walls
American officials said Wednesday morning 's attack , which appears to be the work of al - Qaeda , was a failed attempt to breach the embassy compound 's walls .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters Wednesday that the embassy 's security upgrades , combined with the response of security officials , stopped the attackers .
He said one embassy guard from Yemen was killed , along with several Yemeni security officials .
Six attackers were also among those killed , officials said .
More than one explosion occurred during the attack , and gunfire erupted for about 10 minutes outside the compound .
The explosions damaged several homes in the area , said a Yemeni security official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The Associated Press reported that police quickly cordoned off the area and ambulances rushed to the scene .
Regional TV news networks Al - Jazeera and Al - Arabiya reported that one of the embassy 's buildings was on fire , but U.S. Embassy spokesman Ryan Gliha denied that a fire broke out .
By Michael Karadjis
August 2 , 2008 ( updated October 11 , 2008 ) --
The new Serbian government last month finally cornered Radovan Karadzic , the former leader of the Bosnian Serb Republic ( Republika Srpska ) , one of the two entities which make up Bosnia , during the war in 1992 - 5 when that statelet was created .
Karadzic had been in hiding for many years from the International War Crimes Tribunal in , which in 1995 had indicted him for various war crimes including genocide .
The July 21 arrest led to a wave of hypocrisy in Western capitals , congratulating Serbia on the arrest of the vile criminal .
Yet for the last seven years in Afghanistan and five years in Iraq , well upwards of a million people have been killed as a result of the US invasion and occupation of these countries .
Whole countries are being destroyed ; yet not only do these war crimes of climactic scale go unpunished , but these leading war criminals then see themselves as having the right to designate who is a war criminal .
Daily war crimes are committed against the Palestinian people year in and out by a country which has stood in open violation of international law for decades , yet continues to receive massive military and economic aid from the US .
Such naked hypocrisy can never lead to justice or even a feeling of justice among the oppressed of the world .
However , it is a big mistake to jump from this condemnation of the overall system of injustice to any defense of Karadzic , let alone viewing him as some kind of anti-imperialist hero , as some on the left and far right fringes do .
Who is Karadzic and what makes him so important ?
Born in 1945 in Montenegro , Karadzic was the son of a Chetnik ( Serb - chauvinist ) warrior , Vuk , of World War II .
The Chetniks first fought the Nazis but then ended up collaborating with them against Tito 's communist Partisans .
For much of Karadzic 's childhood under Tito , his father was in prison .
The victorious partisans set up a multi-ethnic socialist federation , in which Serbs were just one of many equal nations .
Extreme nationalism was kept under wraps by Tito , in order that the dominant nations , especially Serbs and Croats , could not dominate the smaller nations , to maintain a united working class .
The Chetniks by contrast had aimed to revive the pre-war rule of the Serbian monarchy over the other non-Serb peoples .
However , as capitalism swept across the former Yugoslavia in the 1980s , the ascending bourgeoisie needed a new ideology to replace " communism " and " brotherhood and unity " .
They found it in a revived national chauvinism .
A psychiatrist and a " poet " , Karadzic fell under the influence of leading anti-Titoist dissident Dobrica Cosic , a prominent figure in the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences and the intellectual father of modern Serb nationalism .
The rising Serb nationalist , medievalist , lunar - right revival of the 1980s came to dominate the Academy , which , though in Belgrade , chose Karadzic to head the newly formed pro-Chetnik , anti-communist Serb Democratic Party ( SDS ) in Bosnia in 1990 .
This is where we have to understand Karadzic .
Neither an International Monetary Fund - linked party technocrat like then Serbian prime minister Slobodan Milosevic , nor a sadistic military officer like General Mladic , would necessarily have ended up destroying Yugoslavia .
Rather it was the wind of Serbian chauvinism - itself not something from the sky , but reflecting the rising capitalist class - that swept both along as opportunists of power , political and military .
Karadzic , by contrast , like his close ally Vojislav Seselj , the founder of the quasi - fascist Serbian Chetnik Movement ( later Serbian Radical Party ) , was always an enemy of the old power structure and a natural leader of the new .
The entire ideology of Karadzic , Seselj and the Serb nationalist lunar right was fundamentally pro-imperialist : they were re-launching the crusades to finally drive " the Turks " out of Europe ( ie , they called Balkan Muslims " Turks ” ) , they were defending Christian Europe against " Islamic invasion . "
If Tito had identified with anti-colonial movements like that in Algeria against French rule , Karadzic by contrast declared “ Bosnia has become like Algeria for the French in the 1950s .
After the appearance of fundamentalism , peace with the Muslims is no longer possible . ”
Army hijacked
While the new bourgeoisie of other Yugoslav nations also promoted national chauvinism – most notably the regime of Franjo Tudjman of Croatia – that of the dominant Serb nation had an additional weapon to put their chauvinist ideology into practice , with the aim of grabbing the largest slice of the ashes of Yugoslavia : they hijacked the former Yugoslav army , the 4th largest military force in Europe , and drove out the non-Serbs .
In 1992 , there was a country called Bosnia , a historic entity , one of the former Yugoslav republics , which was constitutionally a republic of three peoples , Serbs , Croats and
Bosniaks ( Bosnian Muslims ) , all three of whom were represented in the elected government proportionally , and at every level of the state apparatus .
The three peoples were inextricably mixed .
About a quarter of the land mass of Bosnia , containing also a quarter of its population , had no ethnic majority at all ; and in about half the areas that did , these “ majorities ” were tenuous .
Major cities were occupied by Serbs , Croats , Muslims , mixed Serb - Croats , Serb - Muslims , Croat - Muslims , Serb - Croat - Muslims , " Yugoslavs " , " Bosnians " , atheists , Jews , Roma etc , living in the same apartment blocks and working in the same factories and offices , essentially a new nation in formation , a post - capitalist nation under development in socialist Yugoslavia , where Bosnia was the high point of that multi-ethnic state .
This coexistence had lasted 800 years , and everywhere were scattered mosques , synagogues , Serbian Orthodox and Croat Catholic churches .
From the outset , this leader out of nowhere had a plan : to destroy Bosnia , root and branch , the entire historic civilisation , so rudely based , as it was , on coexistence between peoples rather than ethnic purity , Serb domination and apartheid .
In this , he had agreement from his Bosnian Croat chauvinist counterparts , backed by Tudjman .
To do this , however , the Muslim plurality of the population had to be eliminated .
Unlike the much smarter Milosevic , Karadzic made no bones about this ; in a speech to the Bosnian parliament months before Bosnia ’s independence , he threatened that the Muslims would “ disappear from the face of the Earth . ”
The blueprint for this genocide was laid out by the SDS leadership in “ The Strategic Goals of the Serbian People in Bosnia and Herzegovina ” , adopted by the Republika Srpska national assembly in May 1992 .
These goals were : ( 1 ) Separation as a state from the other two ethnic communities ; ( 2 ) a corridor between Sermberija and Krajina ; ( 3 ) the establishment of a corridor in the Drina River valley , i.e. , the elimination of the border between Serbian states ; ( 4 ) the establishment of a border on the Una and Neretva rivers ; and ( 5 ) the division of the city of Sarajevo into a Serbian part and a Muslim part , and the establishment of effective State authorities within each part . ” [ 1 ]
Looking at a demographic map of these regions , particularly the Drina Valley and the “ corridor ” , one can understand that this could only mean the physical elimination of the non-Serb , mainly Muslim , majorities , of these regions .
Mladić gave the order : “ Inflict the greatest losses and force the enemy to abandon the regions of Birač , Žepa and Goražde together with the Moslem population .
First offer the disarming of militarily capable and armed men , and if they do not accept , destroy them . ” [ 2 ]
He set out to do that in 1992 -- and succeeded .
In the northern spring and summer of that year , his Chetniks and the now completely Serb-run " Yugoslav " army swept across Bosnia and uprooted , bombed and massacred the non-Serb population of 70 per cent of Bosnia ( Serbs were only 30 per cent of the population ) .
While the July 1995 massacre in the east Bosnian town of Srebrenica – where Mladic ’s troops killed over 8000 Muslim captives in a few days – is the most terrible crime committed , the massacre in the whole of Muslim - majority east Bosnia occurred over many months of 1992 , alongside the massacre in north and west Bosnia , while the mixed population of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo , along with dozens of other towns and cities , were besieged and bombed daily throughout these years .
Officially , 100,000 people were killed , though like with the Iraq Body Count , real numbers may be much higher .
83 per cent of civilian victims were Muslims , and millions were driven from their homes or made refugees .
Nearly 1700 mosques were destroyed , many flattened and turned into parking lots , whereas when revenge – never justified but essentially inevitable – set in , only 34 Orthodox churches suffered the same fate .
Thus mosques were destroyed at a ratio of 50 to 1 compared to Orthodox churches ( some 340 Croat Catholic churches were also destroyed ) .
The National Library of Bosnia - Herzegovina , with over “ a million books , more than a hundred thousand manuscripts and rare books , and centuries of historical records ” , according to professor of Islamic Studies Michael sells , went up in flames , the biggest book - burning in history , as did the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo , containing more than five thousand Islamic and Jewish manuscripts , from many parts of the Middle East .
The high point of this 3.5 year genocidal war against Bosnia ’s Muslims in the heart of Europe with only whimpers from the European imperialist powers within earshot away was the massacre of 8000 Muslim captives in Srebrenica , when it was captured by Karadzic ’s army , under the command of Mladic , in July 1995 .
At the end of this monstrosity , Mladic declared the Serb people had finally liberated Srebrenica from " the Turks " .
It is somewhat unfortunate that even this crime has come under the spotlight for moral relativists .
Ed Herman , in particular , has penned some appalling work on this ( for a full rebuttal of these left - revisionist works , see my article at : http://mihalisk.blogspot.com/2007/11/srebrenica-response-to-left-wing.html).
Karadzic ’s capture again brought out some of this .
For example , Louis Proyect , the moderator of the Marxism List , wrote :
“ In the latest issue of Links , Karadjis holds forth on the arrest of Radovan Karadzic , the Serb warlord who is qualitatively worse than all the other warlords in Yugoslavia , including the Muslim Naser Oric whose anti-Serb pogroms near Srebrenica unleashed Karadzic ’s bloodlust revenge . ” [ 3 ]
This dishonesty is astounding , and can only be uttered by someone so enamored to the cause of Serbian chauvinism that he allows himself to write things he knows are untrue .
His suggestion here is that the war in east Bosnia began when Oric launched “ anti-Serb pogroms . ”
This then provoked Karadzic into his “ bloodlust revenge ” , by killing 8000 Muslims in Srebrenica .
Proyect however well knows that the massacre and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims from east Bosnia began in earnest – and extremely bloodily – from April 1992 , and that is why the Muslim military leader got holed up in the Gaza - like ghetto of Srebrenica in the first place .
Before that , most of east Bosnia , including all the region surrounding Srebrenica , had a Muslim majority .
Tens of thousands of Muslim refugees poured into the Srebrenica ghetto , which then became known as a Muslim “ enclave ” in “ Serb ” east Bosnia .
Naturally enough , this led to desperate raids out of the ghetto into the lands formerly their own , mostly to get food and seize animals .
These raids , which peaked around late 1992 and early 1993 , were often led by Oric , and sometimes bloody vengeance was exacted on small numbers of Serb civilians .
I have never covered for any attack on civilians , but these raids were more or less the exact equivalent of the raids out of the Gaza ghetto , the Gaza concentration camp , by desperate Palestinians , which similarly result in deaths of Israeli citizens , and can hardly be compared to the systematic crimes of the Israeli occupier .
Not only were the numbers of Serb casualties far less than the Muslim casualties either before or after this time , but above all , Proyect has casually reversed the chronology and causality involved .
Surely he would have been more correct to say that the massive bloodlust pogroms against the Muslims throughout 1992 is what led to Oric ’s much later and smaller - scale “ bloodlust revenge ” .
How the latter can then be claimed as provoking the deliberate , planned capture and massacre of thousands in Srebrenica years later is a tall story indeed .
Imperialism
This then is the legacy of Karadzic , the utter destruction of the nation of Bosnia , in the same way as Bush is responsible for the wholesale destruction of Iraq .
In 1994 , Karadzic ’s `` Serb Republic ’’ annulled all decisions of the ``National Antifascist Council for the People ’s Liberation of Bosnia - Herzegovina ’’ ( ZAVNOBiH ) , the Partisan assembly in World War II which gave birth to both Bosnia - Herzegovina and Communist Yugoslavia .
By contrast , the Bosnian government continues to celebrate the anniversary of the first ZAVNOBiH session as the birth of the Bosnian republic .
In 1996 , retreating Chetnik forces destroyed the memorial to Partisan war dead and victims of fascism in Sarajevo .
But imperialism also wanted the destruction of that Bosnia , because its heartland cities and industrial centres represented a still multi-ethnic working class , the last embers of what was socialist about the very contradictory phenomenon of Titoist Yugoslavia .
Thus even from before the war began , the European imperialist powers put forward the Carrington - Cultheiro Plan , drawn up by the Serb and Croat chauvinists -- indeed by Karadzic himself – for the ethnic dismemberment of Bosnia into “ three constituent ( territorial ) units ” [ 4 ] , despite the intermingling of populations .
This directly led to the ethnic cleansing .
The EU continued to put forward such partition plans throughout the war .
In mid-1993 , EU negotiator Lord Owen from the UK Foreign Office and the UN envoy , Thorvald Stoltenberg , decided the best way to achieve “ peace ” was to offer Karadzic everything he wanted -- a full republic occupying 52 per cent of Bosnian territory within a loose Bosnian confederation of three republics .
Owen and Stoltenberg , Milosevic and Tudjman , the Bosnian Serb and Croat paramilitary leaders Karadzic and Boban , met and agreed on principles .
[ 5 ]
Alia Izetbegovic , president of the legal , UN - recognised government of Bosnia , was not invited to any of these meetings to dismember his country .
In September , and again in December , the Bosnian parliament flatly rejected this imperialist carve - up .
Meanwhile , the imperialist powers embargoed arms from the Bosnian government to force it to surrender , in violation of Article 1 of the UN Charter , on the right of UN member states to self - defence .
Only Iran and some Muslim states managed to smuggle some arms trough in violation of the imperialist embargo .
The UN General Assembly twice voted to lift the illegal embargo against Bosnia , yet this was blocked by the Security Council mainly due to the insistence of Britain and France .
Examples of NATO enforcement of the embargo include the interception by US officers , in September 1992 , at Zagreb airport of an Iranian plane bound for Bosnia with 4000 automatic rifles , and the turning back by NATO navies of a large shipment of Iranian arms to Bosnia in January 1993 , at a time that Bosnia could have used such arms to face the huge combined assault by Serb and Croat nationalist forces .
[ 6 ]
In April 1993 , the US even forced the Pakistan government – at the risk of being declared a “ terrorist state ” – to sack the then head of the ISI , Javed Nasir , due to his role in attempting to get arms to the Bosnian Muslims . [ 7 ]
Finally , the US took over , and after the Srebrenica genocide , intervened in late 1995 with a brief bombing of the Bosnian Serb artillery that had been bombing Sarajevo daily for years , a show necessary in order to hand over half of Bosnia to the " Serb Republic ” , violently “ cleansed ” of its non-Serb plurality – obtaining " peace " via a total victory of Karadzic 's war aims .
It is no wonder then that Holbrooke , the chief US architect of this Serbian victory at the 1995 Dayton Accords , made a secret deal with Karadzic to grant him immunity provided he “ disappear ” from public life .
Former Serbian Interior Ministry cabinet chief , Vlado Nadezdin , recently claimed this agreement was signed between Karadzic and Holbrooke before Dayton .
" I was then chief of cabinet to the Yugoslav Interior Minister Milana Milutinovic and I saw that document .
The agreement contained a number of points , at the top of the page was the president of the Republic of Srpska , the president 's cabinet , in the left - hand corner was Radovan Karadzic 's signature , and in the right , Richard Holbrooke's .
The main clause of the agreement out of the three or four , stated that the Hague Tribunal was not responsible for Radovan Karadzic ” , he said .
This confirms similar accusations by Florence Hartmann , the former spokeswoman for Hague Tribunal Chief Prosecutor .
In a recent book she claimed Russia and America systematically blocked for the past decade the arrest of Karadzic .
Most recently , she claims , in 2004 American forces tipped off Karadzic that he was about to be arrested by the Serbian government .
Hartman claimed Western leaders wanted to avoid their relations with Karadzic coming to light and admitting that they did not make an effort to stop the Srebrenica genocide .
Yet other revelations suggest another US - Karadzic deal had already included conspiring in the capture of Srebrenica ( see http://mihalisk.blogspot.com/2007/03/us-green-light-to-bosnian-serbs-to.html), which seems likely given that the Muslim town was handed to the now - recognised Serb Republic at Dayton as if nothing had happened .
Meanwhile , the Belgrade daily Blic claimed in early August that the CIA had protected Karadzic from arrest until 2000 .
Hartmann also told Blic that the Hague on several occasions gave the US exact locations where Karadzic was hiding , but “ they did nothing . ”
Information “ was abundant , however , it would always turn out that one of the three countries – the U.S. , Britain or France – would block arrests . ”
Hartmann also claimed Karadzic 's arrest “ was never a problem for Serbia as much as for the West – unlike the case of Ratko Mladic , whom the Hague sees as a firm link of crime that connects Belgrade and Bosnia ” , due to Mladic ’s status as a general in the Bosnian Serb Army but having originally been a general in the Belgrade - based “ Yugoslav ” army .
Karadzic , by contrast , “ was known to distance himself from Serbia ” , especially as Milosevic had long agreed to imperialist partition plans giving the Serb Republic half of Bosnia , whereas “ true believing ” right - wing fanatic Karadzic held out for much more till the end .
" Now that Karadzic has finally been arrested , he can tell a lot about secret deals that led to the fall of Srebrenica .
His testimony represents a great risk for the great Western powers ” , Hartmann said .
It is not only the US at risk , but even more the former leaders of the then Tory regime in the UK , the most prominent imperialist spokespeople for Serbian victory from beginning to end .
Tory MP and relative of the former Montenegrin royal family , Jovan Gvozdenovic ( John Kennedy ) , organised two large donations of around 100,000 pounds to the ruling Tory Party in 1992 and 1994 .
The money was donated by a network of British based companies that Kennedy was involved in , partly or wholly owned by a Serbian parent company with strong links to Karadzic .
[ 8 ]
The large London - based Serbian firm Genex was owned in Bosnia by Karadzic ’s people .
Kennedy led delegations of British MP ’s to meet Karadzic and other SDS leaders .
Kennedy was a researcher for and close friend of Tory MP Henry Bellingham , parliamentary secretary to Malcolm Rifkind , British Defense Secretary , and reportedly “ had access to the highest levels of the Conservative Party . ” [ 9 ]
The only MP to come out openly to call for support for Milosevic , right - winger David Hart , was also an adviser to Rifkind .
It is significant that no - one had been asking Serbia to extradite Karadzic , but only Mladic , believed to be in Serbia , given his long term military connections .
Karadzic , who had no such traditional connections , was alleged by both Serbia and Western governments to be in the hills of Bosnia or Montenegro ( his birthplace ) , in fact they held up Bosnia 's EU candidacy process on this account , yet it turns out he was living for years right under the very noses of the authorities in downtime Belgrade , where he had been masquerading brilliantly as a alternative therapies quack dealing in “ energies ” and the like .
New situation
But 13 years have gone by , and Holbrooke 's long gone .
A new situation now allows a new government coalition in Serbia to arrest and extradite Karadzic .
The coalition includes both the Socialist Party – the former party of Milosevic – and the Democratic Party , the party that handed Milosevic to the Hague .
Both parties are now linked to the Second International , espouse “ neo- liberalism with a social face ” , and are strongly pro-EU .
As a maverick right - wing extremist , ideologically linked to those now in opposition in Serbia , Karadzic can now be handed over as a trophy to the EU .
The circumstances suggest both the west and Belgrade long kept quiet so that he could be traded at the right time .
Serbian nationalists and their supporters often claim the Hague is “ anti- Serb ” because the majority of indictees are Serb .
Even a far better article , by Paul D’Amato , which made no apologetics for Karadzic at all , made a similar claim .
After noting that , “ on first look , the ICTY offers an image of impartiality ” , listing some of the Croat , Bosnian Muslim and Kosovar Albanian indictees , D’Amato writes :
“ However , of the 161 individuals indicted by the ICTY , from common soldiers to generals , police commanders and political leaders , three - quarters are Serbs or Montenegrins . ”
This is a very strange argument .
Why should the number of indictees be 25:25:25:25
Serbs , Croats , Muslims , Albanians , as if they all committed , or were able to commit , crimes in equal proportion ?
Would we complain if a world court indicted 70 per cent Israelis and " only " 30 per cent Palestinians for war crimes , that the court was " anti-Jewish " ?
Yes , some three quarters of indictees from the Croatia and Bosnia wars are Serbs , most of the rest Croats and a small per cent Bosnian Muslims - an excellent summary of the proportion of war crimes committed by each .
Over Kosova , six Albanians and seven Serbs have been indicted .
The Hague is however anti-Balkan – only Balkan peoples have been indicted , no imperialist leaders have been indicted for war crimes , particularly for horrendous crimes committed during the bombing of Serbia in 1999 .
This aspect of D’Amato ’s article is completely valid .
Clearly , this fact suggests that any justice served by the Hague can only be selective at best .
This point can and must be made without any doubts that Karadzic is indeed a war criminal of the tallest order , but it makes it difficult to judge the current Serbian government ’s actions .
While the Serbian ultra - right mobilises against the “ traitor ” government , the decision to arrest Karadzic is arguably a great day for the Serbian people , removing an appalling stain , dissociating their nation from some of the most vile rubbish to walk the Balkans since 1945 .
The rather pathetically small demonstrations against the arrest , mostly hard - line Radical Party ranks , give a good idea of the extent to which most Serb people have moved on and rightly want nothing to do with those who destroyed their nation and the rest of the region .
Those who understand this as the ‘ resignation ” of the Serb people to imperialist pressure greatly underestimate the intelligence and political level of the majority of Serbs ; this is in fact a form of anti-Serb racism of those who prefer to support Serbian fascists , and denounce anyone criticising the politics of the Serbian ultra - right as “ Serb - bashers ” , copying the Zionist slur of “ anti-Semitism ” against anti-Zionists .
If this arrest can advance reconciliation among the peoples of the Balkans – impossible without the main perpetrator of the genocide behind bars – this may be a benefit greater than the demerit of sending a Serb leader to a court that refuses to prosecute imperialists .
The Hague ’s bias had much greater relevance in the trial of Milosevic over his crimes against humanity in Kosova , because these crimes – all real and vile enough – took place in the context of the untried crimes against humanity being inflicted on the Serbian people by the world ’s worst war criminals .
Bosnia was an entirely separate and different war .
Karadzic did not fight imperialism , and neither did the latter fight him .
However , if the Holbrooke strategy was to cover up the crimes that imperialism and Karadzic were jointly responsible for , the current imperialist powers supporting the Hague process want him as a scapegoat for these joint crimes - as long as he does n't say too much .
Though the ultra - right has failed to mobilise , even the fact that it maintains the passive electoral support of some one third of voters , far higher than it should be , is partially a reflection nevertheless of the Hague ’s hypocrisy .

( Peter De Lorenzo is the founder of Autoextremist.com , a Web site devoted to commentary on the auto industry .
A veteran of automotive advertising and marketing and an industry consultant , De Lorenzo is also the author of “ The United States of Toyota : How Detroit Squandered its Legacy and Enabled Toyota to Become America ’s Car Company . ”
He spoke with Reuters correspondent Kevin Krolicki . )
DETROIT ( Reuters.com ) --
The U.S. auto industry will eventually mirror the European market and Chrysler will no longer exist , Autoextremist.com ’s Peter De Lorenzo told Reuters .
Here are excerpts :
On the future for the U.S. auto market and U.S. automakers :
“ I firmly believe that we are moving toward becoming a mirror image of the European market where several manufacturers will all hold an equal share of the market .
If you want to pick a number , say 10 percent .
I think Chrysler will no longer exist .
Chrysler will either be sold and parceled off by Cerberus or they will become just a conduit for foreign manufacturers to sell cars and maybe manufacture cars here .
I think Chrysler will cease to exist as we know it .
I think Ford , GM , Toyota , Honda and maybe Hyundai will all approach 10 percent of this market .
Now , what the Chinese will muster in a 10 - year time frame , that ’s a wild card .
On an optimistic basis , they might be able to get rolling by that time , but I do think they ’re at least five to seven years away from having an impact on this market .
I ’m not optimistic about the chances for the Chinese in this country .
It might be 10 years before they are even a player in this market . ”
On the prospects for GM and Ford to succeed with turnaround plans :
“ Now GM has about 20 percent of the U.S. market and they ’re going to have around 10 percent .
I think maybe at 10 percent of the market they will return to profitability in North America .
I ’m actually more bullish on Ford than GM right now because Ford is more focused .
GM is still wrestling with the fact that they have too many divisions and players within their solar system for this market .
I think Ford CEO Alan Mulally has done a tremendous job in less than two years in eliminating much of the entrenched bureaucracy of the Ford Motor Company .
Their bureaucracy was more entrenched than the GM bureaucracy .
And that ’s saying a lot .
All of the various fiefdoms have been erased and Mulally has them going in one direction .
I think GM CEO Rick Wagoner has been very reluctant to skip a step .
He ’s been taking these gradual steps , trying to manage this downward spiral without really making a really bold move that might get GM ahead of the curve a little bit .
That ’s the difference between the two executives .
Mulally has been much more willing to make bold decisions . ”
On what the industry needs from the next U.S. administration :
“ I think the U.S. government needs to start treating the auto industry like the Japanese government treats their industry , which is as an asset and as a source of pride instead of this adversial relationship .
The government is going to have to support our industry .
If we , as a country , lose the ability to manufacture things , in the long run it ’s going to be a lot bigger than the automobile business .
It ’s about the fabric of the country .
I think that GM and Ford can be competitive in the alternative propulsion universe .
But we are talking 2012 before any electric vehicles on any scale are running around on the streets of America .
That ’s a long time . ”
This shocked me .
Sorry it is long but i thought i would leave all of the footage on here so you could see the extent of crazyness !
Hell people , I 'm not sure if this has been answered yet but they were from Sweden .

The Boston Globe has a fantastic article on the psychology of trustworthiness judgements and how they can be taken advantage of by con-men .
The article explores studies which have looked at various influences on our judgements of trust .
One of the most interesting parts is where they cover research that has systematically altered pictures until the researchers generated faces that seem the least trustworthy ( picture of the left ) and most trustworthy ( picture of the right ) .
According to recent work by Nikolaas Oosterhof and Alexander Todorov of Princeton ’s psychology department , we form our first opinions of someone ’s trustworthiness through a quick physiognomic snapshot .
By studying people ’s reactions to a range of artificially - generated faces , Oosterhof and Todorov were able to identify a set of features that seemed to engender trust .
Working from those findings , they were able to create a continuum : faces with high inner eyebrows and pronounced cheekbones struck people as trustworthy , faces with low inner eyebrows and shallow cheekbones untrustworthy .
In a paper [ pdf ] published in June , they suggested that our unconscious bias is a byproduct of more adaptive instincts : the features that make a face strike us as trustworthy , if exaggerated , make a face look happy – with arching inner eyebrows and upturned mouths – and an exaggerated “ untrustworthy ” face looks angry – with a furrowed brow and frown .
In this argument , people with “ trustworthy ” faces simply have , by the luck of the genetic draw , faces that look a little more cheerful to us .
Just as in other cognitive shorthands , we make these judgments quickly and unconsciously – and as a result , Oosterhof and Todorov point out , we can severely and immediately misjudge people .
In reality , of course , cheekbone shape and eyebrow arc have no relationship with honesty .
There ’s plenty more fascinating studies discussed in the article , including an amazing study found that people are more likely to take the advice of someone who has bought the same volume of paint as them compared with someone who buys a different volume of paint !

Federal war on medical pot challenged San Francisco
A federal judge breathed new life Wednesday into medical marijuana advocates ' effort to ward off the federal crackdown on medical pot in California , saying enforcement of U.S. drug laws can go too far if it seeks to interfere with state authority .
U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel of San Jose denied a Bush administration request to dismiss a lawsuit by Santa Cruz city and county officials and members of a medical marijuana collective whose drugs were seized by federal agents in a 2002 raid .
The Santa Cruz raid was one of many actions by federal authorities against suppliers of marijuana in California since the state 's voters approved a 1996 initiative allowing individuals to grow and use pot with their doctors ' approval .
Federal prosecutors have shut down medical marijuana dispensaries , threatened to sue the dispensaries ' landlords , won convictions against growers for violating federal narcotics laws and sought to punish doctors for recommending marijuana .
The U.S. Supreme Court and other courts have upheld the federal actions , except for the government 's attempt to strip federal prescription licenses from the doctors .
But Fogel said the plaintiffs in the current case may be able to show that the federal government exceeded its constitutional authority by trying to force California to repeal its medical marijuana law .
The suit claims federal prosecutors have tried to disrupt the California law by enforcement that targeted critical participants in the state system - doctors who approved their patients ' marijuana use , local officials who issued state - approved identification cards to medical marijuana users , local governments whose zoning allowed pot dispensaries , and marijuana suppliers who cooperated with local governments .
Federal authorities ' goal , the plaintiffs alleged , is to make it impossible for the state to distinguish between medical and recreational use of marijuana and render the state law unenforceable , interfering with California 's constitutional power to enact its own laws .
Government lawyers denied any such intention and said the suit was baseless .
Neither the federal drug law nor any enforcement action has required the state to change its marijuana law or enforce federal laws , they said .
The suit , if successful , " would unlawfully inject the courts into considerations of how the government is enforcing federal law , matters which the Constitution vests in the executive branch , " Justice Department lawyers said in court papers .
But Fogel said Wednesday that if the plaintiffs can prove all their claims , " they may be able to show that ( federal officials ) are deliberately seeking to frustrate the state 's ability to determine whether an individual 's use of marijuana is permissible under California law . "
He cited an opinion by Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in the 2002 ruling on doctors who recommended marijuana .
Although the federal government may prefer that California prohibit medical marijuana , Kozinski said , " it can not force the state to do so . "
Medical marijuana advocates and their lawyers called the ruling a potential breakthrough .
" For the first time , a court has recognized that a calculated plan by the federal government to undercut state medical marijuana laws is patently unconstitutional , " said Graham Boyd , an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer .

What price innocent infringement ?
That 's the question a San Antonio jury will have to address in mid-November , as the RIAA and 20 - year - old Whitney Harper will battle in court over the amount of damages Harper will have to pay to the record labels after being found liable for copyright infringement by a federal judge .
Harper was 16 when MediaSentry discovered and downloaded a number of tracks from what proved to be her shared folder on KaZaA .
The record labels sued her father , but he was dropped from the suit once Whitney admitted to using KaZaA for downloading and sharing music .
Her admission was enough to convince Judge Xavier Rodriguez to hand the RIAA a summary judgment this past August , but he ruled that damages be capped at $ 200 per song , not the $ 750 at minimum sought by the RIAA .
The reason for the $ 200 limit was Harper 's innocent infringement defense .
She admitted to using KaZaA , but said that she did n't know that what she was doing was wrong due to her age at the time and general lack of knowledge about how computers and P2P systems work .
There was no warning from KaZaA that the music on the network was " stolen or abused copyrighted material , " noted Judge Rodriguez in his opinion .
He also agreed with Harper 's assertion that she had " no knowledge or understanding of file trading , online distribution networks or copyright infringement " and that she believed there was nothing illegal about her activities .
Ignorance of the law may be no defense against being held liable for infringement , but it can put a serious cap on damages .
Under the Copyright Act , infringement is normally punishable by fines of up to $ 750 to $ 30,000 per act , and the upper limit can be raised to $ 150,000 if the infringement is deemed malicious .
But for cases of innocent infringement , the judge can reduce the damages below the $ 750 floor .
In the case of Maverick v. Harper , the judge told the record labels they could accept damages of $ 200 per song or have a jury decide what the total damages should be ; the RIAA has chosen a jury trial over the damages .
The RIAA 's decision to reject the judge 's award appears a bit hypocritical on a couple of levels .
The group has said on numerous occasions that its legal campaign against P2P users is n't about making money — indeed , an industry executive testified during the Jammie Thomas trial that the lawsuits are a money - losing proposition .
Instead , the suits are meant , among other things , as a deterrent to copyright infringement and to teach P2P users a lesson .
Here , it seems painfully clear that the lesson has been taught .
Harper has been found liable for 37 counts of copyright infringement and the judge is willing to award the RIAA $ 7,400 in damages — almost double what her father would have had to pay had he accepted the terms of the RIAA 's prelitigation settlement letter back in 2005 .
Furthermore , in the 28,000 - plus copyright infringement lawsuits filed by the record labels , the RIAA has never once asked for a set monetary damages , saying instead that it would be content with whatever the court deemed appropriate ( former RIAA head litigator Richard Gabriel made this very statement during the Thomas trial ) .
Judge Rodriguez did exactly that , and the labels have decided that it was n't enough .
Now , the RIAA will tie up a federal courtroom , a judge , and a jury for a few days before Thanksgiving in hopes of extracting an additional pound of flesh from someone who says she did n't know she was doing anything wrong back when she was just 16 years old .

The okapi , a creature so strange and rare it was once thought to be a unicorn , has been photographed for the first time in the wild .
The images were captured by a motion - triggered camera in Virunga National Park , deep in the jungles of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Some had feared that the okapi – a close relative of the giraffe , though mottled with zebra - like stripes – had been driven extinct by habitat loss and human predation during the decade - long central African civil war .

Out of the hundreds of articles and posts out there on how companies should utilize social media and Web 2.0 , CNN seems to be one of the few major corporations out there that have paid attention .
CNN is one of the few broadcast networks with an expansive line of shining examples in the Web 2.0 space , from basic RSS and bookmarking options to embeddable videos , and its fully user generated content platform iReport.com .
What amazes me most about CNN has not been the millions of iReport submissions or the Web 2.0 / social media , it 's that it seems CNN is now the first official broadcast network ( not just news related ) to start using Twitter and heavily promoting it on air .
For instance , today I watched as CNN Anchor and Editor Don Lemon fished for Twitter replies after various segments .
I ’m sure this is only one of the many mentions to come and I 'm sure we ’ll see a large jump in his followers from here on out .
So , CNN gets it …
What do you think about their on air Twitter plugs ?
Is there any other major company you can think of that ’s an early adopter and getting it right ?

' Ex - gays ' still speaking for Collins , still ignoring Collins ' own words
by Jeremy Hooper
If you 've read this site over the past month , you might remember how we called out professional " ex- gay " Greg Quinlan for presenting noted geneticist Dr. Francis Collins in a way that made it sound as if the man of science had definitively declared there to be " no genetic cause for homosexuality . "
You might also remember that we did n't refute Quinlan on a mere anecdotal level , but rather by pointing to some quotes Dr. Collins had given to the Ex Gay Watch site , in which he spoke out against the way the " ex- gay " side [led by the NARTH ( National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality ) organization ] has been distorting his work .
And you might remember that after we emailed Mr. Quinlan about the situation and reminded him of Dr. Collins ' apparent discomfort , Quinlan replied by making the brazen accusation that ExGay Watch had simply made up Collins ' response .
But mostly you might remember that it was really annoying , both the misrepresentative situation and Quinlan 's refusal to address the actual matter at hand .
Well if you do remember all that , then great .
If you do n't remember and genuinely care to get yourself in the know , you can check out the backlinks and fill yourself in .
But either way , we 're going to fast forward a week and look at the way yet another social conservative , this time Southern Baptist Convention and Exodus International personality Bob Stith , has put the EXACT SAME quote in Dr Collins ' mouth as Quinlan previous had .
In a Baptist Press column , Stith says the following :
For example , in 2003 , the International Human Genome Consortium announced the successful completion of the Human Genome Project , which , among other things , identified each of the approximately 20,000 - 25,000 genes in human DNA .
The press release read : " The human genome is complete and the Human Genome Project is over . "
While this accomplishment was widely reported , almost no one reported the words of Dr. Francis Collins , the head of the project .
Collins , arguably the nation 's most influential geneticist , said , " Homosexuality is not hardwired .
There is no gay gene .
We mapped the human genome .
We now know there is no genetic cause for homosexuality . "
Alright , so the whole " Homosexuality is not hardwired .
There is no gay gene .
We mapped the human genome .
We now know there is no genetic cause for homosexuality " quote is the one to which we 're specifically referring .
This is the exact same quote that Quinlan recently put in Collins ' mouth , even though there is ZERO evidence that Collins ever said this .
The quote has become a social conservative meme , despite the fact that it can not at all be verified .
And not only can it not be verified , but Dr. Collins has specifically spoken out against the way his work is being used by these professional " ex- gay " proponents ( with words that belie the " no genetic cause " quote both Quinlan and Stith put on his tongue ) .
In fact Dr. Collins has spoken out TWICE , with the second instance focused on Quinlan in particular !!
So now we have a two - fold misrepresentation .
Collins was already uncomfortable with the way NARTH , the impetus of all this misrepping , presented his work back in 2007 .
But rather than acknowledging what THE SCIENTIST HIMSELF IS SAYING , the " pro-family " crowd has gone further with the truth - stretching by taking NARTH 's original work , forming this one quote from it , and propagating it amongst their ranks .
That 's not the loving , " pro-family , " Christian thing to do -- it 's the sort of disingenuous , " pro-myopia , " irresponsible thing that we should all be trying to avoid !

Burglar makes the mistake of choosing 22 - stone mastiff 's home
Of all the gardens in all the world , the thief had the bad luck to break into the one where Cromwell was peacefully gnawing on his bone .
The three - year - old English mastiff is a gentle pet .
But his breed are also born guard dogs - and big ones at that .
Only the thief and Cromwell know exactly what happened next .
Cromwell , his owner George Watson and the burglar 's torn shirt
But it can't have been friendly , as the dog's owner heard a ' scream , a roar and a commotion ' from the back garden .
George Watson , 43 , had been having a bath and ran outside in his towel , to see the thief zooming off down the driveway in his van .
Apart from a very agitated dog , the only evidence the man left behind was the torn Tshirt .
Mr Watson , who lives with his wife Lesley , 43 , and daughter Molly , ten , in Gordon , Berwickshire , assumes Cromwell tore the shirt from the thief 's back to stop him stealing the family 's lawnmower , which had been taken from the shed and left by the gate .
Cromwell stands guard : Owner George Watson with son Christopher and daughter Molly
At just under 22 stone the dog could be the world 's heaviest - so it is lucky that this is all he tore off .
' By the time Cromwell had finished with it it was covered in holes , ' his owner said .
Mr Watson , a regional manager of an IT company , does not expect the man to return for another go .
If the burglar decided to make a complaint , Mr Watson could not be prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act because the incident took place on his private property .
The last dog to hold the title of world 's heaviest was Hercules , an English mastiff from the U.S. , which weighed 282 lb ( just over 20 stone ) until its recent death .
The Mastiff's Tale
The breed now known as the English mastiff was brought to this country by Phoenician traders as early as the 6th century BC .
After the Roman invasion , they were used to fight in arenas against other large animals such as lions .
By the end of the Second World War the breed was almost extinct in the UK but was re-established with the help of imports .
Mastiffs are the heaviest dogs in the world and the normal weight for a fully - grown adult is about 14 stone .
Although bred as guard dogs , English mastiffs make very good family pets .
They are good with children , rarely bark and tend to defend rather than attack .
The Ticket opined two weeks ago that Barack Obama would be well - served to avail himself of Bill Clinton 's manifold political skills -- pronto .
Today , the man who once dominated Democratic politics and the one who hopes to for years to come took a small step toward merging their interests : Obama trekked to Clinton 's Harlem office in New York and had a lunch meeting with the former president .
During a brief chat with reporters before they went behind closed doors , Clinton at least delivered a sound bite favorable to Obama 's cause .
With national polls showing John McCain catching a wave after his pick of Sarah Palin as a running mate , Clinton was asked about the state of the race .
He replied : " I predict that Sen. Obama will win and win handily . "
The perked up Obama , who said : " There you go .
You can take it from the president of the United States .
He knows a little something about politics . "
Clinton , without specifying , said he 's " agreed to do a substantial number of things " on behalf of Obama 's campaign .
" Whatever I ’m asked to do , " he added .
Most immediately , he 'll stump for Obama on Sept. 29 in Florida ( where , despite Clinton 's optimistic spin , the Democratic ticket needs help ; a new poll of the state 's voters by Quinnipiac University gives McCain a solid lead ) .
The pool reporter for the photo op , Martha Moore of USA Today , noted that no handshake was exchanged between the men in the presence of the media .
After the get - together , an Obama aide issued the following statement :
President Clinton and Senator Obama had a great conversation in Harlem today .
They discussed the campaign briefly , but mostly talked about how the world has changed since September 11 , 2001 .
Sen . Obama praised the work of the Clinton Foundation around the world and President Clinton applauded Sen .
Obama 's historic campaign which has inspired millions around the country .
They also spoke about what the next President can do to help make the economy work for all Americans , as it did under President Clinton , and ensure safety and prosperity far beyond the coming election .
President Clinton said he looks forward to campaigning for Senator Obama later this month .
A Clinton aide told The Times ' Peter Nicholas that along with the Florida appearance , the ex-president will raise money for Obama ( apparently a growing source of concern within the candidate 's camp ) as well as hit the road for him " throughout the rest of the cycle . ''
The aide said of the two - hour talk between the two : " It went very well . ''

John McCain , but before he could announce the two votes for Paul .
Delegates Paul Clayton of McAlester and Robert Demarest of Talihina voted for Paul , of Texas , who had sought the GOP presidential nomination .
Oklahoma 's vote was announced in the Xcel Energy Center as all 41 votes going to McCain .
Inhofe tried to get the attention of convention organizers so he could correct the mistake .
Convention workers eventually said that could n't be done , possibly because the convention was running late .
It was about 11 p.m. when it was Oklahoma 's turn to announce its vote in the second round .
Several states including Oklahoma abstained on the first round so McCain 's home state of Arizona could announce the vote that would allow him to receive the nomination .
Then the roll call resumed with the states that had abstained going in alphabetical order .
Convention officials assured Oklahoma that the official convention record would show McCain getting 39 votes and Paul getting two .
People " who watched it on TV saw that all 41 votes from Oklahoma went for John McCain , which is not the truth , ” Demarest said .
Frustrated , he and his wife , Cheryl , ripped the Oklahoma patches off their blue blazers — part of the Oklahoma GOP 's uniform — before leaving the convention center .
They said they were done with Oklahoma 's delegation .
Clayton also was upset .
" I just feel robbed , ” he said .
" All the money that I spent to come here ... the number of people that are counting on me to make that decision for them — it 's just kind of emotionally shattering . ”
The Demarests , Clayton and several other Paul supporters met with Oklahoma Republican Party Chairman Gary Jones after they returned to their Minneapolis hotel for an hour or so , and then the Paul supporters discussed it until about 4 a.m. Thursday .
Paul did n't receive any delegates during Oklahoma 's presidential primary in February , but he picked up the two delegate votes when former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who won six votes , released his delegates .
The other four Huckabee delegates joined with the 32 delegates won by McCain .
Three state party officials who are delegates supported McCain as well .
Demarest and other Paul supporters talked with Inhofe , and they said Inhofe is n't to blame .
Their disappointment is with convention officials .
An influential group of European privacy experts said this week that it will lead hearings with Google over the search giant 's claim that EU data protection laws do not apply to it .
The Article 29 Working Party , an independent EU advisory body on data protection and privacy , said that Google is refusing to submit to Europe 's data protection regime and that " strong disagreements " remain .
It said in a statement that Google " considers that the European law on data protection is not applicable to itself , even though Google has servers and establishments in Europe . "
It also said that Google " wishes to retain personal data of users beyond the six months period requested by the Article 29 Working Party , without any justification . "
The dispute is over the records , or logs , of users ' search queries .
Google keeps those and uses them , it says , to improve the quality of search results , to fight fraud and to improve data security .
The Working Party has called for such data to be deleted after just six months .
In a report published in April of this year it said that companies keeping data for longer risked breaching data protection laws .
" If personal data are stored , the retention period should be no longer than necessary for the specific purposes of the processing , " said the Working Party 's April report .
" In view of the initial explanations given by search engine providers on the possible purposes for collecting personal data , the Working Party does not see a basis for a retention period beyond six months . "
It also recommended that that web users must be able to provide consent to the exploitation of their data – in particular for profiling purposes .
Google responded on 8th September and reaffirmed its wish to collaborate with European data protection authorities , stating that it would reduce its retention period from 18 to nine months .
But the Article 29 Working Party has responded by saying that , in substance , " Google refuses for the moment to submit to the European data protection law . "
Alex Türk , chairman of the Working Party , also criticised Google for failing to improve its anonymisation mechanisms , which he called " insufficient " .
He said that Google considers that IP addresses are confidential data but not personal data , " which prevents granting certain rights to its users " .
Türk also accused Google of failing to " express the willingness to improve and clarify the methods that are used to gather the consent of its users . "
In Google ’s response to the Working Party earlier this month , Peter Fleischer , the company ’s global privacy counsel , said that Google was committed to engaging in a constructive dialogue with the Article 29 Working Party and other leading privacy stakeholders around the world .
Google also renounced one if its key arguments in favour of keeping the logs .
Fleischer had previously claimed that the EU's Data Retention Directive forced it to keep details for between six and 24 months .
The Working Party said that this was not the case because data retention laws only applied to telecoms firms .
" We agree with the Working Party that search logs are outside of the scope of the Data Retention Directive , " said Fleischer in Google ’s response document .
In July Google made another concession to privacy activists when it agreed to publish a link to its privacy policy on its front page after calls from regulators to do so .
These concessions were welcomed by the Working Party this week .
" In conclusion , despite some progress , significant work must still be carried out to guarantee the rights of internet users and to ensure the respect of their privacy , " wrote the Working Party .
" In this perspective , the Article 29 Working Party will lead hearings with Google to discuss the points of dissension . "

Nearly 1 million individuals and businesses filed bankruptcy in the 12 months ended June 30 , according to U.S. Bankruptcy Court data released Wednesday .
There were 967,831 bankruptcy cases filed since July 1 , 2007 , up 28.9 % from the prior 12 months , when cases totaled 751,056 .
The largest percentage increase , 60.9 % , was in the court system ’s ninth district , which includes California , Arizona and Nevada , states where the housing meltdown has been especially severe .
Filings spiked to 276,510 in the three months ended June 30 to the highest level of quarterly filings since late 2006 .
Of those , 266,767 , or 96.5 % , were individual filings , and 9,743 , or 3.5 % , were business filings .

Nonbusiness filings made up 96.5 % of the bankruptcies nationwide , totaling 934,009 .
Of those cases 592,376 were Chapter 7 filings , which involve liquidation of nonprotected assets , such as family homes .
The total also included 340,852 filings for Chapter 13 protection , which allows individuals to reorganize their finances and pay down their debt .
An additional 780 individuals filed for Chapter 11 , which is normally used for businesses but can apply to individuals who are reorganizing but have more debt than allowed under Chapter 13 .
By region , the highest number of combined filings was in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court ’s 6th District , which encompasses Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Tennessee .
The total came to 167,561 , up 21.2 % in the last year .
Another economic report Wednesday found that U.S. thrifts lost $ 5.4 billion in the second quarter and set aside a record amount to cover losses from bad mortgages and other loans .

Data from the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision showed federally insured savings and loans posted their second - largest quarterly loss ever in the April - June period , after the $ 8.8 - billion loss in the fourth quarter of last year .
Heavily focused on mortgage lending , thrifts have been stung by mounting home - loan defaults .
The $ 5.4 - billion quarterly loss compared with net profits of $ 3.8 billion in the year - earlier period , and a loss of $ 627 million in the first quarter .
The 829 thrifts also set aside a record $ 14 billion to cover losses from bad mortgages and other loans .
The Washington Post :
Senator John McCain 's campaign manager was paid more than $ 30,000 a month for five years as president of an advocacy group set up by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to defend them against stricter regulations , current and former officials say .
Mr. McCain , the Republican candidate for president , has recently begun campaigning as a critic of the two companies and the lobbying army that helped them evade greater regulation as they began buying riskier mortgages with implicit federal backing .
He and his Democratic rival , Senator Barack Obama , have donors and advisers who are tied to the companies .
Incensed by the advertisements , several current and former executives of the companies came forward to discuss the role that Rick Davis , Mr. McCain 's campaign manager and longtime adviser , played in helping Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac beat back regulatory challenges when he served as president of their advocacy group , the Homeownership Alliance , formed in the summer of 2000 .
Some who came forward were Democrats , but Republicans , speaking on the condition of anonymity , confirmed their descriptions .
Read on ...
Barack Obama and Joe Biden need to jump on this story and keep hammering away until the corporate media can no longer ignore it .
The U.S. stands on the brink of the next Great Depression thanks to Bush / McCain deregulation policies and now we find out that the man who runs the McCain campaign was paid handsomely to lobby for these fatal policies on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , even as he repeatedly tries to tie Obama to those companies .
Voters need to know how we got into this mess and who is responsible .
It was John McCain , his elite lobbyist cronies and the Republican party .
I agree with John :
There should be a campaign to demand that McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , give ever penny back to the American people .
There had better be an ad about this out by COB Monday , and calls for Davis ' resignation .
The McCain campaign thinks we 're a nation full of whiners and cowards who should just STFU , take a second or third job and cancel our vacations and be thankful for what we 're fed .

Xfce announces alpha release of version 4.6
After about a year and a half of development , the Xfce team has announced the alpha release of Xfce 4.6 , codenamed “ Pinky ” “ Pinkie ” .
Xfce is the desktop environment and main reason for the existence of Xubuntu .
It provides the file manager , panels and much more , keeping your desktop fast yet easy to use .
Thus , Xfce is one of the most important parts of Xubuntu , and the 4.4 release has been enjoyed by many users of Xubuntu since it was released .
Obviously , the 4.6 release will be very significant for Xubuntu , and this is an important milestone in the road towards that release .
While it was initially hoped that this release would make it into Xubuntu 8.10 ( codenamed “ Intrepid Ibex ” ) , the Xfce release schedule suggests that , with three beta releases and two release candidated still scheduled , that target wo n’t be met .
However , you can expect to see the new release in Xubuntu 9.04 ( codename “ Jaunty Jackalope ” ) , and if you ’re running 8.10 you can try the alpha release by adding the xubuntu - dev PPA to your software sources .
( Note : at the time of writing this the packaged version is not this actual alpha but a version before that , however , this alpha will be packaged soon . )
The new version of Xfce comes with many new features .
Xfce now has a new configuration backend called xfconf , similar to gconf , but simpler and easier to work with .
This brings more flexibility and better integration between Xfce components .
You can now control your desktop settings through the command - line – this is not only handy for people helping on IRC ( i.e. there is no more need to guide the user through all kinds of settings dialogs – though , IMHO , that would be less confusing for the user ) , it also means automated scripts can easily update your settings .
One use I see for this is being able to change your keyboard layout using a key combination , an oft - requested feature by programmers .
Speaking of key combinations : the confusing keyboard shortcut - themes have been removed and conflicts between keyboard shortcuts and window manager shortcuts are now easily resolved .
All these new settings also come with updated settings dialogs , which can be started standalone as they are now , but also embedded into the settings manager – a feature of which Jannis made a screencast .
Furthermore , Xfce now ships libxfce4menu .
This is a software library aiming to implement the menu standard also implemented by GNOME and KDE and partly implemented by Xfce 4.4 .
While it is currently in use only by the desktop and the Appfinder ( the latter of which has been completely rewritten to support libxfce4menu ) , it paves the way for a proper menu plugin in the panel that you can actually edit .
Apart from the libxfce4 menu support , the desktop manager xfdesktop has also received a few small improvements over the previous version .
It has a redesigned preferences dialog , includes a few more options for the desktop background ( such as colour saturation adjustment ) , and can now automatically start and stop managing a new desktop when you respectively plug or unplug a monitor .
Finally , the Xfce mixer plugin has been completely rewritten to use gstreamer .
One effect this has is that Xubuntu will probably definitely be switching to gstreamer - based applications ( Xubuntu used to include a xine version of Totem , the movie player , but recently switched to the gstreamer - based version ) .
The biggest benefit this brings users is that it will automatically ask to search for additional media support when it is not installed yet , which happens e.g. when you try to play an MP3 - file on a freshly installed Xubuntu .
All in all , though not as big as 4.4 was , this is shaping up to be another fine release of Xfce that has me looking forward to it .
NEW YORK , Sept. 20 ( UPI ) -- Residents of a New York borough may not know who Heather Mills is , but say they appreciate the British ex-model 's donation of $ 1 million in vegan food .
Bronx resident Leslie Scarver guessed the former " Dancing with the Stars " contestant was " a socialite or something " while looking at a photograph of the woman who is giving the money to area programs , the New York Daily News reported Saturday .
Advertisement
" She looks like one of these celebrities -- like a socialite or something , " said Scarver , who was unable to name the former wife of Beatles star Paul McCartney .
Hunts Point Alliance for Children officials said while Mills may not be a household name in the area , her donation of vegan hamburgers and hot dogs is appreciated .
The group said Mills decided to donate the vegan food products because the neighborhood has the city 's highest child obesity and asthma rates .
The Daily News said in return Mills is to receive a special congressional certificate .
Last November and December , the One Laptop Per Child project had a program called " Give One Get One , " whereby you would pay for two laptops , get one yourself and send one to a child in the developing world .
This holiday season , they 're doing it again , only this time in conjunction with Amazon.com .
They have n't announced the price yet , but last year the cost was $ 399 plus shipping .
This is great news , both because Amazon has resources to process and ship orders that the OLPC initiative does not have , and because this year the laptops are dual - boot !
Yes , last year 's laptop , which my kids have greatly enjoyed using since they got it for Christmas , booted only with the Linux - based Sugar operating system , but now the laptops will boot with Sugar or Windows XP .
This may anger some Microsoft - haters , but this seems awesome to me , because most people in the general population will feel more comfortable with a computer running Windows than running Linux .
And that , plus Amazon selling it , makes it likely that this offer will be a huge success , which can only be a good thing .
So if you have kids , or know someone with kids , who'd love to have their own cool little laptop that can take a bit of a beating , put this on your shopping list .
It 's not often you can buy a present that the recipient will love that at the same time makes you feel great for giving it .
Do n't miss out on this one .
__UPDATE : __The laptops will , sadly , not be dual - boot after all .
Thanks to funfly for the heads - up .
I could n't understand Tkinter due to the lack of resources and tutorial stuff .
Then , I fired up my browser , go to handy dandy Google website and typed in ' python gui ' .
The first few results point to the Python Wiki , which had a bunch ( lots of them ) .
The next few Google results pointed to wxPython .
I have heard of wx -* something * before ... ah it was when I was tinkering with C++... wxWidgets .
Yes , I have tried backtracking myself to C++ too .
( Which I feel should be the language after Python then Java ) .
Going back to the water meter billing system , I asked my former boss if it would be desktop or web ?
He replied if I could work it out for both .
I said again yes .
What in the arse was I thinking ?!
So I sticked with the idea of Python + wxPython and deal with the web approach later ( Django or TurboGears ) .
I fired up Firefox and pressed CTRL + K , typed in ' wxpython tutorials ' .
Then at some point the results have taken me to Jan Bodnar 's site : ZetCode Tutorials .
I talked to Jan Bodnar on a few emails .
The guy was kind enough to talk to me ( lucky me ) .
By the time I realized it , I was proposing him to add tutorials for SQLAlchemy - datastore mapper toolkit for Python .
He said some time in the future .
As you can guess by now , my backend ( database ) is now composed of SQLAlchemy + ( database ) .
The database is SQLite v3 + .
As of Python 2.5.2 , SQLite3 is included in the libraries .
I could never ask for more : zero configuration , serverless , and simple .
Later I added Elixir - high level ORM on top of SQLAlchemy .wxPython is easy .
Download the docs + binaries HERE .
But before I dived into the docs provided by wxPython , I read first the tutorials from Jan Bodnar .
His tutorial on wxPython rocks !
wxPython should be installed from binaries for all platforms ( unless developing for wxPython ) .
I use setuptools for SQLAlchemy and Elixir as well as other libs and addons .
Fast forwarding ...
I have built my app pictured below .
Now here comes the real problem .
Binary distributing your Python application !
Googling again : py2exe .
Some time later , I found out that py2exe have issues with setuptools and its eggs ( jars are to Java ) .
The first few nights , I could n't build a sane distribution .
Py2exe complains it cannot find some packages .
Again , searching the web for answers : the only solution is installing a Python egg UNZIPPED !
I have unpacked all my egg dependencies , but still py2exe complains of not finding ' pkg_resources ' package ..
Well , I did unzipped all the eggs but one egg was not unzip , the setuptoolsxxx.egg .
-- Unzipping that and run my setup.py again and voila !
I added some optimizing and buffering options , and I am very much pleased with my first Python app .
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 04 - Subroutines and Signatures
2015-02-25
# sub without a signature - perl 5 like sub print_arguments { say " Arguments : " ; for @_ { say " \t$_ " ; } } # Signature with fixed arity and type : sub distance ( Int $ x1 , Int $ y1 , Int $ x2 , Int $ y2 ) { return sqrt ( $ x2 - $ x1 ) * * 2 + ( $ y2 - $ y1 ) * * 2 ; } say distance ( 3 , 5 , 0 , 1 ) ; # Default arguments sub logarithm ( $num , $ base = 2.7183 ) { return log ( $num ) / log( $ base ) } say logarithm ( 4 ) ; # uses default second argument say logarithm ( 4 , 2 ) ; # explicit second argument # named arguments sub doit ( : $ when , : $ what ) { say " doing $ what at $ when " ; } doit ( what => ' stuff ' , when => ' once ' ) ; # ' doing stuff at once ' doit ( : when < noon > , : what ( ' more stuff ' ) ) ; # ' doing more stuff at noon ' # illegal : doit ( " stuff " , " now " )
Subroutines are declared with the sub keyword , and can have a list of formal parameters , just like in C , Java and most other languages .
Optionally these parameters can have type constraints .
Parameters are read - only by default .
That can be changed with so - called " traits " :
sub try - to - reset ( $ bar ) { $ bar = 2 ; # forbidden } my $ x = 2 ; sub reset ( $ bar is rw ) { $ bar = 0 ; # allowed } reset ( $x ) ; say $ x ; # 0 sub quox ( $ bar is copy ) { $ bar = 3 ; } quox ( $x ) ; say $x # still 0
Parameters can be made optional by adding a question mark ?
after them , or by supplying a default value .
sub foo ( $x , $y ? ) { if $ y. defined { say " Second parameter was supplied and defined " ; } } sub bar ( $x , $y = 2 * $ x ) { ... }
When you invoke a subroutine like this : my_sub ( $ first , $ second ) the $ first argument is bound to the first formal parameter , the $ second argument to the second parameter etc. , which is why they are called " positional " .
Sometimes it 's easier to remember names than numbers , which is why Perl 6 also has named parameters :
my $r = Rectangle.new ( x => 100 , y => 200 , height => 23 , width => 42 , color => ' black ' ) ;
When you see something like this , you immediately know what the specific arguments mean .
To define a named parameter , you simply put a colon : before the parameter in the signature list :
sub area ( : $ width , : $ height ) { return $ width * $ height ; } are a( width => 2 , height => 3 ) ; are a( height => 3 , width => 2 ) ; # the same are a( : height ( 3 ) , : width ( 2 ) ) ; # the same
The last example uses the so - called colon pair syntax .
Leaving off the value results in the value being True , and putting a negation in front of the name results in the value being False :
: draw - perimeter # same as " draw - perimeter => True " :! transparent # same as " transparent => False "
In the declaration of named parameters , the variable name is also used as the name of the parameter .
You can use a different name , though :
sub area( : width ( $w ) , : height ( $h ) ) { return $ w * $ h ; } are a( width => 2 , height => 3 ) ;
Named parameters are optional by default , so the proper way to write the sub above would be
sub area ( : $ width ! , : $ height ! ) { return $ width * $ height ; }
The bang !
after the parameter name makes it mandatory .
Just because you give your sub a signature does n't mean you have to know the number of arguments in advance .
You can define so - called slurpy parameters ( after all the regular ones ) which use up any remaining arguments :
sub tail ( $ first , * @rest ) { say " First : $ first " ; say " Rest : @rest [ ] " ; } tail ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) ; # " First : 1
Rest : 2 3 4
"
Named slurpy parameters are declared by using an asterisk in front of a hash parameter :
sub order - meal ( $ name , *%extras ) { say " I 'd like some $ name , but with a few modifications : " ; say % extras.keys.join ( ' , ' ) ; } order - meal ( ' beef steak ' , : vegetarian , : well - done ) ;
By default arrays are n't interpolated in argument lists , so unlike in Perl 5 you can write something like this :
sub a ( $ scalar1 , @list , $ scalar2 ) { say $ scalar2 ; } my @list = " foo " , " bar " ; a ( 1 , @list , 2 ) ; # 2
That also means that by default you can't use a list as an argument list :
my @indexes = 1 , 4 ; say " abc" .substr( @indexes ) # does n't do what you want
( What actually happens is that the first argument is supposed to be an Int , and is coerced to an Int .
Which is the same as if you had written " abc." substr(@indexes.elems ) in the first place ) .
You can achieve the desired behavior with a prefix |
say " abcdefgh " .substr(|@indexes ) # bcde , same as " abcdefgh " .
substr (1 , 4 )
You can actually define multiple subs with the same name but with different parameter lists :
multi sub my_substr ( $str ) { ... } # 1 multi sub my_substr ( $str , $ start ) { ... } # 2 multi sub my_substr ( $str , $ start , $ end ) { ... } # 3 multi sub my_substr ( $str , $ start , $end , $ subst ) { ... } # 4
Now whenever you call such a sub , the one with the matching parameter list will be chosen .
The multis do n't have to differ in the arity ( ie number of arguments ) , they can also differ in the type of the parameters :
multi sub frob ( Str $ s ) { say " Frobbing String $ s " } multi sub frob ( Int $ i ) { say " Frobbing Integer $ i " } frob ( " x " ) ; # Frobbing String x frob ( 2 ) ; # Frobbing Integer 2
Nobody will doubt the usefulness of explicit sub signatures : less typing , less duplicate argument checks , and more self - documenting code .
The value of named parameters has also been discussed already .
It also allows useful introspection .
For example when you pass a block or a subroutine to Array .
sort , and that piece of code expects exactly one argument , a Schwartzian Transform ( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform) is automatically done for you - such a functionality would be impossible in Perl 5 , because the lack of explicit signatures means that sort can never find out how many arguments the code block expects .
Multi subs are very useful because they allow builtins to be overridden for new types .
Let 's assume you want a version of Perl 6 which is localized to handle Turkish strings correctly , which have unusual rules for case conversions .
Instead of modifying the language , you can just introduce a new type TurkishStr , and add multi subs for the builtin functions :
multi uc( TurkishStr $ s ) { ... }
Now all you have to do is to take care that your strings have the type that corresponds to their language , and then you can use uc just like the normal builtin function .
Since operators are also subs , these refinements work for operators too .

This is a mosaic of images taken by the Mars Express ’s Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer , OMEGA .
It shows the residual south polar cap at the end of northern winter on the Red Planet .
The cap appears clearly asymmetric , its centre being displaced by 3° from the geographic pole .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Scientists are now able to better explain why Mars ’s residual southern ice cap is misplaced , thanks to data from ESA ’s Mars Express spacecraft - the martian weather system is to blame .
And so is the largest impact crater on Mars – even though it is nowhere near the south pole .
Like Earth , Mars has frozen polar caps , but unlike Earth , these caps are made of carbon dioxide ice as well as water ice .
During the southern hemisphere ’s summer , much of the ice cap sublimates , a process in which the ice turns straight back into gas , leaving behind what is known as the residual polar cap .
The problem is that while the winter cap is symmetrical about the south pole , the residual cap is offset by some three to four degrees .
This misplacement , which has puzzled planetary scientists for years , was solved by scientists in 2005 but now , thanks to ESA ’s Mars Express , new information is available to explain the misplacement .
Marco Giuranna of the Istituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario CNR ( IFSI ) , Rome , Italy , and colleagues have used the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer ( PFS ) onboard Mars Express to measure the temperature of the martian atmosphere from the ground up to an altitude of 50 km above the south polar region .
The team used the profiles to chart the way the atmosphere changes in temperature and other characteristics over more than half a martian year .
They monitored the way carbon dioxide builds into the southern ice cap as the martian autumn , or fall , turns into the martian winter .
“ It is not a straightforward process .
We found that two regional weather systems developed from mid-fall through the winter , ” says Giuranna .
These weather systems are derived from strong eastward winds that characterise the martian atmospheric circulation at mid-latitudes .
They blow straight into the Hellas Basin , the largest impact structure on Mars with a diameter of 2300 km and a depth of 7 km .
The crater ’s depth and the steep rise of the walls deflect the winds and create what are called Rossby waves on Earth .
These waves reroute the high altitude winds on Mars and force the weather system towards the south pole .
In the western hemisphere of Mars , this creates a strong low - pressure system near the south pole , and a high - pressure system in the eastern hemisphere , again near the south pole .
Giuranna found that the temperature of the low - pressure system is often below the condensation point for carbon dioxide , so the gas condenses and falls from the sky as snow and builds up on the ground as frost .
In the high - pressure system , the conditions are never appropriate for snow , so only ground frost occurs .
Thus , the south polar cap is built by two different mechanisms .
The areas that have extensive snow cover do not sublimate in the summer because they reflect more sunlight back into space than the surface frost .
Frost grains tend to be larger than snow grains and have rougher surfaces .
The ragged texture traps more sunlight , driving the sublimation .
So the western area of the southern polar cap , built of snow and frost , not only has a larger amount of carbon dioxide ice deposited but also sublimates more slowly during the summer , while the western area built of frost disappears completely .
This explains why the residual cap is not symmetrically placed around the south pole .
“ This has been a martian curiosity for many years , ” says Giuranna .
Thanks to Mars Express , planetary scientists now understand a new facet of this amazing , alien world .

Food bloggers wear a lot of hats .
We have to be chefs , prep cooks , food stylists , photographers , photo editors , dish washers , and writers every time we post a something new .
I ’ve been wanting to do a post on food photography for a while ; everyone who has ever emailed me about my photos : this is for you .
Most food bloggers do n’t have their own studios , or professional lighting equipment , or access to food stylists .
Here ’s how you can make your own high - quality food photos at home no matter what equipment you have .
There is a lot that happens before and after I click the shutter that contributes to the final photo .
I ’m not a professional photographer , and I ’m figuring things out along the way with a lot of trial and error .
The only prior knowledge I have is some skills that I picked up in a high school photography class several years ago .
A lot of the tips online about food photography are for commercial shoots , and therefore do n’t contain much specific information for the home food blogger .
Workflows and techniques are very personal , so I ’m sure other food bloggers out there achieve fabulous results doing things differently than I do .
This is what works for me , and I hope you find it useful .
Dishes
Above is just one part of my dish collection , and it grows all the time .
The right dish really sets the overall look for the photo .
Everytime I ’m in a store that sells dishes , I pick up one or two of something I find interesting .
You do n’t need a full set .
Some general tips :
1 . White will always , always work .
2. Square dishes always look classy .
3 . Smaller is better — small dishes are easier to fill up with food , which prevents your plate from looking bare .
Also look online for fun dishes .
I have a friend who works at Beau - Coup Favors , a neat favors business , and he sent me these great little miniature martini glasses I use in a lot of photos in this post .
Just goes to show you how the right presentation can make even a boring vegetable salad look gorgeous .
Plan Ahead
Do as much as you possibly can ahead of time .
Food should be photographed as soon as possible after preparing , which means you ’ll need a space for photographing ready to go , an uncluttered kitchen , etc .
Here ’s what I do before I start cooking :
1. Clean up , do all the dishes , clear countertops
2 . Pick out dishes
3 . Set camera up on tripod , pick out background
4. Clear your photography space
5 . Think about the dish : do you need a garnish ?
Special utensils ?
Placemat ?
Mise en Place
Prepping all your ingredients neatly will keep your kitchen more organized , cut down on cooking time , and allow you to focus on the task at hand .
And mise en place photographs make for killer filler photos , as well !
Starting Out
When I first started doing my blog , I had a sony point - and - shoot digital camera , no tripod , and I got on just fine .
The image to the left was taken with a point - and - shoot ( PnS ) at night , with only my kitchen light on .
Even better is taking your photos during the day with natural light .
The colors will be much more true to real life , like this photo , which was also taken with a simple consumer camera .
But if you ’re looking to improve not only your photos but also your equipment , here are some tips for you .
Moving Up
If you are interested in investing a little money in your photography , I ’d highly recommend getting a “ prosumer ” digital SLR ( single - lens reflex ) camera and a trusty lens or two .
There are a lot of cameras on the market , but most people find themselves deciding between Canon and Nikon .
It ’s really difficult to say which is better , and the reality is that they ’re both great .
I happen to shoot Canon , so my recommendations will be for Canon products , since that ’s what I know .
Digital SLR Bodies
I started out with a Canon Rebel XTi , aka the EOS 450D .
This is the perfect camera to start out with if you want a dSLR , but do n’t want to spend too too much , and do n’t want a super clunky camera .
Granted , the XTi is much larger than a pocket - sized camera , but compared to other SLRs on the market , it ’s downright tiny .
You ’ll be able to use different lenses , change your aperture and shutter speed , set your white balance , shoot RAW – pretty much everything you ’ll want to do to take your photography to the next level .
However , I started with the XTi , and quickly upgraded to the EOS 30D .
A little too quickly .
I should have spent a little more money up front and gone with the 30D to begin with .
But it ’s bigger , heavier , and more expensive .
Think about what you want in a camera , and go to a store and hold different models before you decide what the right camera is for you .
The 40D is out now , and the 50D has been announced , so I bet you could get a pretty good deal on a 30D right now .
Lenses
Whatever camera you get , I suggest you skip over any camera package that includes what they call a “ kit ” lens .
The lenses the cameras are packaged with are usually semi-poor quality “ all purpose ” lenses that do a bit of everything , but do n’t do anything well .
By getting the camera body only , and purchasing the lenses you want separately , you ’ll not only save money , but also be getting exactly what you want .
But that ’s another decision you need to make : what lenses are you going to buy ?
There are a lot of lenses you can get that will work for food photography .
Here are my recommendations , but keep in mind these are definitely not the only options .
The lenses here are ones that I 1 ) own and use myself and 2 ) make great photos for things other an food photography .
If I ’m going to spend a few hundred dollars on a lens , I want to use it for more than just food photography !
Canon 50 mm 1.8 $ 80- 90ish
If you ’re on a budget and can only buy one lens , I ’d recommend this one .
It ’s cheap compared to other lenses , and is a very “ fast ” lens .
A fast lens is one that has a very wide aperture that creates nice depth of field and can be used in low - light situations ( more on all that later ) .
The downsides : slow , loud auto - focus , a cheaply built plastic body , and cannot focus very close to your subject .
I owned it and it was great for three months .
Then it broke .
Still , very highly recommended .
It is also a great general lens that you ’ll love to shoot portraits with as well .
Example Image from 50 mm 1.8 :
Canon 50 mm 1.4 $ 325
This is the big brother to the 50 mm 1.8 .
It has all the benefits the of the 1.8 , but an even faster aperture , a much sturdier body , closer focusing range , quieter and faster auto - focus and a nicer “ bokeh . ” ( More on bokeh later . )
It ’s much more expensive but will last you longer , and compared to Canon ’s other lenses , this is still on the “ affordable ” side , believe it or not .
I use this lens all sorts of photos .
( You can spend even more and get the 50 mm 1.2 L series lens , but that ’s even more expensive than this one . )
Example Image from 50 mm 1.4 :
Canon 60 mm 2.8 Macro , EF - S $ 400
You might not think there would be a large difference between a 50 mm and a 60 mm , so why own both ?
I ’ll tell you why –this lens is a macro lens .
A macro lens allows you to really get in there and focus closely on your food ( or whatever ) and get details you ’d be hard pressed to get with another lens .
It ’s also fast lens and doubles nicely as a portrait lens .
I ’ve shot the majority of my food photos with this lens , and I ’d say if you only were to buy one lens for food photography , this lens or another similar macro lens might be your best investment .
However , if you ever plan to upgrade your camera to something nicer than a 30/40/50D , be aware that this lens wo n’t mount onto the more professional Canon cameras like the 5D and 1D .
( But if you ’re in the market for a 5D or a 1D , you definitely do n’t need my advice ! )
Example Image from 60 mm 2.8 , food is “ actual size ” :
As I said earlier , there are lots of lenses that can and do work great for food photography .
If you ’re a food photographer and have a different lens that you use and love , please leave it in the comments !
Simple Setups , Natural Light
You do n’t need to invest in lots of studio equipment to get great images .
The very best lighting you can get is free , and it ’s coming through your windows every day .
Here ’s a shot of my “ studio ” :
A table , next to a window .
Done !
Well , almost .
Since I shoot with natural light only , a lot of times it ’s slightly too dark to hand - hold my camera and get a clear image .
Use a tripod and you ’ll be amazed at how much better your photos get , especially with PnS cameras .
Even balancing your camera on a can of tomatoes or a pile of books can save a shot .
Tripods very drastically in price , but I have a cheap $ 30 that has done the trick for well over a year now .
Make your own backgrounds
There are lots of ways you can make backgrounds for your food shots .
My favorite backgrounds are just simple 20×30 ″ foam - core boards that I spray painted on my porch , a different color on each side .
I love these because they ’re cheap , easy to make and customize , easy to store , and fairly durable .
I once bought this kit that comes with colored paper , but soon realized the paper gets destroyed after a few uses : it tears , it gets ugly creases in it , and if you spill anything on it at all it ’s ruined .
The big foam - core boards , on the other hand , wipe clean and do n’t bend , and if you do ruin them they ’re easy to replace .
As you can see in the photo to the left , they ’re easy to swap in and out during a shoot .
You can try all different colors before picking the right one for the dish you ’re photographing .
One tip : buy matte finish spray paint – glossy paint will cause unsightly glares in your photos .
Natural Lighting
I ’ve already mentioned this , but I ca n’t stress it enough .
It ’s nearly impossible to reproduce the wonders of natural sunlight artificially .
As far as I know , even big - wig professionals have trouble duplicating it .
Yes , it means you ’ll need to do your food photography during the day , but I promise you the results are worth it .
Nothing looks as nice as sunlit food , and fortunately the sun is pretty easy to use ( even if it ’s unpredictable ) .
Besides , learning how to shoot with natural , varying light will improve your photography across the board .
Using natural light is probably the number one thing you can do to improve your photos .
Turning off the flash , since you ’re using lovely natural light , is the second best thing .
I find side - lighting to be the most dependable and easist to expose for .
Back - lighting can be very nice , but is harder to manage the correct exposure .
Full on front - lighting can work well , too , so experiment with everything .
When using natural lighting , do n’t place your food in a sunbeam .
You want ambient , diffuse light .
Things shot directly in the sun usually look too harsh , but again , it can sometimes work depending on the shot .
In my opinion , the “ safest ” set up is diffuse side - lighting coming from nearby window .
For those of you who are interested in artificial lighting , I ’m not the best person to turn to for advice , but I can suggest you look into Lowel Ego lights .
I bought a set and have used them on one post only , but I managed to get a good result .
This shot was lit with Ego lights at night :
For more information on Lowel Ego lights for food photography , check out Jaden of Steamy Kitchen ’s fabulous and detailed review of them .
Take a LOT of Photos
I did a photoshoot for this entry to help illustrate the points I wanted to make .
What you see above is every single photo from the shoot , all 93 of them .
I think I average around 100 photos taken per recipe , and I whittle them down drastically to just a handful for each post .
Buy a large memory card for your camera to make sure you have enough space for all those photos !
I always find it funny how one shot can be “ meh ” , while another shot take from a slightly different angle , or with a slightly different focus , can suddenly become “ WOW ! ”
The best way to ensure you get “ the shot ” is to take lots and lots of them .
Taking lots of photos allows you to be very , very picky when you ’re editing , ensuring you never have to post a photo you dislike .
Anatomy of a Shoot
I start out photographing the process of the recipe–chopping , special techniques , assembly , etc .
Once the dish is done and plated , I ’ll take some “ basic ” shots which help me establish the lighting , background , what props / garnishes are needed , positioning of the food , etc .
I gradually work my way towards a photograph that feels complete to me , making sure to get all different angles .
I try overhead , straight on , close up , environment shots , and many different angles .
My photographs start out boring and move towards interesting as I shoot .
It ’s hard to explain how I plate or frame , but it involves a lot of photos and looking at each photo and saying , “ Hmm , the image looks too bare ” or “ I need to figure out how to emphasize this particular quality of the dish . ”
As I said before , the more photos you take , the better chance you have of getting that perfect shot .
Camera Settings
No matter what kind of camera you have , one thing always applies : turn OFF the flash .
A flash will at best make your food look flat and at worst wash out all the details and create unappealing shadows .
If you have a PnS camera , look for a setting that is marked with a little flower .
This is your macro setting , and it will help your lens use the best of its close - focusing and detail capabilities .
If you have a larger dSLR with more settings to choose from , here ’s what I recommend :
ISO : Set to the lowest possible , probably 100 .
The lower the ISO , the “ cleaner ” your image will be .
Photos shot at higher ISOs have a lot of digital “ noise ” in them that looks like colorful static .
Higher ISOs are used to increase your camera ’s sensitivity to light , allowing you to shoot in darker conditions and still maintain a shutter speed that is fast enough to prevent blurry images .
But since you ’re using a tripod ( right ? ! ) , and your food is n’t moving ( right ? ! ) , it ’s best to keep this setting as low as possible for the best looking images .
Flash : Keep it off .
Always .
RAW or JPG :
If you have a choice , shoot RAW .
RAW files record lots and lots information about each photo , which allows you to bring the most out of the image in post - processing ( editing color , contrast , white balance , etc. ) .
Be aware that you may need special software to process RAW images , however , and there ’s more on that below .
If RAW is n’t an option , make sure your camera is set to the highest resolution JPG option available .
Shutter Speed and Aperture :
In my opinion , shutter speed does n’t matter so much in food photography ; it ’s your aperture , or f- stop , that ’s most important .
So important , it gets its very own section .
When shutter speed would matter is for “ freezing ” action , or purposeful motion blur .
For example , in the photo of the pancakes , I needed a fairly fast shutter speed to “ freeze ” the pouring syrup .
And lets say you wanted a shot that showed the motion of you tossing greens or sauteing vegetables ; a slow shutter speed would be required for that .
But on the whole , you ’ll be more interested in apertures than shutter speeds .
Know your F - Stops
If you ’ve ever wondered how photographers get that nice , blurry background with only one thing in focus , now you know .
F - stops !
The aperture of the camera is the opening that lets the light in , and you can set it to very large ( the photo on the left ) or very small ( the photo on the right ) .
Think of the aperture on your camera the same way as the pupil in your eye .
When it ’s dark out , your pupils expand to gather more light .
If someone shines a light in your eye , they constrict and get very small to let less light in .
Your camera ’s aperture is the same .
One of the side - effects is what ’s called “ depth of field . ”
When the aperture is very wide open , only a small amount of the image will be in focus , just like the photo on the left .
If the aperture is very small , much more of the photo will be in focus .
Your eyes are actually the same .
Ever squint to read a street sign in the distance ?
The smaller your pupils get , the more focus you get , so squinting to see a sign more clearly is just like “ stopping down ” to a smaller aperture to get more things in focus .
If you ’ve ever wanted to pick out a specific part of an image to draw the viewers eye , a small depth of field is one way to say , “ Hey , look at THIS ! ”
There ’s no right or wrong when it comes to apertures , it ’s just a matter of taste .
I prefer many images that have very large apertures because I really like the dramatic focus .
If you ’re looking for this in your photos , too , make sure to purchase lenses that have a an aperture of 2.8 or wider ( like 1.4 ) .
All the lenses I recommended above can provide this effect .
By the way , the technical term for the pretty , smooth and silky blurry parts of an image like this is called “ bokeh . ”
Learn Manual
Of course , none of this is much help if you do n’t know how to set your f-stop , or how to get the proper exposure once you do .
The best thing do to is learn how to use your camera on the manual setting .
It takes a bit of time to get used to it , but once you do you ’ll have complete control over your images .
This post is already long enough as it is so I wo n’t go into it here , but I ’m sure there are some great resources online for learning how to use your camera on its manual setting .
One possible way around learning to shoot manually is “ Aperture Priority ” — a setting that is available on my camera and many dSLRs .
On a Canon camera , simply set the dial to Av and use the scroll wheel at the top to set your aperture , big or small .
The camera will figure out the corresponding shutter speed to give you the proper exposure .
Well , that ’s the short of it , anyway .
If you need more help with that , feel free to email me .
Framing
Whatever subject you ’re shooting , you ’ll hear people talk endlessly about the Rule of Thirds , and for good reason .
It just works .
If you ’ve never heard about it , definitely check out that link .
Like all rules of thumb , you can break it and still get a great photo , but it ’s a reliable way to dramatically improve the images you make without much fuss .
For food photography , a lot of times people stand above the dish , take a photo , and call it a day .
Overhead shots can work , but try taking photos from lower angles , even level with the food itself .
Also , get in close , but not too close !
It ’s always important to leave some frame of reference for the viewer so they know what they ’re looking at , even if it ’s just the edge of the plate , or a fork , or the rim of a glass .
You tell me , which close - up photo is more appealing ?
Post - Processing
I use , and highly recommend , a piece of software called Lightroom to edit and organize my photos .
It ’s not free , but it is fabulous .
Since I shoot in RAW , the images that come directly out of the camera are usually pretty “ flat ” looking .
RAW images require some sort of processing , and most people turn them into high - res JPG files , making edits to color , contrast , sharpening , exposure , and white balance along the way .
I tend to boost contrast and color saturation , as well as add vignetting ( darkened edges ) , but it really depends on what I ’m trying to bring out in the photo .
Here ’s an example of two images before and after editing in Lightroom :
It ’s hard to make such dramatic changes to a photo if it ’s not a RAW file .
The information a RAW file keeps allows you to make many non-destructive enhancements .
RAW files give you lots of control over how your final image looks .
If you camera does n’t have the option to shoot in RAW , set it to the highest resolution JPG setting available .
And if you ’re using a mac , you can start with some basic editing in iPhoto .
I feel like Lightroom is a nice middle step between the ease of use of iPhoto and the powerful tools of Photoshop .
I know a lot of people also like Aperture , but I ’ve never used it myself .
If you ’re on a PC , I have no idea what programs to recommend , but I ’m sure other people do !
Whatever software you use to edit your images , check out the settings and make sure your photos are being edited in the sRGB colorspace ( which is good for putting photos on the web ) and use a calibrated monitor when editing .
Both of these things will help ensure your photos look as good as they can on many different monitors .
Final Thoughts
The very best advice I can give you about food photography is simply do a lot of it .
Like anything , the more you do it the better you ’ll get .
I ’ve only been doing food photography for two years or so and I can see a huge difference in the quality of my shots .
The more I learn about photography the more I realize how much more there is for me to learn .
I hope this was helpful for you .
Happy shooting , and be thankful that no matter how your photos turn out , you can always eat your work after wards !
But if you ’re going to get really into food photography , be ready to eat a lot of your meals cold .

It ’s refreshing when the underdog wins
I pull for the underdog .
I enjoy seeing the helpless and bullied rise up victoriously over circumstances and individuals that seek to suppress or control them .
I want the tortoise to beat the hare , which mocks and jeers at him for being slow .
I do n’t like seeing nature taken for granted .
I ’m not against cities – I was born in a city , and I live in a small one , but I ’m against mindless abuses of nature , like clear - cutting forests , polluting our communities ’ air and water .
I ’m against building new buildings , with half a city abandoned , to where wildlife have nowhere to roam but our highways .
I ’d rather see the pines than billboard signs .
I ’ve always related to the Lynyrd Skynyrd lyrics in
All I Can Do Is Write About It
( allen collins — ronnie vanzant )
Well this life that Ive lead has took me everywhere
There aint no place I aint never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just aint no plae like home
Did you ever see a she - gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in tennessee
And lord I cant make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creepin
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Do you like to see a mountain stream a - flowin
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about , well , the air your breathin
Well you better listen to my song
And lord I cant make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creepin
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Im not tryin to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol dixieland
But youll never take ol dixie from a boy
And lord I cant make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creepin
Lord take me and mine before that comes
cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin
Lord take me and mine before that comes
I do n’t see nature as being defeated though .
Nature , like the toroise is slow and steady ,
and in many instances nature wins the race
Sue Jones - Davies ( centre ) with the Monty Python team on the film A mayor 's plan to end her town 's ban on the 1979 Monty Python film Life of Brian are being opposed by the local vicar , who says it pokes fun at Jesus .
Sue Jones - Davies , who played Brian 's girlfriend in the movie , was amazed when she became mayor of Aberystwyth that it was still barred at the cinema .
But Reverend Canon Stuart Bell said Christians he spoke to in Ceredigion were still against it being shown .
The mayor declined to respond , but will still press for the ban to be lifted .
Long before she donned her mayoral robes in Aberystwyth , Ms Jones - Davies played Brian 's girlfriend in the cult movie .
However , when it was released , critics accused the Python team of blasphemy with its story about a Jewish man who was mistaken for the messiah and then crucified .
If someone was going to make fun of my wife in a film then I would oppose that ... making fun of Jesus Christ , whom I love more than my wife , in a film is going to offend me
Reverend Stuart Bell
Some religious groups picketed cinemas which screened the film , and it was banned from being shown in some towns and cities , including Aberystwyth .
Nearly 30 years on , Mr Bell , vicar of the town 's St Michael 's Church , said the restriction should remain in place .
" There 's been no change in attitude or response to the film amongst the Christians who have spoken to me in Aberystwyth , " he explained .
" The film at its root is poking fun at Christ and we do n't want that to happen .
I do n't think that the film should be shown .
Why should the ban be removed ? "
Asked if he had ever seen the film , Mr Bell said he had " seen a small clip , that 's all " .
He said : " If someone was going to make fun of my wife in a film then I would oppose that .
Sue Jones - Davies has switched acting roles for mayoral robes " Making fun of Jesus Christ , whom I love more than my wife , in a film is going to offend me . "
Earlier this month , Ms Jones - Davies said : " I would like to think that any religion would have the generosity to see the film for what it is , which is a comedy . "
The movie has grown in popularity over the years , and usually appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest comedy films .
It featured some iconic lines , most famously the verdict by Brian 's mother on her son : " He 's not the messiah - he 's a very naughty boy " .
Ms Jones - Davies played a revolutionary called Judith Iscariot , and she had a nude scene with the film 's hero , Brian , played by the late Graham Chapman .
It is understood a committee of church leaders in Aberystwyth recommended a ban in 1979 .
Ceredigion council has the power to lift it , but a spokesman said earlier this month that no -one in the licensing department knew about the ban .
But Michael Davies , the owner of Aberystwyth 's Commodore Cinema , said he was sure it was still in place .

What are these ?
Oh man , those boys on that basketball team are done .
Jaime Nared is a 12 - year - old , 6 - foot , 1 - inch basketball player from outside Portland , OR .
She 's just finished sixth grade and she 's now playing with a girls high school traveling team because she 's too good to play with girls her own age .
Perhaps the next Candace Parker .
Or better .
But being a prodigy has its costs , namely , where should Nared be playing ?
The last time she played against girls her own age , her team won 90 - 7 .
Her coach described the game as " like having Shaq on the floor . "
Oregon State has already offered her a scholarship .
From the New York Times ' Play Magazine :
After the league cut Jaime from the boys ' team , Williams called the Portland media .
A local TV station aired Jaime 's story , and a couple of weeks later she and her family were featured on " Good Morning America " and " CNN Headline News . "
Through the summer , Jaime received an outpouring of support - text messages from her former male teammates and notes from total strangers , including a 55 - year - old woman who said she 'd hoped to play basketball in the Olympics , but by the time women 's basketball became an Olympic event , it was too late .
To date , however , the Hoop has not reversed its decision , and Williams is considering a civil claim .
( Hoop management did not return phone calls for this article . )
" Sports brings out the best and worst in us , " Williams says .
" For me , it begs the question of how we do sports at the beginning .
Particularly before puberty , why do we separate boys only , girls only ?
We say boys are stronger , faster , but that 's a generalization . "

Read on for a pretty fascinating article about how the world is reacting to a women 's basketball prodigy .
Scary , is n't she ?

For anyone following the rock / metal scene , it 's no secret Metallica has been on the outs with its fan base for some time .
A string of bad albums and suing fans for downloading its MP3s did wonders to spoil the reputation for a band that had previously been viewed as one of the biggest , most popular and most significant bands to come along in ages .
Its new album , " Death Magnetic , " is due on September 12 , but despite the band 's best precautions , it has leaked to the Internet .
Search any BitTorrent site and there it is , in its full 10 song , 70 minute glory .
This is hardly uncommon .
Every major album release that I 've been following for the past few years has leaked a few weeks to a month prior to official release .
It usually ends up on IRC and BitTorrent trading posts , and once it gets into those networks , trying to stop the trading would be like holding back the ocean with a bucket .
But there will be no lawsuits this time .
Drummer Lars Ulrich , who was particularly singled out for fan vilification over the lawsuits against fans and Napster , told a San Francisco radio DJ " It 's 2008 and it 's part of how it is these days , so it 's fine .
We 're happy . "
He should be .
The album is getting very good reviews , not just by critics but by fans alike who grabbed a copy .
The band needed some positive word of mouth for once .
And yes , it is quite good .
Oh , another blow -- among a flurry of them -- to people who think vaccines are linked with autism .
Some people were claiming that measles vaccines were linked to incidence of autism .
The claim was that the ( killed weakened ) measles viruses in the vaccines were getting into the childrens ' bowels .
The intestines would then react to the virus , lowering vitamin and other nutrient absorption , which in turn could give rise to development disorders including autism .
Measle virus RNA was found in the bowels of children with autism , and there was speculation of a link , though tenuous .
The media , of course , ran with this story .
However , a new study shows that the measles virus RNA found in the children with autism ( who also had gastrointestinal ( GI ) disturbances ) has nothing to do with the onset of autism spectrum disorder :
The temporal order of onset of GI episodes and autism relative to timing of MMR [ Measles / Mumps / Rubella vaccine ] administration was examined .
We found no differences between case and control groups in the presence of MV [ measles virus ] RNA in ileum and cecum .
Results were consistent across the three laboratory sites .
GI symptom and autism onset were unrelated to MMR timing .
In other words , the vaccines had nothing to do with the autism .
As the researchers say themselves , " This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure . "
So this is yet another piece of evidence that autism is not caused by vaccines .
This , of course , wo n't stop the antivaxxers in their campaign to bring back measles , pertussis , and other horrors that have been kept under control by vaccines for decades .
Their antiscientific views are having a real effect , as we 've already seen , with outbreaks popping up around the country .
But as I have seen in the comments of my previous posts on this topic , they are immune to logic .
Against that , they are well inoculated .
Tip o' the syringe to , yes , my mom for telling me about this study .
Pretty cool .

Aug. 08 , 2008 | If Ron Suskind 's sensational charge that the White House and CIA colluded in forging evidence to justify the Iraq invasion is n't proved conclusively in his new book , " The Way of the World , " then the sorry record of the Bush administration offers no basis to dismiss his allegation .
Setting aside the relative credibility of the author and the government , the relevant question is whether the available facts demand a full investigation by a congressional committee , with testimony under oath .
When we look back at the events surrounding the emergence of the faked letter that is at the center of this controversy , a strong circumstantial case certainly can be made in support of Suskind 's story .
That story begins during the final weeks of 2003 , when everyone in the White House was suffering severe embarrassment over both the origins and the consequences of the invasion of Iraq .
No weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq .
No evidence of significant connections between Saddam Hussein 's regime and the al - Qaida terrorist organization had been discovered there either .
Nothing in this costly misadventure was turning out as advertised by the Bush administration .
According to Suskind , the administration 's highest officials -- presumably meaning President Bush and Vice President Cheney -- solved this problem by ordering the CIA to manufacture a document " proving " that Saddam had indeed been trying to build nuclear weapons and that he was also working with al - Qaida .
The reported product of that order was a fake memorandum from Tahir Jalil Habbush , then chief of Saddam 's intelligence service , to the dictator himself , dated July 1 , 2001 .
The memo not only explicitly confirmed that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had received training in Baghdad for " attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy " but also carefully noted the arrival of a " shipment " from Niger via Libya , presumably of uranium yellowcake , the sole export of that impoverished African country .
Very incriminating , very convenient and not very believable .
Indeed , it may be hard to imagine that even the CIA at its bumbling worst would concoct such a blatant counterfeit .
But there are a few reasons to believe that , too .
On Dec. 14 , 2003 , the Sunday Telegraph hyped the phony Habbush memo as a front - page exclusive over the byline of Con Coughlin , the paper 's foreign editor and chief Mideast correspondent , who has earned a reputation for promoting neoconservative claptrap .
As I explained in a Salon blog post on Dec. 18 , the story 's sudden appearance in London was the harbinger of a disinformation campaign that quickly blew back to the United States -- where it was cited by William Safire on the New York Times Op - Ed page .
Ignoring the bizarre Niger yellowcake reference , which practically screamed bullshit , Safire seized on Coughlin 's story as proof of his own cherished theory about Saddam 's sponsorship of 9/11 .
Soon enough , however , the Habbush memo was discredited in Newsweek and elsewhere as a forgery for many reasons , notably including its contradiction of established facts concerning Atta 's travels during 2001 .
But the credulous Telegraph coverage is still significant now , because Coughlin identified the source of his amazing scoop as Ayad Allawi .
For those who have forgotten the ambitious Allawi , he is a former Baathist who rebelled against Saddam , formed the Iraqi National Accord movement to fight the dictator , and was appointed to Iraq 's interim Governing Council by the U.S. occupation authorities after the invasion .
Although Coughlin quoted Allawi at some length , neither he nor his source revealed how the Habbush memo had fallen into the hands of the Iraqi politician .
But the Safire column made an allusion that now seems crucial , describing Allawi as " an Iraqi leader long considered reliable by intelligence agencies . "
Specifically , Allawi was a longtime asset of the Central Intelligence Agency , which had funded his struggle against Saddam for years prior to the invasion .
His CIA sponsorship is noted in nearly every news article about Allawi , usually contrasted with the Pentagon sponsorship of his political rival , Ahmed Chalabi , the infamous fabricator of WMD intelligence ( and suspected double agent for Iran ) .
Obviously , Allawi's relationship with the CIA is worth reconsidering today in light of the charges in Suskind 's book , even though by itself that relationship proves nothing .
There is more , however .
On Dec. 11 , 2003 -- three days before the Telegraph launched its " exclusive " on the Habbush memo -- the Washington Post published an article by Dana Priest and Robin Wright headlined " Iraq Spy Service Planned by U.S. to Stem Attacks . "
Buried inside on Page A41 , their story outlined the CIA 's efforts to create a new Iraqi intelligence agency : " The new service will be trained , financed and equipped largely by the CIA with help from Jordan .
Initially the agency will be headed by Iraqi Interior Minister Nouri Badran , a secular Shiite and activist in the Jordan - based Iraqi National Accord , a former exile group that includes former Baath Party military and intelligence officials .
" Badran and Ayad Allawi , leader of the INA , are spending much of this week at CIA headquarters in Langley to work out the details of the new program .
Both men have worked closely with the CIA over the past decade in unsuccessful efforts to incite coups against Saddam Hussein . "
( The Web link to the full story is broken but it can be found on Nexis . )
So Allawi was at the CIA during the week before Coughlin got that wonderful scoop .
That may not be proof of anything , either , but a picture is beginning to form .
That picture becomes sharper in the months that followed Allawi's release of the Habbush forgery , when he suddenly returned to favor in Baghdad and eclipsed Chalabi , at least for a while .
Five months later , in May 2004 , the Iraqi Governing Council elected Allawi as his country 's interim prime minister , reportedly under pressure from the American authorities .
Combining subservience to the occupiers with iron - fisted tactics , he quickly squandered any popularity he might have enjoyed , and his INA party placed a humiliating third in the 2005 national elections .
That was the end of Allawi as a politician , yet perhaps he had already served his purpose .
And it might be very interesting to hear what he would say today about the Habbush forgery -- and his broader relationship to the CIA and the Bush White House -- especially if he were to tell his story in a congressional hearing .
Until then there is much more to learn from Suskind 's reporting , including new evidence that Bush and other officials knew there were no WMD in Iraq .

" The smearing of the Palin family must end , " he said .
As a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip , I could not have been more proud to learn last June that I had earned a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship to study in the United States .
As a child , I would wonder how televisions , computers and washing machines actually worked .
I took this fascination to the Islamic University of Gaza , the only Gazan university offering a degree in electrical engineering .
There , I developed an ECG monitoring system that enables patients ’ hearts to be monitored at home through a personal computer and an Internet link .
I won the university prize for distinguished projects for my innovation .
I long dreamed of the other advances I might make after an education at the University of Connecticut , where I was scheduled to study this fall for a master ’s degree in electrical engineering .
Now , my dream has been stolen from me .
I am devastated ; my parents heartbroken .
Though Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 , it still controls our borders and determines who and what enters or exits .
Since a 2006 election that brought a Hamas majority to the Palestinian Legislative Council , Israel has steadily diminished access into and out of Gaza .
Many Palestinians reportedly died in the past year because they could not leave to obtain medical care they desperately needed .
Food , fuel and medicine are scarce .
Hundreds of students like me , with scholarships to study abroad , are being arbitrarily denied the right to leave Gaza to fulfill our educational aspirations .
A few weeks ago when I went to the Erez Checkpoint between Gaza and Israel , I was told by the Israeli official that I could not leave unless I collaborated with the Israeli occupation .
I refused .
My conscience and my people ’s right to freedom and equal rights mean more to me than even the finest education .
US officials came to my aid .
They held special visa interviews along the Israeli - Gaza border for me and two other Fulbright scholars in a similar position .
The US granted my visa .
Once again I could imagine taking my seat in a lecture hall in America .
I packed my bags , bought souvenirs for my future friends in America and bade farewell to my family .
Then came a phone call that changed everything .
My American visa had been revoked based on secret evidence provided by Israel .
I can not see the evidence and so have no opportunity to contest it .
What carrot did an Israeli security official dangle before another Gazan ’s eyes , or what torture tactics did he use to manufacture information he could use against me ?
However it happened , and for whatever reason , the outcome is the same .
Despite my abhorrence of violence , I am being penalized .
What troubles me most , however , is not my own personal plight , but the effect this experience has had on my talented younger brother .
After watching what I have endured as an innocent and politically unaffiliated student , he has concluded that he will no longer pursue the educational dream outside of Gaza he once held .
His horizons are closing .
As an older brother from a family that places deep value on education , it pains me to see his own ambitions falter , even temporarily , because of the injustice I am facing .
I wonder what hopelessness all children in Gaza suffer when they learn that Gaza ’s best students are confined by Israel to the cramped Gaza Strip ?
And how are they to succeed when this week their parents discover local stores are empty of study essentials such as pencils , pens and notebooks because of the economic blockade of our small parcel of land ?
There are hundreds of Palestinian students in Gaza hoping for a miracle in the next few days so that we can pursue scholarships that may offer a once - in - a - lifetime escape from ignorance and poverty .
We are determined not to be rendered a dependent people lacking advanced education .
And yet the silence of the world suggests that Israel will succeed in keeping us within the limiting confines of Gaza .
Perhaps American students will think of me and my fellow Palestinian students as the academic year begins .
We long for a similar opportunity .

It turns out there was something more nauseating than the nomination of Sarah Palin as John McCain ’s running mate this past week .
It was the tone of the acclaim that followed her acceptance speech .
“ Drill , baby , drill , ” clapped John Dickerson , marveling at Palin ’s ability to speak and smile at the same time as an indication of her unexpected depths and unsuspected strengths .
“ It was clear Palin was having fun , and it ’s hard to have fun if you ’re scared or a lightweight , ” he wrote in Slate .
The Politico praised her charm and polish as antidotes to her lack of foreign policy experience : “ Palin ’s poised and flawless performance evoked roars of applause from delegates who earlier this week might have worried that the surprise pick and newcomer to the national stage may not be up to the job . ”
“ She had a great night .
I thought she had a very skillfully written , and very skillfully delivered speech , ” Joe Biden said , shades of “ articulate and bright and clean ” threatening a reappearance .
( For a full roundup of these comments go here . )
Thus began the official public launch of our country ’s now most - prominent female politician .
The condescension – damning with faint praise – was reminiscent of the more overt misogyny of Samuel Johnson .
“ A woman ’s preaching is like a dog ’s walking on his hinder legs , ” the wit once observed .
“ It is not done well ; but you are surprized to find it done at all . ”
Palin sounded , at times , like she was speaking a foreign language as she gave voice to the beautifully crafted words that had been prepared for her on Wednesday night .
But that was n’t held against her .
Thanks to the level of general esteem that greeted her ascent to the podium , it seems we ’ve all got to celebrate the fact that America ’s Hottest Governor ( Princess of the Fur Rendezvous 1983 , Miss Wasilla 1984 ) could speak at all .
Could there be a more thoroughgoing humiliation for America ’s women ?
You are not , I think , supposed now to say this .
Just as , I am sure , you are certainly not supposed to feel that having Sarah Palin put forth as the Republicans ’ first female vice presidential candidate is just about as respectful a gesture toward women as was John McCain ’s suggestion , last month , that his wife participate in a topless beauty contest .
Such thoughts , we are told , are sexist .
And elitist .
After all , via Palin , we now hear without cease , the People are speaking .
The “ real ” “ authentic , ” small - town “ Everyday People , ” of Hockey Moms and Blue Collar Dads whom even Rudolph Giuliani now invokes as an antidote to the cosmopolite Obamas and their backers in the liberal media .
( Remind me please , once again , what was the name of the small town where Rudy grew up ? )
Why does this woman – who to some of us seems as fake as they can come , with her delicate infant son hauled out night after night under the klieg lights and her pregnant teenage daughter shamelessly instrumentalized for political purposes — deserve , to a unique extent among political women , to rank as so “ real ” ?
Because the Republicans , very clearly , believe that real people are idiots .
This disdain for their smarts shows up in the whole way they ’ve cast this race now , turning a contest over economic and foreign policy into a culture war of the Real vs. the Elites .
It ’s a smoke and mirrors game aimed at diverting attention from the fact that the party ’s tax policies have helped create an elite that ’s more distant from “ the people ” than ever before .
And from the fact that the party ’s dogged allegiance to up - by - your - bootstraps individualism — an individualism exemplified by Palin , the frontierswoman who somehow has managed to “ balance ” five children and her political career with no need for support — is leading to a culture - wide crack - up .
Real people , the kind of people who will like and identify with Palin , they clearly believe , are smart , but not too smart , and do n’t talk too well , dropping their “ g ”s , for example , and putting tough concepts like “ vice president ” in quotation marks .
“ As for that ‘ V.P. ’ talk all the time … I tell ya , I still ca n’t answer that question until somebody answers for me , What is it exactly that the ‘ VP ’ does every day ? ” Palin asked host Lawrence Kudlow on CNBC sometime before her nomination .
“ I ’m used to bein ’ very productive and workin ’ real hard in an administration and we want to make sure that that ‘ V.P. ’ slot would be a fruitful type of position . ”
And , I think , they find her acceptably “ real , ” because Palin ’s not intimidating , and makes it clear that she ’s subordinate to a great man .
That ’s the worst thing a woman can be in this world , is n’t it ?
Intimidating , which appears to be synonymous with competent .
It ’s the kiss of death , personally and politically .
But should n’t a woman who is prepared to be commander in chief be intimidating ?
Because of the intelligence , experience , talent and drive that got her there ?
If she is n’t , at least on some level , off - putting , if her presence inspires national commentary on breast - pumping and babysitting rather than health care reform and social security , then something is seriously wrong .
If she does n’t elicit at least some degree of awe , then something is missing .
One of the worst poisons of the American political climate right now , the thing that time and again in recent years has led us to disaster , is the need people feel for leaders they can “ relate ” to .
This need is n’t limited to women ; it brought us after all , two terms of George W. Bush .
And it is n’t new ; Americans have always needed to feel that their leaders were , on some level , people like them .
But in the past , it was possible to fill that need through empathetic connection .
Few Depression - era voters could “ relate ” to Franklin Roosevelt ’s patrician background , notes historian Doris Kearns Goodwin .
“ It was his ability to connect to them that made them feel they could connect to him , ” she told me in a phone interview .
The age of television , Goodwin believes , has made the demand for connection more immediate and intense .
But never before George W. Bush did it quite reach the beer - drinking level of familiarity .
“ Now it ’s all about being able to see your life story in the candidate , rather than the candidate , with empathy , being able to relate to you . ”
There ’s a fine line between likability and demagoguery .
Both thrive upon manipulation and least - common - denominator politics .
These days , I fear , this need for direct mirroring — and thus this susceptibility to all sorts of low - level tripe — is particularly acute among women , who are perhaps reaching historic lows in their comfort levels with themselves and their choices .
Just look at how quickly the reaction to Palin devolved into what The Times this week called the “ Mommy Wars : Special Campaign Edition . ”
Much of the talk about Palin ( like the emoting about Hillary Clinton before her ) ultimately came down to this : is she like me or not like me ?
If she ’s not like me , can I like her ?
And what kind of child care does she have ?
“ This election is not about issues , ” Rick Davis , John McCain ’s campaign manager said this week .
“ This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates . ”
That ’s a scary thought .
For the takeaway is so often base , a reflection more of people ’s fears and insecurities than of our hopes and dreams .
We ’re not likely to get a worthy female president anytime soon .
There is a surreal aspect to the entire debate .
Less than two years ago , OPEC cut production by 1.5 million barrels a day to keep prices from slipping below $ 55 a barrel .
Now Venezuela and Iran want the group to keep prices from dropping below $ 100 a barrel .
They have tasted what $ 145 - a - barrel oil tastes like just in July , and they thought it was good .
OPEC meets tomorrow and the betting is that it will do little to alter the cartel 's output .
With prices falling , the group , which provides about 40 percent of the world 's petroleum , sees little need to boost production .
Yet prices are still so high that it would be politically difficult for OPEC 's mightiest member , Saudi Arabia , to heed the calls of the group 's price hawks to cut production much to keep prices comfortably over $ 100 a barrel .
But the fact of the matter is that it's hard to imagine that the world can afford these prices for a protracted period of time .
In the first seven months of the year , OPEC countries have received more revenues than they did all of last year .
As many economists in the United States have noted , this is inflating the U.S. trade deficit , undercutting the U.S. dollar and sapping the economy of money that would otherwise have eased spending burdens of households or gone into badly needed savings and investment .
Saudi Arabia is the key player at OPEC meetings .
It has the most latitude to increase , or cut , production .
It raised output in recent months , pumping an extra half million barrels a day or so .
Many Saudi policy makers have long fretted that high prices could force consuming countries to find alternatives ranging from biofuels to electric cars .
In OPEC meetings , this is called " demand destruction . "
Or as one - time Saudi oil minister Zaki Yamani famously said , the stone age did n't end because the world ran out of stones , a reference to the possibility that people might stop using oil even if oil were still around .
More recently , the Saudi King Abdullah said he would like to see prices come down under $ 100 a barrel .
They are n't far off now , closing Friday at $ 106 , down almost 30 percent from the $ 147 high in early July .
Yet perspectives have changed in OPEC and the gap between pricing doves and hawks has narrowed .
Even Saudi oil officials see burgeoning demand in places like China and India as helping set a floor to world demand , and they too have seen that the world can tolerate much higher oil prices than anyone thought sustainable just a couple of years , or a few months ago .
News reports have said that Saudi Arabia , which boosted output over the summer , is already trimming back slightly .
But slight actions are probably all we 'll see .
There were plenty of hints about OPEC 's outlook in a report issued last month .
It suggested that the organization was leaning more toward trimming output than raising it .
" Risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside , " the group said .
" With current OPEC production well above the expected demand for OPEC crude , there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories . "
Recognizing weak demand in industrialized countries , the group 's analysts said that " The demand for OPEC crude in 2008 is estimated to average 32.1 million barrels a day , a decline of 0.1 million barrels a day over the previous year .
In 2009 , the demand for OPEC crude is expected to average 31.3 million barrels a day or 0.7 million barrels a day lower than in 2008 . "
Forecasts among U.S. analysts continue to be all over the map .
Some forecast year end prices around $ 80 or $ 90 a barrel .
Others say oil prices will bounce back to $ 150 or so .
For now , the ball is in the Saudi royal court .
CNN : GOP Oprah boycott not hurting ratings David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 15 , 2008
Print This Email
This A group of Republican women is angry that ultra-popular talk show host Oprah Winfrey , who has endorsed Barack Obama for president , wo n't invite GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to speak to her show 's massive audience .
Oprah 's backing Obama is unprecedented , and since announcing her endorsement last year , the Chicago - based host has said she wo n't open her show to any presidential candidates .
Obama 's only appearances on the show came in 2005 and 2006 , before he 'd officially launched his presidential campaign .
Both prominent Chicagoans , Oprah and Obama knew each other before he became a nationally known politician .
She said it was that connection that led her to endorse him but pledged not to use her show or magazine to promote his candidacy .
" I made the decision that I have the right to do it as an American citizen , " she said last year .
" But I will not use my platform .
I can use my own personal voice . "
That reasoning is n't good enough for the Florida Federation of Republican Women , which has launched a nationwide boycott of all things Oprah .
It does n't seem to be working .
An Oprah spokesperson tells CNN the show 's ratings have been climbing all year and issues of O , the host 's magazine , continue to fly off newsstand shelves .
Oprah raised millions for Obama and campaigned with the Illinois senator in the months leading up to the Democratic primaries , but her visibility on the campaign trail began to fade as the campaign wore on and even once Obama emerged as the nominee .
One observer suggested that Obama was hurting Obama 's favorability ratings even if she continued to snag viewers .
Some Hillary Clinton backers were upset that Oprah -- an icon for many women -- would choose Obama over the first woman with a real shot at getting to the White House .
The Palin supporters calling for the boycott seem to be targeting the same emotions .

Just 18 Votes Separate Candidates in Circuit Judge Race Where Votes Are Said Lost in Re-tally on Sequoia Optical - Scan Voting Systems
' Severe Repercussions , Dire Consequences for November Election and All Elections , ' Says Broward County Election Supervisor Candidate ...
Brad Friedman Byon
8/30/2008 , 1:52 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman , from Denver , CO ...
16,632 votes are unaccounted for in a Palm Beach County election recount following last Tuesday 's state primary , according to Ellen H. Brodsky , non-partisan candidate for Supervisor of Elections in Broward County and a long - time Election Integrity advocate .
The machine recount was completed early Saturday morning in the Circuit Court race between Judge Richard Wennet and challenger William Abramson , Brodsky reports via email .
The machine recount was completed at 4:30 am , in the race in which Wennet and Abramson were separated by just 18 votes in the initial machine tally .
Palm Beach County recently changed voting systems again , moving from faulty touch - screen voting systems to --- apparently --- faulty optical - scan paper - ballot systems made by Sequoia Voting Systems , Inc. [ PDF ] .
The still - unexplained " disappearance " of votes in the machine recount " has severe repercussions , " Brodsky wrote in an email alert this afternoon describing the re-scan of some 90,000 ballots .
" With 16,632 less votes on summary report , " she writes , it " portends dire consequences for the November election and all elections . "
The question remains as to how many votes were lost in other races on the same ballot which were not included in last night 's re-tally .
Florida state law disallows hand - counting of paper ballots which have already been counted by machine , other than in special circumstances .
We 'll see if this ends up being one of those circumstances .
Theoretically , a hand - count would determine the correct totals for the race , where the machine - count has misreported totals .
[ UPDATE : Palm Beach
Post reports the machine recount was close enough to allow for a hand - count of over votes and undervotes .
See more in the update at end of this article . ]
Sequoia 's voting machines have seen notorious failures of late , including lost votes and other problems , around the country ...
Most recently , their touch - screen systems misreported vote totals on Super Tuesday in New Jersey .
That , after some of their machines refused to start up at all that day , causing embarrassment when Gov. John Corzine 's attempt to vote was delayed while the machines were down for trouble - shooting .
Vote - counting problems have become notorious across the Sunshine State since 2000 and continuing through last Tuesday 's state primary .
Earlier this week , news broke of thousands of ballots not counted by the Diebold voting systems in Sarasota County , which has also recently switched to paper ballots following the still - unexplained loss of some 18,000 votes on ES&S touch - screen voting systems in a 2006 Congressional race that was ultimately decided by just 369 votes .
Some 10,000 ballots were counted by hand this week in Sarasota , following this most recent failure .
Major problems on Diebold systems were also seen in Hillsborough and Brevard counties this week as well .
Last week , Diebold finally admitted that all of their voting systems , used in 34 states across the nation , lose votes during upload to the tabulator , even though no warning message is given for the loss to system administrators .
Ohio's Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner announced last month that she is suing Diebold over the problem voting systems .
[ NOTE :
We sat down with Brunner for an exclusive in - depth interview with her in Denver .
We 'll have that interview posted at The BRAD BLOG next week . ]
In 2000 , Volusia County Florida reported negative 16,022 votes for Presidential Candidate Al Gore , as tabulated on voting systems made by the company which would become Diebold Election Systems .
The unusual negative vote tally was never explained , but the discovery of the odd reported total led to Gore 's rescission of his earlier concession to George W. Bush on Election Night .
That race in Florida led to 36 protracted days of political fighting , in which Republicans were eventually successful in their bid to see the U.S. Supreme Court order the state 's ballots from being counted at all .
A post-election tally [ PDF ] by a media and academic consortium found that had all of the state 's ballots been counted , by any conceivable counting standard , Al Gore would have been named the winner in Florida , and thus , would have become the President of the United States .
[ Note : We 're on the road back from Denver , and may not be able to update this item until later tonight , at best , with any additional details . ]
UPDATE 9:50 pm PT : Palm Beach
Post reports varying numbers of note in the recount , including that " the candidates had lost 4,700 votes " on the " larger counting machines " said to be " more sensitive " .
Their report also says that 16,500 of the 90,000 ballots in the contest , which had been reported by the machines as either overvotes ( too many selections in the race ) or undervotes ( no selections in the race ) , were reviewed by hand :
After the machine recount , the candidates had lost nearly 4,700 votes .
But Cohen said there was no controversy because all of those ballots were to be reviewed by hand and counted .
The larger counting machines are more sensitive , he said , and reject more ballots .
( Those " larger counting machines " would be the high - speed optical - scanners used to count mail - in absentee ballots at county headquarters , rather than the precinct - based op - scan machines .
If they " are more sensitive " and lose more votes , that would seem to indicate that more absentee ballots are miscounted than those scanned at the polling places .
As most counties around the country use a similar system --- high - speed op - scanners for mail - in absentees --- does this indicate absentee ballots are counted at a lesser ( unequal ) rate than those counted at the precinct ? )
Two - person teams from the elections office , each watched by a supporter of one of the candidates , examined an estimated 16,500 ballots .
Those were ballots on which a voter did not check either candidate - called an undervote - or the vote was not clear enough to be picked up by the machines .
Attorney Darren Shull , a Wennet supporter , said he saw ballots on which the vote appeared clearly , and wondered why the counting machines did not register them .
" Sometimes you 're looking at it , going , ' Huh ? ' " Shull said .
" You do n't know why . "
Are those 16,500 ballots the ones referred to by Brodsky ?
Or are the 4,700 that the Post reports as " lost " during the high - speed machine re-tally ?
We 're trying to get more info from from Brodsky , but have yet to hear back on several follow - up questions .
We 'll do our best to continue to keep up even as we 're on the road out here ...

Clinton : I 'll do ' substantial ' work to get Obama elected David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had their dramatic display of party unity several months ago , but reports persisted of lingering hard feelings between the Democratic nominee and former presiden Bill Clinton .
The two finally met for lunch Thursday , while Obama was in New York observing the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks .
Clinton said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Obama this month as soon as he has some time away from his global anti-poverty initiative .
He remained vague when asked about specifics of his campaign trail involvement .
" I 've agreed to do a substantial number of things , whatever I 'm asked to do , " Clinton said .
The former president , who was the first Democrat to serve two terms in the White House since Franklin Delano Roosevelt , predicted Obama would win " pretty handily . "
" There , you can take it from the president of the United States .
He knows a little something about politics , " Obama said , before the two left to have lunch at Clinton 's Harlem office .
After their meeting , Obama 's and Clinton 's offices released the following joint statement .
 President Clinton and Senator Obama had a great conversation in Harlem today .
They discussed the campaign briefly , but mostly talked about how the world has changed since September 11 , 2001 .
" Sen. Obama praised the work of the Clinton Foundation around the world and President Clinton applauded Sen .
Obama 's historic campaign which has inspired millions around the country .

Gary McKinnon , the British hacker who broke into military computers looking for evidence of UFOs in the " biggest military hack of all time , " did so using his home computer and a 56 k modem .
I think we just lost our rights to complain about not having Japan - fast broadband .
Using his own computer at home in London , McKinnon hacked into 97 computers belonging to and used by the U.S. government between February 2001 and March 2002 .
McKinnon is accused of causing the entire U.S. Army 's Military District of Washington network of more than 2,000 computers to be shut down for 24 hours .
Using a limited 56 - kbps dialup modem and the hacking name " Solo " he found many U.S. security systems used an insecure Microsoft Windows program with no password protection .
He then bought off - the - shelf software and scanned military networks , saying he found expert testimonies from senior figures reporting that technology obtained from extra-terrestrials did exist .
At the time of his indictment , Paul McNulty , U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia , said : " Mr. McKinnon is charged with the biggest military computer hack of all time . "
Gorge or Diet : What Olympians Really Eat to Compete Some of the world 's most well - planned meals are served at the Beijing Olympics .
Aug. 14 , 2008  --
Standing tall on the podium -- lean , toned and bulging with pride -- Olympic medalists look like the pinnacle of self - discipline .
But Michael Phelps ' recent tabulation of his daily meals conjured up an image of reckless abandon : 2 pounds of pasta , an entire pizza , energy drinks , two cups of coffee , a five - egg omelet , a bowl of grits , three slices of French toast with powdered sugar , three fried - egg sandwiches with cheese and chocolate chip pancakes .
The account left many asking , what do Olympians really eat ?
If you 're on the Chinese rowing team , you might be eating bull penis soup for breakfast , as a London Time 's reporter described in February .
Elizabeth Applegate , Olympian nutrition consultant and director of sports nutrition at the University of California at Davis , said Phelps ' diet is far from thoughtless gorging .
Athletes in Beijing are eating some of the most artfully orchestrated meals in the world -- designed for their bodies , their sport and their cultural cuisine preferences .
Strategic Chocolate Chip Pancakes
American diver Chris Colwill , who placed fourth with his teammate Jevon Tarantino in the men's synchronized 3 - meter springboard Wednesday , is a big fan of Chinese food .
" Lately , I 've been really into dim sum , " he told ABCNews.com , referring to the southern Chinese food .
Colwill is competing for the third time in Beijing in his first Olympics .
He consumes at least 3,000 calories a day and works with a nutritionist at his home training center at the University of Georgia .
The average person should consume an average of 2,000 calories a day , or fewer , most nutritionists say .
An average Olympian consumes two to three times more than that amount per day .
On an intense training day , Phelps takes in 12,000 calories .
When Colwill heard the number , he was shocked .
" I ca n't image what 12,000 calories [ looks like ] .
That 's about eight meals a day .
Big meals . "
Applegate , who has consulted with Olympic athletes and their trainers for more than 20 years , said that somewhere within that smorgasbord of food that Phelps consumes , there 's enough protein , vitamins and nutrients to sustain him .
Beyond that , Phelps is just searching for pure calories , she said .
" He needs to eat calorie - rich food , and that 's what chocolate chip pancakes are , " Applegate said .
" I 'm not surprised .
Athletes eat like that all the time . "
Some athletes , that is .
Depending on the athletes ' size , sport or event , the meal planning can change drastically .
Applegate would guess there 's an entirely different Olympian dinner at the gymnastic team 's table .
" You could move and sit next to one of the gymnasts and see one - third of the calories , " she said .
While Phelps is a constant swimming machine , other types of athletes , such as divers like Colwill or swim sprinters , work through shorter , concentrated bursts of energy .
" Take a discus thrower :
They 're big .
They still require a lot of calories , but they are only going to take in 3,000 calories , " Applegate said .
Gymnasts , who are slender in size and work in similar short bursts of energy , have to pack daily nutritional needs into fewer calories .
" The gymnasts would know exactly what to eat , and be very precise , " said Applegate , who adds that female gymnasts would have to be extra strict .
In this case sex , not size , matters .
Pound for pound , women burn fewer calories then men do , simply by the difference in their bodies .
Applegate said that if a 140 - pound female athlete and a 140 - pound male athlete ran side by side , in sync , expending the same amount of energy , the female athlete would still burn 8 to 10 percent fewer calories .
" Is n't that a jip ? " Applegate said .
Taking into account the differences in sex , size , sport and event , the Olympic Village in Beijing had the task of providing an endless permutation of carefully designed meal options .
6,000 Seats , 6,000 Meals , 6,000 Athletic Machines
" They 're not operating in the dark .
They know what 's going on , " Applegate said .
The Olympic Village in Beijing put forth a tremendous effort to feed the Olympians -- satellite positioning systems to monitor food delivery to the compounds , bilingual dietitians to confirm that international food requests were followed , a big dining room seating up to 6,000 athletes , and special menus to accommodate cultural cuisine preferences and religious dietary laws .
" They do n't just offer chicken tenders and fries , " Applegate said .
" Going in , there was a concern , but once you get settled in , you realize it 's not so bad .
It 's good to have the staff and the USOC there for us , " Colwill said .
" It 's nice to have Americanized food every now and then , but the food choices have been great . "
Colwill , who sticks to a high - protein diet with plenty of lean chicken , is satisfied with the food at the Olympic Village .
" There 's a Mediterranean section , international section , Asian section .
They 've got all kinds of variety .
You could wind up eating everything .
That could be a problem , but I try my best not to put so much on my plate , " Colwill said .
Recovery Meals Just as Important As Pre-Game Calories
Yet many of the athletes do n't exactly line up high - school - cafeteria style and grab what they want .
On the contrary , some Olympic teams plan their meals as part of an elaborate performance agenda .
" Meals are typically pretty specific .
They sort of go through an approval process by the staff ... but not like everybody has two green beans and an exact portion of steak , " said Dr. Michael Terry , one of several team doctors for the U.S. men's volleyball team and the men 's ski team .
He is a professor of surgery at the University of Chicago but acts as a general physician for the teams he follows .
Instead , the three square meals and snacks fed to the volleyball team focus on a strategic preparation : high - energy carbs through pasta or vegetables before a game , and high - protein meals with selections such as steak , other red meat or chicken .
" They need to be constantly looking forward to the next match , " Terry said .
" The recovery meals and the recovery drinks are just as important as their pregame meals . "
Even sleep becomes strategic .
" We will issue the guys different sleep regulations and schedules -- when they should see the sun and when they should n't so they can get acclimated , " Terry said .
Yet Terry said helpful planning does n't mean the physicians and trainers become babysitters .
" The guys are professionals , so they know what the deal is , " he said .
" Nobody 's twisting their arm at the dinner table . "
ABC News ' Lauren Cox reported from New York , and Jo Ling Kent from Beijing .
Great investors surely have investing secrets that they use to build wealth , but they are open secrets .
Anyone can find out what the greats do and copy them to have success in wealth creation .
And many of the so - called secrets are simply common sense principles .
For instance , investing in a company with consistent earnings is the sensible thing to do and one that has helped Warren Buffet earn his millions .
Taking care to invest in old and well - established companies is another .
Many investors run into trouble by jumping on the bandwagon of some new company that sparkles for a while then quickly dies out leaving a pile of rubble rather than money .
Another common sense principle that is applied to both real estate and shares by the great investors is to never pay too much for an investment .
Generally the more you pay , the less you get back as many real estate investors have found out to their cost .
Warren Buffet also believes in concentration rather than diversification .
When he buys a company he typically buys around 80 % , and keeps it .
Another secret investment principle Buffet favours that has helped him with his wealth creation is to buy companies with experienced managers and keep them on to do what they do best – run the company .
Buffet rarely interferes with the running of the companies he buys .
He simply compliments the managers on the job they are doing .
Buffet ’s talent is to see where good investments are and buy them , not run the company .
Read
Checking out the management philosophy of a successful business is another secret .
Knowing that the manager cares more about the company than the price it brings has worked for Buffet .
He studies the character of the company managers before making a decision to buy the company .
Finding a company whose manager is frugal and cares about costs is an important secret of great investors .
They know that one way to build wealth is to spend less and managers who run a consistently tight ship are the successful ones .
While some investors feel that a younger manager will enhance a company ’s ability to move with the times and make more money , Buffet prefers to retain the successful manager well past the legal retiring age .
He considers that experience is the key word when it comes to managers .
Setting high standards and keeping them may seem unnecessary to many , but it has seen many great investors build wealth where others fail .
We would do well to take on board some of these secrets for ourselves .
Think of it as a comic rendering of Saturday night ’s quotes of the day .
Pretty funny — you ’ll laugh , more than once — but not as gratifying as it would have been if they ’d zeroed in on the smearmongering .
As it is , all you get is the incest line at the beginning and then the rest is mostly an excuse to goof on neurotic Manhattan liberals for being neurotic Manhattan liberals , with Palin as a handy peg .
Fortunately for American democracy , one - sidedness is not the case ( at least in theory ) .
We have what are called checks and balances .
This is essential so as to restrict any of the three branches of government from monopolizing resources with their own self - interests and agendas .
This is not to say that the judicial , executive , and legislative branches are necessarily reactionary or adversarial vis -à - vis each other .
But it is to say that human self - interest , if left unchecked , can wreak havoc on society at large .
Just read any world history book and see how human greed , whether intentional or not , can hurt the self as well as hurt others .
Ergo , checks and balances allow different perspectives to be acknowledged in an existential / phenomenological paradigm where all points of view are treated with consideration in an egalitarian way .
Unfortunately for men , however , there is still little in terms of checks and balances within the politics of gender discourse ( despite the men 's movement being around since E. Belfort Bax published his 1913 tome The Fraud of Feminism ) .
The explicit and salient reason for the unchecked power of women and / or feminism seems to be manifested in the full range of double standards that have been discussed at length by many courageous men ’s rights activists .
The question of import to be drawn from all this , however , is this :
What psychological forces ( implicit or explicit ) sustain the anti-male double standard in society ?
I believe there are at least eleven cognitive biases ( not including argument - biases such as " poisoning the well , " " appeal to emotion , " " straw - man " etc ) that have been acknowledged over the years in the field of psychology and beyond that can be applied here as forces that help sustain this anti-male double standard .
Two of these ( misandry and patriarchy - theory ) deal directly with men , and the rest are more general biases that can still be applied to men .
I feel it is of import to add that I feel it is very rare that any of these 11 anti-male biases are adequately discussed in the mainstream politically - correct university milieu .
Misandry : Misandry ( general hatred of men ) can certainly cloud a person 's cognitive logic , and make it easier to endorse , perpetuate , and justify anti-male double standards .
Even in situations when people deny any hatred of men , some of this anger may be implicit .
Semantic bias : Semantic bias occurs whenever language is skewed and differentially presents some groups as superior over others .
Some feminists have alerted us to the ways in which the English language can at times be one - sided and biased to women ( terms like mankind ) .
Less common , however , is discourse on what words / phrases can be anti-male ( such as man- slaughter or men- at - work which both imply that it is only men who experience undesirable afflictions like death and work ) .
This semantic bias is also manifested in how the rules of gender discourse leave men at the door .
It is indeed interesting to note that the term " masculism " is seldom acknowledged as a real term in mainstream media ( one exception is Wikipedia ) .
Similarly , the term is flagged by some , if not all , computer spell checkers .
This is not to say that the word is seldom used .
However , the term is usually esoteric only to men's rights coteries who have the inclination to challenge feminist assumptions from “ behind the scenes ” or “ behind closed doors . ”
Ipso - facto , the term is relegated to a men ’s rights movement that seems to take place from afar or under the radar of the university and media " thought - police . "
The problem is that the very term “ feminism ” is sexist ( at least on its own ) .
Feminism is a female word , with a feminine prefix ( fem-inism ) .
This can implicitly create the taciturn illusion that feminism = equality .
This is similar to how gender - feminists insist to define sexism in strictly female terms ( despite men obviously being one of the two sexes ) !
Perhaps from the beginning a term like “ gender-ism ” could have been used instead of “ feminism ” to study the restrictive forces of both the male and female gender roles .
This could have established academic checks and balances from the onset without perpetuating the male - perpetrator / female - victim dichotomy and the double - standards that burgeon therein .
In - group bias :
This is one of the more obvious biases , but it bears mention .
In - group bias can be defined as follows : “ the tendency to favor one ’s own group " ( Meyers , 2005 ) .
Another way this concept can be expressed is when a group takes credit for success while avoiding responsibility for failure .
In relation to anti-male bias , I believe that gender - feminists are the most prone to utilize this bias .
When they ignore issues like battered husbands , male suicide , male homelessness , male job injury , and unequal prison times for equal crimes ( or blame these issues on men ) , and at the same time endorse items like the “ Battered Women ’s Syndrome ” or the “ Violence Against Women Act , ” we see a “ shadowy ” in - group - bias emerge which certainly reinforces anti-male double standards .
There is more than a mere modicum of power to gain in the way that gender - feminists can monopolize on being the victim - class and allow themselves to be privy to its entitlements .
This is indicative of why the saying “ play the victim ” became an actual catch - phrase and political strategy while the phrase “ playing the perpetrator ” did not .
“ Victim Power ” is indeed a catch phrase of “ Princess - Syndrome . ”
Patriarchy theory :
When vague constructs like “ oppression ” or “ privilege ” are measured with only one yardstick ( and taught as fact ) by gender - feminists ( or other patriarchy theorists ) , bias will inevitably emerge .
Patriarchy theory uses physical properties ( pay - gap , male physical strength , etc. ) as the only criteria , standard , or context upon which to measure gender - related depravity .
But a masculist , evolutionary , or existential theory may suggest that the most accurate yardstick to measure “ oppression ” with is one that ascertains the actual level of true happiness between the genders .
Sometimes “ oppression ” may indeed be best measured by asking who smiles more or who actually dies more prematurely .
“ Power ” and “ privilege ” are not only vague constructs , but very abstract ones with different meanings for different people .
In other words , we are powerful / privileged when we feel powerful and privileged , and other people are powerful / privileged when we perceive them as being powerful or privileged compared to us .
Ergo , “ power ” seems to be indeed relative ( i.e. , in the eye of the beholder ) .
In a nutshell , patriarchy - theory not only reinforces the anti-male double standard , but it attempts to justify it .
When patriarchy - theory , in - group bias , and misandry interact anti-male bias may be even more likely .
Correspondence bias ( also known as the fundamental attribution error ) :
This can be defined as follows :
" The tendency to focus on the role of personal causes and underestimating the impact of situations on other people 's behavior " ( Brehm , Kassin , & Fein , 2005 ) .
Correspondence bias , in the context of anti-male bias , means that some people ( especially gender - feminists ) may be more prone to blame negative societal conditions on men's dispositions while ignoring the situations that can make men act out in negative ways .
For example , I believe that sometimes people tend to view female prisoners not in terms of them being bad people , but more in terms of how bad situations made them that way ( a sympathetic view ) .
With male prisoners , however , society may tend to view them not as products of a bad environment , but rather as bad products themselves ( an unsympathetic view ) .
It is as if the nature / nurture debate is applied differently to men and women for political gain .
Heuristics ( availability and representative ) :
The availability heuristic can be defined as follows : " a cognitive rule that judges the likelihood of things in terms of their availability in memory .
If instances of something come readily to mind , we presume it to be commonplace " ( Myers , 2005 ) .
Likewise , the representative heuristic can be defined as follows : " the tendency to presume , sometimes despite contrary odds , that someone or something belongs to a particular group if resembling ( representing ) a typical member " ( Meyers , 2005 ) .
In the context of men ’s rights , the availability heuristic can occur when universities and the media play up all the violence that males do via hyperbole and exaggeration .
“ Rape hysteria ” is a common example of this .
This not only creates unrealistic fear and anxiety in women but it also lends itself to the representative heuristic where men are stereotyped as domineering , power - oriented , and feeling - less antagonists .
Insofar that the media portrays males in a negative way that shadows the actual base - rate statistics of male behavior this is an indicator that mental heuristics are being used in a biased manner that help perpetuate the male - perpetrator / female - victim dichotomy and the double - standards therein .
Biases resulting from cognitive dissonance : Cognitive dissonance theory can be defined as : " The theory that holding inconsistent cognitions arouses psychological tension that people become motivated to reduce " ( Brehm , Kassin , & Fein , 2005 ) .
In other manner of speaking , we are sometimes motivated to justify our " negative " behaviors in a way that will alleviate guilt or anxiety resulting from our inconsistent value - system .
For example , when we do something we regret but intellectually justify the decision to preserve our sense of psychological safety we may be guilty of cognitive dissonance ( the concepts of " sweet - lemons " or " sour - grapes " are well - known examples of cognitive dissonance theory ) .
In addition , the well - known Milgram Shock Experiment and Zimbardo Prison Study are classic examples of social psychology that reveal how “ mean - spirited ” feelings , thoughts , and behaviors are potentially justified by people via certain forms of self - serving cognitive appraisal processes .
In the context of men's rights , gender - feminists ' use of patriarchy - theory may indeed be indicative of a cognitive - dissonance bias .
The notion of patriarchy itself can indeed be used as a way to alleviate any residual guilt ( or cognitive dissonance ) that would normally be associated with other forms of bigotry .
To put it more simply , few of us want to acknowledge ourselves as being sexist or racist in any way as these are aversive terms .
But gender - feminists can alleviate this discomfort by intellectually justifying their feelings and behaviors vis -à - vis men .
This can essentially give them carte blanche to engage in male - bashing and utilize anti-male double standards without guilt or remorse !
Just world phenomenon :
This " bias " can be defined as follows : " the tendency of people to believe the world is just and that people therefore get what they deserve and deserve what they get " ( Meyers , 2005 ) .
Applied to men's rights , this bias occurs when people believe that men ( as a class ) deserve negative treatment under the law ( or elsewhere ) because of their own shortcomings .
Common examples include when people have little sympathy for the male - only draft by saying that “ men start wars ” or when people have little sympathy for prison rape because “ prisoners deserve to be punished anyway . ”
The Just world hypothesis may also lend itself to entitlement dependency in some women , because “ good people ” are seen to deserve more than “ bad people ” ( which may also help explain the materialistic spending gap and the societal acceptance of male death and disposability in general ) .
Insofar that people believe in the presumed moral - superiority of women compared to men , and use that belief to reinforce double standards , they are biased from a just world phenomenon mindset .
Behavioral confirmation :
This can be defined as follows : " A type of self - fulfilling prophecy whereby people 's social expectations lead them to behave in ways that cause others to confirm their expectations " ( Myers , 2005 ) .
In relation to men's rights , this bias may in fact reinforce anti-male double standards .
For example , when men are expected ( and treated ) by society to be masculine , unfeeling , chivalrous , and non-complaining this may indeed elicit the expected masculine behavior and prevent men from taking action to fight against the double standards against them .
Confirmation bias :
This can be defined as follows :
" The tendency to seek , interpret , and create information that verifies existing beliefs " ( Brehm , Kassin , & Fein , 2005 ) .
In the context of men's rights , this bias may be especially relevant to gender - feminism .
Insofar that gender - feminists utilize the evidence that supports patriarchy - theory but then disregard the facts that do not support it they are guilty of confirmation bias .
An example of this is when they disregard all the literature about male victims of domestic violence because it does not support their belief system , i.e. , patriarchy - theory , whose dictum declares males as an oppressor class .
Also , some gender - feminists also use the correlation that most prisoners are men in attempts to justify the premise that men are naturally " more violent " than women .
But alas , correlations do not imply causality , and there may be other forces ( such as situational pressures ) acting on men that lead to disparities such as the prison ratio .
Learned helplessness :
This can be defined as follows : " A phenomenon in which experience with an uncontrollable event creates passive behavior toward a subsequent threat to well being " ( Brehm , Kassin , & Fein , 2005 ) .
To put it another way , this biased way of thinking refers to when a person ( or group ) learns to feel helpless ( lacking control or self - efficacy ) even in situations where there really are resources indicative of control and mastery over negative situations .
Ironically , people that suffer from learned helplessness can actually oppress themselves via keeping themselves down .
Vis -à - vis men's rights , the victim - dictum of patriarchy - feminists indeed may be a manifestation of learned helplessness , especially when women are taught that they are powerless victims of men .
Insofar that women actually believe patriarchy - theory ( i.e. , that they are powerless when they really do have resources of mastery ) , they are biased into a learned helplessness mindset .
This reinforces anti-male double standards by putting an over - abundance of emphasis on the male - perpetrator / female - victim dichotomy .
This concludes what I believe are eleven of the most relevant cognitive biases that help sustain the anti-male double standard , which in turn creates a lack of checks and balances in academic gender politics .
As discussed , I believe that many of these are used diligently by gender - feminists who practice patriarchy - theory .
However , to say that it is only gender - feminists who fall prey to these biased cognitive appraisal processes is presumptuous .
I believe that many of these are also practiced by people who do not actively identify with gender - feminism or patriarchy - theory ( and perhaps never heard of these things ) .
In other manner of speaking , I believe that society in general and as a whole is very susceptible to many of these biases against men .
Insofar that we are a society that does not endorse sexism , it may prove to be a pragmatic idea to look at the extent to which we perpetuate anti-male double standards via these forms of bias .

" By the pricking of my thumbs , something wicked this way comes . "
This line from Shakespeare 's play , " Macbeth , " comes to mind when we consider the future of America as we watch our government continue to take on debt after debt after inane debt , heaping more and more responsibility for the financial obtuseness of its privileged elite on its hapless peon taxpayers , profligately spending , borrowing , bailing out and inflating us into some sort of nightmarish , moral hazard oblivion .
Welcome to our new Banana Republic , a country that is now characterized by nonstop hyperinflation , bailouts and moral hazard - and which will soon decline into another Great Depression .
The nationalization of Fannie and Freddie has set us on a path from which there can be no return , carving out for us a much wider and deeper swath of financial death and destruction of a magnitude never dreamed of by even the most pessimistic among us .
Our economy is now in a temporary state of suspended animation by use of an economic act of smoke and mirrors , with the Sword of Damocles waiting overhead , waiting to chop us into tiny pieces .
The implications are dire .
And worse yet , this has all been planned for a while now , having been decided by the Illuminati soon after they watched their precious system burn to the ground right before their eyes a year ago in August .
Hence , you heard Goldman Sachs pronounce late last year : " Short Gold for 2008 . "
They knew this was coming last year , because these evil reprobates planned it to happen that way .
They knew the jig was up when their subprime plot was exposed by analyst Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer & Co .
They knew the implosion of Fannie and Freddie would happen eventually when the fraudulent mortgages started to go bad , but it happened far sooner than they had wanted or expected , and caught them with their pants down .
So , what was supposed to be a future plan to merge our mortgage lending system into their growing corporatist , fascist , financial structure , was moved from the back burner to the front burner , and now you all see the results in spades .
What we may be witnessing here is a combination of internecine warfare between American and European branches of the Illuminati , mixed in with financial warfare between countries that are not yet totally owned and controlled by the Illuminati , like China and Russia , and those countries which are under the Illuminist yoke , like the US , Canada , Europe and Japan .
Note that the Middle East countries like to play both ends to the middle , by pitting the Europeans against the Americans , or Illuminist dominated nations against non-Illuminist nations , which often adds clouds of confusion to events going down on the international front .
The European Illuminists are livid with their American counterparts , who have systematically weakened the dollar to shore up the trade deficit by making European exports more expensive after dumping hundreds of billions worth of fraudulent real estate derivatives into the European sector , derivatives which continue to implode at an ever - accelerating rate and which may act as a catalyst to lead Europe into depression as well .
Their gripe on the derivatives is legitimate , but they know the dollar should have weakened long ago against the euro , so they are blowing smoke about dollar weakness and the American Illuminists know it .
Nevertheless , the European Illuminists are demanding , by way of apology for the derivatives debacle , that the dollar be strengthened to save their staggering economies from imploding , and that the GSE debt which they own a lot of , especially via their OPEC clients , be nationalized to ensure payment when Fannie and Freddie implode .
They know that the final vaporization of Fannie and Freddie is now only a question of " when , " not " if . "
The Japanese are caught in the middle between the Americans and the Europeans who want revenge , and their economy is being destroyed because of it .
While the Japanese are benefiting from the GSE bailout because they own lots of GSE bonds , the weakening of the euro and the dollar against the yen is destroying their export economy and the yen carry trade and leading them into depression as well .
And then there are the non-Illuminist nations who have lots of dollar - denominated treasuries and agencies as well , bought with trade surpluses made possible by artificially lowering the value of their currencies against the dollar through illegal currency manipulations .
This has made them very powerful economically , and has greatly helped to power up their economies , especially Russia and China .
The Illuminati are now picking fights with them in poorly executed attempts to embroil them in pointless , expensive and what they hope will be unwinnable wars .
The purpose of these bogus , false - flag conflicts is to reduce the dollar reserves and drain the power of non-Illuminist nations , thus leveling the playing field .
That playing field is now out of kilter on account of the doltish , bonehead , Illuminist schemes to implement free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing , and both legal and illegal immigration .
Such schemes have been used in a pathetic attempt to improve the prospects for world government , but have instead greatly hindered the efforts to establish world government by weakening the Illuminist centers of power vis-à - vis the non-Illuminist centers of power .
These non-Illuminist nations have undoubtedly threatened to burn the US to the ground , not via a nuclear war , but via hyperinflation to be unloaded on the US by the sale and repatriation of its treasuries and its agencies , and by the refusal to finance its ever - burgeoning deficits by shunning future purchases of these instruments .
They have threatened to turn off the credit spigot and bring the US economy to a screeching halt , thus leading it on a short path to deep depression , if the US continues to weaken the dollar , and fails to make good on its agency paper which would otherwise be vaporized by the subprime fraud .
They are also sending a message about the bogus , false - flag wars and conflicts that the Illuminists are trying to pick with them , and Russia has threatened to start a new Cold War , if necessary .
It is hard to sympathize with the Russians and Chinese after what they did in the aftermath of WWII , but nevertheless these endless wars for profit and geopolitical power have got to stop before we end up burning the earth to a cinder in a senseless world war of self - extermination .
The Illuminati will likely get their world government all right , once the earth has been reduced to a toxic , uninhabitable , burning lump of fused atomic elements .
Congratulations , morons , if and when that happens .
So the Illuminati have been forced by these circumstances to re-strengthen the dollar , and to bail out the GSE bondholders .
They made the other nations wait until the time was right , meaning that they wanted to implement this appeasement at a time of their choosing , the objective being to make America look strong economically right before elections to keep their incumbent henchmen in power .
They also managed to wedge in an oil / food / commodity profit extravaganza for the tanking fraudsters along the way , with a nice little temporary trade deficit reduction thrown in for good measure via the weakened dollar .
Hence , just before elections , the dollar has been pushed up , and the GSE 's have been nationalized .
This is what they get for making us into a debtor nation in a foolish attempt to sacrifice their base of power on the alter of world government .
They thought they could do this while maintaining the balance of power .
We have news for them .
They have failed utterly .
The destruction to their power base is not the controlled demolition they had hoped for to push us into a corporatist fascist system
All they have managed to do is destroy their base of power , and now they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off , fomenting wars , conflicts and other schemes , while appeasing the many nations they have angered and bloodied along the way , in a pathetic attempt to restore the balance of power .
Gold and silver had to be crushed , otherwise their moves would have been exposed as financially unwise and toxic , and the Fed would look like an institution of imbeciles .
Oil and commodities had to be tamed in the process as would happen in any case by virtue of a strengthening dollar , and this has helped them to give the sheople the appearance of improvement on the inflation front to benefit incumbents , even though inflation is still raging .
Naturally , the stock markets had to be supported as well in keeping with the ruse , and the PPT henchmen must be exhausted from the unbelievable manipulations we have witnessed over the past few months .
The elitist have gone completely berserkers with the latest run of market fraud , and they are going to pay for this raging fraud later when the class action lawsuits are implemented and the discovery exposes their machinations .
Look at the open interest on the USDX futures .
The previous record during a dollar rally of 58,595 contracts was set on December 14 .
This Thursday , the USDX futures posted a gargantuan 94,021 contracts , shattering the previous all - time high by 35,426 contracts , an increase of more than 60 % .
That is how desperate they are .
Oil has briefly dipped below 100 , to 99.99 , and the dollar spiked through 80 to a high of 80.395 , and now suddenly , as we predicted might happen , everything has reversed and gold and silver are starting to rally again .
Let 's see if this is this new trend is going to continue , or if the Illuminati have some October surprises in store for us to benefit incumbents .
Keep loading up , because the prices you are getting now on gold , silver and their related shares will never be seen again .
If you do , you will be a very happy camper in 2009 .
It is obvious that the FDIC lacks the capital to back up its claims of the rescue of the American banks .
IndyMac was a $ 10 billion problem , but the other ten failures this year were much smaller .
This , like in the instance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , will cause our government soon to bail out the FDIC with funds that do not exist .
They will have to create more debt in order to accommodate our banking system pushing government further into the hole .
Incidentally , the Federal Reserve faces the same problem .
No one has the money to meet the guarantees .
That is what we just found out in the cases of Fannie and Freddie .
Our government will have to sell more bonds to accommodate these financial demands and they become the obligation of American taxpayers .
That is immediate monetization of those funds , which will be highly inflationary .
Just to give you a prospective of banking health , they have already written off more than $ 100 billion .
They made $ 5 billion in the second quarter down from $ 30 billion plus quarters in recent years .
The FDIC reports that the total assets of 8,451 institutions it insured fell to $ 13.30 trillion from $ 13.37 trillion in the first quarter , the largest drop since 1987 .
Most of the above losses were due to CDOs , SIVs and ABSs , plus the failure of loans and mortgage loans .
They do not reflect the deterioration of the financial condition of the bank ’s customer bases .
There are many who are not current on their loans and banks are starting to write off other loan losses .
As a result loan loss reserves are lower for the month and consecutive quarter leaving banks with 88.5 cents for every $ 1.00 in non-current loans .
Banks are lying about their financial positions .
They are hiding losses on and off balance sheets .
The bad FDIC list is n’t 117 , it is more like 2,000 but they wo n’t tell you that .
They lie about everything as well .
That is frightening but worse more frightening is the fact that the FDIC has one - cent in reserves for every dollar it is responsible for .
Worse yet , there are $ 4.1 trillion of uninsured deposits in banks .
That is in addition to $ 8.6 trillion covered by only one - cent per dollar .
If that does n’t frighten you , you are just plain dumb .
Then you look at Lehman ’s books and you find they are bankrupt and the South Korean government agrees with us .
Incidentally no one in the US media carried the government of South Korea ’s comments .
Half the investment banks , brokerage houses and insurance companies are insolvent .
Just wait – you will find out .
All we see is patchwork , smoke and mirrors and political expediency .
Lies , lies and more lies .
Iraq and Afghanistan continues and the possibility of a cold and hot war with Russia is a possibility .
After looking at the events of the past three months we believe the Cold War could be a put up job involving Russian collusion with the Illuminati .
We just do n’t know for sure yet .
The financial system is falling apart , which is part of the disintegration process .
All these other events are distractions to obfuscate the fact that the game is over .
It is only a question of when does the bottom fall out .
Follow our advice and get your excess capital out of banks , even brokerage houses are safer .
Buy gold and silver coins and shares and Swiss franc government bonds .
If you do not you may lose everything .
Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway has told its subsidiaries to stop insuring bank deposits above the amount guaranteed by the FDIC , which deals a major blow to the financial services industry as it tries to calm anxious customers .
Now what does that tell you ?
It tells us it is panic time , as Warren and his gang of traders run for the hills .
Their subsidiary KBS is one of only a handful of firms , which offer bank deposit guaranty bonds .
This shows you how worried Mr. Buffett is about future bank failures .
This is insurance beyond FDIC insurance for accounts over $ 100,000 .
At Columbian Bank and Trust , which went under , 610 accounts worth $ 46 million was covered by KBS and it caused them to lose money .
Buffett has no further confidence in the banking system , so he is pulling out .
That should be a lesson to those of you who have more money in banks than you need for current operations .
Now that American taxpayers have taken over Fannie and Freddie , Bill Gross is a seller .
He is telling people on CNBC that mortgage paper is an attractive investment , while he is a seller .
Don Coxe is chairman and CEO of Harris Trust in Chicago and is one of the most respected mainline investment authorities in the US .
We quote him here in regard to market manipulation by the US Treasury and the Fed .
“ This has done more damage to my personal wealth than anything in the last 20 years .
I have too much respect for how US authorities engineered the collapse in commodities , a move that was necessary to shore up the global financial system to be bitter .
My attitude is – goddamn it , they ’re good – it was brilliant . ”
This guy is mainstream and does n’t realize they have engineered a catastrophe .
There are no longer any free markets .
Lehman Brothers ’ losses were far more than expected and they may go under .
They failed to purge their balance sheet as Merrill Lynch did .
Richard Fuld released a convoluted , manipulated quarterly report filled with accounting chicanery that would make Mr. Ponzi proud .
The true write - down should have been $ 7.8 billion .
Business for the first nine months of the year fell 28 % , reflecting a rapid deterioration of their ability to conduct trading and investment banking .
Other houses are avoiding doing business with them .
Their commercial and residential mortgage paper of $ 50 billion is probably worth $ 25 billion , or more .
They want to sell 55 % of their investment management business , which is deteriorating as markets implode and investors leave the market .
If the Fed does not rescue Lehman they are toast .
S&P has re-rated Washington Mutual to negative from stable .
Debt market players are now assessing liquidation of WaMu and they believe that on a liquidation basis , best case , that debt holders are covered at slightly more than 60 % of the total amount of debt outstanding .
This means bankruptcy .
Move any accounts you have at WaMu out of there now .
The WSJ reports that 1,082 businesses and some individuals filed for Chapter 11 in August , up 38 % from July .
The average this year to date has been 745 .
Goldman Sachs in an effort to preserve capital and reduce exposure is telling hedge fund clients that the terms of current margin - lending agreements will have to be renegotiated when the current credit facilities expire .
Fitch says debt liabilities equal $ 1.6 trillion , or 11 % of GDP , with guarantees of $ 3.48 trillion , or 48 % of GDP after the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie .
The phony dollar rally will end and only one investment will remain gold and silver .
The dollar is way over - bought ( over manipulated ) , and gold and silver are way over - sold ( manipulated . ) the world is in deep trouble and there is only one place to be and that is in gold and silver related assets .
Ron Paul has rejected John McCain ’s appeal for his endorsement .
Paul said : “ the idea was that he would do less harm than the other candidate . ”
Bolivian President Evo Morales ordered the expulsion of the US Ambassador , Philip S. Goldberg , accusing him of fostering divisions in the Andean nation .
The drop in Phoenix home resale prices extended to 16 months in June and is approaching the record of 17 months of decline posted in the early 1990s .
Home prices fell 22.8 % from June 2007 .
It was the fourth monthly double - digit drop .
House prices in Fort Myers , Florida have fallen from $ 250,000 to $ 143,000 , which means , as I pointed out last month that they might be on the bottom price wise in that area .
An Iraq plan to award six no -bid contracts to Western oil companies has been withdrawn .
The companies were Exxon Mobil , Chevron , Shell , Total , BP and several smaller companies .
The deals under - mined the efforts of Kurds , Sunnis and Shiites to reach agreement on a hydrocarbon law and a revenue sharing agreement .
Bank of America agreed to buy back $ 4.5 billion in auction - rate securities from its customers nationwide in a settlement brokered by Massachusetts .
They neither admitted or denied the fraud allegations .
Its pay the investors and fines and again no one goes to jail .
Saudi Arabia has walked out of OPEC .
It said it would not honor the cartel ’s production cut .
It was tired of the rants of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and the oil minister of Iran .
Saudi said it would meet the market ’s demand .
If this situation continues OPEC is dead .
You can see the hands of the Illuminists all over this .
My Story with the Quran and Losing My Religion
" Without raising an eyebrow , I also read about Mohammed 's genocide of the Jewish tribe of Bani Quryza .
I had developed the concept that committing Islamic genocides against the Jews are no more disturbing to an Arab than slaughtering a herd of cattle . "
Introduction I was reluctant to write the story of my departure from Islam , because it lacks any of the moral elements of the kind mentioned in some of the touching testimonies published on the Internet .
I cannot claim that I was n't aware of Mohammed 's assassinations of his adversaries , because I read about it and accepted it as a justifiable action against the enemies of Allah .
Neither I can claim that I was n't aware of Mohammed 's pedophilic marriage to Aysha because I knew about it and accepted it as a perfectly normal practice during Mohammed 's time .
Without raising an eyebrow , I also read about Mohammed 's genocide of the Jewish tribe of Bani Quryza .
I had developed the concept that committing Islamic genocides against the Jews are no more disturbing to an Arab than slaughtering a herd of cattle .
My problem with Islam was mainly about the Quran which seemed to continuously require external human boasters in the form of interpretations and reinterpretations and endless justifications for much of the Quran 's inanities .
For a person with a free mind and good knowledge of the Arabic language , it is a fierce struggle with the mind to accept anything about the Quran ; its language , style and contents .
The Quran is only convincing for those whose knowledge in Arabic is nonexistent or poor , which is the case in the vast majority of Muslims including the Arabs .
It is especially true for those who are conditioned to read it year after year with only one thing in their minds - to earn hasanat that helps them to avoid hell fire .
For decades , I belonged to the second group , but although my starting point was the false assumption that the Quran is absolutely correct , as all Muslims do , I found it increasingly harder to accept all that collection of nonsense as my knowledge of Arabic developed over the years .
I am afraid that in my case , the language and logical absurdities of the Quran sent a louder alarm than the cruelties of Mohammed .
I rejected the Quran because I expected from Allah a much better book !
A Muslim Child Editor MA
Khan 's book ( Feb 2009 ) .

$ 7.96 | E.Book : $ 6:00 I was brought up in a small village in southern Syria in the early 1950s .
My parents were ordinary farmers with simple education .
Like the rest of the villagers , they performed the prayers and observed Ramadan fasting , which were more of a social and cultural duties .
Like the rest of the children in the village , I was taught to recite some of the Quranic verses by heart well before the school age .
It is still customary for the Middle Eastern parents to teach their young children to recite at least the first sura of the Quran , known as alfatiha .
Some parents begin to work on this from the moment their children start to talk !
That was my first encounter with Quran but by no means the only one ; the Quran was always around me whatever I did and wherever I went .
In the background , there was always that voice of the Quari who reads the Quran in a distinguished tajweed style that spreads an atmosphere of gravity and fear .
Such recitations seemed to go forever ; they came from the mosque 's loud speakers as well as from the radio and other audio devices .
No ceremony or gathering or activity could start , or finish , without reciting some verses from the Quran .
It is not only that I could hear the Quran all the time , but also I could see it all the time .
Wherever I turned my eyes I could see some verses of the Quran written in special calligraphy and framed on the walls of every house or every shop , even means of transport were decorated with Quranic verses .
I attended the village 's only school , which was an ordinary government school that had no particular emphasis on religious education .
In the beginning of every school year , children were handed the relevant books for that particular year .
Those books kept changing year after year except for one book - the Quran , which we called mushaf .
The Quran was a truly intimidating book to any child ; it was so intimidating to me that I could n't even express my feelings towards it .
Children dare not say anything negative about the Quran .
I even did n't dare to allow any negative thoughts about it to surface in my mind for the fear of extreme punishment from Allah .
I was taught to respect the book and do the Islamic washing ritual before even touching it , and never to hold it with my left hand .
I was told to kiss the book immediately after I hold it and touch it with my forehead as a sign of respect .
I was also taught of the special ritual of how to finish reading from the book .
I must n't stop reading before finishing the verse ; even if it was a long one .
After finishing the recitation I had to say in Arabic sadka allahu alazeem meaning ' Allah told the truth ' .
Then I was allowed to close the book respectfully and place it on top of the other books .
I was n't allowed to place any book on top of the Quran .
The Quran , a difficult book to read
It did n't escape my notice that the Quran was not a reader friendly book and certainly not a child friendly one , but I attributed that to the greatness of the book !
It had no pictures at all and no titles or paragraphs and not even spaces between its verses or chapters ; just a continuous writing from the beginning to the end .
Its verses cannot be considered full sentences or paragraphs ; they are just collections of words .
A sentence may start in a verse and end in another one !
If you take away the numbering of the verses , the whole Quran would look like one very long paragraph !
As I progressed in school , I became more talented in reading in Arabic , but I always had problems in reading the Quran .
My consolation was that I was not alone ; all the other children had the same problem .
The only chapters I read easily were the ones I already know by heart or the ones I read before many times .
Reading a new chapter was always a struggle , but , at the time , I never worked out why .
Even today , I still believe the Quran is not a particularly easy book to read for a first timer .
I do not think it is possible for a person to read a page from the Quran for the first time without making many mistakes .
The only way to read a chapter from the Quran without making mistakes is actually to read it many times before hand to become familiar with that chapter .
Once you become familiar with a chapter , reading it becomes more of a reminder of what you already know ( or nearly know ) by heart , .
The Muslim scholars have deliberately made the Quran a very difficult book to read .
The Quran is deliberately scribed in a way that violates all the writing protocols of the Arabic language .
The Muslim scholars are keen on this bizarre practice to ensure that the Quarn is well wrapped in a thick and dark coat of mystic ambiguity , which is the Quran 's fiercest defense .
How can anybody read a book where the standard punctuation marks are not used at all ?
To confuse the reader even more , the Quran contains what appear to be scriptural errors in every verse .
These deliberate violations to the Arabic writing protocols are peculiar to the Quran .
As an example the word salat ( prayer ) is deliberately written like salowat and the word zakat is written like zakowat .
Then every letter in every word is surrounded by coded pronunciation marks that are special to the Quran , to describe how that particular letter , in that particular position , should be pronounced .
To add to the confusion , those pronunciation marks often look like smaller versions of the normal Arabic letters .
Just in case all the above is not enough to confuse the reader , they add to every word the tajweed marks because every letter in the Quran has to be pronounced in a special way , according to its position in the word and sentence , to give a special sound effect , called tajweed , which is the Quran 's musical note , as we may put it .
The Quran , a difficult text to hear or understand Hearing and understanding the Quran were other tortures that my Islamic mind had to put up with .
I could listen to the radio for ten minutes and all the Quari has done was to read only few verses that he repeated many times with many pauses in between , which only helps to distract the listener .
Reading the interpretations or tafseer books is a true torture .
Some tafseer books , especially the modern ones , are massive in volumes and interpreting one word can take many pages .
Such excessive writings intimidate the ordinary readers , which explains why not many people bother to read them , but also follows an imbedded psychological definition for intellectuality as perceived by many Arabs .
There is a common misconception among many Arabs that a highly intellectual person is expected to produce highly complex writings .
Many Arabs think it is all right if ordinary people cannot understand the complex and lengthy writings of the highly intelligent authors .
Many Arabs may become impressed and speak highly of a scholar who writes many pages , or speak for hours explaining one word in the Quran , even though they did not understand a word of it !
Simplicity , as some Arabs understand it , is only for the simple people .
Al Mutanabbi ( 915-965 ) , one of the most talented Arab poets , reflected on such unusual misconception in one of his poems .
He described his intelligence by claiming that he says what he wants to say then sleeps well , but the rest of the world spends the night trying to understand it !
Almutanabbi said what some Arabs wanted to hear , and reflected a common cultural misconception .
To be fair to the man , all his poetry is clear and powerful , but he reminds us with another author who prides himself that he alone can understand what he writes .
" Q.3:7 . … but none knows its meanings except Allâh … . "
The Quran and black magic
The above intensive and continuous brainwashing process that starts from the moment a child is born to a Muslim family , results in a state where Muslims are unable to consider the Quran in an objective way .
The Muslims ' minds are never free when it comes to anything to do with the Quran .
The fact is that the Quran never looked to Muslims as normal , never sounded as normal and was never understood as normal .
Muslims have been conditioned to think of the Quran in a mystical environment , which reminds me with the way the magicians set the seen to perform their tricks .
The stage magicians do not do anything supernatural , but they make the audience believe the do .
They dress in dark colours and choose a dark background ; they distract their audience 's attention by using sound effects and by saying irrelevant words or making irrelevant movements .
Nowadays , black magic is a thriving business in the Middle East , as it had always been .
Black magicians perform their tricks by saying some very strange words that do not make any sense .
Such strange sayings have no meaning , even to the black magicians who compose them , but it is that ambiguity that serves to stun the confused client .
Mohammed has used a lot of these abracadabra - like words in the Quran and the trick seems to work on Muslims !
Many chapters in the Quran begin with a random arrangement of letters , sometimes even one letter !
Indeed , some entire verses are composed of only few randomly arranged letters !
If any person with sanity receives a ' clear ' message that reads H. M. h/ she would reject it but Muslims accept it and consider it a miracle !
As a matter of fact , the above two letters make the first verse of some suras in the Quran like sura 44 .
The interpretation books refer to this verse as a miracle !
Muslim scholars say that nobody knows the meaning of the verse except Allah , which raises the question of why send a message that cannot be understood by the receiver ?
The irony is that the very next verse in sura 44 ( i.e. 44:2 ) says " the clear book " !
Muslims have been reading such verses for centuries without making any sense of them , their only response is to say with amazement : subhan allah !
The use of strange words does not stop at using random letters ; the Quran did actually incorporate strange or foreign words in a similar fashion to the practice of the black magicians .
If we refer to the interpretations books to find the meanings for words like ababil ( 105:3 ) , sijjeel ( 105:4 ) , ghesleen ( 69:36 ) and dozens others we find that they do not agree to a clear meaning , which indicates that such words had no clear meanings to the early Arabs .
Mohammed probably used them just to make an impression .
The Arab black magicians are known to use foreign or distorted words or even coin new ones that have no meaning at all other than making an impression in the minds of their stupid audience .
A high school lesson I still vividly remember how one day in the high school , after the teacher spent a long time explaining the wonderful eloquence of the Quran , one of the pupils asked a question about one of the verses discussed that day , which was verse 49 : 9 " وإنْ طائفتان من المؤمنين اقتتلوا " 49:9 .
And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting , then ….
In the above verse , the Quran uses the word iktatalu ( translated above as fall to fighting ) in a place where it should be iktatala .
The question was why ?
I did n't think the pupil meant to be critical or had any other intentions more than asking a simple grammar question .
The question surprised me , but surprised the teacher more .
The teacher told the pupil off and warned him that he should be careful and respectful when it comes to discussing the Quran .
It was obvious to me that the teacher noticed the above error for the first time ; he struggled to find an answer and to demonstrate the non-existent eloquence of the verse .
He concluded that the early Arabs were amazed by the Quran , so who are we to disagree .
Verse 49 : 9 have an obvious grammatical error that cannot be denied or explained .
Muslim scholars go round and round , they twist the rules and change the meanings and go to any length to tell us that the mistake is not only correct , but also is a miracle !
This is the verse that was the subject of the question :
The Quran has many other grammatical errors , but the one that comes to my mind is in verse 22:19 because it is very similar error to the one above : " هذان خصمان اختصموا " 22:19 .
These two opponents dispute with each other ...
In the above verse , the Quran wrongly uses the word ikhtasamu ( translated above as dispute with each other ) in a place where it should be ikhtasama
It did n't matter to me , that day , how the teacher explained the error , I only wanted to know that there is an explanation .
I satisfied myself with the usual Islamic response that is designed to deter the mind from thinking too much about these things , which I still hear from Muslims nowadays .
If you bring up the issue to Muslims , you hear their classic response " Do you think all those great Arabs of the past did not notice this ?
Do you think you are the genius of your time ?
Are you sure you understand the verse well ? "
A liberal Muslim As a university student , I was a fairly open minded Muslim , as I preferred to describe myself .
The only prayers I used to perform were the Friday prayers but that was an acceptable average for university students those days .
By the time I started my university education I had already discovered many areas in Islam that I did n't feel comfortable with .
My response was to reject most of the ahadith and commit myself only to the Quran .
I considered myself to be a true logical Muslim who is truly convinced of Islam and not just inherited it , a claim that I regularly hear from Muslims nowadays .
Deep in my mind , I realized that Mohammed 's sira ( life story ) and his ahadith were too embarrassing to accept or justify .
Therefore , to maintain my allegiance to Islam I had to reject them , or most of them , and build my own beliefs around the Quran .
This may look bizarre because the Quran is just as bad as ahadith .
The reality was that the Quran is an easy ride for a person with good command of Arabic .
Its ambiguity and contradictions cater for all tastes , you just say what you want and you can find some words in the Quran that you can use to justify your case .
I simply picked what I wanted and explained as I wanted and then turned a blind eye to the rest .
That was the reality of my feelings that I managed to suppress all my Islamic years because my Islamic mind could n't face it .
I practiced islam in a very liberal way , I neglected many of my Islamic duties , sometimes sinned and justified all that from carefully selected verses from the Quran .
I decorated the wall of my room with a calligraphy poster of a Quranic verse , which I selected carefully and kept for years .
It was verse 39 : 53 , which used to be one of my favorites because it is one of the few verses that project Allah as a kind and forgiving god .
39 : 53 .
Say : 'O my slaves who have transgressed against themselves despair not of the Mercy of Allâh … '
I had a reputation among my friends to be a fan of the classic Arabic and to have special sensitivity to language mistakes in formal writings or readings .
I must have read the above verse thousands of times without ever noticing its obvious error !
The verse contains an outrageous language and logical mistake .
Allah is supposed to be talking to Mohammed and asking him to tell Muslims ( Allah 's slaves ) not to despair , but the existing wording implies that Muslims are Mohammed 's slaves !
The above verse should start like this : ' Say : O Allah 's slaves … . '
I still find difficult to explain how I read the above verse days and nights for many years without ever noticing such an evident mistake , which I only noticed when I read the Quran with a critical mind some years later .
But I am not alone ; in fact I never came across an Arab Muslim who noticed the error , although they all would try hard to justify it .
It is sad that Muslims are never free when it comes to anything to do with the Quran .
Muslims are continuously subjected to an intensive indoctrination process that leaves them with impaired senses and dysfunctional minds .
Muslims , under the influence of Islam , are incapable of reading the Quran in an objective way .
I was amazed by the number of blunders , of all kinds , that started to appear as I started to read the Quran in an objective way .
Removing the divine halo that surrounds the Quran reveals a very different book that does n't require any interoperations to understand because all its mysteries are solved by one word - nonsense .
The above verse is not a one off error ; actually the Quran is full with them .
It is a common practice in the Quran for Allah to suddenly move from the third person to the first person or vice versa with no reason at all .
In verse 6:99 , such a poor usage of language implies that Allah talks about a different god who sends down rain from the sky while He is responsible for the vegetations : 6:99 .
It is HE who sends down water from the sky , and with it WE bring forth vegetation of all kinds …
But my favorite example of the Quran 's lack of clarity is verse 6 : 151 , which is a list of the forbidden things that Muslims must avoid .
The verse , in theory , should be one of the easiest verses to compose ; it is just a matter of listing things one after the other , which the Quran failed miserably to do : 6 : 151 .
Say : " Come , I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from : Join not anything in worship with Him ; be good and dutiful to your parents ; kill not your children because of poverty -
We provide sustenance for you and for them ; come not near to Al - Fawâhish whether committed openly or secretly , and kill not anyone whom Allâh has forbidden , except for a just cause … .
The above verse lists the forbidden things that all Muslims must avoid .
The verse lists being good and dutiful to parents as one of those sins .
Muslim scholars say that ' being good to parents ' is not part of the list and we also sincerely hope it not .
But why did Allah insert it in that position of the verse then rely on human commonsense to figure out that it is not part of that list ?
Is there a good writing style in the above verse ?
Would such writing be acceptable from any writer , past or present ?
And my story with the Quran continues ..

If " Join not anything in worship with Him " is prohibited in 6:151 , then the muslims must do the opposite , join something in worship with Him .
Also for the rest of the list .

It is a very interesting article , that too coming from a man from the middle - east , which is the hub of islamic cult !
It is just an arabian barbaric cult bent upon destroying all civilisations and great cultures to make it subservient to arab hegemony .
Iraq was the land of Babylonians , Sumerians , Akkads , etc .
Where are they today .
They have been obliterated and the locals have been arabised to such an extent that they loath their own ancestors and obliterate their language and culture to become arabised in toto !
The same is the condition of Egyptians andothers inthe vicinity !
That is islam for you !
From being a great civilisation these countries have been reduced to a backward and intellectually and morally bankrupt nations !
Fortunately they could not succeed in India where the roots are very strong .
Today in Pakistan or Bangladesh or Indonesia , or Malaysia criticising arabs in any way is sacrilege because Muhamad , the lecherous murderous and psychopathic founder of the cult of islam was an arab !
It is time these people come out of the zombiehood and integrate with the world in all its colourful hues and varieties , inculcate tolerance and abilty to think rationally than be a dumb idiot of a muslim !

Islam has a problem .
The internet is a medium of information dissemination the Muslim fanatics cannot burn or destroy .
Through it the ugly and beastly nature of Islam is exposed .
Thanks to those enlightened and brave ex-Muslims , now Islam 's greatest enemy .
Their revelations of the true nature of Islam will educate the world and help in opening the eyes of non-Muslims and Muslims blinded by a pervert religion that promises an afterlife paradise of big bosom virgins and rivers of wine catering to the carnalities of its followers , which is of course non-existent , an invention of Mohammad .
A virulent and vicious religion that command its followers to kill innocent human beings who have all the right to live in this world they label as infidels .
A deception perpetrated by its founder Mohammad whose sexual perversion and penchant for mass murder and plunder was duly recorded in the Koran .
The epitaph of Islam is already being written .
Muslims of the world awake now and open your eyes to this deception and leave Islam for good !!!
You are helping to make this world a better place to live in by leaving Islam .
Outside Islam it is no longer obligatory for you to blow yourself to pieces to kill your fellow human beings who had done nothing wrong to you .
Human life is precious .
Only Satan does not care for human life .
He wants you to be his instrument of destruction .
It is recorded in your Koran , " There is no shame in killing .
Allah is not the real God .
He is the Deceiver of Mankind .
The Destroyer .
The Accuser .
The Father of Lies . The Old Serpent .
He is Satan the Devil .
He desired to be like the Most High to be like God .
So he established Islam through Mohammad his perfect partner the personification of evil .
For Satan can disguise himself as an angel of light and perform great miracles .
Hell is already reserved for Satan disguised as Allah and his demons .

When I read the Qur'an ( in English ) , I kept wondering when the religious part was going to begin .
The Qur'an seems to confine itself to condemning unbelievers and describing the various punishments they face in hell .
Submission to Allah is its only instruction .
There is no narrative or context and seems to consist of a series of diatribes against whomever Muhammed does not like at the moment .
I am pleased to discover that the Qur'an is hard to read in Arabic as it is in English .

Thank you brother Mumin .
Great article .
I was born and raised in the middle east .
So , I completely understand what you are talking about .
Though I was not born with a Muslim background , very many of my friends were Muslims .
Islam was a " Live Option " to me as one philosopher says .
My own rejection of Islam was based mainly on silly things that the God of the universe should not worry about ( i.e. wudu , position of hands when one prays , passing gas , what to say when one has sex with his wive .. Just stupid things like that ) .
Also , Islam 's teachings about women is terrible and backward .
Also , the barbarity of Sharia Law .
When one reads just the first chapter of brother Sina 's book , one finds thousands of reasons to reject Islam .
But I think it depends on the individual .
Everyone rejects Islam for different reasons , almost all are valid .
Again , thank you brother on a great article .
Now to Akhter : Please stop using my good name to post your comments .
You even spelled it wrong .
( Ibn Kamanu ) is the wrong spelling .
Morally , this is a very wrong behavior Akhter .
But what can I say ?
You are a true Muslim after all .
Peace to all .

A very interesting article .
I am surprised that the Koran is such a difficult read in Arabic .
The English translations reveals such lame and demented content and poor writing style that I thought it must at least sound good in Arabic .
It is interesting that people can so easily be taught to ' not see ' what is there .
When I took an into geology course in university I was amazed at how knowledge let you see folded bedding planes in mountains as a story in the stone whereas before you only saw lines in the rock .
It seems that fear and indoctrination can let one be kept from seeing imperfections that are there .
It is interesting that something as seemingly fundamental as vision and reading can be altered by the information content of your mind .

Upon reading the above article and the comments written below , I cant help but feel very angry .
But whats worse than the anger that I feel is the sorrow that such a symbol of perfection like the Holy Quran was wasted on a frustrated and lost group people like you .
I could write a very logical and well put explanation , but something deep down tells me my efforts would be wasted on a lost cause .
Its a shame that you guys were ever Muslims because all that guidance could have served someone else much better .
Just bear in mind that one day you 'll have to answer for all this , and that day doesnt look to bright for any of you .
Besides that thing with the Jews was n't a massacre , it was war that the Prophet P.B.U.H tried very hard to avoid , but the Jews were very provocative and dug their own graves .
Get your facts straight before you challenge things you do n't understand .

Praise and Glorify the religion and the prophet .
Muslims are obsessed with doing that all the time .
They fall over each other trying to come up with ways to describe how wonderful , scientific and awesome it is .
If you want to be accepted in a muslim country , you just have to do that continuously .
One may question - are they trying to shield something .. something so ugly that without being so fiercely protected , it will not stand even one day ?

What you have been taught is - do n't look at Islam straight in the eye .. the secret reason is ... because it is a BEAST !
It is the most ugliest thing that happened to mankind .
You are never allowed to question it , only glorify it .
So naturally you will try to come up with some explanation whatever ugliness you are presented with .

How can this author , who seems to consider himself some sort of Arab scholar , compare the Quran 's ancient Arabic to modern Arabic ?
That would be akin to comparing Shakespearean English to modern English .

Is the obscurity of the Qur'an the reason there are 73 contradictory Muslim sects ?
Apparently , that is the reason .
Since the Qur'an is obscure , and because many contradictory sects , 73 of them , have sprung from it , then , it 's obvious that Islam is n't a true religion but a confused idiology that has misled people .
The result , as we can see has been catastrophic .
Muslim Sunnis are murdering Muslim Shiites , and Muslim Shiites are murdering Muslim Sunnis .
This is pretty much the norm throughout the Muslim world .
Of course , Muslims take time out so that they can also murder other peoples , like Christians and Jews .
Let 's face it ; Islam is one screwed up ideology .
The bottom line is that Islam is cruel .

Very instructive article .
Also Muslims should explain how eternal words of Allah can be abrogated and replaced by better one !!!!
An eternal word or sentence or order from Allah abrogated is not eternel but temporal .
This is contradictory .
So Quran contains something which was correct and is not anymore correct .
Quran contains errors , imperfections , something Allah thougth correct but decided afterwise incorrect .
And it was said an eternal word of Allah .
Maybe Akter has an explnanation of this great steadiness of Allah or the great want of foresight of Muhammad who should have restrain his tongue and is now entrangled with his owen words .

Thanks to massive immigration we in the west now know how crazy the middle east actually is .
Most people has learned this the hard way since mainstream media is covering all crimes up commited by muslims , robberies , gang rapes , harrassments etc , which makes me think the saudis are involved and / or in cahoots with politicians and media .
EU is now trying to control the blogosphere .
I can guess why , internet has gotten out of hand for these control freaks , thus making it harder to brainwash the sheeple .
So far they have failed miserably and more and more people are waking up to the harsh reality of islam and sharia .

It is so obvious that the Quran was written by insane desert warriors for the purpose of brainwashing everyone into their psychotic cult of death .
The creators of the Quran were interested in one thing : Conquest .
They created a cult in order to justify all of their CRIMES by saying they represented " God . " Bullcrap .
They represent EVIL .
The whole cult is designed to terrorize , torture and exploit weaker people , such as women and children .
And they made this sick and depraved book the Quran incomprehensible as part of this evil brainwashing .
All Muslims must get out of this perverted cult NOW .

True story : four muslim mullahs in North Africa were walking one day when they saw a vision of the Lord Jesus Christ .
He said to them , " Mohammed is not the way , I am the way , follow me . "
And , all four became Christians .
Similiar visions have been given to muslims around the muslim world .
Why ?
Because Christians all over the world are praying for Muslims .
Not that they will die but have salvation !
Eph. 4:12 tells us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities , against the rulers of the darkness of this world .
The Lord is doing a work with the muslims helping them to come out of this darkness into light !

Recent headline : SAUDI ARABIA : HONOR KILLING
In Saudi Arabia , a father killed his teen daughter when he found she ’d converted to Christianity .
Todd Nettleton of Voice of the Martyrs USA says so - called “ honor killings ” are a two - sided coin : done first because of shame , and second because of the mindset that conversion takes time .
“ If you ’re able to kill your family member before that conversion process is complete , you ’re actually doing them a favor because they ’re still going to die a Muslim .
They ’re still going to have some chance of going to Muslim paradise after death . ”
Blog Web sites the girl visited in secret have created mourning pages or temporarily shut down in protest .
It ’s evidence that people are looking for answers outside the Koran .
Now , " repeat for clarification " - who 's killing who , even their own family members , and why ?
Tolerance of evil is morally repugnant .

Will you please give your comment on the verses of your Koran that incite bloodshed and murder of fellow human beings , 1 ) .
" Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them ! " , " There is no shame in killing !' , " Killing is a small matter to us ! "
These are the motivation of your hardcore Muslim fanatics to murder the innocents !
Remember the attacks on World Trade Center that took the lives of more than 3,000 innocent people the anniversary of which is tomorrow Sept.11
These are not " antiquarian religious and cultural practices " .
No part of your Koran is considered doctrinal garbage since you firmly believe it 's divinely inspired .
How about the promises of your beloved Mohammad of an 2 ) . " afterlife paradise of big bosom virgins , handsome young boys , rivers of wine ? " that duped your terrorist bombers to blow themselves to pieces killing the innocents in the process blindly believing they will be with your Allah for eternity .
Another clarification is the simplified division of the world into the 3 ) .
" House of Islam and the House of War " thereby considering non-Muslims as infidels or enemies to be slaughtered .
How about your beloved Koran not recognizing gender equality 4 ) .
" Woman is just a toy " , " You can beat your wife ! " 5 ) . The intolerance of your Islam to other religions resulting in the banning of the practice of other religious beliefs in Islamic countries obedient to the true spirit of your Koran .
These are just a few of the things in your Koran a normal mind will consider beastly , barbaric , pure evil .

" Pagan idolators " are not oppressing your lands !
Then why all the bloodshed against non-muslims ?
Even muslim clerics all across the US and Britain are calling for " jihad " against the infidels !
Are you a mullah ?
If not , then what makes you more knowledgable then they are ?
Truth is , you are telling us what you think you want us to hear .
Mohammed knew very well what he was writing ( a number of other violent passages as well as these ) when he murdered men in front of their wives .
To insert a " special circumstance " in all the passages which clearly call for bloodshed of the " infidel " is doing bad service to the quran for you matters well insert a " special circumstance " wherever the koran says something you do n't want to have to admit !
A muslim leader denounced the 9/11 attacks in the US but praised them and incited the crowd towards more bloodshed when he got back to his country .
When muslims are the minority , the play up to being " peaceful " although their actions speak louder than words ( like , the recent " peace " protest in London ) .
When they are the majority , freedom of the press goes out the window , women are suppressed and religious minorities have their daughters kidnapped and fathers killed .
Denmark is not a muslim country and muslims around the world called for the death of the brave soul who printed a comic about mohammed .
That teacher in Africa nearly got lashed when she allowed a child to name his teddy bear " mohammed . "
You can try to tell us what we want to hear but your actions speak louder than words .
As we commemorate the 9/11 attacks , let us remember the 10,000 plus acts of violence commited by muslims around the world since then !

You know why these hardcore Muslim fanatics hate the Jews or Zionist ?
The Jews descended from the House of Judah one of the 12 tribes of Israel .
Since most of the tribes of Israel except Judah were lost to history ( unless you know where to look today ) after the Assyrians uprooted them from their land only the identity of descendants of the House of Judah was preserved .
The House of Judah is special because out their seed emerged Jesus of Nazareth .
Genesis 49:8 , " Judah , you are he whom your brothers shall praise ;
Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies ;
Your father 's children shall bow down before you . "
Genesis 49:10 , " The scepter shall not depart from Judah , Nor a lawgiver between his feet , Until Shiloh comes ; And to Him shall be the obedience of the people . "
It does not take a lot of brain to figure out Who wanted to exterminate this people .
None other than the Destroyer , the Deceiver , the Old Serpent , Satan the Devil .
He wanted to destroy God 's people .
An interesting verse , " Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies . " is really a pain in the neck for the Muslim countries surrounding Israel .
A tiny nation of 7 million cannot be be destroyed by 1.5 billion Muslims .

An important question : is the Quran the Word of God or is it a fabrication of a Man .
Thus , is the Quran the truth or a fiction and a hoax ?
The jihadists use many verses from the Quran as the Main source of justification for their violence , mayhem and murders .
There , the question is clearly given on pages 145 through 157 in THE ISLAMIC INVASION by Robert Morey in which he wrote a section on the Quran with its self - contradictions .
Just two of the many he cited are the following “ The Quran differs on whether a day is a thousand years or fifty thousand years in God ’s sight ’ and “ Who was first to believe ?
Abraham or Moses [ Sura 6:14 versus 7:143 ] ?
The above is inconsistent and illogical .
Further , Morey wrote about “ The fact that Judaism and Christianity broke up into different sects was used in the Quran to prove that they are not of God [ Suras 30:20 - 32 . 42:13 , 14 ] .
Yet Islam has broken up into many warring sects and therefore cannot be true if the Quran is right . ”
Moreover , Morey in his book shows many more contradictions and absurdities in the Quran , there are and how Muhammad incorporated extra Biblical and Jewish folklore along with pre-Islamic Arabian myth and parts of Zoroastrian and Hindu stories into the Quran .
Furthermore , the Muslims claim that “ the Quran is the direct , literal word of God unmodified in any way by the Prophet who uttered them at the bidding of God . ”
Nevertheless , in the book UNVEILING ISLAM by Ergun Mehmet and Eethi Caner has shown that the Quran was modified in the following account on pages 45 .
“ Muhammad felt the need to improve on the words of Allah , since he changed Allah ’s wisdom for his own on several occasions .
A hadith tells of the nonchalant emendations of Muhammad : ’
On a number of occasions he [ a scribe ] had , with the Prophet ’s consent changed the closing words of verses .
For example , when the prophet had said ‘ God is mighty and wise ‘ Adbollah b. Abi Sarh suggested writing down ‘ Knowing and wise ’ and the Prophet answered that there was no objection .
Having observed a succession of changes of this type , Adbollah renounced Islam on the grounds that revelations , if from God could not be changed at the prompting of a scribe such as himself .
After his apostasy he went to Mecca and joined the Qorayshites . ’
Other writers reveal that later Muhammad and his people did go war with the Qorayshites and he personally killed Abdollah .
Obviously Abdollah knew too much and Muhammad wanted Abdollah ’s knowledge to die with him . ”
In conclusion , the Quran is not only a fiction , it ’s also a hoax .

Before getting to the essence of the subject , there is a very important point which must be considered : the authenticity of the Qur’anic text .
It is known that the text of the Qur’an was both recited from memory , during the time it was revealed , by the Prophet and the believers who surrounded him , and written down by designated scribes among his followers .
This process lasted for roughly twenty - three years .
Here we must note a highly important point .
The present text of the Qur’an benefited in its original preparation from the advantage of having its authenticity cross-checked by the text recited from memory .
The memorized text was of paramount importance at a time when not everyone could read and write , but everybody could memorize .
Moreover , the need for a written record was included in the text of the Qur’an itself .
The first five verses of chapter al - ‘ Alaq , which happen to constitute the first revelation made to the Prophet ( S ) , express this quite clearly : “ Read :
In the name of your Lord who created .
Who created man from a clinging entity .
Read !
Your Lord is the most Noble , Who taught by the pen .
Who taught man what he did not know . ”
Qur’an , 96:1 - 5
These are surely words in “ praise of the pen as a means of human knowledge ” , to use Professor Hamidullah ’s expression .
Then came the Caliphate of ‘ Uthman ( which lasted from the twelfth to the twenty - fourth year following Muhammad ’s death ) .
Within the first two years of Caliph ‘ Uthman ’s rule , seven official copies were reproduced from the official text and distributed throughout a large area of the world which had already come under Islamic rule .
There were , moreover , many witnesses to the immediate transcription of the Qur’anic revelation .
I shall also mention another fact of great importance .
We shall examine statements in the Qur’an which today appear to merely record scientific truth , but of which men in former times were only able to grasp the apparent meaning .
The presence of these statements spread throughout the Qur’an looks ( to the impartial observer ) like an obvious hallmark of its authenticity .
The Qur’an is a revelation made known to humans in the course of twenty - three years .
It spanned two periods of almost equal length on either side of the Hijrah .
In view of this , it was natural for reflections having a scientific aspect to be scattered throughout the Book .

Just a clarification .
Please read carefully .
The House of Judah is one of the 12 tribes of Israel .
Therefore Judah descended from Israel .
Jesus of Nazareth came from the tribe of Judah .
The name Jew is taken from Judea( Judah ) during Roman times .
The present name of State of Israel is supposed to be State of Judea or State of Zion .
But ultimately after deliberation when the nation was formed in 1948 they chose the name State of Israel .
The other tribes of Israel was lost to history after the Assyrians uprooted them from their land hence they are called the " Lost Tribes of Israel . "
Their identity is hidden unless you know where to look .
I hope this is clear to you .

This article is great , it describes a true experience of a lot of people who are born moslems and live in a moslem countries where they are not allowed to think or speak up for themselves .
They are brain washed .
I am sure that there are thousands of people who can relate to author experience but with the fear of getting their heads cut off or go to hell after life , had to submit to mohamed 's nonsense .
We all have duties here , is to find a way to reach out to these people , not to hate your average moslem .
The ex-moslems would be the best people to convince those who are repressed .
We can fight the finatics becasue that is the only way they understand , which is the edge of the sword but for the average repressed , fooled and deceived born moslems , they need to see the truth and judge for themselves , if there is enough out there who are willing to see Islam for what it really is , the rest of the commoners or the simple person will follow .
If we hate them that means we will alienate them and Mohamed and the finatic cult will win !
Enlightment is by reaching out and showing logical facts and defeating their scholars or their olama in their own field .

I will prove to you that Mohammad , the founder of Islam is wrong .
The angel Gabriel appeared to Mary , according to her , announcing the birth of Jesus Christ , the begotten Son of God through her .
600 + years later an angel called Gabriel appeared to Muhammad , according to him also , claiming God has no begotten Son .
Now we have a problem here , who is telling the truth ?
The two revelations could not come from the same God , right ?
If you believe in God it follows that you believe in the existence of the Devil .
The Bible confirmed the existence of the Devil and so is the Koran .
So we all agree in the existence of the Devil .
Now who is telling the truth here , Mary the earthly mother of Jesus or Mohammad the founder of Islam ?
Now we will prove who is telling the truth , Mary or Mohammad ? , The Bible or the Koran ?
There is a verse in the Bible copied by the Koran , since the Bible is thousand + years ahead of the Koran , that states , " No eye has seen , no ear has heard , no mind of man can conceived what God has prepared to those who loved Him . "
This is self explanatory .
Nobody has idea any what Paradise , whom God has prepared , look like .
What is in store for those who will dwell in it ?
It 's anybody guess .
Now came Mohammad describing in detail what Paradise , whom God has prepared , has to offer , " big bosom virgins , handsome young boys , and rivers of wine . "
Now Mohammad violated the verse " No eye has seen , no ear has heard , no mind of man can conceived what God has prepared to those who loved Him . "
Therefore this proves Mohammad is wrong and Islam is false !
Let 's compare what Jesus said and what Mohammad had said .
Mohammad said " Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them ! " , " There is no shame in killing ! " , " Killing is a small matter to us ! "
Jesus said , " Love your enemies ! " , " Love those who persecute you ! " , " Love your neighbor ! "
One is a command to commit murder .
The other is a gospel of love .
Now it does not take a lot of brain to decide who is evil here : Mohammad !
Therefore Mohammad was the servant of the Devil and Islam is a false religion .
It is also a dangerous religion because in its pages is written the blueprint to subjugate the whole world under Islam .
When that happens forget freedom of expression , forget freedom of religion , forget human rights !!!

" Muhammad was so great that even Allah showered praises on him and saluted him " ( Qur’an 33 : 56 ) .
What an Excellent hilarious .
Even with Proof , Muslims still refusing that Qua'ran was not Copied from BIBLE Style , In fact Qua'ran is the copy , cut& remix - Version of ( BIBLE , Paganism , Hindu tradition + Pedophile Sexuality ) JESUS is Son of GOD= GOD 's Son .
That kind of Style was copied by Muhammad , he jealous about JESUS , ha haa Beware Muslim friends , Your prophet was Mentally Retarded , Down $ Syndrome or something .
He wanted to be like JESUS .... how dare you Muhammad ??? with your pedophile Rapist Action upon 6 yr old child , you wanted to be supreme above JESUS .
...? How pity you Muhammad ? , he was suffered Jealousy about JESUS , How Pathetic Muhammad ?
What an Excellent Hilarious ... ha haa ... thanks Qua'ran , I have been unhappy for months , but now , I can't stop my Laughing .
ha haa haaa ..... think about that friends .... haa haaaa haaa ...
Muhammad was suffered Jealousy about JESUS and Muhammad wanted JESUS position , he made himself as above JESUS position in his own - made Islam Religion .
However , Muhammad will be very Happy at Eternal Hell , Muhammad is so Happy now and he was cried due to Extreme Emotional Feelings .
Because , 1400 years old - his antique Desire , was full - filled by Muslims .
Although people from Genuine GOD ( YAHWEH ) laughed at Muhammad , he was Praised by 1.3 Billion of Muslims .
Although Christians & Jews Laugh Muhammad , He was Praised by Islam .
At last , our pathetic Psycho - Insane - Prophet - Muhammad 's Desire about JESUS position was Full - Filled by Muslims .
Congratulations ...!
At least , some idiots Worship Muhammad supreme above JESUS .
ha haa Surely , Allah saluted Muhammad .
Because even Allah - himself can not break that World - Fucking - Records of Muhammad .
I think no one can .
6 year old child :)

To help you in determining the true religion just observe its followers .
If they are loving , kind , merciful , then join that group !
If they murder , hateful , vengeful , avoid them !
" A tree is known by its fruits ! "
The true God is a loving , merciful God !
Do your own research .

This is how you should pray : " Our Father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
Thy kingdom come .
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us .
And led us not to the test but deliver us from the Evil One . "

Do these things : " Love your enemies ! " .
" Love those who persecute you ! " , " Love your neighbor ! " , " Forgive those who sinned against you ! " , " Flee fornication ! "
Do not keep evil thoughts in your mind for the mind is the wellspring of your action .
Guard your tongue so that you will not speak evil .
If you sinned go to a private place and ask forgiveness to your Heavenly Father .
Be humble always .

Fantastic .
This gives a clearer picture of Islamic traditions .
Incidentally Hinduism is more a philosophy or simply a way of life .
One need not follow any particular methodology or even go to a place of worship to be a hindu .
Hindus respect all regions and consider jesus christ an " Avatar " ( one of the many births of God on earth "

You ’ll be playing Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade next Wednesday September 24th , 3D Realms has revealed .
Hidden in the Game Trailer is a tiny update that Duke Nukem 3D will be available to download on Xbox Live Arcade next Wednesday , September 24 ( skip to the news update part ) .
It looks like 3D Realms getting good at sticking to plans .
There ’s no word on pricing but expect it to be annouced this week .
The good news is that Duke 3D is getting some good reviews .
OXM in the US went as far to call it the ultimate version .
“ Like Doom before it , Duke Nukem 3D was a juggernaut in the adolescence of the first - person shooter .
And also like Doom , it stands tall as a fantastic FPS on a system full of great shooters , ” reads OXM ’s review , though they get stuck on the puzzles by the sounds of it .
Eight player ‘ Dukematch ’ is addictive as ever says OXM , bolstered with a fleshed out lobby system that keeps you and your friends together after matches .
“ The only part of Duke ’s gameplay that fails the 2008 test is its reliance on annoying three and four - switch puzzles you must ‘ solve ’ to proceed , ” the review continues , adding that the bumper - activated weapon cycling can also cause problems .
“ Nevertheless , these niggles do n’t keep Duke from greatness , ” adds OXM .
“ The one - liners and parodies are still funny , the level design is outstanding , then inventory items are genius and the weapon stash remains one of the genres most unique and fun to wield … ”

But some worry that the agency has fewer people  and less money  than it needs to cope with the industry ’s latest travails , particularly if several large institutions were to collapse .
Nine lenders , most of them small , have failed so far this year .
Analysts expect dozens more to run into trouble .
Ms. Bair ’s agency is stretched .
Dozens of staff members who had been through the banking crises of the early 1990s retired in recent years .
Despite her efforts to bring some seasoned examiners back , her small army of examiners is largely untested .
Meanwhile , there are growing questions about the adequacy of F.D.I.C. ’s insurance fund , which guarantees repayment on deposit accounts of up to $ 100,000 when banks collapse .
The fund dwindled to $ 45.2 billion during the second quarter , from $ 53 billion in the first quarter .
To replenish its fund , the agency will probably have to raise the fees it charges banks by at least 14 cents for every $ 100 of deposits , according to estimates by analysts .
Ms. Bair declined to comment on the likely size of any increase but said the agency was proposing to revamp its fees so that institutions engaging in high - risk practices would pay higher rates .
“ It only seems fair , ” Ms. Bair , 54 , said .
Such a move is expected to draw criticism from banks .
How Ms. Bair navigates the financial and political landmines ahead will help determine the course of the banking industry and , by extension , the broader economy .
It will also determine her legacy .
“ If the agency gets through the credit mess , having handled the bank failures that are to come , she is going to be widely seen as the person who prepared the agency for this , ” said Jaret Seiberg , a financial policy analyst for the Stanford Group in Washington .
“ If the cycle is worse than expected  and if the agency insurance fund is n’t big enough or they did n’t have enough examiners  she will become the fall guy . ”

The centerpiece of Ms. Bair ’s plan is to modify loans so that people can stay in their houses .
“ It is something we should put a priority on , ” said Ms. Bair , who speaks at a rapid clip .
To be fair , I understand her crash “ Economics 101 ” course is n’t until Thursday .
More from Huff Post :
Gov. Sarah Palin made her first potentially major gaffe during her time on the national scene while discussing the developments of the perilous housing market this past weekend .
Speaking before voters in Colorado Springs , the Republican vice presidential nominee claimed that lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had “ gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers . ”
The companies , as McClatchy reported , “ are n’t taxpayer funded but operate as private companies .
The takeover may result in a taxpayer bailout during reorganization . ”
Economists and analysts pounced on the misstatement , saying it demonstrated a lack of understanding about one of the key economic issues likely to face the next administration .

It is a unquestionable fact to the Right : Jimmy Carter ’s was a disastrous presidency , and the country barely survived , thanks to the magnificent rule of Ronald Reagan .
It ’s so unquestioned that any “ conservative ” will react in honest shock on hearing any suggestion that Carter was a good , smart and decent President and that , barring a few political mistakes and some unfortunate timing , would certainly have been reelected in 1980 .
How different would the country have been if we ’d been spared the indignity of eight years of Reagan and another 12 years of Bushes ?
On one subject–energy policy –Carter was well ahead of his time .
A second Carter term would almost certainly have taken an entirely different path toward sustainability and self - reliance .
Cynthia Tucker , in a Baltimore Sun editorial , puts it all very well :
“ Beginning at this moment , this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 – never , ” he said .
“ From now on , every new addition to our demand for energy will be met from our own production and our own conservation .
The generation - long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks right now . ”
Mr. Carter also called for research into alternative fuels , massive investment in public transit and a broad campaign for conservation .
He acknowledged that the new programs would require billions ; but “ unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil , these funds will be paid by Americans to Americans . ”
Of course , you know the rest of the story .
The next year , Ronald Reagan was elected and threw out Mr. Carter ’s plans .
The Organization of Petroleum - Exporting Countries relented , and gasoline became , once again , plentiful and cheap .
So Americans pretended Mr. Carter was the problem – not our profligate consumption patterns .
Today , we ’re importing twice as much oil as we were when Mr. Carter gave that speech . ….
What if the nation had stuck to the path Mr. Carter laid out ?
What if we had invested billions back then in public transit and alternative fuels ?
What if we ’d made a national campaign of conservation , similar to the successful no -smoking campaign ?
What if we ’d insisted that Detroit continue pushing up fuel efficiency ?
What a great question .
And what if we had remembered the long gas lines and rationed fuel ?
What if we had insisted that Detroit build small , efficient and reliable vehicles ?
And what if we ’d known better than to choose a President and Vice President right out of the oil business ?

The U.S. embassy in Kyrgyzstan has found itself embroiled in scandal after the country ’s interior ministry announced that a hoard of U.S. - made weapons has been found in a house in Bishkek rented by U.S. citizens .
The embassy hurriedly stated that the weapons were intended for antiterrorism exercises , but Kyrgyz enforcement agencies have not confirmed that .
The news is the talk of Kyrgyzstan .
The prosecutor general has begun an investigation .
Local police found 53 firearms , including large - caliber guns , grenade launchers , machineguns , pistols , sniper ’s rifles and more than 15,000 rounds of ammunition of various sizes .
According to Kyrgyz Deputy Minister of the Interior Temirkan Subanov , there were two employees of the U.S. embassy with diplomatic immunity and ten members of the American military , allegedly in the country to train Kyrgyz special forces .
“ Interior Ministry staff questioned them about the weapons and ammunition to determine their purpose .
We received information from residents of a new house that they were constantly moving things into and out of that house .
None of the U.S. citizens were detained or arrested .
All of them were simply questioned , ” Subanov said .
The U.S. embassy quickly issued a statement saying that the cache was in the country with the permission and at the request of Kyrgyz authorities .
The Kyrgyz Defense Ministry , State Committee for National Security , border service and national guard say that they have no training with Americans planned .
Only the narcotics control agency had such plans , but they did not include weapons .
Kyrgyz officials are not commenting on the situation .
Observers are both pointing out reasons to be alarmed at the incident and reasoning that the United States has little motivation to create a provocation in Kyrgyzstan .

Montgomery , Alabama , came in at No. 2 in the 100 most political cities , followed by Little Rock , Cleveland and Kansas City .
Greensboro in North Carolina , Des Moines , Milwaukee , Portland and Pittsburgh , rounded the top 10 in the ranking by Men ’s Health magazine .
“ Our hope is that by releasing these rankings now weeks before election day , the residents there will see this as a challenge and step up at the polls like never before , ” said Men ’s Health editor in chief David Zinczenko .
Washington D.C. took the 16th spot while New York placed 89th on the list .
Americans will head to the polls on November 4 to vote for Republican candidate John McCain or Democratic candidate Barack Obama for president .
Men ’s
Health magazine used information for its ranking on the percentage of citizens registered to vote , percentage who participated , campaign spending in each city since 2006 and contributions by residents to the 2008 U.S. presidential race .
The bottom five cities included Yonkers in New York , Norfolk , Virginia , Modesto , California and three Texas cities -- Arlington , El Paso and Lubbock .
“ What is striking is that six Texas cities are in the bottom ten , possibly because as a Republican stronghold there ’s this complacency that ’s taken hold over the past four years , ” Zinczenko said .
Men ’s Health gathered the information for its ranking from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission , Dave Leip ’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections , Federal Election Commission and the Huffington Post .

A PACKED HOUSE ….
A few months ago , John McCain described his favorite setting — town - hall meetings — as the “ essence of democracy . ”
McCain seemed to revel in interacting with audiences , fielding all kinds of questions .
That is , until the campaign reached crunch time — before yesterday , McCain had n’t hosted a town - hall meeting since Aug. 20 .
It was a pleasant surprise , then , to see McCain and Sarah Palin share a stage in Grand Rapids , Mich. , for what ’s become a rare event .
There was , however , a catch .
As she took questions from voters for the first time since she was tapped as Senator John McCain ’s running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin was asked here Wednesday about her “ perceived lack of foreign policy experience . ”
She responded with an invitation for people to play “ stump the candidate ” with her .
“ As for foreign policy , you know , I think that I am prepared , ” Ms. Palin said at an enthusiastic town - hall - style meeting she held alongside Mr. McCain .
“ And I know that on Jan. 20 , if we are so blessed as to be sworn into office as your president and vice president , certainly we ’ll be ready .
I ’ll be ready .
I have that confidence .
I have that readiness .
And if you want specifics with specific policy , or countries , go ahead and you can ask me .
You can even play stump the candidate , if you want to . ”
But before anyone could take her up on the offer , Mr. McCain stepped in to praise Ms. Palin ’s qualifications … .
So , what was the catch ?
Unlike most town - hall events , which are open to the public , include diverse crowds , and no one needs an advance invitation , this event was for ticket - holders only .
And the only way to get a ticket was through the local Republican Party , after an advance RSVP .
No wonder Palin was prepared to play “ stump the candidate ” — it was a very friendly crowd that had no interest in testing her .
It does n’t exactly sound like a vote of confidence in the candidates ’ ability to answer tough questions , does it ?
By By Susan Duclos Aug 21 , 2008 in Politics John McCain sat down with a The Politico reporter for a half hour after his town - hall style meeting and spoke about a variety of issues , one being lobbyist and earmarks , something he had been a longtime critic of .
He called them " birds of prey " .
John McCain has been a longtime critic of lobbyists and earmarks and in his career , first in U.S. House of Representatives where he served two terms , then in the U.S. Senate which he was elected as Senator of Arizona in 1986 , easily winning reelection in 1992 , 1998 and 2004 .
In those years of his career , McCain has never met an earmark he liked and is one of the few politicians in Washington who has never earmarked what is called a pork - barrel project .
When he sat down with
What he did discuss was lobbyists and earmarks , making the comparison between himself and Barack Obama , pointing to the amount of money for earmarks Obama has asked for in his career , stating , " Senator Obama has asked for nearly a billion dollars in earmarked pork - barrel projects .
And he rails against lobbyists ?
I ’ve never taken a single one . "
He also referred to lobbyists as " McCain was asked about the lobbyists working for him and he asserts that anyone working in his administration would not be allowed to go back to lobbying and they would have to make a pledge agreeing to it .
He pointed to his own example to which he says , " I point out what my record is , which is one that has not won me Miss Congeniality over the years .
People want change in America — we all know that — and very legitimately so . ”
The senator went so far as to say : “ Lobbyists do n’t come to my office .
Because they know they ’re not going to be an earmark .
They know they ’re not going to get a pork - barrel project .
Senator Obama ’s gotten lots of ’em . :” McCain ’s plan for the strict admonition on future lobbying by White House aides is part of a policy he imposed on his campaign staff this spring after questions were raised about their past clients .
McCain maintains there are too many lobbyists in Washington and goes on to say they are " they are the symptom of a disease " , declaring , " As long as you have earmarking and pork - barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for DNA of bears in Montana and museums and all that , then you ’re going to have lobbyists .
“ So it ’s kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem , which is the earmark .
They ’d all be out of business – most of ’em would be out of business if we stopped pork - barrel and earmark spending . ”
Despite the daily rhetoric from both campaigns , The Politico article mentions lobbying and the Russia / Georgia conflict were the rare times in the interview that McCain mentioned Obama .
On the topic of Russia and Georgia and Obama 's response to the situation when it occurred , McCain draws other comparisons and he states he does n't question Obama 's patriotism but he does question his judgment .
McCain 's states for the record , " I have , and continue to question his judgment , whether it be his initial reaction to the Russian invasion of Georgia , or whether it be his failure to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded , or his opposition to nuclear power , among others .
So I question the judgment .
I do n’t question the patriotism . ”
Another topic he spoke about was the recent book " Obama Nation " which hit number 1 on the New York Times ' best seller list , and has unsubstantiated personal attacks against Barack Obama and questions his ties to Islam , with McCain saying he was not comfortable with that type of attack helping his campaign .
He also points out that he had previously condemned similar lines of attack .
He was referring to the commercials used in other campaigns which invoked Obama 's longtime Pastor Jeremiah Wright after video emerged of him making controversial comments in his sermons , which McCain denounced at the time .
John McCain did admit that he has not read the " Obama Nation " book , so he could not comment directly to the content nor denounce the book outright .
The Politico report states that McCain " Punted on several opportunities to whack Obama " .
They refer to when he was asked if Hillary Clinton would make a better president than Obama , to which he answered , " I do n't know , " and when asked if he felt the United States would be more vulnerable to a terrorist attack under a President Obama than it would be under a President McCain , he responded with , " I ’m sure that if Senator Obama were president of the United States , if the American people chose him to be their president , that he would act as a president who would get my full and complete support . "
A lobbyist is a person who tries to influence legislation on behalf of special interests .
An earmark is legislation which provide funds to a specific special interest , usually that interest is in the home state of the politician which has been lobbied and has inserted the earmark into a bill .
John McCain has been a longtime critic of lobbyists and earmarks and in his career , first in U.S. House of Representatives where he served two terms , then in the U.S. Senate which he was elected as Senator of Arizona in 1986 , easily winning reelection in 1992 , 1998 and 2004 .
In those years of his career , McCain has never met an earmark he liked and is one of the few politicians in Washington who has never earmarked what is called a pork - barrel project .
When he sat down with The Politico reporter , after a town - hall style meeting in New Mexico , right off the bat he made it clear he would not discuss his vice presidential pick and they describe him as clearly weary of the question .
What he did discuss was lobbyists and earmarks , making the comparison between himself and Barack Obama , pointing to the amount of money for earmarks Obama has asked for in his career , stating , " Senator Obama has asked for nearly a billion dollars in earmarked pork - barrel projects .
And he rails against lobbyists ?

They refer to when he was asked if Hillary Clinton would make a better president than Obama , to which he answered , " I do n't know , " and when asked if he felt the United States would be more vulnerable to a terrorist attack under a President Obama than it would be under a President McCain , he responded with , " I ’m sure that if Senator Obama were president of the United States , if the American people chose him to be their president , that he would act as a president who would get my full and complete support .

However , you may not be able to set up a third app if you only have a dual - SIM device .
This would put the smartphone to its limit , since it only has a couple of vacant slots .
When materials scientist Joseph Michael and his team at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , trained their high - powered electron microscope on anthrax spore samples the FBI had sent them in February 2002 , they made two crucial discoveries :
The first confirmed previous findings that the Bacillus anthracis spores mailed to U.S. Senate offices and various media outlets ( shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks ) contained silicon , a substance used to turn anthrax - causing spores into a biological weapon .
But it was Sandia 's next discovery that marked a critical turning point in the feds 's probe of the mysterious mailings , which killed five people , injured 17 and prompted thousands more who were potentially exposed to the deadly spores to take potent antibiotics — in particular , Ciprofloxacin ( known to irritate the gastrointestinal tract and cause joint swelling ) .
Using highly sensitive transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) , the researchers came to a startling realization :
The silicon had grown organically inside the Bacillus anthracis samples , nothing had been added to weaponize the spores .
" The silicon was not on the outside of the spore , " says Michael , who headed up Sandia 's investigation , " but rather incorporated on the inside . "
It was this key information that helped the FBI to rule out the likelihood that a terrorist organization was behind the anthrax mailings and prompted the agency to turn its attention to U.S. government labs as the possible source of the anthrax .
This move eventually led the agency to conclude that Bruce Ivins , a scientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , a federal biodefense research laboratory at Fort Detrick , Md. , who initially assisted with the investigation , was the culprit .
Ivins , 62 , two months ago committed suicide as prosecutors prepared to charge him in connection with the mailings .
Post -9/11 Scare
FBI Director Robert Mueller , III , this week told a House panel that he plans to commission the National Academy of Sciences to review evidence compiled by the agency 's Amerithrax Task Force to erase any remaining doubts that the mailed anthrax came from Ivins 's lab — and close a case that began seven years ago when a batch of letters containing Bacillus anthracis , the bacterium that causes the disease anthrax , were sent to several news outlets , including the New York Post and NBC News .
Although only the letters to the Post and NBC were discovered , the FBI concluded that contaminated letters were also responsible for anthrax infections at ABC News , CBS News and for the October 5 , 2001 , death of Robert Stevens , a photo editor for the National Enquirer publisher American Media , Inc. , based in Boca Raton , Fla .
Anthrax infection begins within a week of exposure with a few days of fever , chills , chest heaviness , malaise and cough as the spores are absorbed by the lungs .
Ultimately the bacteria produce toxins that damage the lungs and poison the blood , potentially sending the victim into septic shock that leads to organ failure and , in many cases , death .
By mid-October , spore - filled envelopes had also been discovered in the offices of former Sens. Tom Daschle ( D–S.D. ) and Patrick Leahy ( D–Vt. ) , along with ominous messages , including : " You can not [ sic ] stop us .
We have this anthrax " and " Are you afraid ? "
Buildings throughout Washington , D.C. , including the Hart Senate Office Building , the main postal distribution facility and several offices of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were shut down out of fear they had been contaminated .
The feds tested 36 postal facilities in the D.C. area ( including one where two postal workers died ) , finding spores at 15 of them .
The Hart Building did not reopen until January 2002 .
Investigating the Investigators
Congress has called for an investigation of the FBI 's work on the anthrax case .
One major misstep was revealed Tuesday , when the Los Angeles Times reported that Peter Jahrling , a former senior civilian scientist at the Fort Detrick facility , admitted that he had made an " honest mistake " seven years ago when he told top FBI brass that he believed anthrax spores he examined had been altered to make them more deadly .
Worried that a terrorist organization or a country sympathetic to al Qaeda might be involved , the U.S. Department of Justice in late 2001 commissioned a series of tests to determine whether the spores had been coated with a substance that would prevent them from clumping together , enabling them to hang in the air longer than they would normally , thereby increasing the chance of inhalation .
Early in the investigation , the FBI appeared to endorse the view that only a sophisticated lab could have produced the material used in the Senate attack , investigative journalist Gary Matsumoto wrote in the November 2003 issue of Science .
In fact , in May 2002 16 scientists and physicians working for the government published a paper in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association , describing the Senate anthrax powder as " weapons - grade " and exceptional : " high spore concentration , uniform particle size , low electrostatic charge , treated to reduce clumping . "
In addition , the August / October 2002 newsletter from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ( AFIP ) , a research organization that the government often turns to for help analyzing potentially pathological substances , reported that a mass spectrometry analysis found silica — a staple in professionally engineered germ warfare powders for decades — in the powder sent to Sen .
Daschle .
The silica was believed to be there to prevent the anthrax spores from aggregating and make it easier for them to disperse into the air , according to Matsumoto , who added that any such weaponized form of anthrax is " more than 500 times more lethal than untreated spores . "
Finding the Right Technology
By the time the Sandia researchers began their work in February 2002 , " we had heard just like everyone else that the spores had been weaponized , " says Michael , who had proposed a study of the elemental composition of any materials found growing outside the spores .
The first step was to find the silicon .
Michael was aware that FBI researchers had analyzed the samples with both scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , which scans surfaces with a high - energy beam of electrons , and with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDS ) , which analyzes x-rays emitted by a substance after it is hit with charged electrons .
But at that point , no one had studied them with a scanning transmission electron microscope ( STEM ) , which transmits a focused beam of electrons through a small part of a specimen to form an image and could provide compositional information by examining the spores a few nanometers ( one nanometer is 40 millionths of an inch ) at a time , a higher resolution than SEM could provide , Michael says .
This enabled Sandia researchers to not only detect the presence of a foreign substance such as silica , but also to determine its location on or inside the spore .
" In the FBI 's mind , it was important not only that trace amount of elements were present , but also …[ to determine ] … where those elements were located in the sample through microanalysis , " says Paul Kotula , a Sandia material scientist who studied the samples with Michael .
The researchers could find no way that the silica could be placed inside the spore without leaving a residue on the spore 's outermost layer .
( They found none . )
Instead , the researchers determined that the silica formed inside the spore naturally .
After only a month examining the anthrax samples in March 2002 , Michael and his team were convinced , contrary to other reports , that the anthrax used in the attacks had not been weaponized .
Some of the samples they worked with came from the USAMRIID , which employed both Ivins and Steve Hatfill , another government scientist the FBI pursued but who ultimately turned out to be a dead end .
( He was vindicated in June when he won a $ 5.8 million settlement in June against the Justice Department . )
According to Michael , neither he nor other Sandia researchers ever worked directly with any of the USAMRIID researchers , instead obtaining all of the samples they tested through the FBI .
Nor did Sandia work with live anthrax ; all of the samples they received were first inactivated or irradiated by the FBI .
Michael says he was surprised to hear that the feds were closing in on a scientist at USAMRIID ( Ivins , who died of a prescription - drug overdose ) , but that he was " not surprised the person who did this had knowledge of microbiology . "
In the end , it was at Sandia where scientists cracked the mystery behind the mailings .
The problem was , says Michael , that he had to keep mum on his findings — which might have calmed a jittery nation still reeling from the 9/11 terror attack — until the FBI wrapped up its investigation .
" That 's been one of the really frustrating things for Paul and me , " Michael says .
" We knew the answers but could n't tell anyone "
Updated | 12:25 : Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s name will be placed into nomination at the Democratic National Convention , a symbolic move approved by the Obama campaign in an effort to soothe a lingering rift with Clinton supporters .
“ I am convinced that honoring Senator Clinton ’s historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion , ” Senator Barack Obama said in a statement .
The decision was announced on Thursday afternoon in a joint statement from the senators .
It comes after long negotiations on both sides , with many backers of Mrs. Clinton vigorously pushing for her candidacy to be validated by giving her delegates the chance to support her through a roll call vote .
“ With every voice heard and the Party strongly united , we will elect Senator Obama President of the United States and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again , ” Mrs. Clinton said in a statement .
For Democrats inside the convention center in Denver , as well as the television audience at home , it could create some interesting moments .
After the state - by - state roll is tallied , Mrs. Clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to Senator Barack Obama .
So how will Mrs. Clinton , who is a superdelegate herself , vote ?
Associates say she will throw her lot behind Mr. Obama and ask her supporters to follow suit .
To see if it unfolds as the Obama campaign hopes – free of acrimony – tune in on Wednesday , Aug. 27
Newswise —
How much do white Americans think it " costs " to be black in our society , given the problems associated with racial bias and prejudice ?
The answer , it appears , is not much .
When white Americans were asked to imagine how much they would have to be paid to live the rest of their lives as a black person , most requested relatively low amounts , generally less than $ 10,000 .
In contrast , study participants said they would have to be paid about $ 1 million to give up television for the rest of their lives .
The results suggest most white Americans do n't truly comprehend the persisting racial disparities in our country , said Philip Mazzocco , co-author of the study and assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University 's Mansfield campus .
" The costs of being black in our society are very well documented , " Mazzocco said .
" Blacks have significantly lower income and wealth , higher levels of poverty , and even shorter life spans , among many other disparities , compared to whites . "
For example , white households average about $ 150,000 more wealth than the typical black family .
Overall , total wealth for white families is about five times greater than that of black families , a gap that has persisted for years .
" When whites say they would need $ 1 million to give up TV , but less than $ 10,000 to become black , that suggests they do n't really understand the extent to which African Americans , as a group , are disadvantaged , " Mazzocco said .
These results also offer insight as to why more than 9 out of 10 white Americans reject proposals to give reparations to the descendants of slaves , said study co-author Mahzarin Banaji , the Cabot Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard University .
" Our data suggest that such resistance is not because white Americans are mean and uncaring , morally bankrupt , or ethically flawed , " Banaji said .
" White Americans suffer from a glaring ignorance about what it means to live as a black American . "
The study appears in the current issue of Harvard 's Du Bois Review .
The researchers did a series of studies in which a total of 958 whites of different ages and from different parts of the country were asked variations of the same question : " How much should you be paid to continue to live the rest of your life as a black person ? "
In most cases , the participants were told to imagine they were actually black , but had always passed for white .
The imagined race change required no physical transformation , just a change in public status .
They were also asked how much they should be paid for giving up television , and how much they should be given to change their officially listed state residency ( without having to move ) .
These questions were asked , Mazzocco said , to compare what people requested for relatively trivial changes , like a new listed state residency , as compared to a more life - changing request , like giving up television .
Results suggest white people considered a race change as relatively trivial , along the lines of a change in official state residency , as opposed to the seemingly big sacrifice of giving up television .
In some of the studies , the researchers changed the scenario in order to learn more about what white Americans thought about the costs of racial disparities .
One issue with the previous scenario is that participants may minimize the disparities they would face as a black person , because they had always passed as white .
So in one study , whites were told to imagine that they were about to be born as a random white person in America , but they were being offered a cash gift to be born as a random black person .
Once again , white participants requested relatively small sums to make a life - long race - change .
In addition , some were given a list of some of the costs of being black in America , such as the racial wealth disparity .
The result was that whites in this latter scenario requested significantly higher amounts than those in the previous studies " about $ 500,000 .
Finally , some participants were given a similar scenario except all references to blacks , whites and America were taken out .
They were asked to imagine they were born into the fictional country of Atria , and were born either into the " majority " or " minority " population .
They were given a list of the disadvantages that the minority population faced in Atria ( which were identical to the real disadvantages faced by blacks in America ) .
In this case , white participants in the study said they should be paid an average of $ 1 million to be born as a minority member in Atria .
" When you take it out of the black - white context , white Americans seem to fully appreciate the costs associated with the kinds of disparities that African Americans actually face in the United States , " Mazzocco said .
" In this case , they asked for a million dollars , similar to what they want for giving up television . "
Mazzocco said blatant prejudice was not the reason for the findings .
Results showed that whites who scored higher on a measure of racial prejudice did not answer significantly differently than others in the study .
The researchers are conducting new studies to examine more closely why whites do underestimate the costs of being black .
Mazzocco believes many white Americans have a perception that race bias in the United States has been virtually eliminated , and that blacks are no longer disadvantaged .
" While there has been progress in making racial conditions in American more equal , there 's clearly a lot more work to be done , " he said .
" Blacks and whites are not experiencing the same America . "
When whites do understand the extent of racial disparities in the United States , they are more likely to support reparations .
The findings showed that whites who wanted more money to be publicly recognized as black " suggesting they understood the true costs of racial disparity " were more likely than others to say they would support reparations .
But there are many reasons why nearly all whites oppose reparations .
Mazzocco said some whites may believe slavery happened so long ago that slave descendants today do n't deserve to be compensated .
The researchers examined the " too long ago " rationale in another study .
The researchers asked participants to imagine that their great , great grandfather , a wealthy shipping magnate , had been kidnapped about 150 years ago .
The kidnappers demanded and received a large ransom that bankrupted the shipping magnate .
That ransom was used to start a successful company that still survives today and is worth $ 100 million .
Participants were asked whether they would be willing to be a part of a large suit against the present - day company that could net them each about $ 5,000 .
In this scenario , 61 percent agreed to have their names listed on the lawsuit .
The researchers noted that this is about the percentage of blacks today who support reparations for slave descendants .
" When white Americans find it within themselves to say ' I must be compensated for a past injustice done to me ' but the same logic evaporates when the injustice concerns black Americans , they are staring straight at bias , " Banaji said .
Mazzocco said the results of this research have implications for the fledgling reparations movement in America .
" Surveys show that 90 to 96 percent of white Americans are against slave descendant reparations .
It is nearly impossible to get that many people to agree on anything , so it is an issue that really deserves attention to see why that is .
We wanted to take a heated and emotional issue and look at it through a scientific lens , " he said .
The research was facilitated by a postdoctoral fellowship to Mazzocco from Ohio State 's Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity .
Other co-authors of the study included Timothy Brock of Ohio State , Gregory Brock of Georgia Southern University and Kristina Olson of Harvard .

I ’m just not buying it .
Sorry , but I am not buying that the only way to “ save the economy ” is with a $ 700 billion bailout package that has to be passed NOW !
NOW !
NOW !
Admittedly , I am not an economist .
But there has to be a better way to right the ship than charging every American taxpayer $ 5000 to make sure George Bush ’s Trust Fund buddies get their golden parachutes .
According to the 2007 IRS FactBook , there were 138,894,000 income taxes filed last year .
$ 700 billion divided by 138 million actually equals $ 5039.81 per taxpayer .
$ 700 billion divided by estimated US population of 305 million equals $ 2295.08 per every single person in the country .
Over the past two days I have been watching Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke do their best to frighten Congress into passing a bailout package before anyone has a chance to see what ’s in it .
Watching some of their “ The Sky is Falling ” testimony made me think of the run-up to the Iraq war , only this time , the “ mushroom cloud ” has been replaced with the ridiculous notion that our entire economic system will collapse in on itself .
Paulson and Bernanke ’s sweaty brows and bulging eyes as they sit in the hot lights before Congress bear more than a passing resemblance to all those equally bug - eyed administration mouthpieces who told us over and over that not only did Saddam Hussein have weapons of mass destruction , he was getting ready to use them against us .
Even the President ’s address the other night was reminiscent of when he went on the air in 2003 to explain to the American people why we had to invade Iraq .
This is an administration that has not only tried to use FEAR ! to scare the Congress into giving away our rights , but also has led us into a war on false pretenses .
Now , they are using the same tactics to try and get Congress to pass a $ 700 billion bailout package that most everyone , except the Bush administration , seems to think is fatally flawed .
It ’s despicable , but I wish I could say it is surprising .
Just look at this quote yesterday from Johnny Mac :
The meeting with Mr. Bush on Thursday was precipitated by a call from Mr. McCain , who cast his request as a matter of urgent national priority .
“ Following Sept. 11 , our national leaders came together at a time of crisis , ” he told a small group of reporters , while reading the brief statement from a teleprompter , in a small ballroom at the New York Hilton Hotel .
“ We must show that kind of patriotism now . ”
Sayfuckingwhat ?
Did he just use 9/11 to try and scare us into passing this horrible bailout package ?
You fucking scumbag .
Something does not add up .
Maybe the reason John McCain needs to suspend his campaign is because his millionaire wife and their buddies are finally losing money so NOW it ’s time to do something about the economy .
( And by the way , why is it so fucking important that John McCain , a guy who has admitted he does not know shit about the economy , so goddamn important to the process that he has to suspend the democratic process for a few days and rush back to Washington to be in on the negotiations ? )
One ca n’t help but wonder if the Administration That Cries Wolf is once again trying to sneak something past the American people .
Forgive me if I ca n’t help but think all the big noise they ’re making is because they know this is their last chance to bilk the taxpayer and make their buddies rich and they are afraid if they do n’t scare us into thinking that we do n’t even have time to read the bailout package we might realize they are just the same bunch of lying screwheads they always were .
This is an administration that has proven over and over that they do n’t know shit from shinola and will tell any tall tale they can to help their rich buddies get even richer at the expense of the rest of us .
Not only that , but these are the same idiots whose reckless policy and rigid adherence to a failed and flawed ideology that got us into this mess .
I just ca n’t bring myself to believe that these five failing banks will cause the end of capitalism .
These are people who invested poorly and got caught holding the bag when the music stopped , as Craig Ferguson ( of all fucking people ) put it last night .
They gambled and they lost and now they do n’t want to pay up .
In fact , they still want to keep their $ 45 million salaries and retirement packages for the great job they did running these companies into the ground .
No .
They need someone to bash them on the nose with a rolled up newspaper and say “ Bad screwhead fuckwads !
No ! ”
When I gamble and lose or I run up a credit card bill that is too much for me to pay , I do n’t get a government bailout , but these rich fucking idiots want $ 5,000 from every taxpayer ?
Screw them .
I want them tossed out on their asses and forced to stand in breadlines for the welfare checks that this bailout really is .
They have been making things up and betting against themselves , using money they do n’t have in order to make it look like they are profitable .
They have been robbing Peter to pay Paul for years , using one credit card to pay off another and the collection agencies have finally caught up with them .
I say good .
Let the fuckers drown .
The American economy will survive .
I have enough faith in the American people to believe that we can get through this .
Not every industry is failing .
Yes , credit may be tougher to come by for a while , but you know what ?
GOOD !
It ’s been too easy for too long for people with no conceivable way to pay back debt to get credit card after credit card and mortgage after mortgage , making these Ponzi Scheme motherfuckers on Wall Street very rich in the process .
It ’s time for people – and Wall Street and the fucking government – to start living within their means again .
Republicans may call Democrats “ Tax and Spenders ” but the fact is that Republicans are simply Spenders and it ’s time once again to let the grown - ups take over and start paying the bills .
These banks loaned money to people who were living above their means and could not possibly pay it back , yet the loaned them the cash anyway .
That ’s called poor business practice and – like the good free - market Republicans they are supposed to be – it ’s time to pay the piper and let the market correct itself .
But that ’s only the right thing to do when it happens to the little people , I guess .
Allowing the market to correct itself does n’t sound like all that bad an idea :
It does to Sweden .
The country was so far in the hole in 1992 — after years of imprudent regulation , short - sighted economic policy and the end of its property boom — that its banking system was , for all practical purposes , insolvent .
But Sweden took a different course than the one now being proposed by the United States Treasury .
And Swedish officials say there are lessons from their own nightmare that Washington may be missing .
Sweden did not just bail out its financial institutions by having the government take over the bad debts .
It extracted pounds of flesh from bank shareholders before writing checks .
Banks had to write down losses and issue warrants to the government .
That strategy held banks responsible and turned the government into an owner .
When distressed assets were sold , the profits flowed to taxpayers , and the government was able to recoup more money later by selling its shares in the companies as well .
Imagine , holding people responsible for their poor decisions .
Wow .
It boggles the mind .
Mr Giuliani's firm will advise on compliance
Indian drug firm Ranbaxy has hired ex-New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as an adviser , the company says .
The move comes a day after the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) banned the import of more than 30 generic drugs made by the drug firm .
The FDA said it imposed the ban after it found manufacturing quality problems at two Ranbaxy factories in India .
Ranbaxy said Mr Giuliani's consulting and investment firm will advise it and look into compliance issues .
Ranbaxy has said it is " very disappointed " with the decision of US drug authorities .
The import ban affects some popular generic versions of antibiotics and cholesterol medicines .
Key documents
In July , US prosecutors had alleged that Ranbaxy , India 's largest pharmaceutical company , deliberately lied about the quality of its low - cost drugs , including those for HIV .
The US Department of Justice wanted the firm to hand over key documents relating to drug testing procedures .
The firm was paid millions of dollars by the US government to provide low - cost HIV drugs for President Bush 's emergency plan for Aids relief , which was set up to help Aids patients in 120 countries around the globe .
Defending the reliability of its drugs , Ranbaxy had said the US Food and Drugs Administration had tested over 200 random samples of its products and found them " complying with all the specifications " .
In June the Japanese pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo agreed to pay more than $ 4bn ( £ 2bn ) for a controlling stake in the firm .
The US government has been investigating Ranbaxy since February 2006 when the FDA issued a warning letter over what it said were manufacturing violations found at a Ranbaxy factory in India .
Since then Ranbaxy has been trying to resolve the issue with US regulators .
Last year , US officials seized documents from Ranbaxy 's US headquarters in New Jersey .
In July , Justice Department prosecutors alleged that the company had systematically lied about the makeup of its generic drugs , which include a cheaper version of US drug maker Merck 's cholesterol pill Zocor .
Ranbaxy has denied any wrongdoing , saying the allegations were baseless .
The FDA will only approve cheaper generic drugs if they can be shown to be equivalent to the original drug .
US investigators had also alleged that Ranbaxy has used unapproved ingredients in its drugs .
Is Kim Jong
Il dead ?
Yes , North Korea ’s “ Dear Leader ” is no more , having passed away in the fall of 2003 , writes Waseda University professor Toshimitsu Shigemura in Shukan Gendai ( Aug 23-30 ) .
A one - time Mainichi Shimbun journalist posted in Seoul , Shigemura is introduced by the magazine as a leading authority on the Korean Peninsula .
His latest book , released this month , is titled “ The True Character of Kim Jong Il . ”
If true , the implications are potentially vast .
Among them : former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi ’s summit partner during one or both of his landmark visits to Pyongyang in 2002 and 2004 was not Kim himself but a dummy -- the stand - in Shigemura claims has been fooling the world for at least five years .
A dictator having one or multiple doubles is a familiar notion since Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein was shown to have deployed them .
But Saddam was alive at the time .
Kim , in Shigemura ’s scenario , was not manipulating a look - alike ; he was replaced by one .
Of course it ’s fantastic -- but in North Korea , says Shigemura , fantasy and reality are not mutually exclusive .
“ Japanese common sense cannot take the measure of North Korea ’s uniqueness , ” he writes .
“ For example : Kim came to Tokyo six times in the 1980s . ”
Then as now , North Korea and Japan had no diplomatic ties .
Kim , then heir to the throne under his father , “ Great Leader ” Kim Il Sung , apparently traveled incognito by ship .
His purpose : to take in the magic shows staged by magician Hikita Tenko at the upscale Cordon Bleu show pub in Akasaka .
Shigemura cites as sources ( without naming them ) several people close to Kim ’s family .
He hears from them that Kim ’s diabetes took a turn for the worse early in 2000 .
From then until his supposed death three and a half years later he was confined to a wheelchair .
Was the flurry of diplomatic activity in which the world saw Kim engaged during those years mere sleight of hand ?
The “ hermit kingdom ” seemed all of a sudden to grow remarkably outgoing .
In June 2000 Kim hosted the historic summit with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung .
The following month , he received Russian President Vladimir Putin .
In October his guest was U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
In January 2001 he visited China ; in August , Russia .
In September 2002 there occurred the first summit with Koizumi , culminating in Kim ’s admission , after decades of denial from Pyongyang , that North Korean agents had kidnapped Japanese nationals .
August 2003 saw the launch of the Six Party talks aimed at North Korea ’s nuclear disarmament .
“ Then suddenly , ” writes Shigemura in Shukan Gendai , “ the pace slows . ”
The second Kim - Koizumi summit , in 2004 , lasted all of 90 minutes .
Scheduled meetings with other foreign dignitaries were abruptly canceled .
Kim ’s retreat from the public eye was almost total .
State television in October 2003 showed him touring a collective farm , but mention of the date of the visit was conspicuously absent .
Kim ’s family , meanwhile , was in a state of upheaval .
His wife died -- of breast cancer , said official reports ; assassinated , according to persistent rumors .
His favorite sister , a high - ranking Communist Party official , suddenly moved to Paris .
Her husband lost his post .
Clearly something was afoot .
In the spring of 2006 , says Shigemura , American spy satellites succeeded in photographing Kim .
An analysis of the photographs led to an astonishing conclusion : Kim had grown 2.5 cm !
“ Recently , ” Shigemura proceeds , “ someone who was in contact with a Kim family member told me he heard the family member say , ‘ There ’s been a promise not to decide on Kim ’s successor so long as the current shogun is alive . ’ ”
“ ‘ Shogun ’ was Kim ’s nickname , ” Shigemura explains “ If Kim were alive , the family member would simply have said , ‘ the shogun ’ -- not ‘ the current shogun . ’
The stress on ‘ current ’ seems to suggest that the person in question is someone other than Kim Jong Il . ”
Shukan Gendai asks a government official who helped plan Koizumi ’s Pyongyang visits what he thinks of all this .
His reply : “ Rumors of a dummy Kim began circulating after the summit .
Some of us said we should have Kim ’s voice prints analyzed .
But if we did that and proved the prime minister had been conferring with a double , it could have destroyed the Koizumi administration .

I also loved her for her later comments about Sarah Palin — that it 's sexist to question if she can raise five kids AND be the vice president since no one would ask a man that , but that you also know there 's no way she 's gonna actually be raising the kids herself if she 's President .
All political spouses and their vote - seeking mates smile and extend their hands to the masses -- over and over and over , tens of thousands of times .
Today in Michigan , Cindy McCain had one handshake too many , and a presumably well - intentioned grip resulted in a sprain that sent her to a hospital in West Bloomfield for X - rays .
A campaign spokeswoman said McCain 's had previous surgeries for carpal tunnel syndrome and the handshake exacerbated the condition .
" Funny as it may sound , handshaking is a common source of people having sore hands , " says Dr. Leon Benson , professor of orthopedic surgery at Northwestern University School of Medicine .
" There are people , in the name of giving a strong handshake , who squeeze in a way that 's pretty uncomfortable . "
He himself remembers having a sore hand for three days after an aggressive handshake .
But surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome , unless it was within the last six to nine months , probably would n't make the hand or wrist any more vulnerable than normal , he said .
" If you catch somebody the wrong way , it can really hurt , but I 've never seen anything serious come of it . "
The American Academy of Orthopedic surgeons has a wealth of information on all sorts of injuries , including hand and wrist sprains and strains .

UPDATE : site loading as of 4:15 p.m. )
Meanwhile , anyone out there with adoring fans , whether politician or movie star , might consider wearing a wrist brace to signal a vulnerable extremity .
Cupping the hand could prevent a squeeze , or offering the fingers only , royalty - style , rather than the full hand .
Or you could always cross your arms over your chest , bow respectfully and say , " Sorry , but I think I 'm getting a cold and do n't want to spread germs . "
But those things might smack of social aloofness .
" There are so many social issues that arise over the meaning of a handshake , that people just suffer through it , " says Benson .

Paired with Sarah Palin 's absence from Friday night 's Presidential debate , this photo - op of the McCain 's boarding their campaign plane that afternoon for Mississippi is phenomenally awkward .
Given that the " visual vernacular " in a photo like this tends to reference the presidential and vice - presidential couple combined with the fact John , Cindy , Sarah and First Dude have been stuck together lately like super glue , this shot of Giuliani and Judy Nathan is particularly attention grabbing .
Typically , I would caution anyone from assuming , based on a photo like this , that McCain was even thinking of throwing Palin overboard .
Considering how McCain not only trotted out Giuliani this way , but also lined him up against Biden as McCain 's main post - debate spinmaster , though , it almost destines the photo to raise such speculation .
But then again , punitive acting out -- in this case , temporarily " elevating " Giuliani in order to publicly humiliate Palin for embarrassing McCain with her dismal interview with Katie Couric -- is also consistent with how McCain flies .

Well , if anyone had any doubt about how dirty this would get , wonder no more .
The Alaska Attorney General Talis Colberg ( 3rd in line for the Governor ’s throne should Palin win the VP slot , and Lt. Governor Sean Parnell win the House seat ) has announced that none of the 13 people state employees who were issued subpoenas in Palin ’s ethics investigation into the “ Troopergate ” scandal will testify , unless there is a unanimous vote from the full Senate or the entire Legislature .
In other words , the Attorney General has stated that nobody who is subpoenaed will show up .
Either the AG and the McCain campaign are genuinely afraid of what this investigation will uproot , or they are just trying once and for all to illustrate that the guy at the anti-Palin rally in Anchorage on Saturday who held aloft a sign reading “ Bush in a Skirt ” was right .
My money is on the former .
Oh , and five private citizens from the Fairbanks area today filed suit to halt the investigation on the grounds that the entire thing is unconstitutional .
And of course Palin herself has folded her arms , crinkled her nose and said she will no longer be cooperating in this investigation that she “ welcomed ” just a few short weeks before she was assimilated into the world of Republican politics on the national scale .
I keep searching for the appropriate Alaskan metaphor for overkill .
Swatting a mosquito with a sledge hammer ?
Shooting a moose with a cruise missile ?
Whatever metaphor you choose , the message is the same .
There ’s a whole lot of legal muscle , big league strategy , and nasty DC Rovian politics descending on our poor little town in the Last Frontier .
Makes you wonder what exactly there is to find , and how desperate they are to make it go away .
And , of course , there always has to be an official reason given for the stonewalling .
And it ’s usually a good laugh line , so here it is , from AG Talis Colberg :
“ This is an untenable position for our clients because the governor has so strongly stated that the subpoenas issued by your committee are of questionable validity . ”
Ahh .
It would be uncomfortable to testify because the governor does n’t want them to .
Now , I get it .
The silver lining in all this ?
The more paper they throw , the more tantrums they throw , the guiltier they look .
Long ago , Rep. Les Gara suggested to Palin that she confess to a bad judgment call , and hire Monegan back .
She did n’t listen .
And now the act of firing Monegan , which has gone so far to illustrate her temperament , her decision making ability , and her judgment , has come back to haunt her , with help from the McCain campaign .
There is a growing sense in the blogosphere , in local and national media , and among people I know , that the bloom is off the Palin rose .
Got this in my mailbox forwarded by a friend .
This might be oldie for some , but I have n't seen or read about it before .
Not about the crash but about the true story behind the crash .
Ca n't say if it 's made up either .
Tried to Google it and could n't find much except that authorities are ' investigating reasons for crash ' .
Make up your mind ! :P
THE TALE OF THE ARAB FLIGHT CREW
Written by To The Point News
Friday , 16 May 2008
The brand spanking new Airbus 340-600 , the largest passenger airplane ever built , sat in its hangar in Toulouse , France without a single hour of airtime .
Enter the Arab flight crew of Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies ( ADAT ) on November 15 , 2007 to conduct pre-delivery tests on the ground , such as engine run-ups , prior to delivery to Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi .
The ADAT crew taxied the A340 - 600 to the run-up area .
Then they took all four engines to takeoff power with a virtually empty aircraft .
Not having read the run-up manuals , they had no clue just how light an empty A340 - 600 really is .
The takeoff warning horn was blaring away in the cockpit because they had all 4 engines at full power .
The aircraft computers thought they were trying to takeoff but it had not been configured properly ( flaps / slats , etc . )
Then one of the ADAT crew decided to pull the circuit breaker on the Ground Proximity Sensor to silence the alarm .
This fools the aircraft into thinking it is in the air .
The computers automatically released all the brakes and set the aircraft rocketing forward .
The ADAT crew had no idea that this is a safety feature so that pilots can't land with the brakes on .
Not one member of the seven - man Arab crew was smart enough to throttle back the engines from their max power20setting , so the $ 200 million brand - new aircraft crashed into a blast barrier , totaling it .
The extent of injuries to the crew is unknown , for there has been a news blackout in the major media in France and elsewhere .
Coverage of the story was deemed insulting to Arabs .
Finally , the photos are starting to leak out .
Contrary to the old adage , crime really does pay - at least for a while .
Here are the stories of 6 rich criminals who , while did n't know how to live good , they did know how to live very well .
1 . John Palmer ( ca. 1947 - ) British bad boy John Palmer suckered over 16,000 people in a phony time - share scheme .
Currently ranked Great Britain's wealthiest criminal , having amassed ill - gotten wealth of over £ 300 million , the notorious Mr. Palmer owns a fleet of cars and several houses all over England , including a huge estate at Landsdown in Bath .
He even has a cool nickname : Goldfinger .
Which does n't mean he has a golden rep .
Palmer defended himself in the fraud trial , lost , got eight years in the clink , and has so far been slapped with fines of £ 5 million .
But this was n't his first criminal activity .
In 1983 he took part in the U.K.'s greatest - ever robbery , in which he and a partner stole £ 26 million in gold bullion from a cargo storage company at Heathrow Airport .
He smelted the gold himself and was arrested when police found two gold bars , still warm , under his sofa .
( Photo : BBC ) 2 . Pablo Escobar ( 1949 - 1993 )
Picture every stereotypical South American drug dealer you 've ever seen in a movie .
They 're all based in part on Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria , head of the Colombian Medellin cartel .
Escobar ran his empire from a lavish pad complete with Arabian horses , a miniature bullfighting ring , a private landing strip , a Huey 50 helicopter , and a private army of bodyguards .
Clearly money was n't an object for the man .
After all , he could afford to pay local authorities $ 250,000 each to turn a blind eye .
Plus , he used his money to build schools and hospitals , and was even elected to the Colombian senate .
But eventually the pressure from authorities , including the American DEA , got to be too much and he turned himself in .
Of course , incarceration did n't stop him from living the lush life .
Escobar used some of his loot to convert his prison into a personal fortress , even remodeling all the bathrooms and strengthening the walls .
Once he left , he was a fugitive again , but he was n't hard to track down .
An obsessive misophobe , Escobar left a conspicuous trail of dilapidated hideouts with shiny , expensive new bathrooms .
In the end , the cocaine kingpin was killed when the secret police tracked his cell phone to an apartment , stormed the building , and shot him .
Many , many times .
3 . Mother Mandelbaum ( 1818 - 1894 )
One of New York City 's earliest criminal godfathers was actually a godmother .
Fredericka " Mother " Mandelbaum , or " Marm " to her friends , was the top " fence " ( buyer and seller of stolen goods ) in post - Civil War New York .
From 1862 to 1882 , she 's estimated to have processed almost $ 10 million in stolen stuff .
In fact , Mandelbaum made enough money to purchase a three - story building at 79 Clinton Street .
Running her business out of a bogus haberdashery on the bottom floor , and living with her family in opulence and comfort on the top two floors , " Mother " often threw lavish dinners and dances for the criminal elite , which included corrupt cops and paid - off politicos .
Ma Mandelbaum could afford to eat well , too , and allegedly tipped the scales at over 250 pounds .
But like any good criminal , she gave back .
Well , kind of .
Mandelbaum ran a school on Grand Street where orphans and waifs learned to be professional pickpockets and sneak thieves .
She was finally arrested in 1884 , but fled to Canada with over a million dollars in cash before the trial .
She remained there in comfort and safety until her death in 1894 .
4 . L. Dennis Kozlowski ( 1946 - ) OK , so he's not a criminal in the classic " bang bang , shoot 'em up " kind of way .
But this scumbag still has it coming .
The former CEO of Tyco International , along with CFO Mark Swarz , allegedly embezzled an estimated $ 600 million from his company , its employees , and its stockholders .
He borrowed $ 19 million , interest free , to buy a house , a debt that the company then forgave as a " special bonus . "
He got an $ 18 million apartment in Manhattan and charged the company $ 11 million more for artwork and furnishings , including a $ 6,000 shower curtain and $ 2,200 garbage can .
He even threw his wife a little 40th birthday soiree on the island of Sardinia that cost the company over two million clams .
Special musical guest : Jimmy Buffett .
And while a mistrial was initially declared in April of 2004 , the best lawyers could n't keep Kozlowski and his cohorts from changing residences from their very big house to the Big House .
5 . Leona Helmsley ( 1920 - 2007 )
The famous New York real estate mogul and class - A witch lived the American Dream .
Well , except for the whole prison thing .
Leona was a divorced sewing factory worker with mouths to feed before she met and married real estate tycoon Harry Helmsley ( the fact that he was already married mattered little ) .
In 1980 , Harry named Leona president of his opulent Helmsley Palace Hotel , which she ruled like a despot .
Her tendency to explode at employees for the smallest infraction ( like a crooked lampshade ) earned her the title " Queen of Mean . "
The tyranny did n't exactly last .
In 1988 , Leona and Harry were indicted for a smorgasbord of crimes , including tax fraud , mail fraud , and extortion .
And after numerous appeals , Leona served 18 months in prison and was forced to pay the government $ 7 million in back taxes .
A healthy dose of irony for the woman who once said , " Only the little people pay taxes . "
Of course , that does n't mean things turned out that badly for poor Leona .
Said to be worth over 2.2 billion bucks , the dreaded Ms. H. still owns the lease to the Empire State Building and lives in luxury with her aptly named dog , Trouble .
[ Ed. note : Leona Helmsley died in 2007 , two years after this article was first published ]
6 . Al CApone ( 1899 - 1947 ) He killed people .
He bought cops by the precinctful .
He bootlegged liquor .
He ran Chicago like his own personal kingdom .
He was damn good at what he did , and he did it with style .
Al Capone ( aka Scarface ) maintained a swank Chicago headquarters in the form of a luxurious five - room suite at the chic Metropole Hotel ( rate : $ 1,500 a day ) .
And when those Chicago winters proved a little too chilly for him , he bought a 14 - room Spanish - style estate in Palm Island , Florida , which he spent millions turning into a well - decorated fortress .
Capone 's total wealth has been estimated at over $ 100 million ( not a penny of which was kept in his vaults , as Geraldo Rivera learned on live TV ) .
Not bad for a guy whose business card said he was a used furniture dealer .
Of course , he did n't pay taxes on any of it , which is what eventually sent him up the river .
I ’d like to share 5 lessons I ’ve learned , that I wish I ’d learned in college — or much earlier on in my business career .
These five things have had the biggest impact on my success so far in my small business :
1. Stop Being a Control Freak
Learning the fine line between giving direction and delegating is one of the toughest things for me .
My natural tendency is to want to do it all myself .
Of course , I can’t .
I have to keep checking myself .
I ’m far from perfect .
But I ’ve found that it helps to visualize the power of leverage .
Getting 5 sets of hands working on your business means greater success than one set of hands — even if those hands are part - time or just a few hours a month from a service provider .
Try visualizing this incredibly simple graphic if you , too , need help checking your tendencies to be a control freak :
2. Build Incrementally
There are different schools of thought about growth .
Some are of the “ go big or go home ” approach .
Been there , done that .
The approach that I feel most comfortable with is one of developing products and services gradually , making incremental enhancements .
Start small , spend as little as you can , and build on early successes .
Quickly dump the stuff that does n’t work out .
If you take this approach , your risks of going down the wrong path and spending lots of development time and money on offerings that fail , will be minimal .
It ’s also a way to gather market research along the way .
You learn what customers want and you ’re early enough you can build that feedback into your offering .
3. Think About a Business Problem the Last Thing at Night
Often you hear advice that suggests you should compartmentalize and put your problems out of your mind , especially late at night when you want to get some sleep .
But for solving business problems , I ’ve found the opposite works .
I will sit down at my computer for 15 minutes right before going to bed .
I ’ll look at an email message that outlines a troubling problem or I will just jot down a problem and study it .
I say to myself , “ I ’ll think about this overnight . ”
Then I go to bed .
You see , your subconscious mind works while you sleep .
Thinking about a business problem the last thing at night is how you harness your subconscious to work on that problem .
Sometimes I literally will wake up with the solution — or easily think of several potential solutions the next day .
4. Treat Your Computer Systems Like a Factory Production Line
For millions of business owners like me , our computers are the biggest set of business equipment we have — and they ’re crucial .
Without a computer system , I can not operate my business .
Yet , why do so many of us still treat our computer systems as if they ’re discretionary gadgets ?
That ’s one of the mysteries of the universe .
It ’s the Rodney Dangerfield syndrome — they “ get no respect . ”
We do n’t back up our data regularly .
We do n’t do maintenance ( such as de-fragging or critical updates ) the way we should .
Our electronic files are a disorganized mess .
We practically ignore our computer systems until a problem happens .
Then the problem turns into a full - blown crisis .
When I worked in the corporate world , the division I worked in had a factory .
The division was in the electronic publishing industry , and the factory involved scanning of documents , manual data entry , and the output of CDs and microfiche at the other end .
Knowledge - work , but still a factory .
Business was booming and that factory operated 3 shifts , 24 hours a day .
Often when I would visit the factory , I would see a part of one operation or another shut down for a few hours , while the employees worked on maintaining the equipment ( including computer equipment ) .
The plant manager never said to himself , “ we ’re so busy we ca n’t afford to stop and do a few hours maintenance . ”
No , he knew that regular maintenance would keep the production lines running and yield the highest throughput each month .
5. Pretend you Have an Accounting Department
Everybody in business hears the standard advice about the need to track and understand your financial numbers .
Unfortunately , that kind of advice is easy to give , but hard to follow . 🙂
Part of the reason startup entrepreneurs avoid bookkeeping in the early years is that the numbers can be flat - out dismal .
I hate to look at bad numbers .
I like to work on things that make me feel good .
Paltry numbers or negative bottom lines do not make me feel good .
But you know what ?
Those numbers are unlikely to get better unless we as business owners find the courage to face them .
The biggest challenge for me was getting past my emotional block .
To overcome that block , I would pretend I had an accounting department .
I scheduled a few hours every weekend to “ be the accounting department . ”
It was n’t ME personally looking at the numbers , something that would have made me feel like I personally was failing .
Rather , it was the accounting department looking at the numbers — in a detached manner .
Looking at your financial numbers is one of the most clarifying of activities .
I was able to “ see ” things in my business I never saw before , weed out the low value activities , and focus on profitability .

Much has been made lately by the liberal blogs about Karl Rove ’s acknowledgment that Senator John McCain ’s campaign has been stretching the truth .
What Mr. Rove , the former political strategist for President Bush , actually said was that both Mr. McCain and Senator Barack Obama have “ gone one step too far ” in their assertions about each other .
He gave an example involving Mr. Obama , then was asked about Mr. McCain .
This is the part of his quote that gets repeated :
“ McCain has gone , in some of his ads , similarly gone one step too far in sort of attributing to Obama things that are , you know , beyond the 100 - percent truth test , ” Mr. Rove said Sunday on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
For the architect of the two successful Bush presidential campaigns to call out his fellow Republican , that was surprising enough .
By now , I assume you ’ve all heard the news .
This will be Stargate Atlantis ’s fifth and final season .
I ’m disappointed but not surprised .
We came into this year knowing that renewal would be a longshot .
With 100 episodes under our belts , rising production costs , and the US dollar ’s steep decline , the odds were stacked against us .
Still , we ’d heard no definite word either way and if SG - 1 ’s surprising 10 - year run taught us one thing , it ’s that anything is possible .
The circumstances that contributed to SG - 1 ’s longevity were very different but , back then , we had n’t expected it to get a sixth season pick - up either .
Furthermore , with our strong premiere numbers and the equally impressive showing of the ensuing episodes , some of us were , if not exactly upbeat , then cautiously optimistic .
We watched .
We waited .
And , finally , received word the other day .
We told the cast first , then headed down to set and broke the news to the crew .
These are people who have given so much of themselves over the show ’s five - year run and we felt it only right that they hear it from us rather than finding out about it elsewhere .
It ’s been a bittersweet couple of days .
On the one hand , I ’m sorry to see the series end but , on the other hand , I ’m extremely proud of what we ’ve accomplished .
100 episodes is pretty damn impressive feat and , as evidenced by the quality of recent stories and the uptick in the ratings , we ’ll be going out on a high .
Even though I see a lot of anger directed at both MGM and Sci Fi , the fact is we could n’t have done it without their support .
And we ’re going to count on that support as Atlantis continues its adventures as a movie franchise .
Episode 20 , Enemy at the Gate , will mark our 100th episode and , contrary to online speculation , we will not be ending things with a cliffhanger .
Regardless of whether we got the pick - up or not , we had always planned a clean conclusion to our 100th episode , one that would hopefully leave fans satisfied yet eager for more .
And that “ more ” will come in the form of the Stargate Atlantis movie …
About a month ago , with so much uncertainty about the future of the series , Rob Cooper pitched out the idea of shooting the SGA movie at the end of this season .
His thinking was that if the series did end , we would have a movie in hand .
If , however , the series was picked up , the “ SGA movie ” ( codenamed Project Twilight ) would simply become the opening two episodes of the show ’s sixth season .
Alas , this notion never got past the consideration stage and , as a result , we wo n’t be rolling right into it as planned .
On the bright side , however , the network has greenlit the movie and we do have a terrific idea in mind .
Obviously , I ca n’t say much about it at this point but suffice it to say that it should include the entire cast in addition to a certain gaunt and pallid flowing - locked guest star .
And , if it proves anywhere as successful as the first two SG - 1 direct - to - video features , you can be assured that this will be the first in a long , long line of Stargate Atlantis movies .
Like my grandmother used to say :
Whenever a gate closes , a hyperspace window opens …

Newswise — Barack Obama is the preferred U.S. presidential candidate in all 22 nations polled for the BBC World Service by the University of Maryland and Globescan .
On average , Obama was preferred by a four to one margin ( 49 percent to 12 percent ) over his Republican rival John McCain in the poll of 22,000 people .
But the margin ranged widely across nations , with Obama favored by nine percent in India to 82 percent in Kenya .
Nearly 40 percent of those surveyed did not take a position .
This was particularly the case in Russia , Turkey and Egypt .
The results are drawn from a survey of 22,531 adult citizens across 22 countries conducted for the BBC World Service by the University of Maryland Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) and the international polling firm GlobeScan .
A parallel poll surveyed 1,000 U.S. adult citizens .
GlobeScan coordinated fieldwork between July 8 , 2008 and August 27 , 2008 .
Countries Polled : Canada , Mexico , Panama , Brazil , United Kingdom , Germany , Poland , France , Italy , Turkey , Lebanon , United Arab Emirates , Egypt , Nigeria , Kenya , Russia , India , China , Singapore , Indonesia , Australia and the Philippines .
Expected Impact on International Relations
The poll also explored the expected impact of the U.S. election .
In 17 of the 22 countries surveyed , the most common view is that if Barack Obama is elected president , America 's relations with the rest of the world are likely to get better .
If John McCain is elected , the most common view in 19 countries is that relations will stay about the same as they are now .
The countries most optimistic that an Obama presidency would improve relations are America 's NATO allies - Canada ( 69 percent ) , France ( 62 percent ) , Germany ( 61 percent ) , United Kingdom ( 54 percent ) , Italy ( 64 percent ) - as well as Australia ( 62 percent ) and the African countries Kenya ( 87 percent ) and Nigeria ( 71 percent ) .
U.S. Companion Poll
In a separate poll conducted in the U.S. , Americans also said an Obama presidency would improve U.S. relations with the world more than a McCain administration , with 46 per cent of Americans expecting relations to improve if Obama is elected compared to 30 percent for McCain .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Green Party , which captured far less than 1 percent of the vote in the last presidential election , chose former Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney as its 2008 presidential candidate on Saturday .
McKinney , 53 , will be joined on the ticket for the November election by vice presidential candidate Rosa Clemente , a hip - hop artist and activist .
McKinney received 313 out of 532 votes cast at the party ’s nominating convention in Chicago , party spokesman Scott McLarty said .
In 2004 , the Green Party drew 119,859 votes , or 0.1 percent of the total , finishing in sixth place behind the two major parties and three other third - party tickets .
The party ’s best performance came in 2000 when Ralph Nader headed the ticket , and won 2.8 million votes , or 2.7 percent of the total .
Some political analysts say Nader , a political and consumer activist , may have drawn votes from Democrat Al Gore and helped tip the election to Republican George W. Bush .
Nader is running for president again this year as an independent .
McKinney served six terms in Congress and lost her 2006 bid for re-election .
She was the first black woman to represent Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Another former House member from Georgia , Bob Barr , who served as a Republican , is running as the Libertarian Party candidate for president .
The major - party candidates are Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain .
The U.S. Green Party says it is a partner with the European Federation of Green Parties and the Federation of Green Parties of the Americas .
“ Green parties are the first parties to recognize that our role in the world is stewardship of Earth ’s natural resources rather than domination and unrestrained consumption of the goods of the Earth , ” the party said in its proposed platform for the 2008 election .
When a company is having a fire sale due to risky business practices , should they be receiving this kind of compensation ?
I realize this team came in after Stanley O’Neal led them into this problem but this still seems excessive .
Let ’s not forget that taxpayers have been giving away billions in loans that are about half the rate of * official * inflation , so it ’s not as though Wall Street has been on their own .
Looking at how poorly this sector is doing and the fact that former CEO Stanley O’Neal walked away with $ 161 million , this is a problem .
CEO
Thain has himself only been at Merrill since last December .
The tax code – that helps makes all of this as easy and pain - free as possible for companies and CEOs – has to be updated .
Is it fair that companies pay for the taxes of executives ?
How many Americans have such giveaways and how is that even allowed ?
Nobody is asking for handouts ( besides CEOs ) but Americans are looking for some fairness .
When business does well , everyone should profit accordingly , not just a couple of people .
As we are seeing yet again , the profits are always limited to the top of the food chain .

We put up with too many cables .
There are at least four different kinds of USB plugs , two kinds of FireWire and like a million different ways to connect something to TV or monitor .
Modern gadget life can be kind of retarded in this way .
Why not one kind of cable , or just a couple ?
I do n't know .
But until everyone gets on the same appendage - to - hole scheme , in the meantime , you can use this : an illustrated guide to pretty much every kind of cable you will see in current gadgets and what it 's used for ( unless , you know , Sony springs a new one on us overnight , which is honestly possible ) .

Clarification : USB 2.0 adds in the Battery Charging specification 1.0 , which allows for dedicated charging and other power goodness .
This particular connector is the type A variety .
It plugs everything from your iPod to your digital camera into a computer , or whatever else .
If you have n't seen this before , what are you reading this on ?

USB Type B The USB
Type B plug is basically a USB connector for peripherals - you 've probably seen it jacked into a printer or scanner .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Mini USB
It 's a type of USB connector for smaller devices like cameras and phones - it takes up less real estate than a port for a Type A connection , obviously .

Micro USB
Even smaller than the above Mini USB .
Since it 's , like , even smaller , we 're starting to see it adopted by LG , Motorola and others - hopefully this is the last time they all switch power adapters on us , till wireless power makes adapters unnecessary .
Update : Better pic via Mobile Burn .

IEEE 1394 ( aka FireWire )
An alternative to USB , Apple popularized the IEEE 1394 interface as FireWire ( Sony called it i.LINK ) .
You 're probably most familiar with it on a digital camcorder ( or an old school iPod ) , since it 's really speedy for data transfers .
You 're looking at the four - and six - pin versions of FireWire 400 .
The six - pin version delivers power , the four - pin version ( originally favored by Sony ) does n't .

FireWire 800 A revised , faster version of FireWire introduced in 2003 , it does n't use the same connectors as the original , making it rare for non pros-and an unnecessary pain the ass .

RJ45
The kind of plug you 're used to seeing on the end of a Category 5 , Cat5 enhanced or Cat6 ( commonly known as Ethernet ) cable , which is plugged into your router or computer 's networking port .
Cat5e is an update to Cat5 that supports faster Gigabit Ethernet .
Cat6 is the next - gen standard that will handle speeds twice as fast as Cat5e , and has stricter rules about noise and crosstalk .
Interestingly , the most recently approved IEEE 1394 spec ( aka FireWire S800T ) uses RJ45 connectors as well .

eSATA External Serial ATA is a branch off of the Serial ATA interface that connects your hard drive to your computer if it was put together in the last couple of years .
As you can guess from the name , the difference is it's an external port , but it delivers the same insane data transfer speeds as the hookup to your hard drive .
Faster than USB or FireWire , it 's basically for external hard drives for quicker data transfers .
You 'll be seeing it more as more laptops include a port for it , usually one that can also be used with USB .
There 's even talk of bus -powered eSATA coming in the next year or two .

HDMI High - Definition Multimedia
Interface is another one of those " it'll connect everything except all the stuff it does n't " deals , but for high - definition audio and video .
It basically replaces DVI ( see below ) plus S - Video and all that other analog crap .
Laptops , desktops and even high - end cameras and other gadgets are getting HDMI .
Besides fat bandwidth , another benefit is control : The Consumer Electronics Control ( CEC ) profile already lets machines send commands to other products over HDMI - that or something like it could be very useful in the PC space , too .
Advertisement
DVI
The digital successor to VGA , Digital Visual Interface is a video connection you 'll most likely see dealing with computers or computer monitors , at least until they 're all replaced by HDMI .
Older HDTVs have DVI ports too .
It can have a few different pin arrangements , depending on whether it carries a digital ( DVI - D ) or analog ( DVI - A ) signal or both ( DVI - I , for integrated ) .
The analog deal on some types is to make them easy to adapt for use with a VGA monitor , but it 's less and less noteworthy .
There 's also a dual - link version that carries more data for high - res displays .
These are helpfully depicted at Wikipedia .
Advertisement
Mini and Micro DVI are dumb , shrunken , Apple - only versions of DVI .
Why dumb ?
Because they 're essentially proprietary formats .
HDMI will make them obsolete before long .
Advertisement
DisplayPort is the newest video interface on the block , and its plane of existence is basically in the computer - to - monitor realm only .
It 's not even close to mainstream yet , but Dell is backing it , among others , so you might wanna know it .
It can carry a whole lot of data , but it 's got DRM built into the spec , so it 's a double - edged sword .
Update : Swapped pic out with a better one .

Off the rails
by Jeremy Hooper
So what are the " pro-family " folks at the Campaign For Children and Families , major supporters of the attempt to ban marriage in California , saying on their " Save California " website today ?
Well , they are using the sexual orientation of Rob Sanchez , the late engineer at the helm of the recent tragic Metrolink crash , to make some sort of political point :
( highlighting our own )
No attempt to criticize any of Mr. Sanchez 's potentially negligent actions ( like texting ) .
There 's no attempt to mourn the tragedy .
No , no -- " unstable homosexual " is the only point they think their readers need to know , and the real " tragedy " that everyone should apparently be mourning .
Unreal .
But of course this means that we can put up a big , bold - texted exploitative headline the next time an evangelical " pro-family " Christian and 25 others tragically lose their lives in a accident .
Except , wait -- oh yea , that 's right : WE WOULD NEVER , EVER CONSIDERING DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT !
And why ?
BECAUSE HUMAN LIVES AND DECENCY ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO US THAN OUR POLITICAL ENDEAVORS !
:: sigh : : Can we all just go ahead and admit that the anti-gay side , in general , is simply not the nice one ?!
Because we can probably stomach a few more years of this so - called " culture war , " but we 're not sure how much of our opposition 's undeserved morality - hijkacking we can take .
The casting just does not fit the play !

Your thoughts
" Unstable " from Webster 's dictionary : not stable : not firm or fixed : not constant :as
a : not steady in action or movement : irregular
b : wavering in purpose or intent : vacillating
c : lacking steadiness : apt to move , sway , or fall
d ( 1 ) : liable to change or alteration ( 2 ) : readily changing ( as by decomposing ) in chemical or physical composition or in biological activity
e : characterized by lack of emotional control I do n't see connection with the headline description .
Sounds like slanderous or libelous words to me , ca n't you sue for that ?

So , while it is outrageous , insensitive and exceptionally bad taste , at least there are very few who regularly view the incendiary content from these lunatics .
It also does bring into specific relief the sheer magnitude of the hatred that those factions harbor .
And , it makes it pretty difficult for them to make a proffer of an underlying " compassion " with such overt acts of hostility .
All that being said , I do plan to contact the PR people at Metrolink and let them know what these wackos are saying .

I am also a post op TS and a lesbian .
When I saw this I was beyond outraged , mainly from a professional point of view .
The outside world knows little to nothing about the life that Sanchez lives as a railroader just like no one other than a railroader know what I live with everyday I step on my engines .
Nor do most of them really care .

I think a bigger concern is how this demonstrates bias beyond " we do n't like gays " to " gays should n't be hired . "
And many of our opponents want to go even further .

Okay , I 'm generally a " lurker " on this site but this one has enraged me enough to post .
I am simply stunned that someone could make a connection like this .
It 'd be one thing if there was not a loss of life , but there was .
Simply unacceptable .

Answer to an Amory Lovins Disciple Who Believes in Conservation , Solar , Wind and Micropower
September 11th , 2008 by Rod Adams
In addition to my efforts on Green Options publications like CleanTechnica , I also publish a blog titled Atomic Insights .
On that blog , I have recently been engaged in a conversation with a reader named Gordon , who is a believer in the energy supply systems that Amory Lovins has been advocating for more than 35 years .
I addressed this response to Gordon , but it is a more generally applicable response for anyone who wants to follow the non-nuclear “ soft energy path ” .
Gordon :
One thing you apparently do not understand about nuclear fission is that it can come in a variety of sizes .
Not all plants are the extra large central station power plants that you are discussing .
I am currently the only ( unpaid ) employee of Adams Atomic Engines , Inc .
We have not yet gained sufficient investor traction to move forward with our design , but our plan is to produce plants in sizes ranging from about 1 – 50 MWe .
Our plants will use long - lived reactors as heat sources for turbo machines that closely resemble the gas turbines engines that have enabled low capital costs for systems burning natural gas .
Our advantages will be that our heat costs about 1/3 as much , it will be available anywhere in the world , and it does not release any greenhouse gases at all .
Though Adams EnginesTM are pretty far off at this point – my stubborn streak has interfered with my ability ability to raise sufficient capital – there are better organized companies that are pursuing similar concepts .
Hyperion Power Generation , for example , is focusing on a heating unit that is small enough to fit on the back of an over - the - road truck that can produce 70 MW of thermal energy constantly for several years .
I spoke to the company founder for The Atomic Show Podcast and he explained how his company is establishing the supply chain needed to build 4,000 units that will be able to provide heat for about $ 3 per million BTU .
By comparison , liquified natural gas sold in Japan last week for $ 20 per million BTU .
Hyperion ’s patented technology was developed by a Los Alamos National Laboratory team led by Otis ( Pete ) Peterson and is backed by Altira Group LLC .
They are the real deal and have designed a system that meets every design criteria that Lovins could want – except the fact that it uses nuclear fission as the heat source .
After reading Lovins ’s work dating back more than 35 years , I know he has a firm aversion to that basic physical phenomenon .
Hyperion is not alone in thinking that small , simple , passively safe fission power plants can change the world .
I also spoke recently to the CEO and the Chief Technology Officer for NuScale Power , a company that grew out of a research project at Oregon State University .
Their system , originally called the Multi-Application Simple Light Water Reactor ( MASLWR ) , is designed to be built in a factory and transported to a site on a ship , train , specialized truck or barge ready to produce 45 MW of electricity .
The entire nuclear steam supply system will be in a container that is 60 feet long and 15 feet in diameter .
Again , NuScale is up and running with a good chance of success .
The CTO began his career with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and has taught engineering at Oregon State University for more than 20 years .
The CEO – Paul Lorenzini – was the president of PacifCorp and was lured out of retirement by his belief in the idea that the system could meet a real and pressing market need .
I know some of the members of the team that is now doing the detailed design and will be leading the licensing effort .
They are some of the smartest and most innovative engineers I have met in the nuclear industry .
NuScale is backed by CMEA Ventures .
Like many evangelists , Amory Lovins preaches a message that has a certain attraction and even some validity , but because he is a professional anti-nuke he has assiduously avoided the only known technology that could make his post - fossil fuel , distributed power system actually workable .
I have told him – in person – at least twice about the existence of small , distributed nuclear fission power plants , but that message has apparently not been received .
There is no such thing as “ firmed wind ” or reliable solar power in a world where windless high pressure areas often rest over entire countries for days to weeks and where the sun sets every single day and is interrupted by dense clouds on a regular basis .
Highly sophisticated wind - based transportation demonstrated its very real limitations compared to even primitive coal - fueled steam engines more than 150 years ago , but nuclear fission power is currently propelling some of the fastest and most reliable ships on the ocean .
Emission free nuclear fission power has been proven reliable at the North Pole , in Antarctica , Alaska , Siberia , and other remote locations where the weather is harsh and deadly .
In many remote places , the only way to use less power is to avoid going there , but sometimes that is not an option .
When you or Lovins claim that you can always fall back on grid power or even distributed combustion based “ micropower ” people like me and Atomic Insights readers see that as an acknowledgment that you plan to always have a large component of fossil fuel in your future power and energy systems .
Since most of us believe that the world is going to use more energy in the future , not less , we see that vision as a de facto endorsement of an ever increasing dependence on a depleting and polluting fuel source .
In the case of Lovins , I believe he knows that he is really selling coal , oil and gas .
I am not sure about you yet .
Fission makes that continued , nearly exclusive dependence unnecessary .
The grid that I envision includes some large central station nuclear power plants like those being built by Areva , Westinghouse , Atomstroyexport , GE , Toshiba , and Mitsubishi .
Those plants will fit into our existing , expensively constructed grids to provide stability and replace the coal and natural gas fired power plants that currently provide 70 % of the electricity in the US .
It also includes lot of small nukes like those advocated by Hyperion , NuScale , Toshiba , and Adams Atomic Engines , Inc. to supply power to places not reached by the existing grid and to fill in weak spots or incremental growth in grid supplied areas .
My future energy visions includes distributed nuclear fission power on ships , nuclear fission powered electrified trains , plug in electric vehicles , and possibly even atomic turbine engines directly powering large aircraft .
There are sufficient stores of uranium and thorium in the world to supply the kind of abundant , reliable power system needed to enable human comfort , ingenuity and development for thousands of years .
PS – I am under verbal non-disclosure agreements with two more companies that should be announcing their entries into the small nuclear power plant market by the end of this year .
There is plenty of room for more entries , the potential size of the market is measured in the trillions of dollars .

The Space Shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to launch next month ( October 8th ) , carrying new instruments , batteries and gyroscopes to the Hubble Space Telescope .
This will be the final servicing mission to Hubble , the 30th flight of the 23 - year old Atlantis , and one of the final 10 flights of the Space Shuttle program , which will be retired in 2010 .
Even though Shuttle launches may seem to have become commonplace , their preparation and execution is still a months - long process , requiring the work and diligence of thousands to make sure the aging , complex systems are all in perfect condition for launch .
Here are some photos of the ongoing preparations for the launch of this mission , STS - 125 , some of the people involved in making it work , and the crew , who will assume the risks to help keep Hubble alive .

The court 's decision is just the latest word in an evolving national discussion of what to do with captured " terrorists . "
Congress and the White House have been wrestling with this since Sept. 11 , 2001 , and will continue to do so .
Even those who applauded the court 's defense of habeas corpus are not so sure that federal courts are the right place for " enemy combatants " to appeal their detention .
And among those who side with the court , few would argue that enemy combatants are owed the full legal protections enjoyed by citizens .
But certainly anyone arrested and locked away deserves the chance to challenge their arrest .
I ’m a coffee addict .
When it gets too hot in the summer , I ’ll stop drinking hot and make myself some iced .
There ’s several schools of thought on making iced coffee at home : some make regular hot coffee , then chill it , some pour hot over ice , some cold - brew .
In my younger , naive days , I would make hot coffee , let it cool , then chill it further with the addition of cold milk .
But wisdom–and experience–tells me that cold - brew is the path of least resistance and provides the best buzz for your buck .
Seriously .
You wo n’t go back .
And you can save a few bucks by making your own at home .
The all - too - simple directions , after the jump .
You need nothing fancy for this .
No french press , no percolator , just a large glass jar or similar container .
This is a small step towards conservation –no electricity needed except to grind your own beans , if you so desire .
Add to the jar a half - cup of your favorite ( hopefully organic , free - trade ) coffee beans , ground .
Fill the jar with water .
Shake that bad boy up .
Let it sit on the counter for at least 12 , if not 24 hours .
When you want a cup , filter through coffee filter .
Cut with a little bit of cream or half - and - half , or do like I do and go 50 / 50 coffee and your choice of milk .
The flavor of the coffee is more pronounced , more nuanced .
You taste what that coffee is supposed to taste like .
Hey , take it easy your first time .
This stuff can knock you on your tail .
You ’re going to be feeling it if you suck down two of these in less than an hour .
I recently went to a new coffee shop in town and had two iced coffees in about three hours .
I was practically shaking when it was time to go .
I asked the barista about their iced coffee .
“ Oh , we cold - brew . ”
That ’s what I thought .

A robot dog that runs , climbs rough terrain and carries heavy loads has become an internet sensation after video footage attracted millions of viewers .
BigDog was created by engineering company Boston Dynamics for the American military .
The robot , which is the size of a large dog , is powered by a gasoline engine that drives its hydraulic system .
In trials the intrepid hound was able to run at 4 mph , climb slopes up to 35 degrees steep and walk across rubble while carrying a 340 lb load .
The robotic rover has legs that move like an animal 's and can absorb shock by repositioning its three joints up to 500 times a second .
During a demonstration video , which was viewed by more than 6 m people on YouTube , it managed to keep its footing on an uneven surface after being shoved sideways .
BigDog has an on - board computer that helps it to balance , steer and navigate as conditions vary .
Other sensors focus on the internal state of the robot , monitoring the hydraulic pressure , oil temperature , engine temperature and battery charge .
Current models are remote - controlled from bases , however it is believed scientists are working on sight sensors that will allow BigDog to make basic movement decisions .
The project was sponsored by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which comes up with radical inventions for the military .

International cooperation in human spaceflight may be facing its toughest test since the cold war .
The immediate concern : Will US astronauts be able to ride Russian rockets between 2010 , when the last shuttle is retired , and 2015 , when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to launch a replacement ?
Russian spacecraft are how NASA plans to send its astronauts to the International Space Station .
But with tensions rising over Russia ’s invasion of Georgia and a US - Polish missile deal , some lawmakers and space - policy analysts worry that the US Congress – or Russia itself – could scuttle the plan .
If tensions fail to ease over the longer term , the space station could shift from an orbiting laboratory to a geopolitical bargaining chip .
The possibility that international tensions could limit US access to the space station for at least five years “ is a real concern , ” says Ray Williamson , an analyst with the Secure World Foundation , a space - policy think tank in Superior , Colo .
But the notion that the US needs an alternative right away is a bit premature , he adds .
Proposals range from extending the shuttle program beyond 2010 to cutting a deal with China , which is ramping up its own human spaceflight effort .
Each option faces big budgetary or political challenges .
Already , Bush administration officials reportedly have suggested that the full range of US - Russian ties need to be reviewed in light of Moscow ’s actions in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia .
Those tensions appeared to have risen another notch Wednesday when US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski inked a deal under which the US would install antiballistic missiles in northeastern Poland .
For the US , the challenge lies in the way the Bush administration crafted its 2004 vision for space exploration .
It called for an end to the shuttle program in 2010 and the launch of a replacement , the Ares I and its Orion capsule , by 2015 .
NASA is working on the Ares I system , along with other major components of its Constellation program , with that deadline firmly in mind .
Constellation aims to return humans to the moon by 2020 .
But that schedule leaves at least a five - year gap with no homegrown way to send astronauts to the space station .
The US endured a nearly six - year gap in human spaceflight between the Apollo and shuttle programs .
But this time around , the US has a destination in orbit that it has paid big money to build and maintain .
NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has called the gap and the need for Russia ’s help “ unseemly . ”
To try to narrow the gap , the agency initially set an internal target for launching Ares 1 with its Orion crew capsule in September 2013 .
But with more - refined cost estimates in hand , and based on an assumption of no new money likely from Congress to support a 2013 deadline , the agency has moved that internal date to September 2014 .
“ The space community has been trying to yell about this for years , but people did n’t pay a lot of attention , ” says George Whitesides , executive director of the National Space Society , a space - exploration advocacy group in Washington .
“ The biggest lesson we should have learned ” from the shift from Apollo to the shuttle “ is the need to think through the transition between vehicles without gaps . ”
The first signals about the future may well come from Congress , which is weighing whether to grant NASA a waiver this year from the Iran , North Korea , and Syria Non-Proliferation Act .
It did so in 2005 so that NASA could buy astronaut launch services from Russia through 2011 .
NASA officials have said they need to place their order soon given the lead time the Russians say they to build the new Soyuz capsules NASA would need .
Short of holding its nose and granting the waiver , Congress appears to have few options .
The US could try to play a China card , notes Vincent Sabathier , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a former official with the French space agency CNES .
In an online commentary last week , he noted that China does n’t represent an immediate solution .
But Chinese space officials have expressed an interest in participating in the space - station program , he notes .
And tighter links between the US and Chinese space programs could represent important confidence - building measures affecting other areas of US - Chinese ties .
But such a move would require a profound change in US policy that would be a tough sell , especially at this point in the US political cycle , according to Joan Johnson - Freese , a specialist in international space policy who heads the department of national - security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport , R.I .
Thus , if Congress turns its back on a waiver for NASA , “ that leaves us in a situation of keeping the shuttle on line , ” she says .
“ Then we ’re eating our seed corn once again . ”
The reason : Unless a new president and Congress give NASA enough money to extend the shuttle program – which already is winding down and likely would require a costly recertification of the remaining shuttles – cash to keep the shuttles running probably would come from money NASA plans to spend on the Constellation program .
At the end of the day , “ Congress will act pragmatically ” and grant the waiver , predicts Peggy Finarelli , a senior fellow at the Center for Aerospace Policy Research at George Mason University in Fairfax . , Va .
While US - Russian relations appear to be growing more rocky , she does n’t anticipate the space station becoming a bargaining chip for either country .
Hearkening back to the Carter administration ’s response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and its cancellation of science and technology exchanges in protest , she says that the White House could make that move then because “ there was nothing there where you had multibillion - dollar programs where you had invested a lot of your future . ”
Moreover , over the past 10 to 15 years , the two countries ’ space programs and even their space - launch industries have become tightly intertwined .
“ These relations are not so easy to damage , ” says Mr. Whitesides .
That , he says , gives some cause for hope that the space station will remain a symbol of international cooperation in space , despite sometimes rocky relations between partners on Earth .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Haze hovered over the Chinese capital on Thursday , just a day before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games that have been beset by worries about pollution .
Cloudy skies were forecast for the rest of the day in Beijing where the Environmental Protection Bureau said that levels of particulate matter were within the “ fairly good ” range on Wednesday .
Humid , still weather and temperatures hitting 34 degrees Celsius ( 93 Fahrenheit ) have seen stubborn smog hanging over the city over the past few days .
The capital has already pulled millions of cars off the roads and halted factory production to ensure cleaner air .
Friday is expected to be cloudy too , with scattered rain , and a maximum temperature of 30 degrees Celsius ( 86 Fahrenheit ) .
“ During the opening ceremony it will mainly be cloudy ... and there will essentially be no impact upon it , ” the China Meteorological Administration said on its website ( www.cma.gov.cn).
It was raining in muggy Hong Kong , where equestrian events are scheduled to start on Saturday , as a tropical storm looms over the former British territory .
Tropical storms often develop over the South China Sea in the summer months , growing into full - fledged typhoons threatening China , the Philippines , Taiwan , South Korea and Japan .
For athletes of endurance events , smog could pose a major problem and the International Olympic Committee has said it might reschedule events if the pollution is too bad .

Even as policy makers worked on details of a $ 700 billion bailout of the financial industry , Wall Street began looking for ways to profit from it .
Financial firms were lobbying to have all manner of troubled investments covered , not just those related to mortgages .
At the same time , investment firms were jockeying to oversee all the assets that Treasury plans to take off the books of financial institutions , a role that could earn them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fees .
Nobody wants to be left out of Treasury ’s proposal to buy up bad assets of financial institutions .
“ The definition of Financial Institution should be as broad as possible , ” the Financial Services Roundtable , which represents big financial services companies , wrote in an e-mail message to members on Sunday .
It encourages a delusional state in the audience , a warm and cosy feeling that their opinion matters and counts for a hill of beans .
That they ’re part of a community , in this case a community of creative endeavour , in which , of course , they have not participated …
Screw the audience .
This is the rough text of a talk I delivered at Oxford Geek Night , which was held at The Jericho Tavern in Oxford , 27th August 2008 .
It ’s quite long , and despite attempting to use the “ excerpt ” field when posting this blog , it does n’t appear to work .
Sorry about that .
You ’ll find the rest of the content on this blog about 3 and a half miles down the page .*** I was pondering the other day whether I actually have a field of expertise .
I thought for ages , and could n’t come up with anything , and then in a blinding flash I realised , with a slight sense of despondency , what it might be : being in bands that people have never heard of .
I ’ve been doing it for years , now , and it ’s incredibly easy .
You get together with a few mates , write some songs , play some gigs , labour over some half - baked recordings , and fail to achieve any success whatsoever .
It ’s like falling off a log , seriously , and if you have n’t tried it , you should give it a go .
One thing that nearly all my bands had in common was a complete inability to get people to give us money in exchange for the recordings we ’d made .
As I ’ll explain later , the MP3 revolution – if I ’m allowed to call it that – has made that failure even more apparent , and the pain even more acute ; it ’s just few weeks since I went down to my local tip and recycled approximately 1,500 unsold CD albums in order to make room for my girlfriend ’s burgeoning magazine collection .
Her tatty copies of Vogue and Elle Decoration are worth more , square foot for square foot , kilo for kilo , than my CDs .
I ’d always suspected this , but that trip to Wandsworth dump confirmed it .
This talk was going to be called The Futility of Flogging Music .
I ’ve tweaked this slightly , because I ’ve noticed that Columbia Records seem to be effortlessly selling CDs by The Ting Tings .
So I changed it to The Futility Of Flogging Your Own Music .
Although , actually , it ’s probably just possible to flog your records to gullible family and friends , so let ’s call it The Futility Of Flogging Your Own Music To People You Do n’t Know Very Well .
The last time I was at this venue was , according to my diary , the 12th July 1991 .
I was in a band called The Keatons ; we were rowdy , confrontational , and looked something like this .
We were here supporting 14 Iced Bears , and if you ’ve never heard of 14 Iced Bears , that might give you an indication of how monumentally insignificant we were .
One thing sticks in my head about that evening ; our guitarist , Dave , sitting on the steps going down from that side door over there , holding copies of our 12 ” EP , watching audience members leave at the end of the evening , and him saying “ Excuse me .
Please buy my record .
P - p - please buy one .
Or th- th - they ’ll send me back THERE .
” Dave ’s pathetic pleading had magnificent comedy value – although you obviously had to be there , like so many shithot rock ’n ’roll anecdotes – but he really meant it .
We needed to scrape together the petrol money to get home , and if we did n’t , Dave would spend the next week living off instant mashed potato and milk stolen from next door ’s doorstep .
And we knew that the best chance to get anyone to part with money in exchange for our records was just after a gig , when people were hot , sweaty , disorientated , ears ringing and , crucially , pissed out of their heads .
This is probably still the case .
But , more often than not , we failed .
Not because we were shit , necessarily – we were good enough for Blur to take us on tour as their support act – but as a result we became cynical about the process of selling records .
Other bands that I was in just gave up trying to sell them , and just gave them away to mailing list subscribers instead .
People could n’t get their heads around it , in 1996 .
They did n’t understand .
“ What , it ’s free ? ” they ’d ask .
Of course , at the time , we had no idea quite how prescient this was .
The only other way bands had of flogging records at that time was via an indie distributor .
Actually making this happen was a soul - destroying , hellish process .
For starters , the distributor would come up with a list of incredibly good reasons why they should n’t waste warehouse space on you , let alone try and sell in your music to the shops .
Firstly , it was always the “ wrong time of year ” .
Now , there was never a “ right time of year ” .
They ’d say to you : “ Oh , there ’s no point in putting out a record in the run-up to Christmas , ” as if records by Bogshed or Shitbucket were somehow competing against sales of waffle irons or trouser presses .
Then after Christmas , they ’d tell you that no - one releases records right after Christmas , it ’s a dead time .
So , ok , we ca n’t release records when everyone else is , or indeed when no - one else is .
In the summer , they ’d say that there ’s no point , the students have run out of money and they ’re back at home for the holidays .
So in September , or April , when they could n’t really wield that excuse , they ’d move to excuse number two .
“ No - one knows who you are ” , they ’d say .
“ You need to put together a shithot publicity campaign .
We need you to get your photo into magazines .
We need you to get your record on radio playlists .
We need you to arrange a full UK tour , and become album of the month in influential periodicals . ”
Now , for a DIY act to get a play on Radio Ceredigion in Aberystwyth is hard enough , so to reach the national media was incredibly difficult .
You ’d send out hundreds of albums at great expense , with a ridiculously overblown , optimistic press release , virtually all of which would be binned .
John Peel was a rare beacon of light in this quagmire of misery – but even his patronage was insufficient to remove the ice from the frozen hearts of the distributors .
And they ’d inevitably move to reason number 3 : You ’re shit .
These people wielded enormous power over DIY acts ; they became embittered and hardened to the pathetic pleas of crap indie dance combos , and were perfectly happy to insult them to their faces .
Very occasionally , they would relent .
They ’d take 200 copies of your record , hang on to them for a few weeks , you ’d then pop around and they ’d sneeringly hand every single one of them back to you again , along with sales sheet prominently featuring the digit zero .
They had to sell records to survive as a business ; we failed to understand that .
We thought they owed us the right for our records to be in the shops and , if they were , that this would somehow create demand .
We laid the blame for our continued lack of success squarely at their door .
We hated them .
And they hated us .
But wind forward more than 15 years to 2008 , and it ’s manifestly obvious that they were right all along .
Now that we ’re put in touch directly with our audience and that distributors can be completely removed from the equation , and replaced by MP3 aggregators who a ) do n’t need warehousing space for your MP3s , b ) will put them into a range of online stores for a flat fee and , crucially , c ) do n’t care whether you ’re brilliant or whether you ’re bloody awful , we have exactly the same problem selling the music as the distributors had .
Just because the songs are available to buy , does n’t mean we can sell them – in the same way that ( and excuse the often - used analogy ) installing a landline does n’t mean that the phone is going to ring .
And we ca n’t blame the distributors any more .
The only people that are left to blame are ourselves .
And that hurts .
It hurts because web technology lets us see exactly how many people are listening to our music .
We can see the MySpace hit counters spin round , with the total number of listeners for each track .
Our stats pages on our blogs show us how people arrived at our page , which country they ’re from , even which web browser they ’re using .
We ’ve got information about the reach of our music that we could n’t have dreamed of 10 years ago , and it tells us that thousands upon thousands of people have their ears open , and they ’re listening .
But , by and large , and with a few exceptions , we ca n’t fucking sell music to them .
And we ’re starting to obsess about it .
We ca n’t stand the fact that we have 2,739 friends on MySpace , several of whom have posted highly encouraging messages such as “ thnx 4 the add ” , and yet none of them are prepared to dig in their pocket , or Paypal account , and just send us a few quid – despite the fact that we ’ve poured our heart , our soul and our cash into the whole endeavour .
But hang on .
these people might be listed as “ friends ” , but that does n’t necessarily make them fans , let alone fans who want to give us some money .
There ’s no way of knowing if they think we ’re any good – in fact , they might hate us .
But even the ones who love your music know that they wield the power , and that you are very much their bitch .
As we all know , net - savvy music fans can download a track they love , for free , by any major label act you care to mention in a couple of minutes flat – so why on earth should we expect them to actually give us money for our tunes ?
The ease of using BitTorrent , Limewire , Soulseek and all these networks is erasing any guilt complex that music fans might have had over enjoying music that they have n’t paid for .
There ’s nothing we can do about this , that ’s just the way it is .
Deep down , I probably still believe that rewarding musicians financially for managing to come up with something that is n’t complete shit is the right thing to do – but filesharing is compulsive , it ’s a tool you ca n’t NOT use once you know about it .
What I do find hilarious is when people attempt to morally justify it .
They either claim that they ’re “ sticking it to the man ” ( as if most musicians are swanning around in limousines , when the vast majority are scraping a living by working part time in Halfords ) or “ it ’s OK , bands can make money by touring , instead ” .
Which is like casually suggesting to the owner of an off licence , after he ’s spotted you nicking a bottle of wine , that he can sell a few crisps to make up for it .
And anyway , The Rolling Stones might well gross millions on a world tour , but nearly all bands lose money hand over fist while on the road .
People might come out with stats about live music revenues being on a gradual incline , but believe me – having been in bands known and unknown , and done tour budgets for countless others – touring represents a black hole of disappearing cash for musicians .
Sound engineers might get paid , promoters ensure that they get their cut , but precious little filters down to the musicians , unless they ’re lucky enough to get tour support from the record company .
Which is actually an advance .
Which means that , er , it ’s their money in the first place .
But anyway , after you ’ve pointed all this out , the filesharer just says “ well , bollocks , I ’m just going to do it anyway . ”
And this kind of logic is impossible to argue with .
The morality of filesharing is obviously a huge question , and one that people can , and indeed do , talk about all night – but resistance to it is utterly futile , so it ’s essentially a moot point .
The difficulty I have with being a musician in a Web 2.0 world is the fact that press articles , blogs and web startups are all trying to persuade us that we should somehow be raking in the cash , that the web is providing us with a unique opportunity to earn decent money from our music .
One blog called Music Think Tank is entirely devoted to this very concept .
The posts , many of which I fundamentally disagree with , provoke comment threads where you can almost feel the desperation , because this holy grail of being paid for your art has been ratcheted up to a preposterous extent .
There ’s a recent post about a guy called John Taglieri , who has what he calls an “ inner motto ” .
“ I want what I want , ” he says , “ and you are either going to help me , or get out of my way . ”
John says that he had to disassociate himself from friends who were holding him back by telling him that there was no way he could make it .
To me , this utterly joyless statement completely misses the point of playing music .
Jonathan Coulton is another one ; he is often cited as the king of online DIY music , because for 18 months he has been making a living by spending 6 - 8 hours a day vigorously social networking and sending birthday greetings to pre-pubescent girls in Wisconsin in the hope that she ’ll send him her pocket money in return .
Personally , I can think of nothing more soul destroying .
And it ’s worth noting that if I had n’t been told that Taglieri and Coulton were supposedly famous internet successes , I would never have heard of them .
David Thomas , from legendary American post - punk band Pere Ubu , has these wise words to say to me on the topic of social networking and music :
This is n’t very helpful if you ’re a musician trying to “ make it ” online in the 21st century , but I ’d rather hear that than hear John Taglieri offering advice about “ developing income streams ” .
Form a covers band to play weddings and barmitzvahs , he suggests .
Hire out your amateurish music production skills !
Buy a CD duplicating machine and charge people to use it !
No thanks , John .
I mean , sure , I could stay at home and watch my $ 8 earnings on Google AdSense slowly grow to $ 8.50 ; or I could play my heart out , for no money , to a bunch of people in a converted barn in Rhyl who are off their tits on magic mushrooms , have a really shit Welsh pizza for my tea , arrive home at 5 am and have to get up for work at 7 am .
Yes , the latter option may appear stupid , but at least it ’s living a little .
The internet has entirely switched the focus from making music to sales and marketing .
While some might say that this is just the harsh reality , it ’s what you have to do to survive , I say bollocks .
I ’m not just being romantic about this .
There ’s a choice : play gigs , experience that peculiar bonding you get with fellow band members , feel that curious mixture of love and antipathy you get from an audience – and make no money .
Or obsess about selling mp3s – and make no money .
My children , and my children ’s children , certainly wo n’t want to hear about my tedious marketing efforts to secure a song that I wrote 250,000 views on YouTube .
( Note that I sold barely 100 MP3s as a result of this colossal and unexpected exposure – which certainly made it an interesting experiment , but also a fairly solitary and unfulfilling one . )
What would have made a better story would have been to wangle a gig in a Parisian squat where the electrics are dodgy , suffer a massive electric shock off a mike stand , get carried from the building while everyone cheers loudly , be left rubbing your head while slumped against the side of your van , the promoter takes advantage of the confusion by running off with the mixing desk which he ’s holding ransom because he claims that the PA company owe him money , at which point you realise that you ’re not going to get paid , and you look at your fellow band members , and then you start to cry .
That ’s the story I ’d rather tell , and frankly it ’s the story I ’d rather hear .
Music ’s biggest function , from time immemorial , has never been its capacity to make money .
It ’s its powerful social glue .
Without wishing to get all Oprah on your ass , it may be an expensive hobby , but it brings people together in an utterly unique fashion .
In any case , why pursue this mythical pot of cash , when nearly all bands that come into money are inevitably be torn apart by it ?
Entire musical genres are propped up by people not being quite able to afford to be involved in them , and people who obsess over clawing back cash from the enterprise are entirely missing the point .
Slight poverty is what drives music forward .
It only works if you ’re in the red .
You ’ve never felt so alive as when you ’ve just maxed out your credit card to get your band on a cross channel ferry for a one - off gig in Antwerp .
Seriously .
You know , it ’s like biographies of bands .
The most interesting bit is the first bit , you know , the horror , where they ’re playing shit venues to small crowds , and the pointlessness of it all is on the verge of driving them insane .
When they get to the bit where they turn up at a plush venue and there ’s a dozen Cantaloupes and a melon baller in the dressing room , well , that ’s when I stop reading .
Their passion has disappeared at that point .
It ’s just not interesting .
Of course , there ’s probably a valid question to be asked about whether , if the monetizing of music is eventually revealed to be a pointless battle , whether people will be quite so interested in forming bands .
But again , it ’s not about money , is it .
I do n’t go and watch Red Pony Clock or Desalvo and imagine that they ’re doing it because there ’s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow .
They ’re doing it because they want to show off .
And quite right too .
In the unlikely event of anyone wanting my advice , it would be to stop worrying about selling recordings .
Just give them away .
Let them go .
Put them online for free , and tell people that they ’re there .
And if , against the odds , you ’ve been given some cash , you ’ve managed to release an album commercially , and you see that someone has posted it on a blog for readers to download – for god ’s sake do n’t get angry .
Do n’t see it as being down £ 20 .
See it as being up 20 listeners .
Yes , your music might conceivably have been stolen , but there are no police .
So get used to it .
And now you ’re freed of this burden , pursue all the other things that you want from being in a band – writing songs , rehearsing , doing gigs , building relationships with other bands , going on wallet - busting tours , receiving unmemorable blowjobs .
Because seriously , you ’re almost more likely to get a blowjob after a gig than sell an MP3 .
And remember – just because music does n’t make you money , certainly does NOT mean that it ’s worth nothing .
Obama camp briefs McCain press corps
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe defended the Democratic nominee ’s strategy on Monday , after a spate of recent polls reported John McCain with a slight lead in the race .
“ In this building we do n’t spend a lot of time on national polls , we are very focused on the battleground states that will decide the race , ” said Plouffe .
“ We think McCain is more at his high water mark then we are . ”

Plouffe 's comments came at an unusual briefing designed specifically for McCain 's travelling press corps .
While the Arizona senator was in Chicago for an afternoon fundraiser that reportedly raised $ 4 million for the Republican party , the Obama campaign invited his traveling press pool to visit their Michigan Ave. headquarters for a briefing with Plouffe .
The meeting offered a strategic opportunity to combat a wave of positive news for the McCain campaign , which has enjoyed heightened enthusiasm and poll numbers since the addition of running mate Sarah Palin last week .
McCain ’s selection of the Alaska governor has energized the GOP 's socially conservative wing and his campaign rallies have attracted thousands over the past week — significantly larger audiences than attended his earlier events .
A weekend CBS News survey found McCain leading Obama by two percentage points .
A Washington Post / ABC
News poll , also taken last weekend , showed the race essentially in a dead heat , with 47 percent of likely voters supporting Obama , 46 percent for McCain .
“ We ’ve been under siege from this idea that John McCain is running for George W. Bush ’s third term , ” said senior McCain aide Mark Salter , speaking to reporters on the campaign plane .
“ We ’ve successfully reminded people of who he is . ”
Despite what appears to be a shrinking lead , Obama aides argued that they maintain a strong position in the race .
The Obama camp is counting on holding all the states won by Kerry in 2004 .
The campaign also expressed confidence in its ability to flip Iowa and New Mexico , two states that went for Bush in the last election .
If Obama won all those states , they ’d have 264 electoral votes .
The remaining six needed for a win , said Plouffe , could come from a victory in Colorado , Indiana , Florida , Virginia , Nevada , or Nebraska .
“ When you look at the battleground states that will determine the presidency , we feel very good about where we are , ” said Plouffe .
“ From a state by state perspective we ’d much rather be us then John McCain . ”
Earlier in the summer , the Obama campaign named 18 battleground states as prime advertising targets .
Obama recently stopped running ads in Georgia , a state the campaign originally identified as a potential battleground .
Some Georgia field staff was moved into North Carolina , said Plouffe .
The campaign is still operating an aggressive ground game in Montana , North Dakota and Indiana , traditionally Republican states where Democrats see potential .
The Obama campaign is banking on their ability to expand the base of Democrats by registering independent and younger voters .
They ’ll also relay on e-mail and text messages to turnout the campaign 's huge database of likely voters .
“ John McCain not only has to match George W. Bush ’s historic turnout job in Ohio and Florida , he has to exceed it because we believe our turnout will exceed John Kerry ’s turnout , ” said Plouffe .
For its part , the McCain campaign identified Pennsylvania and Michigan as prime battlegrounds .
Aides say Palin ’s working class background and strong social conservative credentials will mobilize the GOP base in those states .
“ This is going to be a close election , ” said Plouffe .
“ These are all going to be races that get decided from somewhere between one and six points . "
During an interview on " The View , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed Joy Behar ’s question about why she is refusing to hold impeachment hearings by saying “ If somebody had a crime that the president had committed , that would be a different story . “ ( Newsbusters )
( Replace Pelosi petition )
Pelosi ’s blatant disregard for the rule of law when it comes to this administration has been evident from day one .
When she first took our constitutional provision of impeachment “ off the table , “ she effectively re-wrote the Constitution to suit her own personal agenda .
She gave away the only tool to hold the president in check .
The founders of this once great nation knew that , without this important restraint , any president could seek an imperial level of control that even King George himself did n’t have .
And Pelsoi gave that oversight away .
Or should we say , she sold it .
One - and - a- half years ago , when the call for impeachment really took off , Nancy Pelosi argued that they had to “ build the case ” so that it was clear to the American people that it was n’t a partisan attack .
One year ago she claimed they “ did n’t have the votes . “
Six months ago she claimed there “ was n’t enough time . “
And now , remarkably , Nancy Pelosi , leader of the Democratic Party in the House , is further covering up for the rogue presidency of George W. Bush by claiming on a national television show that Bush and Cheney have n’t committed any crimes .
This just days after some 12 people came before the House Judiciary Committee and brilliantly testified to the numerous obvious crimes committed by the Bush administration .
Pelosi made this remarkable comment because she knows that very few people actually watched the CSPAN coverage of the “ non-impeachment ” hearing and certainly not that many people watch " The View . "
So , she was able to misinform millions of " The View ’s " audience without regard for the small percentage that would see through her propaganda .
And that is the point ; as long as they can keep the majority of Americans in the dark for just a little while longer , then they can ride out the call to investigate this criminal administration , wait for time to pass and people to forget the facts as they re-write the history , and prepare for the next imperial presidency that will again be unincumbered by the rule of law .
Because that is the end result , people .
That is why she took impeachment off the table ; from the very beginning she was protecting the 1 %ers that this criminal administration serves .
She is not the leader of the Opposition Party , but rather , she is a co-conspirator of the most criminal administration in the history of this nation .
She will argue , if pushed enough , that she is attempting to protect the democratic leadership in congress as well as Obama ’s shot at the White House by making the republicans in the Senate “ own this war . "
But that is a smokescreen that a 10 - year - old can see through .
The design of that talking point is to keep liberals and progressive democrats from talking about , writing about , or working for impeachment .
And it has worked .
Many “ progressive ” sites have banned discussion of impeachment for more than a year because they felt it would reduce their candidates ' chances for election in the fall .
This has become a guiding principle for some democrats , that has been consciously intertwined with their feverish desire to see Obama in the White House in 2009 .
What these well meaning progressives do n’t see is that the people who really run this country are using their heartfelt “ hope for change ” as a leash to keep them tethered , obedient , and silent .
But Speaker Pelosi knows what the “ Help America Vote Act ” did .
She knows what the republicans are doing to the voter registration rolls throughout the south .
And she knows damn well what all the hype over Iran is about .

John McCain used a Van Halen song during his big speech earlier today and the band wants to make one thing clear -- they 're not running with McCain .
Van Halen management tells us the band had no idea McCain was planning on using " Right Now " during his big entrance in Ohio telling us , " Permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given . "
Six months ago , satellite telescopes spotted an exceptionally bright burst of energy that would have been the most distant object in the universe ever visible to the naked eye , if anyone saw it .
Even though no humans have reported seeing it directly , the gamma-ray burst , an explosion that signals the violent death of a massive star , is changing theories of how these events look .
Gamma ray bursts are typically accompanied by intense releases of other forms of radiation , from X - rays to visible light .
This burst , dubbed GRB 080319B , was first detected by the Swift satellite on March 19 , while the spacecraft was serendipitously looking at another gamma -ray burst in the same area of the sky .
The light it emitted in the visible part of the spectrum was so intense that the burst would have been visible to the naked eye in the constellation Bootes for about 40 seconds — no other gamma -ray burst has ever been visible without a telescope .
The incredible amount of energy given off across the entire electromagnetic spectrum during a gamma-ray burst is what Jonathan Grindlay of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics calls " the birth pangs of a black hole .
This is the scream . "
It took the light of GRB 080319B about 7.4 billion years to reach Earth , placing the explosion " more than halfway back to the Big Bang and the origin of our universe , " Grindlay wrote in an editorial accompanying a new study of the burst in the Sept. 10 issue of the journal Nature .
This means that the explosion happened 3 billion years before the sun or Earth even formed , Grindlay added .
When astronomers see such distant objects , they are in effect looking back in time .
After the Swift detection , telescopes around the world were alerted and trained their eyes onto the new gamma-ray burst , giving scientists a highly detailed view of these explosions — the most luminous in the universe — whose formation and structure still hold many mysteries .
The findings in the new study of GRB 080319B challenge some of the commonly - held views of gamma-ray bursts .
A violent death and birth
Gamma -ray bursts are something of an extreme form of supernovas , the bright explosions that mark the deaths of massive stars .
But possibly one in every 1,000 supernovae is not one of these " normal " explosions ; instead of the star simply dying , its core collapses to form a black hole — that event generates a gamma-ray burst .
( Just what the conditions are that boost a normal supernova into a gamma - ray burst are not known . )
The gamma-ray burst is actually a powerful jet of material sent out by the spinning accretion disk that surrounds a newborn black hole .
This bright part of the burst typically only lasts between 3 and 100 seconds , and an afterglow follows that can last for days or weeks .
GRB 080319 B 's jet was one of the brightest ever observed in terms of gamma rays , and it was unusually bright in optical wavelengths .
" It was unexpected that it was this bright , " said lead author of the new study Judith Racusin , a graduate student at Penn State University .
Narrow jet
The study suggests that the jet of the gamma - burst actually has two components : a narrow , ultra - fast jet at the core of a wider , slightly slower jet .
The narrow part of the jet of GRB 080319B was so fast that it shot material directly toward Earth at 99.99995 percent the speed of light .
Scientists think that it was because the jet was pointed straight at us that it appeared so much brighter than previously - observed gamma -ray bursts .
The researchers speculate that it is rare to detect the inner core of the jet because it is so narrow — only about 1/100th the size of the full moon as seen from Earth .
For this reason , astronomers think they may have missed the narrow core of the jet in previous bursts :
" We 're primarily just seeing the outer jet , " Grindlay told SPACE.com , because we are not seeing those bursts head - on .
Racusin said that it is n't know for sure that all gamma-ray bursts have this two component structure to their jets , but that the theory fits what they saw with GRB 080319B .
To see a similarly bright burst , astronomers would have to catch another one aimed directly at Earth , which Racusin and her colleagues calculated should happen about once ever three to 10 years .
Swift may not still be around in 10 years , but the recently launched GLAST satellite ( recently renamed Fermi ) and other missions in the planning stages could catch a glimpse of them .
But whether or not they do , Racusin knows one thing : With GRB 080319B , " we got lucky . "
In a scathing letter to George Bush , Democratic congressmen Henry Waxman of California and John Dingell of Michigan said the Defence Contract Audit Agency 's audit was completes last October - before the election .
They also note that 12 separate requests to the Pentagon to view the completed audits on the contractor 's $ 2.5 bn contract to supply fuel and other services in post - war Iraq had been ignored .
" We would like to know why this audit report - and audit reports on nine additional task orders - are being withheld from Congress , " they wrote .
" We also want to know what steps you are taking to recover these funds from Halliburton . "
In a second public letter yesterday , Mr Waxman accused Bush administration officials of deliberately withholding information on overcharges by Halliburton from UN auditors - at its behest .
Some $ 1.6bn of the $ 2.5 bn Halliburton contract was funded from Iraqi oil revenues overseen by the UN .
" The evidence suggests that the US used Iraqi oil proceeds to overpay Halliburton and then sought to hide the evidence of these overcharges from the international auditors , " the letter says .
The audit , released by the congressmen on Monday , offers the most definitive glimpse so far of overbilling by Halliburton , once run by the vice president , Dick Cheney .
In the most startling transaction , it charged the Pentagon $ 27.5 m to ship $ 82,100 worth of cooking and heating fuel to Iraq from Kuwait - 335 times the actual cost of the liquified petroleum gas , a charge the Pentagon auditors said was " illogical " .
The firm and its subsidiary , Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) , face several investigations , including a fraud inquiry from the justice department .
A preliminary Pentagon audit , focused on the immediate aftermath of the US - led invasion , found KBR overcharged the Pentagon by $ 61 m for kerosene and other fuels .
Critics of Halliburton are convinced this represents just a fraction of the overcharges .
The audit released this week covers only one of 10 task orders undertaken under the $ 2.5 bn no -bid contract awarded immediately after the invasion of Iraq .
However , the overcharges identified in the single task order already dwarf the $ 61 m ( £ 32 m ) in previously discovered overcharges .
Halliburton charged army corps of engineers $ 875 m ( £ 457 m ) to supply fuel from May 2003 to March 2004 .
Auditors questioned $ 108.4 m ( £ 56.6 m ) of those costs .
As the Congressmen note , the auditors criticised charges in nearly every area , saying the firm misled auditors and failed to supervise sub-contracts .
" Halliburton failed to demonstrate its prices for Kuwaiti fuel were ' fair and reasonable ' , " the auditors say .
They also note Halliburton refused repeatedly to provide information on costs of obtaining fuel from Turkey and Jordan , or reveal how it selected its contractors in Kuwait .
A Halliburton spokeswoman , Wendy Hall , said it was forced into paying , and charging , high costs because of the security situation following the war .
" Transporting fuel into Iraq was a mission fraught with danger , which increased the prices that firms were willing to offer for trans portation , " she told reporters .
" The report fails to take into account the fact KBR performed an urgent mission at the army 's request and the mission took place in a wartime environment . "
The lawyer for an army corps of engineers whistle - blower said that his client was set to be interviewed for a second time by Pentagon investigators on April 4 over her claims of contracting abuse involving KBR .
Dear Dategirl ,
I recently met a hot guy and we decided to have a sexual but noncommitted relationship .
Our fuck date was going just fine until his penis was injured ( and we even took care of each other first before the action took place ) .
It slipped out and somehow got hit hard enough to hurt and stop any fucking for that night .
Now this has happened ( a lot ) in the past with a previous boyfriend .
I ’m wondering : Am I loose ?
I ca n’t be , because I ’ve only slept with three guys , but then I guess I do n’t even know if I am or not unless the guy tells me .
What can I do to prevent this from happening with future partners ?
Or does the problem lie with the other person instead of me ?
I am sick of feeling like there ’s something wrong with me ( and my vagina ) whenever I have sex with a guy and his penis somehow ends up injured !
Thank you very much !
Lucy
Despite its misleading name , there ’s no bone in a boner .
However , it is possible to “ break ” a penis .
As there are only about 1,000 cases reported each year in this country , your boys probably just experienced the equivalent of a sprain .
A broken wiener occurs when the erect member slams into a hard , unyielding surface — like your inner thigh , pubic bone , or taint .
When the ligaments are torn , it ’s as if the guy has broken an arm or leg .
In short , it hurts — a lot .
There ’s sometimes blood , and usually swelling .
If that happens , get him to the ER , stat .
I asked my Large Greek Boyfriend if he ’d ever junked his joint .
He thought back to the dark years and said that it had happened with one of his first girlfriends .
He reported that while it hurt a great deal at the time , she nursed him back to health with a blowjob .
You crazy kids are probably just being a little overenergetic and sloppy .
My research shows that it ’s more common when the woman is on top — not that you need to stop .
Just be careful that if his dong slips all the way out , guide it carefully back in .
If you ’re going doggie style , it ’s pretty much up to him to take care of that , because unless you ’re a very special lady you do n’t have eyes on your ass .
You might also explore other , less wham - bam positions .
I ’m not saying you have to get all gentle and love - makey , just be a little more aware of where both your bits are .
I would n’t worry about being loose — just keep doing your Kegel exercises .
Not only will they help you have better orgasms , they ’ll keep you from peeing your pants when all the other biddies at the nursing home are sitting in puddles of their own making .
Too many women spend hours working their abs and butts and forget about the most important muscle of them all — the love muscle .
Hopefully you already know how to do your Kegels , but in the interest of being servicey , I ’ll tell you :
Next time you pee , stop the flow of urine midstream .
Hold it for a few seconds and let go .
That ’s the muscle you should be working when you ’re Kegeling .
But do n’t keep doing this while you ’re on the toilet because you ’ll end up with a urinary tract infection , which can be as painful as a sprained penis .
Do n’t ask me how I know this .
So now that you know which muscle to flex , you can Kegel anywhere .
On the bus , stuck in traffic : Squeeze that muscle ( feels kind of good , does n’t it ? ) , hold it for three seconds , then let it go for three seconds .
Repeat 10 times .
Work up to four , five , then 10 seconds .
Do 10 sets three times a day .
Pretty soon you ’ll have a twat as tight as a tourniquet .

As Republican friends in - the - know often remind me , Dobson is THE religious right leader – not “ a ” leader , THE leader .
As voters in 24 states head to the polls today to choose a presidential nominee , Dr. James Dobson released a statement to The Laura Ingraham Show today .
He stated his personal opinions of this critical election :
“ I am deeply disappointed the Republican Party seems poised to select a nominee who did not support a Constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage , voted for embryonic stem - cell research to kill nascent human beings , opposed tax cuts that ended the marriage penalty , has little regard for freedom of speech , organized the Gang of 14 to preserve filibusters in judicial hearings , and has a legendary temper and often uses foul and obscene language .
“ I am convinced Sen . McCain is not a conservative , and in fact , has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are .
He has sounded at times more like a member of the other party .
McCain actually considered leaving the GOP caucus in 2001 , and approached John Kerry about being Kerry ’s running mate in 2004 .
McCain also said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president .
Given these and many other concerns , a spoonful of sugar does NOT make the medicine go down .
I cannot , and will not , vote for Sen.
John McCain , as a matter of conscience .
“ But what a sad and melancholy decision this is for me and many other conservatives .
Should Sen. McCain capture the nomination as many assume , I believe this general election will offer the worst choices for president in my lifetime .
I certainly ca n’t vote for Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama based on their virulently anti-family policy positions .
If these are the nominees in November , I simply will not cast a ballot for president for the first time in my life .
These decisions are my personal views and do not represent the organization with which I am affiliated .
They do reflect my deeply held convictions about the institution of the family , about moral and spiritual beliefs , and about the welfare of our country . ”
Around noon today , Dr. Dobson talked to national talk - show host Dennis Prager .
He made it clear he was not endorsing anyone .
“ Dr. Dobson ’s statement speaks for itself , ” said Gary Schneeberger , vice president of media relations for Focus on the Family Action .
“ He made it as a private citizen , and it reflects his personal opinion of Sen. McCain ’s candidacy and record .
People can read into it what they like ; all I see is his own personal ‘ straight talk ’ regarding why he ca n’t vote for one candidate . ”
New York Times bestselling author Don Miller is the latest nationally known evangelical Christian to head into what is considered by many the heart of conservative evangelism — Colorado Springs — to deliver the message that Christians should expand their focus beyond hot - button social issues like abortion and same - sex marriage .
Miller , the author of “ Blue Like Jazz ” and who delivered the benediction at the Democratic National Convention in August , is speaking at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs tonight .
In an interview today with the Colorado Independent , he said that his appearance in Colorado Springs is designed to help convince evangelicals that Barack Obama , who has spoken extensively of the role of faith in public life , is “ probably the most evangelical candidate of all the candidates . ”
“ One of the reasons we ’re here in Colorado is that it is up for grabs and the opportunity arose , ” Miller said .
“ We have no desire to go into the heart of the evangelical movement and dismantle it , but here ’s the message : A lot of people do n’t know that the culture war is a cultural Vietnam , and we ’re at an impasse .
This is a chance for us , and a lot of evangelicals are finding themselves endeared to Barack Obama . ”
As an evangelical stump - man for the Democratic candidate , however , Miller knows the odds are challenging at best .
Citing current polls , he says only 15 percent of the most conservative evangelical people of faith plan to vote for Obama .
Miller ’s visit to Colorado ’s second largest city , which is home to national and international headquarters of dozens of high profile Christian nonprofits , follows an appearances last week by Richard Cizik , the vice president for governmental affairs of the 30 - million member National Association of Evangelicals .
Cizik is the nation ’s leading high - profile evangelical promoting the need for Christians to address climate change and protect God ’s planet — and he has withstood hardball efforts from old - style evangelicals like Springs - based Focus on the Family CEO James Dobson to get him fired .
Dobson , along with others , would prefer Christian evangelicals focus on social issues like abortion and same sex marriage .
In an interview with the Colorado Independent , after two public appearances in the Springs , Cizik took issue with Republican John McCain , terming the Republican as unprincipled for backing away from former positions articulating the need to address climate change , as well as torture and a sensible tax policy — and in effect , becoming more like George Bush than the John McCain of the past .
Despite his condemnation of McCain ’s positions , however , Cizik stopped short of saying he plans to vote for Obama .
Miller , who says he does not know Cizik , also underscored his desire that Christian evangelicals move beyond the divisive issues of abortion and gay marriage — which many of the younger generation have already done .
“ Certainly many more evangelicals , and younger evangelicals , are figuring out that globalization and trade are incredibly important — responsible fatherhood is incredibly important , ” Miller said .
In addition , he termed the current administration ’s accounting practices “ unbiblical . ”
“ Our taxes have gone up and we have a 40 percent larger government … we can no longer say as evangelicals we have one party , ” he said .

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has committed more than $ 1 million to evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of recovering and using methane from coal mines in China .
The process of mining coal releases methane , a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide , into escape into the atmosphere .
If methane recovery programs are implemented at all three project sites , up to 1.8 million metric tons of the greenhouse gas could be eliminated .
That ’s equal to the annual emissions of up to 330,000 cars .
Methane to Markets , launched in 2004 , is a public / private partnership that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the cost - effective , near - term recovery and use of methane , while providing clean energy to markets around the world .
China and the U.S. were two of the founding members of the partnership , which has grown to include 27 countries and more than 750 private sector entities , financial institutions , nongovernmental agencies and other organizations .
Under the agreement , EPA is conducting three full - scale feasibility studies at the Luizhang Mine in Anhui Province , a group of six mines in the Songzao coal basin in Chongqing , and a group of six mines in the Hebi region of Henan Province .

I knew there was a good reason not to “ play ” the stock market .
Jim Willie writes for Kitco today :
Hidden inside the AIG bailout funding package , surely hastily cobbled together , but carefully enough to include a totally corrupt clause , was a handy dandy clause that permits raids .
The conglomerate financial firms are permitted at this point to use private individual brokerage account funds to relieve their own liquidity pressures .
This represents unauthorized loans of your stock account assets .
So next , if the conglomerate fails , your stock account is part of the bankruptcy process .
Finally the corrupt USGovt and corrupt Wall Street houses are desperate enough to put into policy , stated by the US Federal Reserve , outlining the authorized raid of your money .
Beware .
In the olden days , this sort of thievery resulted in a rope , a tree , and a horse scared out from under the perpetrator .
Now ?
The government in cahoots with the Fed actually helps the bankers steal the money .
The Financial Times admitted as much on September 14 , when it wrote : “ The Fed also suspended rules that prohibit banks from using deposits to fund their investment banking subsidiaries . ”
As the Naked Capitalism blog notes , this is the opposite of the “ narrow banking ” that resulted in the wake of the savings and loan rip - off .
So called “ narrow banking ” requires “ banks to invest depositors ’ funds only in the very safest assets , ” but now the sky ’s the limit as the bankers are going wild with your money , that is if you are stupid enough to be in the stock market .
Naked Capitalism turns to an email from a former bank regulator on the topic :
I worked as a senior supervisory analyst at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York in the late 80s / early 90s when the FHLB ( and later the Office of Thrift Supervision ) were cleaning up the S&L mess .
In reading of this development , I am speechless .
The whole point of our job was to minimize risk to the deposit insurance funds , and our bosses really drummed that one into our heads … .
The Fed seems to be enabling the very things it should be standing against .
If he felt that Treasury needed to subsidize the Merrill takeover Paulson should have asked Congress for explicit appropriations of finite funds .
The 23A [ Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act ] suspension will make it hard for us to know how much is being risked , at what odds , and for how long .
It is a blank check issued under the table .
I ’m no expert on such matters , but it seems obvious what is going on — the Fed and Paulson are opening the floodgates and taking down the hurdles — as minimal as they were — safeguarding depositors .
It ’s brazen thievery on steroids .
“ All too often both bankers and regulators get overconfident during economic booms .
However , if the regulators can’t tighten the ship even during a crisis like this one we are lost . ”
Tighten the ship ?
Seems the ship was long ago hijacked by pirates and they are now stripping the rigging , the mizzenmast , the rudder , transom , everything down to the floorboards , the works .
Soon we ’ll be crammed into a dinghy and sent to face the ravages of Mother Nature .
You can almost hear the smarmy yuppies whining and gnashing teeth as their brokerage accounts are savaged .
It is short comfort to a much larger calamity .

Republicans , Democrats miss deadline to file presidential candidates in Texas
Bob Barr is slated to be the only presidential candidate on the ballot in Texas after Republicans and Democrats missed the Aug. 26 deadline to file in the state .
“ Unless the state of Texas violates its own election laws , Congressman Barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot , ” says Russell Verney , campaign manager for the Barr Campaign and the former campaign manager for Ross Perot .
“ Texas law makes no exceptions for missing deadlines . ”
The Texas Secretary of State Web site shows only Bob Barr as the official candidate for president in Texas .
“ We know all about deadlines , ” says Verney .
“ We are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation .
When we miss deadlines , we get no second chances .
This is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy . ”
“ Republicans and Democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws , no matter how absurd or unreasonable , ” says Verney .
“ Therefore , Republicans and Democrats should be held to the same standards . ”
Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr represented the 7th District of Georgia in the U. S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .

President Sarkozy 's ' third leg ' embarrasses French magazine Paris Match
Paris Match journalists are up in arms over a photo in the glossy weekly featuring President Nicolas Sarkozy of France sporting a " third leg " as he stands next to the Pope , due to a hastily touched up photoshop edit .
Both Barack Obama and John McCain have spoken at length ( if not always in detail ) about their energy and environmental proposals .
And , as the economy continues into a tailspin , Americans are concerned about the prices they ’re paying for gasoline , electricity , natural gas and ( soon ) heating oil .
But what do we really know about the presidential candidates ’ records on energy and the environment ?
For many of us , the answer is “ not much . ”
And it does n’t appear that the mainstream media is going to help us in this regard : pigs and lipstick receive more attention than either candidate ’s voting record , speeches , and writings on how to move the US away from its addiction to fossil fuels , and towards a robust low - carbon economy .
As citizens concerned about the US ’ direction on these important matters , we ’re finding a real lack of information in the 24 - hour news cycle .
So … let ’s do something about it .
Let ’s start digging .
That ’s right … rather than waiting for the mainstream media to do its job , Red , Green and Blue is partnering with social media start - up ReframeIt to host a “ scavenger hunt ” for the information we need to make informed decisions in this important election .
We invite you to put on a pot of coffee , fire up the computer , and start playing investigative reporter .
Your goal : break those stories about Obama and McCain ’s record on energy and environmental issues that the general public is n’t hearing through the popular news media .
By sharing your finds through ReframeIt , you ’ll be able to get a dialogue started with all of your fellow investigators … and we ’ll keep track of the most provocative finds here on RG&B .
So , how do you participate in this citizen - powered information hunt ?

Now this is a bike !
The Ferrari V4 is a motorcycle concept developed by Israeli industrial designer Amir Glinik that borrows heavily from the sleek and contoured bodies of Ferrari supercars .
The bike features drive - by - wire hand controls adapted from an F - 16 jet fighter and a weatherproof touch - screen LCD on the fuel tank .
The design is centered around a chopped down version of the Ferrari Enzo ’s V12 engine which is reduced to just four - cylinders , hence the name V4 .
Personally , I think he could have used the full V12 if he built it like The Gunbus .
With the smaller engine , Glinik has been able to create an incredibly sleek body which wraps around and conceals almost all of the superbike ’s internals .
The touch - screen is an impressive addition , allowing for the monitoring of all driving information like speed , RPM , fuel level and gear status .
In addition , you could use it as a diagnostic tool to figure out any mechanical problems , control the anti-theft device , access radio and GPS , monitor all internal liquids and temperatures and even , somehow , calculate the bike ’s weight .
The project began back in 2005 when someone raised a question in Glinik ’s office about the lack of a Ferrari motorcycle .
This led him to some research … which let to some ideas … which led to the sleek beast you see before you today .
Do n’t know about you guys , but I want to know what the ‘ Wild Mode ‘ button does .
Nice work Amir .

Ray Bradbury , who has made Southern California his home since 1934 , turns 88 today .
He 's the author of more than 30 books , countless short stories , screenplays , poetry , plays and books for children .
Not only did he write " Fahrenheit 451 " and " The Martian Chronicles " and " Something Wicked This Way Comes , " he became a pop-culture futurist who has worked with everyone from Disney to rocket scientists .
He 's also been open and available to fans and young writers .
In 2001 , he advised the audience at Point Loma Nazarene University 's Sixth Annual Writer 's Symposium by the Sea ( full video below ) :
The problem with novels is you can spend a whole year writing one and it might not turn out well .
. . .
The best hygiene for beginning writers or intermediate writers is to write a hell of a lot of short stories .
If you can write one short story a week -- does n't matter what the quality is to start , but at least you 're practicing .
At the end of the year , you have 52 short stories , and I defy you to write 52 bad ones .
Ca n't be done .
Tomorrow Ray Bradbury be at the Mystery & Imagination Bookstore in Glendale at noon sharp to celebrate his 88th birthday .
At his party there last year , he accepted his Pulitzer citation -- and had cake .
This year the cake has a " Moby Dick " theme ; Bradbury wrote the screenplay for the 1956 movie .
" I had so many heroes that I wanted to be like , " Bradbury says in the Writer 's Symposium video .
He 's been a hero to many , many more .
Happy birthday , Mr. Bradbury !

THE VOYAGE OUT
By Virginia Woolf
This English novel , by an English writer , gives promise in its opening chapters of much entertainment .
Later , the reader is disappointed .
That the author knows her London in its most interesting aspects there can be no doubt .
But aside from a certain cleverness -- which , being all in one key , palls on one after going through a hundred pages of it -- there is little in this offering to make it stand out from the ruck of mediocre novels which make far less literary pretension .

HARMONIUM
By Wallace Stevens
Unpleasant as it is to record such a conclusion , the very remarkable work of Wallace Stevens cannot endure .
The verses which go to make up the volume '' Harmonium ' ' are as close to '' pure poetry ' ' as one could expect to come .
And so far as rhythms and vowels and consonants may be substituted for musical notes , the volume is an achievement .
But the achievement is not poetry , it is a tour de force , a ' ' stunt ' ' in the fantastic and the bizarre .
From one end of the book to the other there is not an idea that can vitally affect the mind , there is not a word that can arouse emotion .
The volume is a glittering edifice of icicles .
Wallace Stevens is a martyr to a lost cause .
Do You Love to Complain ?
You wo n’t Believe what Happened to Me Today …
Are you the victim of bad drivers , rude salespeople , annoying co-workers , or bosses that never give you credit for anything ?
How many times does it take you to get a problem resolved with a bill , purchase , etc ?
My wife and I have a standing joke that we always have to ask at least 2 different people at a company or agency what to do about a problem , since we ’re not likely to get the right answer the first time .
Sometimes it seems like the whole world is conspiring to give you grief .
No wonder that you feel like complaining to anyone who will listen !
It ’s so easy to slip into negativity , even when that accomplishes nothing .
And negativity is one of the most powerful ways to sabotage your own personal growth .
The No Complaining Rule
Jon Gordon recently released The No Complaining Rule , a book that tells how negativity destroys personal and corporate health .
Jon ’s earlier books are about personal energy .
In those books he teaches you how to raise your energy level .
Why is that important ?
It ’s critical that you have enough energy to achieve the dreams that are important to you , while keeping up with our increasingly complex world .
His new book is written as a business story .
Have you ever read a book in that style ?
Some people love them , while other people who read them are just waiting for the author to get to the point .
Stories are often a great way to pass ideas .
Our brains love stories , and the contents of the story often make a deep impression on us .
Have you ever wanted to make a change to your behavior or attitudes ?
Stories are a particularly powerful way to sneak challenging ideas into our heads , and start the process of change .
Complaints into Solutions
Jon ’s book is self - described as “ A story about positive ways to turn complaints into solutions , innovations , and success . ”
When someone discovers , or has important insight into a problem , they might write about it without providing any action plan .
That ’s ok .
The writer wants to raise awareness about a problem that has no clear solution yet .
But in a way , it ’s like making a valid complaint .
The company should hear the complaint , but unless that company tries to address the issue and find a solution , the only consequence of the complaint may be the negativity that it spreads .
Jon ’s book points out some of the key dangers of negativity .
For example :
Negativity costs between 250-300 Billion / year in lost productivity
90 % of doctor visits are stress related , and # 1 cause of office stress is coworkers and their complaining
Negativity affects the morale , performance , and productivity of teams
One person ca n’t make a team , but one can destroy it .
Just one negative person can create a miserable environment for everyone else
And negativity is n’t only a problem in the workplace .
Negative emotions are associated with :
Health problems , and shorter life span
More pain
Less Energy
Fewer friends
Less success
Jon ’s book does n’t just complain about the hazards of negativity .
He offers solutions including : the no complaining rule , three no -complaining tools , 5 things to do instead of complaining , and corporate and personal action plans .
You might be thinking :
This is ridiculous .
If I eliminate complaints , I ’ll never consider the risks or downside to my plans .
And you ’re sort of right .
This book is not about completely eliminating complaints .
It ’s about using complaints in a balanced way , tied to solutions .
Jon ’s book is about eliminating mindless complaining , breaking out of a negative mindset where complaining is done for its own sake .
As an example , here ’s Jon ’s
No complaining rule :
“ Employees are not allowed to mindlessly complain to their coworkers .
If they have a problem or complaint about their job , their company , their customer , or anything else , they are encouraged to bring the issue to their manager or someone who is in a position to address the complaint .
However , the employees must share one or two possible solutions to their complaint as well . ”
What ’s Missing ?
Is there anything missing from this book ?
Yes .
Jon does n’t give you an important warning .
This rule wo n’t work for every company .
Why not ?
True , these are simple and incredibly powerful ideas .
But , the ideas in this book offer a fundamental change in the mindset of a corporation and its employees .
The No complaining rule must be implemented at every level of the organization to succeed .
A company ’s leadership must commit itself to this change personally , to set an example for everyone else .
Fundamental personal or corporate change is hard , and some people , leaders or not , are not willing to face it .
Still , there are many companies that will be able to implement this new mindset in the organization , and benefit tremendously .
Is your company one of these ?
( Take a look at The No Complaining Rule at amazon.com , or Jon ’s website for more information . )
Suppose you have the bad habit of dwelling too much on the same negative thoughts .
And suppose there ’s no outward physical manifestation associated to them .
It ’s just negative thinking , like “ I ’m so depressed ” or “ I hate my job ” or “ I ca n’t do this ” or “ I hate being fat . ”
How do you break a bad habit when it ’s entirely in your mind ?
There are actually quite a number of ways to decondition a negative thought pattern .
The basic idea is to replace the old pattern with a new one .
Mentally resisting the negative thought will usually backfire — you ’ll simply reinforce it and make it even worse .
The more you fire those neurons in the same way , the stronger the pattern becomes .
Here ’s a little method I use to break negative thought patterns .
It ’s basically something I concocted from a combination of the swish pattern from NLP and a memory technique known as chaining .
I usually find the swish pattern alone to be weak and ineffective , but this method works very well for me .
Instead of trying to resist the negative thought pattern , you will redirect it .
Think of it like mental kung fu .
Take the energy of the negative thought and rechannel it into a positive thought .
With a little mental conditioning , whenever the negative thought occurs , your mind will automatically flow into the linked positive thought .
It ’s similar to Pavlov ’s dogs learning to salivate when the bell rang .
Here ’s how it works :
Let ’s assume your negative thought is a subvocalization , meaning that it ’s like you hear a voice in your head that says something you want to change , like , “ I ’m an idiot . ”
If the negative thought is visual ( a mental image ) or kinesthetic ( a gut feeling ) , you can use a similar process .
In many cases the thought will manifest as a combination of all three ( visual , auditory , and kinesthetic ) .
Step 1 : Turn the negative thought into a mental image .
Take that little voice , and turn it into a corresponding mental picture .
For example , if your thought is , “ I ’m an idiot , ” imagine yourself wearing a dunce cap , dressed very foolishly , and jumping around like a dork .
See yourself surrounded by other people all pointing at you while you shout , “ I ’m an idiot . ”
The more you exaggerate the scene , the better .
Imagine bright colors , lots of animation , rapid movement , and even sexual imagery if it helps you remember .
Rehearse this scene over and over in your mind until you reach the point where thinking the negative thought automatically brings up this goofy imagery .
If you have trouble visualizing , you can also do the above in an auditory fashion .
Translate the negative thought into a sound , such as a jingle that you sing .
Go through the same process with sound instead of imagery .
It works either way .
I happen to prefer the visual method though .
Step 2 : Select an empowering replacement thought .
Now decide what thought you ’d like to have instead of the negative one .
So if you ’ve been thinking , “ I ’m an idiot , ” maybe you ’d like to replace that with “ I ’m brilliant . ”
Choose a thought that empowers you in a way that disrupts the disempowering effect of the original negative thought .
Step 3 : Turn the positive thought into a mental image .
Now go through the same process you used in Step 1 to create a new mental scene from the positive thought .
So with the example “ I ’m brilliant , ” you might imagine yourself standing tall , posing like Superman with your hands on your hips .
Picture a giant light bulb appearing just above your head .
The bulb turns on so bright that it ’s blinding , and you see yourself yelling , “ I ’m bbbbbrrrrilllllllliannnntttt ! ”
Again , keep rehearsing this scene until merely thinking the positive line automatically brings up the associated imagery .
Step 4 : Mentally chain the two images together .
Now take the images in Step 1 and Step 3 , and mentally glue them together .
This trick is used in memory techniques like chaining or pegging .
You want to morph the first scene into the second scene .
The NLP swish pattern would have you do a straight cut from one scene to the next , but I recommend you animate the first scene into the second .
A cut is very weak glue and often wo n’t stick .
So instead pretend you ’re the director of a movie .
You have the opening scene and the closing scene , and you have to fill in the middle .
But you only have a few seconds of film left , so you want to find a way to make the transition happen as quickly as possible .
For example , one of the hecklers in the first scene might throw a light bulb at the idiot version of you .
The idiot you catches the bulb and screws it into the top of his head , wincing at the pain .
The bulb then grows into a giant bulb and turns on so bright it blinds all the hecklers .
You rip off your dorky clothing to reveal a shining white robe beneath it .
You stand tall like Superman and yell confidently , “ I ’m bbbbbrrrrilllllllliannnntttt ! ”
The hecklers fall to their knees and begin worshipping you .
Again , the more exaggeration you use , the better .
Exaggeration makes it easier to remember the scene because our brains are designed to remember the unusual .
Once you have the whole scene worked out , mentally rehearse it for speed .
Replay the whole scene over and over until you can imagine it from beginning to end in under 2 seconds , ideally in under 1 second .
It should be lightning fast , much faster than you ’d see in the real world .
Step 5 : Test .
Now you need to test your mental redirect to see if it works .
It ’s a lot like an HTML redirect — when you input the old negative URL , your mind should automatically redirect you to the positive one .
Merely thinking the negative thought should rapidly bring up the positive thought .
If you ’ve done this correctly , you wo n’t be able to help it .
The negative thought is the stimulus that causes your mind to run the whole pattern automatically .
So whenever you happen to think , “ I ’m an idiot , ” even without being fully aware of it , you end up thinking , “ I ’m brilliant . ”
If you ’ve never done visualizations like this before , it may take you several minutes or longer to go through this whole process .
Speed comes with practice .
The whole thing can literally be done in seconds once you get used to it .
Do n’t let the slowness of the first time through discourage you .
This is a learnable skill like any other , and it probably will feel a bit awkward the first time .
I recommend you experiment with different types of imagery .
You ’ll likely find some variations more effective than others .
Pay particular attention to association vs. dissociation .
When you ’re associated in a scene , you ’re imagining seeing it through your own eyes ( i.e. first - person perspective ) .
When you ’re dissociated you ’re imagining seeing yourself in the scene ( i.e. third - person perspective ) .
I usually get the best results when I dissociate in both scenes .
Your results may vary .
You may have to do some mental camera work if you switch from dissociated to associated or vice versa , but it can be done with practice .
I did a lot of this type of mental conditioning during the early 90s .
Whenever I uncovered a negative thought , I plucked it out and redirected it .
Within a few days , I had reprogrammed dozens of negative thought patterns , and pretty soon it became hard for my mind to even produce a negative thought or emotion .
Everything kept getting redirected to the positive side .
I think that ’s partly why I felt so confident about starting my own business right out of college — I used mental conditioning to redirect the thoughts of self - doubt to a more can - do mindset .
I also used this a lot while in college , and I ’m sure it helped me graduate faster than normal .
I still had to deal with plenty of real - world challenges , but at least I was n’t battling my own self - doubt at the same time .
This type of mental conditioning gave me a lot more conscious control over my internal states .
Today it ’s so internalized that I just do it automatically without even thinking about it .
My subconscious took over at some point , so whenever I have a thought like “ I can ’t , ” it automatically gets twisted into “ How can I ? ”
That ’s actually supposed to happen — with enough mental conditioning practice , your subconscious will take over .
Memory experts similarly report that with practice , techniques like pegging and chaining are taken over by the subconscious , just like riding a bicycle .
Give this process a try the next time you notice yourself dwelling on a negative thought .
I think you ’ll find it very empowering .
And feel free to share it with others who could use a mental pick - me - up .
