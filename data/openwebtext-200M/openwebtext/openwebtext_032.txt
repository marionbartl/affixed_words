For cash - strapped homeowners , it was a pitch they could n't refuse : Refinance your mortgage at a bargain rate and cut your payments in half .
New home buyers , stretching to afford something in a super - heated market , did n't even need to produce documentation , much less a downpayment .
Those who took the bait are in for a nasty surprise .
While many Americans have started to worry about falling home prices , borrowers who jumped into so - called option ARM loans have another , more urgent problem : payments that are about to skyrocket .
Slide Show
The option adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) might be the riskiest and most complicated home loan product ever created .
With its temptingly low minimum payments , the option ARM brought a whole new group of buyers into the housing market , extending the boom longer than it could have otherwise lasted , especially in the hottest markets .
Suddenly , almost anyone could afford a home -- or so they thought .
The option ARM 's low payments are only temporary .
And the less a borrower chooses to pay now , the more is tacked onto the balance .
The bill is coming due .
Many of the option ARMs taken out in 2004 and 2005 are resetting at much higher payment schedules -- often to the astonishment of people who thought the low installments were fixed for at least five years .
And because home prices have leveled off , borrowers can't count on rising equity to bail them out .
What 's more , steep penalties prevent them from refinancing .
The most diligent home buyers asked enough questions to know that option ARMs can be fraught with risk .
But others , caught up in real estate mania , ignored or failed to appreciate the risk .
There was plenty more going on behind the scenes they did n't know about , either : that their broker was paid more to sell option ARMs than other mortgages ; that their lender is allowed to claim the full monthly payment as revenue on its books even when borrowers choose to pay much less ; that the loan 's interest rates and up - front fees might not have been set by their bank but rather by a hedge fund ; and that they 'll soon be confronted with the choice of coughing up higher payments or coughing up their home .
The option ARM is " like the neutron bomb , " says George McCarthy , a housing economist at New York 's Ford Foundation .
" It 's going to kill all the people but leave the houses standing . "
Because banks do n't have to report how many option ARMs they underwrite , few choose to do so .
But the best available estimates show that option ARMs have soared in popularity .
They accounted for as little as 0.5 % of all mortgages written in 2003 , but that shot up to at least 12.3 % through the first five months of this year , according to FirstAmerican LoanPerformance , an industry tracker .
And while they made up at least 40 % of mortgages in Salinas , Calif . , and 26 % in Naples , Fla. , they 're not just found in overheated coastal markets : Through Mar. 31 of this year , at least 51 % of mortgages in West Virginia and 26 % in Wyoming were option ARMs .
Stock and bond analysts estimate that as many as 1.3 million borrowers took out as much as $ 389 billion in option ARMs in 2004 and 2005 .
And it 's not letting up .
Despite the housing slump , option ARMs totaling $ 77.2 billion were written in the second quarter of this year , according to investment bank Keefe , Bruyette & Woods Inc .
The First Wave
After prolonging the boom , these exotic mortgages could worsen the bust .
They also betray such a lack of due diligence on the part of lenders and borrowers that it raises questions of what other problems may be lurking .
And most of the pain will be borne by ordinary people , not the lenders , brokers , or financiers who created the problem .
Gordon Burger is among the first wave of option ARM casualties .
The 42 - year - old police officer from a suburb of Sacramento , Calif. , is stuck in a new mortgage that 's making him poorer by the month .
Burger , a solid earner with clean credit , has bought and sold several houses in the past .
In February he got a flyer from a broker advertising an interest rate of 2.2 % .
It was an unbeatable opportunity , he thought .
If he refinanced the mortgage on his $ 500,000 home into an option ARM , he could save $ 14,000 in interest payments over three years .
Burger quickly pulled the trigger , switching out of his 5.1 % fixed - rate loan .
" The payment schedule looked like what we talked about , so I just started signing away , " says Burger .
He did n't read the fine print .
After two months Burger noticed that the minimum payment of $ 1,697 was actually adding $ 1,000 to his balance every month .
" I 'm not making any ground on this house ; it 's a loss every month , " he says .
He says he was told by his lender , Minneapolis - based Homecoming Financial , a unit of Residential Capital , the nation 's fifth - largest mortgage shop , that he'd have to pay more than $ 10,000 in prepayment penalties to refinance out of the loan .
If he 's unhappy , he should take it up with his broker , the bank said .
" They know they 're selling crap , and they 're doing it in a way that 's very deceiving , " he says .
" Unfortunately , I got sucked into it . "
In a written statement , Residential said it could n't comment on Burger 's loan but that " each mortgage is designed to meet the specific financial needs of a consumer . "
The loans certainly meet the needs of banks .
Option ARMs offer several payment choices each month .
Among Burger 's alternatives were one for $ 2,524 , about what a standard fixed - rate mortgage would be on the new amount , and the $ 1,697 he pays .
Why would his bank make the minimum so low ?
Thanks to a perfectly legal accounting practice , no matter how little Burger pays each month , the bank gets to record the full amount .
Option ARMs were created in 1981 and for years were marketed to well - heeled home buyers who wanted the option of making low payments most months and then paying off a big chunk all at once .
For them , option ARMs offered flexibility .
So how did these unusual loans get into the hands of so many ordinary folks ?
The sequence of events was orderly and even rational , at least within a flawed system .
In the early years of the housing boom , falling interest rates made safe fixed - rate loans attractive to borrowers .
As home prices soared , banks pushed adjustable - rate loans with lower initial payments .
When those got too pricey , banks hawked loans that required only interest payments for the first few years .
And then they flogged option ARMs -- not as financial - planning tools for the wealthy but as affordability tools for the masses .
Banks tapped an army of unregulated mortgage brokers to do what needed to be done to keep the money flowing , even if it meant putting dangerous loans in the hands of people who could n't handle or did n't understand the risk .
And Wall Street greased the skids by taking on much of the new risk banks were creating .
Now the signs of excess are crystal clear .
Up to 80 % of all option ARM borrowers make only the minimum payment each month , according to Fitch Ratings .
The rest of the money gets added to the balance of the mortgage , a situation known as negative amortization .
And once balances grow to a certain amount , the loans automatically reset at far higher payments .
Most of these borrowers are n't paying down their loans ; they 're underpaying them up .
Yet the banking system has insulated itself reasonably well from the thousands of personal catastrophes to come .
For one thing , banks can sell some of their option ARMs off to Wall Street , where they 're packaged with other , better loans and re-sold in chunks to investors .
Some $ 182 billion of the option ARMs written in 2004 and 2005 and an additional $ 83 billion this year have been sold , repackaged , rated by debt - rating agencies , and marketed to investors as mortgage - backed securities , says Bear , Stearns & Co. ( NYSE : BSC - News ) Banks also sell an unknown amount of them directly to hedge funds and other big investors with appetites for risk .
The rest of the option ARMs remain on lenders ' books , where for now they 're generating huge phantom profits for some lenders .
That 's because , according to generally accepted accounting principles , or GAAP , banks can count as revenue the highest amount of an option ARM payment -- the so - called fully amortized amount -- even when borrowers make only the minimum payment .
In other words , banks can claim future revenue now , inflating earnings per share .
For many industries , so - called accrual accounting , which lets companies book sales when they contract for them rather than when they receive the cash , makes sense .
The revenues will eventually come .
But accrual accounting does n't apply well to option ARMs , since it 's more difficult to know if unpaid interest will ever cross a banker 's desk .
" This is basically an IOU that may never get paid , " says Robert Lacoursiere , an analyst at Banc of America Securities .
James Grant of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer recently wrote that negative - amortization accounting is " frankly a fraudulent gambit .
But what it lacks in morality , it compensates for in ingenuity . "
The Financial Accounting Standards Board , which is responsible for keeping GAAP up to date , stands by its standard but told BusinessWeek in a written statement that it is " concerned that the disclosures associated with these types of loans ( are ) not providing enough transparency relative to their associated risks . "
Camouflaged Losses
Risks or not , the accounting treatment is boosting reported profits sharply .
At Santa Monica ( Calif. ) - based FirstFed Financial Corp. ( NYSE : FED - News ) , " deferred interest " -- what an outsider might call phantom income -- made up 67 % of second - quarter pretax profits .
FirstFed did not respond to requests for comment .
At Oakland ( Calif . ) - based Golden West Financial Corp. ( NYSE : GDW - News ) , which has been selling option ARMs for two decades , deferred interest made up about 59.6 % of the bank 's earnings in the first half of 2006 .
" It 's not the loan that 's the problem , " says Herbert M. Sandler , CEO of World Savings Bank , parent of Golden West .
" The problem is with the quality of the underwriting . "
In the middle of one of the hottest U.S. markets , Coral Gables ( Fla. ) - based BankUnited Financial Corp . ( NASDAQ : BKUNA - News ) posted a $ 14.8 million loss for the quarter ended June , 2005 .
Yet it reported record profits of $ 23.8 million for the quarter ended in June of this year -- $ 20.9 million of which was earned in deferred interest .
Some 92 % of its new loans were option ARMs .
Humberto L. Lopez , chief financial officer , insists the bank underwrites carefully .
" The option ARMs have gotten a bit of a raised eyebrow because we generate and book noncash earnings .
But ... it's our money , and we do feel comfortable we 'll get it back . "
Even the loans that blow up can be hidden with fancy bookkeeping .
David Hendler of New York - based CreditSights , a bond research shop , predicts that banks in coming quarters will increasingly move weak loans into so - called held - for - sale accounts .
There the loans will sit , sequestered from the rest of the portfolio , until they 're sold to collection agencies or to investors .
In the latter case , a transaction on an ailing loan registers on the books as a trading loss , gets mixed up with other trading activities and -- presto ! -- it vanishes from shareholders ' sight .
" There are a lot of ways to camouflage the actual experience , " says Hendler .
There 's no way to camouflage what Harold , a former computer technician who asked BusinessWeek not to publish his last name , is about to face .
He 's disabled and has one source of income : the $ 1,600 per month he receives in Social Security disability payments .
In September , 2005 , Harold refinanced out of a fixed - rate mortgage and into an option ARM for his $ 150,000 home in Chicago .
The minimum monthly payment for the first year is $ 899 , which he can afford .
The interest - only payment is $ 1,329 , which he can't .
The fully amortized payment is $ 1,454 , which his lender , Washington Mutual ( NYSE : WM - News ) , gets to count on its books .
WaMu , no fly - by - night operation , said it could n't comment on Harold 's case , citing confidentiality issues .
A spokesman says the bank " accounts for its option ARM product in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . "
WaMu has about $ 12 billion in loans negatively amortizing right now , up from $ 2.5 billion in 2005 , estimates CreditSights '
Hen dler .
In a written statement , WaMu said " borrowers who request an adjustable loan with payment options should understand those options and potential adjustments throughout the life of the loan .
We make detailed disclosures to customers that are designed to develop a more informed consumer of mortgage products and ensure that our customers are comfortable with the loan products they select . "
Hard Sell
To get the deals done , banks have turned increasingly to unregulated mortgage brokers , who now account for 80 % of all mortgage originations , double what it was 10 years ago , according to the National Association of Mortgage Brokers .
In 2004 banks began offering fatter sales commissions on option ARMs to encourage brokers to push them , says Gail McKenzie , assistant U.S. attorney in Atlanta , who is investigating mortgage brokers for improper practices .
The problem , of course , is that many brokers care more about commissions than customers .
They use aggressive sales tactics , harping on the minimum payment on an option ARM and neglecting to mention the future implications .
Some even imply verbally that temporary teaser rates of 1 % to 2 % are permanent , even though the fine print says otherwise .
It 's easy to confuse borrowers with option ARM numbers .
A recent Federal Reserve study showed that one in four homeowners is mystified by basic adjustable - rate loans .
Add multiple payment options into the mix , and the mortgage game can be utterly baffling .
Billy and Carolyn Shaw are among the growing ranks of borrowers who have taken out loans they say they did n't understand .
The retired couple from the Salinas ( Calif . ) area needed to tap about $ 50,000 in equity from their $ 385,000 home to cover mounting expenses .
Billy , 66 , a retired mechanic , has diabetes .
Carolyn , 61 , has been caring for her grandchildren , 10 - year - old twins , since her daughter 's death in 2000 .
The Shaws have a fixed income of $ 3,000 a month that will fall by about $ 1,000 in November after Billy 's disability benefits run out .
Their new loan 's minimum payment of about $ 1,413 is manageable so far , but the fully amortized amount of about $ 3,329 is out of the question .
In a little over a year , they 've added some $ 8,500 to their loan balance and now face a big reset if they continue to pay only the minimum .
" We did n't totally understand what was taking place , " says Carolyn .
" You have to pay attention .
We did n't , and we 're really stuck here . "
The Shaws ' lender , Golden Wes t , says it routinely calls customers to ask them if they are happy and understand their mortgage loan .
Then there 's the illegal stuff .
Mortgage fraud is one of the fastest - growing white - collar crimes in the nation , costing $ 1 billion in 2005 , double the year before .
A slower housing market could foster more wrongdoing .
" With a tighter market , you are going to find there is more incentive to manipulate , " says Tim Irvin of Irvin Investigations & Research Services in Spring , Texas .
" Brokers are having a harder time getting business , so they 're getting creative . "
Concerns like these have n't curbed Wall Street 's hunger for option ARMS .
" At a price , you can originate or sell anything , " says Thomas F. Marano , global head of mortgage and asset - backed securities at Bear Stearns .
Hedge funds have been particularly active , buying risky loans directly from banks and cutting out the bundlers in the middle .
Kathleen C. Engel , an associate professor of law at Cleveland - Marshall College of Law at Cleveland State University , says Wall Street and hedge fund money has helped to finance widespread lending abuses , particularly among the most vulnerable borrowers .
Pros Go Unscathed
Why are hedge funds willing to buy risky loans directly ?
Because they can demand terms that help insulate them from losses .
And banks , knowing what the hedge funds want in advance , simply take it out of the hides of borrowers , many of whom qualify for lower rates based on their credit histories .
" Even if the loan goes bad , ( the hedge funds are ) still making money hand over fist , " says Engel .
Eventually , some of it will go sour .
But the Wall Street pros who buy option ARMs are in the business of managing risk , and no one expects widespread losses .
They 've taken on billons in iffy option ARMs , but the loans are no shakier than the billions in emerging market debt or derivatives they buy and sell all the time .
Blowups are factored into the investing decision .
Banks that hold lots of option ARMs on their books will surely be hit by loan defaults in coming years .
" It 's certainly reasonable to expect to see some excesses wrung out , " says Brad A. Morrice , president and CEO of New Century Financial Corp .
But even here the damage will likely be limited .
Banks use insurance and other financial instruments to protect their portfolios , and they hold real assets -- homes -- as collateral .
Christopher L. Cagan , director of research and analytics at First American Real Estate Solutions , a researcher and unit of title insurer First American , forecasts total defaults of $ 300 billion across all types of loans , not just option ARMs , over the next five years -- less than 1 % of total homeowner equity .
( In comparison , JPMorgan Chase & Co. alone has a mortgage portfolio of $ 182.8 billion . )
Cagan estimates that banks will end up losing only $ 100 billion of it all told .
Most of the pain will be born by ordinary people .
And it 's already happening .
More than a fifth of option ARM loans in 2004 and 2005 are upside down -- meaning borrowers ' homes are worth less than their debt .
If home prices fall 10 % , that number would double .
" The number of houses for sale is tripling in some markets , so people are not going to get out of their debt , " says the Ford Foundation 's McCarthy .
" A lot are going to walk . "
Jennifer and Eric Hinz of Somerset , Wis. , are feeling the squeeze .
They refinanced out of a 5.25 % fixed - rate , 30 - year loan in June , 2005 , and into an option ARM with a 1 % teaser rate from Indymac Bank .
The $ 1,483 payment for their original mortgage dropped to as low as $ 747 with the new option ARM .
They say they had no idea when they signed up , however , that the low payment adds $ 600 in deferred interest to their balance every month .
Worse , they thought the 1 % would last three years , but they 're already paying 7.68 % .
" What reasonable human being would ever knowingly give up a 5.25 % fixed - rate for what we 're getting now ? " says Eric , 36 , who works in commercial construction .
Refinancing is out because they can't afford the $ 15,000 or so in fees .
" I 'm paying more , and the interest is just going up and up and up , " says Jennifer , 34 , a stay - at - home mom .
" I feel like we got totally screwed . "
They say their mortgage broker has stopped returning their phone calls .
Indymac declined to commen t on the loan 's specifics .
Stories like these can be found across the socioeconomic spectrum , says Allen J. Fishbein , director of Housing & Credit Policy for the Consumer Federation of America .
In a May focus group , the CFA found that option ARM customers at all income levels said the loans were the only way they could afford their homes .
While many recognized that their mortgages could increase , " they professed complete surprise that they could increase as much as they could , " says Fishbein .
That lack of diligence will cost them over time .
Not that all option ARM holders go in blindly .
While the loans are marketed aggressively , plenty of holders know exactly what they 're getting into .
Jon and Meghan Bachman of Portland , Ore. , consider them wealth - building tools .
" We want to own a bunch of houses , " says Meghan .
" We 're hoping for early retirement . "
So far they have stayed out of the fire .
The couple , who are in their 30s , bought their first home , a 100 - year - old farm house in Portland , Ore. , in October , 2005 , with a no-money - down loan for $ 200,000 from GreenPoint Mortgage , a unit of NorthFork Bancorporation Inc .
By May , the value of the house had soared to $ 275,000 .
Rather than sit tight as their grandparents might have , the Bachmans , with an annual household income of $ 70,000 , took out a home equity loan to put a $ 30,000 downpayment on an investment property in an up - and - coming neighborhood nearby .
They pay a minimum of just $ 825 on their new $ 191,000 mortgage , and rent the house out for $ 100 more than that .
Sooner or later , the payment will rise .
Then they 'll have to raise the rent to stay in the black .
If the still - strong Portland housing market tanks , they could find themselves in deep trouble .
It 's a risk they say they 're willing to take .
Public policy has yet to catch up with the new complexities of the lending industry .
Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan , the banking industry 's main regulator , wants banks to clean up their act .
A source inside the federal Office of the Comptroller says Dugan intends to raise lending standards , as he did last year on credit cards , where super - low minimum payments made it improbable that cardholders would ever pay down debts .
New guidelines are expected this fall .
Fair - housing pundits suggest that mortgage lenders follow the lead of the securities industry and require that mortgage borrowers be not only eligible for a product but also suitable -- meaning the loan wo n't impose hardship .
Says Consumer Federation of America 's Fishbein : Buyers have to have a " reasonable prospect of being able to handle the payments , not at the initial rate , but ( assuming ) the worst - case scenario . "
So far , banks have shown little desire to raise their standards .
In February , Golden West announced it would raise its minimum option ARM payment to 2.6 % of the loan .
In March , Golden West 's Sandler wrote a nine - page letter to the Office of Thrift Supervision decrying the lax lending standards he was seeing .
" Foolish lenders who eventually stumble under the weight of their missteps will bring down innocent borrowers with them and leave the rest of us to clean up the mess , " he wrote .
But on May 7 , Golden West announced it was selling out to Charlotte ( N.C. ) - based Wachovia Corp . ( NYSE : WB - News ) .
By June it had dropped its option ARM rate back down to 1.50 % .
Sandler says the rates were changed according to the bank 's interest rate outlook .
Analyst Frederick Cannon of Keefe Bruyette & Woods says most banks do n't apologize for their option ARM businesses .
" Almost without exception everyone says ( the option ARM ) is a great loan , it 's plenty regulated , and do n't bug us , " he says .
In an April letter to regulators , Cindy Manzettie , chief credit officer for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati , said it's not the " lender 's responsibility to help the consumer determine the appropriate payment option each month ....
Paternalistic regulations that underestimate the intelligence of the American public do not work . "

The readers ' editor has considered a number of complaints from Noam Chomsky concerning an interview with him by Emma Brockes published in G2 , the second section of the Guardian , on October 31 .
He has found in favour of Professor Chomsky on three significant complaints .
Principal among these was a statement by Ms Brockes that in referring to atrocities committed at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war he had placed the word " massacre " in quotation marks .
This suggested , particularly when taken with other comments by Ms Brockes , that Prof Chomsky considered the word inappropriate or that he had denied that there had been a massacre .
Prof Chomsky has been obliged to point out that he has never said or believed any such thing .
The Guardian has no evidence whatsoever to the contrary and retracts the statement with an unreserved apology to Prof Chomsky .
The headline used on the interview , about which Prof Chomsky also complained , added to the misleading impression given by the treatment of the word massacre .
It read : Q : Do you regret supporting those who say the Srebrenica massacre was exaggerated ?
A : My only regret is that I did n't do it strongly enough .
No question in that form was put to Prof Chomsky .
This part of the interview related to his support for Diana Johnstone ( not Diane as it appeared in the published interview ) over the withdrawal of a book in which she discussed the reporting of casualty figures in the war in former Yugoslavia .
Both Prof Chomsky and Ms Johnstone , who has also written to the Guardian , have made it clear that Prof Chomsky 's support for Ms Johnstone , made in the form of an open letter with other signatories , related entirely to her right to freedom of speech .
The Guardian also accepts that and acknowledges that the headline was wrong and unjustified by the text .
Ms Brockes 's misrepresentation of Prof Chomsky 's views on Srebrenica stemmed from her misunderstanding of his support for Ms Johnstone .
Neither Prof Chomsky nor Ms Johnstone have ever denied the fact of the massacre .
Prof Chomsky has also objected to the juxtaposition of a letter from him , published two days after the interview appeared , with a letter from a survivor of Omarska .
While he has every sympathy with the writer , Prof Chomsky believes that publication was designed to undermine his position , and addressed a part of the interview which was false .
Both letters were published under the heading Falling out over Srebrenica .
At the time these letters were published , following two in support of Prof Chomsky published the previous day , no formal complaint had been received from him .
The letters were published by the letters editor in good faith to reflect readers ' views .
With hindsight it is acknowledged that the juxtaposition has exacerbated Prof Chomsky 's complaint and that is regretted .
The Guardian has now withdrawn the interview from the website .

And those African workers lucky enough to be part of a social security plan are not guaranteed comfort .
The AIDS epidemic has left many national plans on shaky financial footing because there are more payouts for medical care and death benefits but not as many contributions .
Simply prying the benefits from bureaucrats can be a job in itself .
Charles Owala , 56 , a retired Kenyan civil servant , has spent nearly two years trying to get his pension money .
" First when I came here at the beginning of 2004 , the officers told me to wait because my membership card number was nowhere to be seen , " he said , camped outside the National Social Security Fund offices in Nairobi .
" It took a lot of time for it to be traced .
Now I 'm being told there are some other contributions that my employer has failed to remit .
What can I do ?
Wait again . "
Those without an employer to contribute to a formal plan -- those who , to make ends meet , sell food from the curb , iron clothing , dig ditches , harvest crops or perform any number of the other small - scale tasks that keep Africa going -- have long been left out completely .
They are particularly vulnerable to illness because of poverty and exposure , but often put off doctor visits as long as possible .
They try traditional medicine because of its lower cost .
And they often end up flat on their backs as the price of staying alive soars out of reach .
The fact that many manage to get by is largely because those who have little share with those who have even less .
The community insurance initiatives build on this poor - helping - poor philosophy .
They differ from private insurance companies in that they are run by the beneficiaries and not intended to make a single franc .

Visit nature 's magnificence , and find that elusive solitudeIf you prefer to visit with magnificent Mother Nature in ( near ) solitude , you 'll find our favorite crowd - free national parks in the US and Canada every bit as dramatic as the big headliners , yet agreeably free of the usual mobs .
We ’ve laid out the details on how to take in the grandest of canyons from a little - known access point , and have proposed two further options in America ’s heartland : a park boasting lunar - like landscapes and verdant prairies and another with one - of - a- kind vistas of sweeping sandstone arches .
Tree - huggers will relish their seclusion at two ancient forests on both coasts , while water - lovers will delight in untamed Texan rafting adventures , snorkeling at an underwater Floridian marine park , or whale - watching on a Canadian cape .
The more remote you go , the more likely you are to find that elusive solitude ; to that end , we also highly recommend an archipelago dubbed the “ Canadian Galapagos ” and an island park home to the world ’s tallest volcano and the Hawaiian goddess Pele .
Arches National Park , one of a quintet of stunning Utah national parks , may not attract the same number of visitors as the state ’s more - accessible Zion or Bryce Canyon parks , but its surreal terrain of towering sandstone arches makes this Southern Utah wilderness wonderland one sensory experience not to be missed .
Two particular arches reign supreme over the 2000 - plus that dot the scene : Delicate Arch , a lone - standing arch whose likeness also embellishes Utah license plates ; and the slender 300 - feet - high Landscape Arch , the largest in the park .
Situated in southwestern South Dakota , the Badlands National Park marries mixed - grass prairies with pinnacles , spires , canyons , and otherworldly buttes of varied colors and shapes to create a lunar - worthy landscape .
The product of millions of years of erosion and deposits , this geological anomaly has the Sioux to thank for its name ; they called it mako sika or " land bad , ” in reference to how difficult it was to cross .
Modern - day visitors will be relieved to know that a nicely paved road now connects the park ’s nine scenic overlooks , trailheads , and visitor ’s center .
For a wild ride , thrill - seekers should raft down the unruly Rio Grande , the 118 - mile - long river winding along the southern boundary of Big Bend National Park , one of America ’s largest and least - visited national parks .
Although named for the substantial bend in its roaring river , most of Big Bend ’s acreage actually consists of arid desert expanses , giant canyons , and the Chisos mountain range – a terrain that has disgorged superb fossil specimens of ancient plants and dinosaurs .
Dive in and explore the ocean floor at this unique aquatic national park .
The largest marine park in North America ( at about 173,000 acres ) , Biscayne lies just 25 miles from Miami and sits on part of the world ’s third - largest coral - reef system .
Most of the park is accessible only by boat ( kayak , canoe , or motorized tour ) ; scuba diving and snorkeling excursions will help you get up close to the abundant underwater life .
Alexander Graham Bell , Cape Breton 's famous resident , once said " I have traveled around the globe .
I have seen the Canadian and American Rockies , the Andes , the Alps and the Highlands of Scotland , but for simple beauty , Cape Breton outrivals them all . "
His praise surely extended to the national park occupying its northern edges that ’s home to the illustrious Cabot Trail .
The park ’s rugged coastline , forested plateaus , canyon views , and verdant highlands are marvelous to behold , as are vistas of frolicking whales and soaring bald eagles .
Tree - huggers rejoiced at the founding of Congaree National Park , a 22,200 - acre terrain that earned its national stripes as recently as 2003 .
Located about 20 miles from Columbia , South Carolina , this recent newcomer preserves the largest tract of old - growth floodplain forest in the whole of North America – giant hardwoods , lofty pines , and bald cypresses are just some of the roughly 75 species of ancient trees that form one of the world ’s highest natural canopies .
Not surprisingly , the incredible biodiversity generated here has earned the park due rank as an International Biosphere Reserve .
Millions of visitors from around the globe descend on the Grand Canyon each year to try and wrap their minds around its seemingly infinite reach – to do so in relative solitude , head to the canyon ’s North Rim instead .
Despite being located just 10 miles from the South Rim ( and its popular Grand Canyon Village ) , the North Rim is that much harder to reach that few visitors do – those that do go the extra mile ( or 215 in this case , by car ) will be rewarded with serenity and an unblocked view of one of Mother Nature ’s most stupendous creations .
Although only 3000 visitors reach this virtually untrammeled park each year , this magnificent archipelago off the coast of British Columbia is arguably one of the most beautiful and diverse landscapes in all of North America .
Home to abundant wildlife – in fact , the island chain is often referred to as the “ Canadian Galapagos ” – the area is also the ancestral home of the Haida , a Pacific Northwest tribe whose rich culture and settlements is still visible here .
Towered over by the glacier - sculpted peaks of the San Christoval Mountains , and home to beautifully carved totem poles and old log - house villages amidst massive old pines , this pristine wilderness is only accessible by boat or float plane .
It ’s not all sand and surf on Hawaii 's Big Island .
This hot spot ( geologically speaking , at any rate ) also finds fiery lava flowing from the mouth of one of the world ’s most - active volcanoes at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park , where the daunting Kilauea regularly spews molten 2100 - degree lava that reshapes the landscape as it gushes down into the Pacific .
Not to be outdone , the world ’s largest volcano , Mauna Loa , is also found here , rearing up 13,677 feet from below sea level .
The 11 - mile - loop Crater Rim Drive provides a dramatic overview of the scene ; do stop at the Halemaumau Crater Overlook to peek into the bubbling lava - filled home of Pele , the Hawaiian volcano goddess .
Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks , two California parks co-managed by the National Parks Service , are often overshadowed by hugely popular Yosemite , but hard to overlook all the same .
Dominated by the Sierra Nevada range , whose peaks shelter the headwaters of three rivers , diverse wildlife , and of course , the park ’s eponymous groves of massive sequoias , this “ land of giants ” – so - called for the sheer size of the trees , which can reach heights of over 300 feet and widths of 30 feet – includes the aptly named Giant Forest , where you ’ll find the 2200 - year - old General Sherman Tree , the largest tree on earth .
Before 9/11 , Mr. Cheney was trying to undermine the institutional and legal structure of multilateral foreign policy : he championed the abrogation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow in order to build an antimissile shield that does n't work but makes military contactors rich .
Early in his tenure , Mr. Cheney , who quit as chief executive of Halliburton to run with Mr. Bush in 2000 , gathered his energy industry cronies at secret meetings in Washington to rewrite energy policy to their specifications .
Mr. Cheney offered the usual excuses about the need to get candid advice on important matters , and the courts , sadly , bought it .
But the task force was not an exercise in diverse views .
Mr. Cheney gathered people who agreed with him , and allowed them to write national policy for an industry in which he had recently amassed a fortune .
The effort to expand presidential power accelerated after 9/11 , taking advantage of a national consensus that the president should have additional powers to use judiciously against terrorists .
Mr. Cheney started agitating for an attack on Iraq immediately , pushing the intelligence community to come up with evidence about a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda that never existed .
His team was central to writing the legal briefs justifying the abuse and torture of prisoners , the idea that the president can designate people to be " unlawful enemy combatants " and detain them indefinitely , and a secret program allowing the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on American citizens without warrants .
And when Senator John McCain introduced a measure to reinstate the rule of law at American military prisons , Mr. Cheney not only led the effort to stop the amendment , but also tried to revise it to actually legalize torture at C.I.A. prisons .
There are finally signs that the democratic system is trying to rein in the imperial presidency .
Republicans in the Senate and House forced Mr. Bush to back the McCain amendment , and Mr. Cheney 's plan to legalize torture by intelligence agents was rebuffed .
Congress also agreed to extend the Patriot Act for five weeks rather than doing the administration 's bidding and rushing to make it permanent .
On Wednesday , a federal appeals court refused to allow the administration to transfer Jose Padilla , an American citizen who has been held by the military for more than three years on suspicion of plotting terrorist attacks , from military to civilian custody .
After winning the same court 's approval in September to hold Mr. Padilla as an unlawful combatant , the administration abruptly reversed course in November and charged him with civil crimes unrelated to his arrest .
That decision was an obvious attempt to avoid having the Supreme Court review the legality of the detention powers that Mr. Bush gave himself , and the appeals judges refused to go along .
When I was planning to write about Find and Run Robot .
I was wondering why would someone need it on a Windows 7 or for that matter a Windows Vista machine .
I totally understand it 's need on prior versions of Windows before Windows Vista .
But after I installed and started using it I was in love with this utility .
Also , it 's much more advanced than Vista or Windows 7 Search programs and files feature .
It 's a great software and I am totally in love with it .

Welcome to WCP , the FIFA World Cup Markov Chain Monte Carlo Tournament Predictor and Bet Advisor .
It was originally implemented for the 2006 Fifa World Cup and then updated for the 2010 FIFA World Cup .
IMPORTANT : This is a legacy page .
It has been preserved on our website for historical reasons , even though it may contain old or outdated information and links .
The World Cup Predictor ( Markov - Chain Monte Carlo ) and Bet Advisor
This online tool ( WCP ) performs two main functions .
Firstly , it uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate the likelyhoods of each team winning the FIFA World Cup tournament -- using the pairwise probabilities for each team matchup provided by users .
Secondly , it uses these estimates , and the current betting odds found online , to identify the bets with the highest expected values .
What Is Markov Chain Monte Carlo ?
Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithms work by repeatedly simulating a sequence of progressive events over and over , and accumulating statistics on final outcomes .
MCMC works by leveraging simple single - event probabilities , that you can easily estimate , into long - range predictions involving many interactions .
There 's no magic involved .
It 's basically a way of estimating the probabilities of complex multi-step outcomes by average many outcomes of brute force simulation .
MCMC and the World Cup
In the case of the World Cup , MCMC amounts to simulating complete tournaments by playing each game from round one through the final , choosing winners based on simple pairwise expectations of how the teams pair up against each other .
The pairwise match - up probabilities are the key to being able to simulate entire tournaments autonomously , and must be provided by an expert or from records of previously played games .
You can create your own pairwise estimations using WCP '10 or use one of the probability estimation tables generated by an expert .
Obviously , the accuracy of this pairwise match - up table is critical to getting good results from the Tournament Simulator .
The key to the power of MCMC methods is that they let you convert simple known ( or relatively easily estimable ) probabilities , and by simulating full sequences of outcomes over and over again , arrive at an estimate of the probabilities of different long - term highly - interactive final outcomes .
There are some important caveats to keep in mind .
The MCMC approach has the potential to give an extremely accurate estimate of the probabilities of each team winning the tournament , assuming that one can come up with an accurate model of the distribution of game scores likely to result when a given pair of teams meet up .
However , this assumption is a generous one , and that is where the trouble starts .
A Perfect Probability Function ?
There is no objectively perfect model of the probability distributions of game scores between any two teams , and there are tons of choices for functions to represent probability distributions .
This is where we must choose some approximate parameterized function to represent the range of probability distributions of possible game scores .
Our goal is a probability distribution function that can capture a reasonable range of match - ups , and which is reasonably easy for an expert to express .
For psychological reasons involving motivation - in a real match game there may be some more complex interaction between team scores in a match , but this seems unlikely to have a significant effect on which team wins the game .
Truncated Gaussian and Poisson Distributions
To represent the probability distribution of scores in a game , we use either a Truncated Gaussian or a Poisson distribution , with user specified means ( and standard deviations in the case of a Gaussian ) .
For each possible game match - up ( i.e. every pair of teams ) , an expert must provide an estimate of the mean number of goals scored by each team .
The mean values can be seen as a kind of average score if the two teams played over and over again .
If using Truncated Gaussian functions for the distribution of scores , an expert also needs to provide an estimate of the Standard Deviation of the provided means .
The standard deviation can be seen as a measure of the noise in the estimate .
More precisely , it is a measure of the average distance of the data values from their mean .
The larger the standard deviation , the more randomness that will result when the games are simulated .
With standard deviations of 0 , the expert is saying that he is 100 % confident of the exact score of the game .
Larger values reflect less confidence ( or more innate randomness ) .
Random numbers generated from the Gaussian are rounded and truncated at 0 .
Standard deviation parameters are ignored when using Poisson distribution .
Which probability Function Should You Use ?
You can choose which probability distribution to use .
In practice we do n't expect much difference between using a Gaussian and Poisson distribution .
The Poisson is a bit simpler since it does not require a Standard Deviation value to be provided .
You might use a Gaussian if you want to experiment with standard deviations other than 1.0 .
Larger values induce more noise ; smaller values put the simulated game scores close to their means .
Round One - Groups and Rankings
Why not just estimate the probability that each team will beat each other team ?
Good question .
You could make a good case that such an estimate would be easier for experts to provide , rather than score distributions .
The problem is the way the first round of the FIFA World Cup tournament is conducted .
It 's not a simple elimination process , and is instead based on points scored .
To use simulated games to predict a tournament winner we need to actually simulate the entire tournament according to FIFA rules .
The official tournament rules are a bit unusual and complicated .
The first round is a " knock - out " round , where teams are organized into 8 groups of 4 teams .
Within each group , 6 games are played , so that each team plays each of the others in their group .
Then the top 2 " ranked " teams in each group advances to the second round .
We must simulate this ranking process .
For each game played , a team gets + 3 points if they win , and +1 point if they tie .
If the top two teams in a group cannot be uniquely chosen based on points , they are ranked based on highest goal differential , and then total goals .
If this is still not enough to determine the top two ranked teams uniquely , they are compared based on performance playing each other .
If this fails , FIFA judges do something crazy to pick a winner .
We simulate all of these ranking procedures except the last two .
While we could use head - to - head performance to break ties in that penultimate case , we decided it was so rare as to be not worth the effort .
If it gets this far we simply choose randomly between teams tied for ranking in the top two positions .
Elimination Games and Free Kicks
After the first round , things get much simpler and FIFA employs a standard elimination tournament where after each game the losing team is eliminated from the tournament .
The only slightly tricky issue is how to force a winner when the simulated scores show a tie initially .
In the actual game , a series of free kicks will determine a unique winner .
In an ideal world one might try to use separate probability distributions to model free kick performance of the different teams , but our strong intuition is that such modeling is overkill .
Instead , we simply simulate the breaking of predicted ties by running additional simulated games between the teams .
This amounts to assuming that the likelihood of a team winning in free kicks against their opponent is matched by their likelihood of winning against their opponent in normal scoring .
Going One Step Further -- Identifying the " Sweet " Bet
When deciding what to bet on , you do n't care as much about actual chance of winning as you do about your expected profits in the long run :
Expected Profit = ( ( ProbabilityOfWin*BetLineOdds ) - ( ProbabilityOfLoss ) ) x bet
‘ Solve This ’ # 1 – How to Get into the Flow of Better Work
post # 239 — November 14 , 2006 — a Careers post
In a previous blog post discussion on avoiding negativity , it was suggested we start a series of posts called â€ œSolve Thisâ€  where we invite everyone reading this to pitch in and offer real - world , practical advice to solve a particular situation .
Hereâ€™s one to get us started .
In the â€œAre You Having Fun Yetâ€ chapter of my book TRUE PROFESSIONALISM I reported on a survey I have done for more than twenty years around the world .
I ask people what percent of their work they would put in the â€œI love thisâ€ category versus â€ œItâ€™s OK Itâ€™s what I do for a living .
It doesnâ€™t excite me.â€ 
Thereâ€™s also a third category called â€ œI hate this part of my work life.â€ 
I also ask people what percent of their clients they would put in the category â€ œI REALLY like these people I serve and find their sector fascinatingâ€ ( as opposed to : “ Itâ€™s OK , I can tolerate them.â€  )
The third category here is â€ œBy my taste , theyâ€™re idiots in boring businesses.â€ 
The â€œtypicalâ€ answers I am given ( by people at all levels ) are about 20 - 30 % for â€ œI love thisâ€ work , 60 % for â€œcan tolerate itâ€ and 10 - 20 % for â€œitâ€™s junk .â€ 
On the client questions , typical numbers are 10 - 60 - 30 .
( Iâ€™m not making this up .
By and large , people donâ€™t REALLY like those they serve , bosses or clients . )
My message has always been that these are depressingly low numbers – I do n’t want to spend the majority of my life doing tolerable stuff for tolerable people just because they pay me .
I ’m going to work to change that !
One young person wrote in to ask : â€ œPeople will wonder what your message is if they really cannot find favorable numbers where they currently work , or at least on the tasks they are currently assigned to .
Can someone in a junior position influence the flow of tasks that he / she is assigned so as to increase the proportion that is stimulating ?
What can a junior person do ?â€ 
Some obvious first thoughts :
Build RELATIONSHIPS
WITH POWER PLAYERS who can get you in the flow of work you would prefer to what you are doing now ?
( Go be helpful to someone . )
VOLUNTEER for challenging activities so you can say â€ œNo , sorry , Iâ€™m too busy , when the bad assignments come along ?â€ 
PROPOSE and INITIATE suggestions for innovative projects that will get you assigned to things you would like to do ?
TALK to those who are currently doing the work you aiming for in order to find out if it truly is as satisfying as you think it is ?
Talk with OTHER STAFF MEMBERS in your firm , to find out which senior people you can learn from and which ones will just exploit you and dump you ?
Go get friendly with CLIENT PERSONNEL .
Any client intelligence you can pick up and bring back will mark you out as a go - getter , and it mike lead to more work for your organization .
Alright , everybody , weâ€™ve all been juniors in an organization at one time or another , so letâ€™s help .
How do you get more of the interesting work and avoid getting stuck on the dull stuff ?
Whatâ€™s YOUR top 3 , 4 , or 5 suggestions to an individual at the lower levels of an organization that would help him / her bring about a better future for him / herself ?
Different subtypes of HIV are seen around the world
US researchers studied people in Uganda , and found HIV was more likely to progress rapidly in people with subtype D than in those with subtype A .
Most people in the UK and other western countries have type B .
Experts said the Johns Hopkins University study highlighted the need for people to come forward as soon as possible for HIV treatment .
The research was presented to the 2006 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections .
Traditional HIV tests monitor the progression of HIV by keeping track of viral load .
If there are fewer than 50 viral particles per cubic millilitre of blood , the disease is considered to be suppressed - while a viral load of more than 75,000 particles per cubic millilitre of blood means the disease will progress more rapidly .
Virulence
Researchers are following a group of 12,000 people in Uganda to see how HIV spreads throughout the country .
In this part of the research , more than 300 newly infected men and women were examined between 1995 and 2001 .
Through annual blood tests , which were part of the study , the researcher knew when each person became infected .
Once the diagnosis was confirmed , researchers used DNA tests to determine the HIV subtype , A and D being the most common in Uganda .
Fifty - three people were found to have become infected with subtype A , and 203 infected with subtype D .
Another 70 were infected with a recombinant version , a combination of both subtypes .
Even though the quantity of virus infecting these individuals was roughly the same for each subtype , average years of survival for each subtype differed widely : 8.8 years for A , 6.9 years for D and 5.8 years for AD .
Ten percent of those infected with subtype D died within three years , while none with subtype A died .
Viral load ranged from 20,000 particles per cubic millilitre of blood to 100,000 particles per cubic millilitre of blood in those with both subtypes , and was not found to be an accurate predictor of rapid death within the same timeframe .
The researchers suggest that subtype D is more virulent than subtype A because D has the ability to bind to key receptors on immune cells , allowing it to kill more quickly .
Additional blood analysis showed that subtype A bound only to one kind of receptor , CCR5 , to infect the cell .
But 25 % of the subtype D virus bound to both CCR5 and another receptor , CXCR4 .
And two - thirds of those infected with a CXCR4 - binding virus died within three years .
Early diagnosis ' key '
Oliver Laeyendecker , who led the research , said : " Knowing a person 's HIV subtype is important for the management of the infection because the disease can progress more rapidly in those infected with subtype D and recombinant virus incorporating subtype D than in those with other subtypes . "
Michael Carter , of Aidsmap , told the BBC News website : " This research is from a very important cohort study . "
He added : " Subtype tests could be useful if they are cheaper than viral load tests .
" And , in the UK , there is an issue that people who get their diagnosis latest are people who are recent migrants from Africa .
" This study is more evidence of the importance to be diagnosed as early as possible , so that people can begin treatment . "
I recently imported some source code for a customer that exceeded the maximum path limit of 256 characters .
The paths in question were n't particularly meaningful , just pathologically * long , with redundant subfolders .
To complete the migration , I renamed some of the parent folders to single character values .
This made me wonder : is 256 characters a reasonable limit for a path ?
And what 's the longest path in my filesystem , anyway ?
I whipped up this little C# console app to loop through all the paths on my drive and report the longest one .
static string _ MaxPath = " " ; static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RecursePath ( @ " c :\ " ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( " Maximum path length is " + _ MaxPath .Length ) ; Console.WriteLine( _MaxPath ) ; Console.ReadLine( ) ; } static void RecursePath ( string p ) { foreach ( string d in Directory .
GetDirectories ( p ) ) { if ( IsValidPath ( d ) ) { foreach ( string f in Directory .
GetFiles(d ) ) { if ( f. Length > _ MaxPath .
Length ) { _ MaxPath = f ; } } RecursePath(d ) ; } } } static bool IsValidPath ( string p ) { if ( ( File.GetAttributes ( p ) & FileAttributes.ReparsePoint ) == FileAttributes.ReparsePoint ) { Console. WriteLine ( " ' " + p + " ' is a reparse point .
Skipped " ) ; return false ; } if (! IsReadable ( p ) ) { Console. WriteLine ( " ' " + p + " ' * ACCESS DENIED *. Skipped " ) ; return false ; } return true ; } static bool IsReadable ( string p ) { try { string [ ] s = Directory .
GetDirectories ( p ) ; } catch ( UnauthorizedAccessException ex ) { return false ; } return true ; }
It works , but it 's a bit more complicated than I wanted it to be , because
There are a few folders we do n't have permission to access .
Vista makes heavy use of reparse points to remap old XP folder locations as symbolic links .
The longest path on a clean install of Windows XP is 152 characters .
c: \Documents and Settings \All Users \Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSAS-1-5-18d42cc0c3858a58db2db37658219e6400_89e7e133-abee-4041-a1a7-406d7effde91
This is followed closely by a bunch of stuff in c: \WINDOWS \assembly \GAC_MSIL , which is a side - effect of .NET 2.0 being installed .
The longest path on a semi-clean install of Windows 8.1 is 273 characters :
c:\Users\wumpus-home\AppData\Local\Packages\WinStore_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\Microsoft\Windows Store \Cache\0\0 -Namespace-https???services.apps.microsoft.com?browse?6.2.9200-1?615?en-US?c?US?Namespace?pc?00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000?00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 .
The longest path Microsoft created in Windows 8.1 is 273 characters .
But what 's the longest path I can create in Windows Explorer ?
The best I could do is 239 characters for folders , and 11 characters for the filename .
Add in 3 characters for the inevitable " c : " , plus 6 slashes .
That 's a grand total of 259 characters .
Anything longer and I got a " destination path too long " error .
The 259 character path limit I ran into jibes with the documented MAX_PATH limitation of the Windows shell :
The maximum length path ( in characters ) that can be used by the [ Windows ] shell is MAX_PATH ( defined as 260 ) .
Therefore , you should create buffers that you will pass to SHFILEOPSTRUCT to be of length MAX_PATH + 1 to account for these NULLs .
If 259 characters plus a null seems like an unusually restrictive path limit for a modern filesystem like NTFS , you 're right .
The NTFS filesystem supports paths of 32,000 characters , but it 's largely irrelevant because the majority of Windows APIs you 'd use to get to those paths only accept paths of MAX_PATH or smaller .
There is a wonky Unicode workaround to the MAX_PATH limitation , according to MSDN :
In the Windows API ( with some exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs ) , the maximum length for a path is MAX_PATH , which is defined as 260 characters .
A local path is structured in the following order : drive letter , colon , backslash , name components separated by backslashes , and a terminating null character .
For example , the maximum path on drive D is " D:\some 256 - character path string < NUL > " where " < NUL > " represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system codepage .
( The characters < > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a valid path string . )
The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended - length path for a maximum total path length of 32,767 characters .
This type of path is composed of components separated by backslashes , each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function ( this value is commonly 255 characters ) .
To specify an extended - length path , use the " \? " prefix .
For example , " \? \D:\very long path " .
The " \ ? " prefix can also be used with paths constructed according to the universal naming convention ( UNC ) .
To specify such a path using UNC , use the " \? \UNC " prefix .
For example , " \? \UNC\server \share " , where " server " is the name of the computer and " share " is the name of the shared folder .
These prefixes are not used as part of the path itself .
They indicate that the path should be passed to the system with minimal modification , which means that you cannot use forward slashes to represent path separators , or a period to represent the current directory , or double dots to represent the parent directory .
Because you cannot use the " \? " prefix with a relative path , relative paths are always limited to a total of MAX_PATH characters .
The shell and the file system may have different requirements .
It is possible to create a path with the API that the shell UI cannot handle .
Still , I wonder if the world really needs 32,000 character paths .
Is a 260 character path really that much of a limitation ?
Do we need hierarchies that deep ?
Martin Hardee has an amusing anecdote on this topic :
We were very proud of our user interface and the fact that we had a way to browse 16,000 ( !!) pages of documentation on a CD - ROM .
But browsing the hierarchy felt a little complicated to us .
So we asked Tufte to come in and have a look , and were hoping perhaps for a pat on the head or some free advice .
He played with our AnswerBook for about 90 seconds , turned around , and pronounced his review : " Dr Spock 's Baby Care is a best - selling owner 's manual for the most complicated ' product ' imaginable – and it only has two levels of headings .
You people have 8 levels of hierarchy and I have n't even stopped counting yet .
No wonder you think it 's complicated . "
I think 260 characters of path is more than enough rope to hang ourselves with .
If you 're running into path length limitations , the real problem is n't the operating system , or even the computers .
The problem is the deep , dark pit of hierarchies the human beings have dug themselves into .

An extraordinary appeal to Americans from the Bush administration for money to help pay for the reconstruction of Iraq has raised only $ 600 ( £ 337 ) , The Observer has learnt .
Yet since the appeal was launched earlier this month , donations to rebuild New Orleans have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars .
The public 's reluctance to contribute much more than the cost of two iPods to the administration 's attempt to offer citizens ' a further stake in building a free and prosperous Iraq ' has been seized on by critics as evidence of growing ambivalence over that country .
This coincides with concern over the increasing cost of the war .
More than $ 30 billion has been appropriated for the reconstruction .
Initially , America 's overseas aid agency , USaid , expected it to cost taxpayers no more than $ 1.7bn , but it is now asking the public if they want to contribute even more .
It is understood to be the first time that a US government has made an appeal to taxpayers for foreign aid money .
Contributors have no way of knowing who will receive their donations or even where they may go , after officials said details had be kept secret for security reasons .
USaid 's Heather Layman denied it was disappointed with the meagre sum raised after a fortnight .
' Every little helps , ' she said .
In the past 12 months , Americans raised some $ 250bn for charity , including other foreign causes such as the Asian tsunami victims .
Layman said : ' There is no financial goal .
People are looking for a way to help rebuild Iraq and this is a way to facilitate that .'
The fundraising comes amid concern that some US projects in Iraq will be scrapped or only partly completed because of rising costs .
Some officials fear that money may run out before key projects are completed .
Last week , the number of US troops killed in Iraq rose above 1,900 .
Composable continuations are a means of inverting control by reification of continuation segments .
This sounds like a horrible mouthful of jargon to express a disgustingly complex concept , but it 's actually not .
This is why .
We shall begin by introducing two new special forms , reset and shift .[ 1 ] ( reset expression ) sets up a special continuation , or mark on the stack , and evaluates expression .
This means simply that , as expression is evaluated , there is some information during its evaluation which we can refer back to later .
Shift , in fact , refers back to this information .
( shift variable expression ) jumps back to where that mark was , i.e. where you used reset , and saves the portion of the program between that and where you called shift ; it reifies that segment of the program , known as a `composable continuation ' , into a composable procedure , binds variable to that procedure , and evaluates expression .
` Composable ' means that the procedure will return , and so it can be composed with other procedures .
There are other names for `composable continuations ' as well , such as `delimited continuations ' and `partial continuations , ' but we shall consistently use the term `composable ' here .
This property of composability differs from the `escape procedures ' that call - with - current - continuation constructs .
While an escape procedure does not return -- rather , it has the effect of returning control to another point in the program -- , a composable continuation procedure does .
Calling a composable continuation procedure has the effect of returning control to the point where shift was called .
However , when control subsequently returns to where the thunk passed to reset was called , instead of returning then to where reset was called , it rather returns to where the composable continuation procedure was called !
Another way to explain it is by code transformation : [ 2 ]
( reset ( ... A... ( shift V E ) ... B... ) ) let lambda ( x ) (... A... x ... B... ) ) ( V E ) ( reset E ) E
A string of examples may help to elucidate .
In the first place , ( reset expression ) with no shift has the same effect as evaluating expression , ignoring tail recursion .
Let us add a shift , then , to the example .
If we do not call the composable continuation procedure created by shift , then shift has the effect of discarding everything between it and the dynamically enclosing reset .
+ 1 + 2 ( shift k 3 ) ) ( reset cons 1 cons 2 cons 3 ' ( ) ) ( shift k ( reset
Question :
What if the application of k is within the ( reset ... shift ) portion of the code ?
Now let us use the composable continuation .
It has the effect of ( lambda ( x ) (+ 2 x ) ) or ( lambda ( x ) ( cons 2 x ) ) ; we can see this by creating a procedure of one argument whose body mirrors that of the expression we passed to reset , but with the value of the argument , x , substituted for the call to shift .
This is what is meant by `inverting control ' : a portion of a program 's evaluation becomes reified into a function .
+ 1 + 2 + 3 ( k 4 ) ) ( shift k ( reset + 1 let lambda ( x ) + 2 x ) ( k + 3 ( k 4 ) ) + 1 + 3 + 2 4 ) cons 1 cons 2 cons 3 cons 4 ' ( ) ) ( k ( shift k ( reset cons 1 let lambda ( x ) cons 2 x ) ( k cons 3 cons 4 ' ( ) ) ( k cons 1 cons 3 cons 2 cons 4 ' ( ) )
We can , in fact , call composable continuation procedures multiple times ; they are simply functions that run through portions of a program , and we can run through those portions more than once .
+ 1 + 2 + 3 ( k 5 ) ( k 1 ) ) ( shift k ( reset + 1 let lambda ( x ) + 2 x ) ( k + 3 ( k 5 ) ( k 1 ) ) + 1 + 3 + 2 5 ) + 2 1 ) cons 1 cons 2 cons 3 cons 4 ' ( ) ) ( k ( k ( shift k ( reset cons 1 let lambda ( x ) cons 2 x ) ( k cons 3 cons 4 ' ( ) ) ( k ( k cons 1 cons 3 cons 2 cons 2 cons 4 ' ( ) )
These examples probably seem contrived and not very useful .
Indeed , they are contrived , but their purpose was to elucidate the explanation of shift and reset by way of simplicity .
We could have manually performed the code transformation , but the great power of shift and reset lies in the fact that they do not require global code transformation .
We can use shift and reset to cross boundaries of abstractions in order to invert dynamic control of program sections over which we have no lexical control ; that is , we can use this to turn dynamic program segments into functions without knowing anything about many parts of the programs .
Let us take a more sophisticated example now .
Suppose we have a procedure like for - each , and we want to create a procedure that accepts a collection , of the sort accepted by for - each or any procedure like it , and returns a lazy stream of the collection 's elements .
We can accomplish this using call - with - current - continuation thrice and set ! as well .
Those weak of stomach or heart should avert their eyes from this Scheme procedure .
Clearly , this is clumsy .
While there is a very nice slope of indentation as one follows code down into the depths of nesting , that is about the only notion of elegance that could possibly come to one 's mind when considering this code .
However , this pattern is actually very similar to what shift and reset abstract .
Return - cdr represents the continuation of the expression evaluated in a reset ; as we go through the collection , it is set to return - next - cdr to return to successive cdrs of the output stream .
Like shift , as we enter the point we want to save the program fragment to , we reify a continuation -- return - to - for - each -- and then abort out to the next reset point , i.e. return - cdr .
When we want to use the program fragment , as if invoking a composable continuation , we reify the continuation -- which is that of the stream 's next cdr -- into return - next - cdr , set return - cdr to that so that the program fragment can find where to return next , and then call return - to - for - each to re-enter the program fragment .
This can all be expressed much more easily using shift and reset :
Footnotes
[ 1 ]
We could have used procedures ( reset thunk ) and ( shift receiver ) instead of special forms , but we chose not to for the sake of simplicity and columns , and to keep in - line with the common use of these constructs .
Note also that there are control and prompt -- two other known control operators that will produce the same results with most of the examples on this page .
[ 2 ]
This transformation is not strictly correct .
In actuality , there are a few more reset s placed throughout the output .
The details of this fall outside the scope of this introductory text , however , and it is relevant only if we were to use nested shift and reset .
For the sake of completeness , though , here is the correct transformation , if you want it :
( reset ( ... A... ( shift K E ) ... B... ) ) let lambda ( x ) ( reset ( ... A... x ... B... ) ) ) ( K ( reset E ) ) ( reset E ) E
( The reset inside the lambda expression is the only difference between this and the control / prompt operators . )
Implementation
There is Riastradh 's implementation of shift and reset in terms of call - with - current - continuation , which is very heavy - weight and slow for the purpose , but which is portable .
Oleg 's version uses a trampoline to capture only the part of the continuation needed .
This has the advantage of not leaking memory , but the trampoline should be placed in an ' empty ' continuation and call / cc needs to be changed to work as expected .
PLT Scheme has shift / reset and numerous others in its scheme / control library , with links to the corresponding papers .
Gasbichler and Sperber 's paper " Final Shift for Call / cc : Direct Implementation of Shift and Reset " goes into detail on the various implementation techniques .

Being a RISC OS user is an odd experience .
It ’s normally baffling to non-believers why so many ( mostly British ) computer users persist with the eccentric beast .
It ’s easy to list reasons why no self - respecting geek would trouble with it : many old or under - developed applications , poor streaming media support , lack of compatibility with key standards and technologies , limited hardware support , and there are many more .
For most , RISC OS is a thing of the past , a curio , a once - promising minority OS trampled on by the juggernauts of Windows , MacOS and Linux .
For some of us , however , it has retained its charm .
Long - time users stick with it through thick and thin , defying the passage of time and upstart concepts like multi- threading or transparent gadgets .
Against all the odds , you can still buy copies from the publicity - averse RISC OS Ltd , although in true British style they ’ve made their website as unfriendly and counter - intuitive as possible ( do n’t bother looking for recent version information or , heavens above , a secure ordering page ) .
You can also get a slightly different flavour of RISC OS if you buy an Iyonix ARM - powered computer from Castle Technology .
In a stroke of marketing genius , this version is developed independently and is unavailable for any other machine .
Although the two types of RISC OS remain broadly compatible , both companies have decided that devoting time to public spats and legal arguments is preferable to actually developing the product .
Which is a pity , because the basic OS is still a joy to use , and in some areas remains remarkably productive .
First off , there is the interface .
Designed in an era before taskbars and context - sensitive menus appeared anywhere else , the RISC OS iconbar and pop -up menu system remains a pleasingly elegant way of launching applications and using them .
The iconbar , in its day , was a fantastic innovation ( see screenshot 1 ) .
Hardware such as drives and printers sits on the left , as God intended , and applications sit on the right .
There ’s no program menu ( unless you use a third - party application ) , and no trays cluttered with utilities and performance - sapping processes .
Applications do n’t have menu bars attached to windows , but instead use the second mouse button to pop -up choices anywhere over a task ’s windows or its program icon ( see screenshot 2 ) .
Nicely , this allows a clean division between options for the application as a whole or the file currently being edited .
Simplicity and clarity is another draw .
The OS was designed to work with very low - powered computers by today ’s standards , and as a result flies along very nicely for non-intensive tasks .
Deft use of a three - button mouse makes shifting windows around extremely quick and hassle - free .
You can still edit window contents when they ’re under other windows , which sounds like a minor thing but really makes life much more pleasant for everyone .
Comparative lack of bells and whistles , a problem for some , is a positive boon for RISC OS fans .
We do n’t get asked to update our software every five minutes , or have virus checkers pop -up without being asked - to , or have talking paperclips emerge from the shadows when writing a letter .
All of this is good .
Really good .
On top of this , RISC OS still has some great applications which , for ease of use at least , often leave their bloated competitors on other machines far behind .
Take ArtWorks , a lovely vector drawing programme maintained by the sainted Martin Wuerthner of MW Software .
Speedy and clean in design , it nonetheless boasts a very respectable feature set and is being constantly updated .
EasiWriter , a word processor , Ovation Pro , a DTP application , and Messenger , an email client , are similarly distinguished indigenous programs .
In addition to home - grown stuff , a heroic band of developers led by Peter Naulls has made porting applications from Linux - like environments a great deal easier : although incomplete , the ubiquitous Firefox just about works on RISC OS , and will hopefully be integrated further in the months ahead .
The Unix Porting Project lists dozens of applications on their website , most of which are recent additions to RISC OS .
It ’s not all rosy , however .
Web browsing , even with Firefox , can be a daunting challenge , and there ’s little support for modern video standards or nice things like Flash .
The hardware is a bit creaky as well : the fastest ARM - based machine is the Iyonix , clocked at a not - very - eye - watering 600M Hz .
Its diminutive rival , the distressingly badly - named A9home from Advantage6 , weighs in at an even more modest 400MHz .
RISC OS ’s generally lightweight nature compensates for some of this , but activities like 3D modelling or heavyweight compilation are n’t much fun .
Emulation , using commercial products like VirtualAcorn , provides access to faster PC hardware , but brings with it some of the disadvantages of sitting on top of Windows ( see screenshot 3 ) .
Despite this , many developers have chosen this as a way of keeping hold of their beloved RISC OS while having access to the power and compatibility of Windows .
Emulator solutions for MacOS and Linux may eventually emerge in due course .
So , all this being the case , why do I use RISC OS ?
Well , apart from a slight perverse enjoyment of using something different , lots of stuff really is easier and nicer than on other platforms .
I briefly dumped the environment after its creator , Acorn Computer , folded in the late 90s .
But I came back eventually , and will stick with it for as long as the party lasts .
As for how long that is , who knows ?
RISC OS really ought not to be around any more .
It ’s appallingly marketed , has a tiny pool of developers , and those that are left are fighting amongst themselves .
But I still like it .
It makes me smile .
And when was the last time Windows did that for you ?

No matter what the cultural norm , children who are physically disciplined with spanking and other such approaches are more likely to be anxious and aggressive than children who are disciplined in other ways .
This finding , published in the November / December journal Child Development , comes from surveys of parents and children in six different countries .
The study grew out of existing controversies over whether parents should spank their children or use other forms of physical discipline .
While some experts argue that physical discipline should never be used because of evidence that it is related to more , rather than fewer , child behavior problems and might escalate into physical abuse , others argue that the effects of physical discipline might depend on characteristics of children and families and the circumstances in which physical discipline is used .
To find out if the latter theory was valid , researchers from Duke University in North Carolina , Chinese University of Hong Kong , Göteborg University in Sweden , the University of Naples , the University of Rome and the Istituto Universitario di Scienze Motorie in Italy , Chiang Mai University in Thailand , the University of Delhi in India , the University of Oregon and California State University - Long Beach questioned 336 mothers and their children in China , India , Italy , Kenya , the Philippines , and Thailand about cultural norms surrounding the use of physical discipline and how it affects children 's aggression and anxiety .
They first asked mothers how often they physically disciplined their children , and then asked mothers and children how often they thought other parents in their country physically disciplined their children .
Finally , they asked mothers and children how often the child worries , is fearful , gets in fights , bullies others and other questions to measure children 's aggression and anxiety .
The researchers found differences in how often mothers used physical discipline and the mothers ' perceptions of how often other parents used physical discipline .
Specifically :
Mothers in Thailand were least likely to physically discipline their children , followed by mothers in China , the Philippines , Italy , India , and Kenya , with mothers in Kenya most likely to physically discipline their children .
More frequent use of physical discipline was less strongly associated with child aggression and anxiety when it was perceived as being more culturally accepted , but physical discipline was also associated with more aggression and anxiety regardless of the perception of cultural acceptance .
In countries in which physical discipline was more common and culturally accepted , children who were physically disciplined were less aggressive and less anxious than children who were physically disciplined in countries where physical discipline was rarely used .
In all countries , however , higher use of physical discipline was associated with more child aggression and anxiety .
" One implication of our findings is the need for caution in making recommendations about parenting practices across different cultural groups , " said lead researcher Jennifer Lansford , Ph.D. , a research scientist at the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University .
" A particular parenting practice may become a problem only if parents use it in a cultural context that does not support the practice ( for example , if they migrate from one country to another ) . "
However , she notes , some practices that were condoned historically ( e.g. , child labor ) are now condemned , at least in certain countries .
" A larger question is whether a parenting practice is acceptable , regardless of whether it occurs commonly within a cultural group . "

You will hear everyone out on this coast say it – the Valley is small .
I could n’t agree more .
While I believe there are still some actual geographic constraints on what is and is n’t the Valley , blogs have actually broadened the scope of the Valley to include folks outside of the Bay Area who are still deeply integrated in the tech scene , though not physically present .
For me , the Valley sometimes just feels like an ethereal collective of people who are building and dealing in technology more than any one physical place .
Whatever the case , in the last four weeks , I have seen a few entrepreneurs underestimate how small this Valley really is .
It started a month ago with an email from a VC friend of mine .
He forwarded me a message from an entrepreneur who noted , in no uncertain terms , that Google was a big fan of his WiFi access node technology .
This VC was , appropriately , doing a reference check before investing and wanted to know why it was we really liked this equipment .
As co-lead of the Google WiFi effort it seemed funny to me that I had n’t heard the name of this vendor before and was pretty sure we had n’t met with them .
I asked the VC to double - check with the entrepreneur about the veracity of the statement .
The entrepreneur had the audacity to write back to the VC that he had met with Google a number of times .
I checked with my team .
Had anyone heard of this company ?
Sure enough , one team member says “ Yeah , I bumped into them at a trade show .
They have been begging for a meeting . ”
“ But , did we endorse their tech ? ” I asked .
“ Nah .
I do n’t know anything about them , ” says my colleague .
That was it .
That was their basis for claiming our deep and passionate support for their product in a VC pitch - bumping into a member of our team and asking for a meeting .
Needless to say , the VC thanked me for the heads up and presumably walked away from the funding opportunity .
At the same time , this company , whose technology may have been wonderful for all I know , assured themselves of never doing business with me .
This , unfortunately , was n’t an isolated incident .
I recently watched more than one startup submit our name as their partner for a recent RFP .
When asked what they intended to achieve by this , they boldly and baselessly defended the action , and yet quickly scrambled to redact all uses of our name .
On top of this , I get executives at Google telling me that they receive calls from entrepreneurs alleging that I vouch for them and using my name to get on the exec ’s radar .
Yikes .
( First of all , if you know me , you know I think phones are wasteful and would never recommend a call . )
One colleague at Google told me a company founder mentioned we were having ‘ very fruitful discussions . ’
When I checked my Gmail , the only communication we ever had between us was my polite “ no thank you ” email response to his unsolicited query .
Fruitful ?!
Happens again and again .
I am not sure I get what all these guys are thinking .
Do they think that we are not going to find out ?
Do they assume that because Google is now 5,000 employees we all sit in offices with doors closed and do n’t chat ?
Do they believe that VCs do n’t diligence their investments anymore ?
Heck , many VCs are excited to have a reason to get back in touch with an old friend and will email me right away .
In any event , the minimal upside a founder will enjoy if they pull off such a fabricated endorsement without it making back to us can’t possibly be worth the very real downside of being discovered as untruthful .
To be fair , I have been on the entrepreneurial side of the coin many times .
I know the temptation , and sometimes , the benefit of being aggressive .
I once asked a mentor of mine at Fenwick how you go about raising a $ 100 million venture fund ( it was a long time ago ) and he told me that his mentor said “ by selling the last $ 5 million spot twenty times . ”
I am all for posturing .
You want to use the royal ‘ we ’ ?
Go ahead .
You want to try to convince me that you have another offer on the table or a partner who is moving faster ?
I am ready to play cards and sniff out a bluff .
However , one currency that should always be handled with kid gloves is the endorsement of another resident of the Valley .
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has used the phrase “ stay the course ” several times in discussing the war in Iraq in recent years , echoing a key phrase of the White House , contrary to an article published today in The Times .
The article used a database to analyze hundreds of Mr. Lieberman ’s war - related comments since 2001 .
It pointed out that Ned Lamont , the Democratic nominee for United States Senate , frequently criticized Mr. Lieberman for being a strong supporter of the Bush Administration ’s “ stay the course ” policy on Iraq , and said that in the statements reviewed the senator never actually uttered that phrase .
In fact , Mr. Lieberman has used the phrase at least half a dozen times over the last two years , during a presidential debate and in several television interviews — including several instances that were covered in The Times database .
As recently as November 2005 , upon returning from a trip to Iraq , for instance , he said on CNN ’s American Morning that he agreed with the administration ’s view that it was necessary to “ stay the course . ”
“ I agree to the extent that we have to stay the course of the policy we chose in overthrowing Saddam and helping the Iraqi people become free , which will really make us a lot more secure and set the terrorists back , ” Mr. Lieberman said , adding that some of the war tactics should change .
The original article noted that the database , which included more than 300 Iraq - related comments since the Sept 11 terrorist attacks , could not be comprehensive .
But five of Mr. Lieberman ’s “ stay the course ” references were , in fact , included in the database , and should have been mentioned in the article .
It is unclear why the phrase did not come up when the database was checked before publication .
The same search on Tuesday , after readers complained , yielded the correct results .
Mr. Lieberman used the phrase several times in 2004 , saying during a presidential primary debate in Iowa that January : “ We have to stay the course in Iraq now and continue to build a stable , modernizing , democratizing country there . ”
After losing his party ’s presidential primary , in April 2004 Mr. Lieberman said in a televised press conference that he blamed his loss on his support for the war in Iraq and praised the Bush administration ’s policy .
“ I thought the president gave the strongest case that I can remember him giving about why we went in and why we have to stay the course , ” he said then .
“ We ’ve got to adopt a strategy of success .
A defeat will create chaos in Iraq , chaos in the Middle East , and will embolden the terrorists in a way that will endanger our future and our children ’s future . ”
Mr. Lieberman also made his support for the president clear during an interview on CNN ’s Larry King Live a month later , saying “ the president ’s right . ”
“ It ’s been a lot harder to achieve it than we hoped it would be , ” he said of America ’s mission in Iraq .
“ But we ’ve got to stay the course and finish the job . ”
In July , Mr. Lieberman used the phrase again on Fox News ’ “ Hannity & Colmes , ” saying of the president : “ What I ’m most happy about is that he said that he will stay the course in Iraq until we finish the job and the Iraqis are in control of their own destiny . ”

The funny thing is , now that I ’m in a symbiotic relationship with the bullshit industry , I ’d be stuffed if they all went straight .
Although in 2006 there was no sign of it happening just yet .
It was a particularly good year for anyone wanting to make money shovelling dodgy science into the innocent minds of young schoolchildren .
The ludicrously pseudoscientific “ Brain Gym ” programme is still being peddled in hundreds if not thousands of state schools ( although from the ever joyful Bad Science postbag it sounds like Brain Gym “ tutors ” are at least getting some good - quality heckling from science teachers these days ) .
The Dore programme ’s expensive “ cure ” for dyslexia and the dismal trial published on it in the journal Dyslexia eventually prompted five resignations from that journal ’s editorial board ( did I mention that the trial author received money from Dore ? ) , and the epic story of the Durham fish oil “ trials ” has reached as far as the comic Viz , which certainly made my Christmas .
Children of the nation , ignore your teachers and parents : it is not necessary to take pills every day to lead a healthy life .
There will be something very special on the Durham fish oil “ trials ” in 2007 , believe me .
Meanwhile , we caught Sky ’s flagship science show , Brainiac , red - handed faking experiments , which was only funny because they make such a melodramatic fuss about how incredibly daring they are for doing lots of dangerous “ experiments ” “ for real ” .
It was testament to the geeky readership of Bad Science that within a week of the story I ’d been sent videos of some guy in America casually doing , for real , in his own back garden , the very stuff that Brainiac had been unable to do .
Even better was an instruction video for schoolteachers showing how to do an experiment in class that Brainiac crowed was too dangerous to do in class ( and then faked anyway ) .
And what a great year for scares .
The Times reported on its front page that cocaine use among schoolchildren had doubled when it had done nothing of the sort ( they simply misinterpreted the report ) .
The media ’s anti-MMR campaign continued unabated as the Telegraph , Mail and Times all reported on unpublished research claiming to show a link between the vaccine and autism , even though the research was from a man with a history of making such claims as far back as 2002 , which he still has n’t published .
Over the year , at least two fully published studies showing a negative result for almost the exact same experiment were inexplicably ignored by all newspapers .
Similarly , large - scale published studies showing no link between mercury fillings and health problems were ignored – yesterday ’s scare perhaps – because fatigue , dizziness , headaches , aching joints and more are now being blamed on wi-fi , mobile phones and “ electromagnetic hypersensitivity ” instead ( despite 31 published studies showing no relationship ) .
There was even a Tamiflu vaccine scare ( although Tamiflu ’s not a vaccine ) .
In the meantime every newspaper was filled with meaningless corporate - sponsored “ science ” stories like Bravo TV ’s London School of Economics “ Evolution Report ” ( “ all men will have big willies ” as the Sun said ) , because PR agencies know news editors are powerless to resist a silly science story and the story will always run with the sponsoring company ’s name attached .
Ker-ching .
It ’s also been a great year for complementary medicine .
Magical magnetic bandages are available through the NHS Prescription Pricing Authority , although they do n’t work better than a placebo , and the MHRA , the healthcare regulator , has allowed herbal remedy and homeopathy companies to make health claims on their packaging without evidence for efficacy .
I ranted about this on New Year ’s Eve 2005 , but then eight months later in August the great and the good in science were queueing up with letters to everyone to say it was a disgrace that these measures had been dumped on parliament in a hurry and rushed through .
Perhaps some people assume the stuff in this column is so bad that I must just fabricate it .
Meanwhile , the nutritionism industry raked it in unabated , antioxidant pills still did n’t do anything for you , and the Daily Mail continued sifting through every last inanimate object in the world to divine whether it either causes , or cures , cancer .
There were bonkers smoking treatments , ludicrous cosmetics claims ( mostly involving “ oxygen ” ) , postmodernist drongos complaining that evidence - based medicine is fascism , and one postmodernist drongo who acted like he ’d done swanky experiments on brain chemistry for his big Agatha Christie programme on ITV when he very simply had n’t .
And somehow we managed to sneak rambling explanations of publication bias , the need for clinical trial registers , medicalisation , the viciously complicated “ prosecutor ’s fallacy ” in Sir Roy Meadow ’s “ one in 73 m ” courtroom statistic and a long and frankly very dreary disquisition on the counterintuitive maths behind positive predictive values in tests for rare events in relation to psychiatric violence on to the news pages of a national newspaper .
I should be paying you .
And that ’s all just for starters .
Next week , business as usual .

「 自分がいる場所」の便利地図を見やすく素早く作り出そう
- 「 自分がいる場所」の便利地図を見やすく素早く作り出そう -
最近の携帯電話はGPS測位機能が標準装備されているのが普通です。初めて行く場所で誰かと待ち合わせるときや、外出先で道に迷ったときなどは、携帯電話付属のソフトで地図を眺めて場所を確認したりすることがあります。それはそれで便利なのですが、携帯電話の小さな画面ではどうにも見づらくて、結局近くの本屋やコンビニに駆け込んで、地図を眺めたりします。ところが、それはそれで自分が今いる位置を見つけ出すのに苦労します。その時点で既に迷っていたりするわけで、地図を眺めてみても「ココはドコ？ワタシはダレ？」状態になってしまうのです。
そこで、今回は 「 街中に溢れているコンビニ( セブンイレブン)と自分が持っている携帯電話を使うことで、自分がいる場所がちゃんとわかる地図、しかも紙の大きく見やすい地図、さらに自分が探している場所などの便利な情報が入った地図を一瞬で作り出す」ということをしてみようと思います。
携帯電話ナビ機能は便利だけど…小さすぎる
私の携帯電話にはGPS測位機能とナビ機能がついています。右の写真は、携帯電話で自分がいる場所辺りの地図を眺めている例です。初めて行く場所で誰かと待ち合わせるときや、外出先で道に迷ったときなどは、こんな携帯電話地図を眺め場所を確認したりすることがあります。これはこれで便利なのですが、写真を見ればわかるように、こんな携帯電話の小さな画面ではどうにも見づらくて、結局近くの本屋やコンビニに駆け込んで、(大きな)地図を眺めたりするのです。やはり、携帯電話画面に映し出された小さな地図よりは、紙の大きな地図の方がずっとわかりやすいわけです。
ところが、紙の地図の場合、自分が今いる場所を見つけ出すのに苦労したりします。携帯電話なら、(GPS測位された)今現在の場所にアイコン表示がされていたりするわけですが、紙の地図ではそうはいきません。紙の地図はどこかの印刷所で印刷・製本されているわけで、私やあなたようにカスタマイズされた地図ではないのですから、それは当然の話です。その結果、地図は見やすいけれど、自分の場所がわからないという(現実にも地図上でも)
「ココはドコ？ワタシはダレ？」状態になってしまうのです。地図を探している時点で既に道に迷っているわけですから、そうなりやすいのも当然の話です。それに、自分の位置がわかったところで、地図本はそんなに安くありませんからなかなか買いづらかったりします。必要なページはたった1ページだけなのに、一冊の本を買うのもなぁ…と思い始めて、地図を頭の中に記憶して本屋をそのまま出てしまう、なんていうことをします。これでは、単なる立ち読み野郎です。…しかも、えてして、その記憶の中の地図は全然あてにならず、またすぐに迷ったりするのです。
自分専用の地図をコンビニ・プリントで作り出す
以上のジレンマを整理してみるとこうなります。
「 携帯電話なら自分の位置がわかるけれど、地図は小さく見にくい」
「 本屋やコンビニに置いてある地図は大きく見やすいけれど、自分の位置がわからない」
「地図本の中で、自分にとって必要なのはたった１ページしかないが、１ページ単位の地図はなかなか売っていない」
「 携帯電話 ・Googleローカル・ネットプリント」を組み合わす
最近はWEB2.0とやらが声高々に謳われる時代のようです。であるなら、「携帯電話」や「コンビニ」や「紙」といったモノの利点を組み合わせて、すなわちマッシュアップして、便利なものを作り出してみれば良いのではないでしょうか。つまり、携帯電話で位置を調べ、WEBサービスでその位置に特化した便利な地図を作り出し、その作り出した地図などのデータをネット経由でコンビニに転送し(データ転送を携帯電話のパケット通信でなく、セブンイレブンの店舗・サーバ間網を利用するのです)、コンビニに置いてある(カラー)プリンタで「自分用にカスタマイズ・パーソナライズされた(大きく見やすい)1枚の紙の地図としてプリントする」というわけです。色んなモノの利点を上手く組み合わせて使ってみるのです。そうすれば、「自分の今いる場所を中心にした、自分を探している場所や電話番号・住所が記入され、色んな場所アイコンもちゃんと描かれている見やすく大きくカラフルな地図」がモノクロなら30円くらい、A4カラー地図でも80円程度で手に入るのです。
実際にやることはとても簡単です。
「 携帯電話 」
「 Googleローカル 」
「( セブンイレブン・富士ゼロックスの ) ネットプリント 」
を組み合わせるスクリプトCGIを自分用に作るだけ、です。携帯電話で位置を調べ、探したい情報と位置情報をもとにGoogle ローカルからパーソナライズ・カスタマイズされた地図を作り出し、セブンイレブンと富士ゼロックスのネットプリントを使い地図データをネットプリントのサーバーに格納させて、そして、自分の目の前にあるコンビニにおもむろに入りプリンタを(15～20秒程度で携帯電話に送られてくるプリント番号を使って)操作すれば、自分専用の「1枚の地図」を出力することができるのです。
実際にそんなスクリプト(ダウンロード・説明などはさらに下にあります)などを作って、試してみたようすが下になります。まずは、携帯電話でフォームページにアクセスしボタンを押すと(1番左の画像)、測位が開始され(2番目の画像)、作業が完了した旨が表示されます(3枚目の画像は"
周辺マンガ喫茶地図を作成"
した例です)。そして、ネットプリントのサーバから「コンビニでプリントする際に必入力するプリント番号」がメールで送られてくる、というわけです。一番最初からここまで、必要な時間はせいぜい30秒といったところです。やることは、リンクを呼び出してボタンを一回押すだけ、です。
さて、ここまで来たら近くにあるセブンイレブンに入りましょう(もちろん、上の手順をコンビニの中で行ったって構いません)。最近であれば、都会の街中で周囲を眺めてみれば、セブンイレブンは必ず視界のどこかにあることが多いので、セブンイレブンを捜すのに苦労はしないはずです。そして、店舗中に設置された多機能プリンタの「ネットプリント」のボタンを押し、予約番号を入力し、そしてプリントボタンを押せば、下のような地図が出力されるのです。ただ、それだけ、です。その作業にかかる時間はせいぜい30秒～1分以内といったところでしょう。そんな風にお手軽に「自分の今いる場所を中心にした、自分を探している場所や電話番号・住所が記入され、色んな場所アイコンもちゃんと描かれている見やすく大きくカラフルな地図」がすぐ手にはいるのです。下の地図は、渋谷駅周辺でイタリア料理レストランを検索した結果の地図、です。大きな紙上に、自分にとって必要な情報・地図がとても見やすく出力されていることがわかると思います。
例えば、上に示した地図の場合は、A4カラーで出力したので1枚で80円ポッキリです。セブンイレブンで白黒プリントを選択すれば、(例えA3サイズでも)1枚30円ポッキリですし、A3カラーにしてもたったの120円なのです。手間も掛からず、値段も80円程度で最高にカスタマイズされた地図が手にはいる…なんて考えたら、携帯電話でパケット料金を気にしつつ小さな見にくい携帯画面を頼りに街をさまよう気にはもうなれません。
今回作成してみたのは携帯・Googleローカル・セブンイレブンを組み合わせた(マッシュアップした)地図出力ですが、今回のスクリプト（あるいは単に今回のアイデア）を色々改造してみれば、便利な活用法はたくさんありそうです。例えば、Googleローカルでなく、Googleを使って検索キーワードの高順位のものを組み合わせたページを出力する。あるいはニュース記事やRSSなどを組み合わせたページを作成し、コンビニで出力させて、「あなただけにパーソナライズされたニューズペーパー」を電車の中で読む、そんな面白い可能性が見えてくるはずです。素晴らしく楽しい、そしてあなたの生活を幸せにする「 WEB 2.0時代のコンビニ・プリント活用法」が浮かび上がってくるのではないでしょうか？今回の記事がそんなキッカケになったら良いな、と空想してみたりします。

Tony Blair was talking to soldiers he had sent to fight the toughest guerrillas on earth for control of southern Afghanistan .
He told them : " Your defeat [ of the Taliban ] is not just on behalf of the people of Afghanistan but the people of Britain ...
We have got to stay for as long as it takes . "
The prime minister 's brain has clearly lost touch with reality .
Even under the Raj there was no conceivable way Britain could conquer and hold the arc of territory to which Blair was referring .
It stretches from the Persian Gulf through Iranian Baluchistan and Afghanistan to Pakistan .
No central government has come near to controlling this region , and its aversion to outside intervention is ageless and ruthless , currently fuelled by the world 's voracious appetite for oil and opium .
But it poses no threat to world security .
The sole basis for Blair 's statement is Mullah Omar 's hospitality to the fanatic , Osama bin Laden , at the end of the 1990s .
As we now know , this was never popular ( an Arab among Pashtuns ) ; after 9/11 , when the Taliban had collaborated with the west over opium , either Bin Laden would eventually have had to leave or the Tajiks would have taken revenge for his killing of their leader , Sheikh Massoud .
Even the Pakistanis were on his tail .
Either way , Talib Afghanistan was no more a " threat " after 9/11 than were the American flying schools at which the 9/11 perpetrators trained .
So what is Blair getting at ?
He once confessed to his hero , Roy Jenkins , that he regretted not having studied history at Oxford .
He never spoke a truer word .
The concept of world security as holistic and vulnerable to incidents such as 9/11 is nonsensical .
Politics is not a variant of the Gaia thesis , in which each component of an ecosystem depends on and responds to every other .
There is no butterfly effect in international relations .
For want of a victory in Helmand , the Middle East is not lost , nor for want of victory in the Middle East is western civilisation lost .
This is as well , since Blair 's resumed war in Afghanistan is clearly not being won .
We know from the former army chief Lord Guthrie that Blair , despite promising to " give the army anything it takes " , has refused the extra troops and armour needed by the pathetically small expeditionary force of 7,000 in Helmand .
He has already had to switch tactics from winning hearts and minds to American - style " search and destroy " , blowing up villages with 1,000 lb bombs ( as we saw on TV last week ) .
British commanders are describing " successes " in terms of enemy kills .
They should recall that Victorian officers in the Punjab were told that such boasts would be treated as a sign of failure , not success .
Such killings infuriated the population and presaged revenge attacks .
Has the British army learned nothing ?
Blair has not been able to persuade his Nato allies in Europe of his apocalyptic world - view .
The use of the word terrorism to imply some grand military offensive against the west may sound good in White House national security documents and Downing Street speeches .
But terrorism is not an enemy or an ideology , let alone a country or an army .
It is a weapon , like a gun or a bomb .
It is not something that can be defeated , only guarded against .
Nor can terrorism ever win .
Blair 's flattering reference to it was in reality to al - Qaida and to the Islamist jihadism whose cause he has so incessantly advertised .
As the American strategist Louise Richardson points out in What Terrorists Want , al - Qaida has not the remotest chance of defeating the west or undermining its civilisation .
Only a deranged paranoid could think that .
Some group or other will always look for ways to commit random killings , against which national security services need to be vigilant .
But this is not war .
Richardson points out that these groups are being grotesquely overrated .
They cannot plausibly deploy weapons of true mass destruction , and remain stuck with the oldest terrorist tool of all , the man with a bomb ( and if we are really negligent , with a plane ) .
While terrorism can take on different guises , it is not new and is not a threat to human society to rank with a world war or a nuclear holocaust - as the home secretary , John Reid , has absurdly claimed .
Terrorist incidents are the outcome of someone 's mental pathology and are of no political significance - unless cynical leaders in a targeted community choose otherwise .
What is sad about Blair 's statement is not its strategic naivety but the psychology behind it .
Why have the leaders of Britain and America felt driven to adopt so wildly distorted a concept of menace ?
In an analysis of terrorism in the latest New York Review of Books , Max Rodenbeck offers plausible but depressing answers .
They include the short - term popularity that war offers democratic leaders , the yearning of defence chiefs and industries to prove the worth of expensive kit and , in Iraq 's case , " the influence of neoconservatives and of the pro-Israeli lobby , seeing a chance to set a superpower on Israel 's enemies " .
All this is true , but I sense a deeper disconnect .
The west is ruled by a generation of leaders with no experience of war or its threat .
Blair and his team cannot recall the aftermath of the second world war , and in the cold war they rushed to join CND .
They were distant from those real global horrors .
Yet now in power they seem to crave an enemy of equivalent monstrosity .
Modern government has a big hole in its ego , yearning to be filled by something called a " threat to security " .
After 1990 many hoped that an age of stable peace might dawn .
Rich nations might disarm and combine to help the poor , advancing the cause of global responsibility .
Instead two of history 's most internationalist states , America and Britain , have returned to the trough of conflict , chasing a chimera of " world terrorism " , and at ludicrous expense .
They have brought death and destruction to a part of the globe that posed no strategic threat .
Now one of them , Tony Blair , stands in a patch of desert to claim that " world security in the 21st century " depends on which warlord controls it .
Was anything so demented ?

Teetering along on their stick - thin legs , they look like they have n't had a square meal in years .
But today 's breed of size - zero supermodels might be advised to develop a taste for pie and chips as pressure grows to ban too - skinny girls from the catwalk .
Gallery : See more fashion pictures ...
• Super - skinny models fuel zero size trend
• Olympus Fashion Week
• Italian Vogue " terror " fashion shoot
A few days ago in Madrid , it was announced that only healthy - looking mannequins would be permitted to strut their stuff at the city 's annual style event .
Anyone with a body mass index of less than 18 was banned .
Now organisers of London Fashion Week , which begins on Monday , are being urged to impose similar rules .
That would leave in - demand models such as Lily Cole , Erin O'Connor , Alek Wek and Eva Herzigova kicking their heels .
But health agencies are adamant that legal steps must be taken to protect the health of the catwalk queens .
Steve Bloomfield , a spokesman for the Eating Disorders Association , said : " We do think legislation is needed .
" This is about protecting the young women and men who work in the fashion industry , as well as those who are at risk of an eating disorder and can be influenced by the pictures that they see .
" The fashion industry is there to make money and there is no legislation to protect models .
It basically exploits people who are underweight and forces others to follow suit . "
The Madrid initiative followed the death of 22 - year - old Luisel Ramos during a fashion show in Uruguay last month .
The emaciated model died of a heart attack moments after stepping off the catwalk - a result of having eaten nothing but green leaves , washed down with Diet Coke , for three months .
To put the Madrid limits into context , a BMI of 18.5 or below is classed as underweight by the World Health Organisation .
A model who is 5ft 9in would have to weigh a minimum 8st 12lb to be classed as healthy .
At present , the average 5ft 9in catwalk model weighs a mere 7st 12lb - a BMI of only 16 .
' A lot to be said for beautiful curves '
And Spain 's best - known model Esther Canadas , with an estimated BMI of only 14 , failed to qualify for the show by a wide margin .
The world 's fashion capital , Milan , is proposing to impose similar rules with the city 's mayor , Letizia Moratti , confirming as much this week .
Sarah Watkinson , managing director of the outsize modelling agency 12 Plus UK , agrees that legislation is needed to protect the health of models - and those aspiring to emulate their favourite catwalk stars .
" I definitely encourage any formal move made to promote the use of curvy , healthy - looking women on the catwalks , " she said .
" One of the biggest problems is that some designers especially like to use incredibly thin girls to wear their clothes because they like the shock aspect .
These days more and more very skinny , size zero models are being used .
" It would be far better to have women of a realistic size and weight on the catwalk who look healthy and purport to a healthy body image .
It is vital for schoolgirls who might aspire to look like these models to have a range of size 10 , 12 and 14 women to look towards , instead of comparing themselves with women who look starved .
" There is a lot to be said for beautiful curves . "
The Storm agency , which discovered Kate Moss , begged to differ .
A spokesman dismissed the planned rules as " useless " while claiming that the company would not use " someone who was really underweight or too thin . "
A spokesman for designer Allegra Hicks said : " We would never dream of using models under a British size 10 .
" A ban on the size zero model should be compulsory across the fashion industry .
Size zero is not feminine and not healthy . "
Asda uses Coleen McLoughlin - a size 12 with a BMI of over 20 - as the face of its George clothing range .
A spokesman said : " The reason we use Coleen is that she is real .
Customers are aspirational but they want to be able to identify with our models .
Banning size zero models is the way forward . "
A spokesman for the fashion house Biba said : " It is beyond my comprehension that we would want to show girls on the catwalk who have the BMI of a ten - year - old .
" I agree with what they have done in Spain and think it should be emulated here .
We use a lot of young models but certainly not a size zero . "

Today , we will continue the little stroll around the Io language landscape that we started in Blame it on Io !
A slow - paced introduction to the Io language .
We will delve deeper into the central principle of prototype - based languages : cloning .
Cloning crash course
For the mad scientists and other evil dictators who landed here after googling “ manual of cloning ” , here is a crash course in object creation , à-la Io :
Movie := Object clone original := Movie clone original title := " Island of Lost Souls " original year := 1933 original scenario := " Mad scientist off - shores development of mutant race " remake := original clone remake title = " The Island of Dr Moreau " remake year = 1977 remakeOfRemake := remake clone remakeOfRemake year = 1996
Object creation in Io , like Polka , is a two step dance : 1 . you clone , 2 . you specialize .
Differential inheritance
As we have just seen , cloning an object is done by sending it the clone message .
This allows for a very elegant implementation of the Singleton pattern :
GeorgeClooney := FamousActor clone GeorgeClooney clone = GeorgeClooney
Bad news for my wife … but I digress .
To really understand cloning , it is necessary to look at how an object is implemented .
I will spare you the details of the struct definition ( see vm / IoObject_struct.h if you really want to know ) by remaining at a conceptual level .
Io objects are made of two ingredients : slots and prototypes .
Slots are stored in a hash table and represent both the data and the methods of the object .
Prototypes are stored in a list and are the ancestors of the object — more on why this is a list in the next section .
How does this all fit together ?
Well , when a message is sent to an object , its name is used to query the slots hash table of the object .
If no slot is found , the operation is repeated for each prototype in the prototypes list .
When a matching slot is found , it is activated .
If no slot is found , the forward slot is activated .
If no forward slot is found , then you get an error .
This will clarify :
JeanClaudeVanDamme := FamousActor clone JeanClaudeVanDamme act
will raise : Exception : Importer Object does not respond to ' act ' , whereas :
KeanuReeves := FamousActor clone KeanuReeves forward := method ( writeln ( " I know " , call message name ) ) KeanuReeves kungfu
will even pretend that Keanu Reeves can act .
Now , back to our first question , what happens when an object is cloned ?
Very little actually : a new object is created with an empty slots hash table and a prototypes list containing the target of the clone message .
By default , a clone delegates everything to its original .
Once it is created , a clone is usually specialized by adding slots in its slots hash table .
The clone only stores the difference with its original .
This is called differential inheritance .
Clones sharing memories with their original , not only makes bad hollywood movies ( The Island and Replicant ) , it is not always desirable :
Movie := Object clone Movie cast := List clone
would lead to all movies sharing the same cast !
You could fix the problem by initializing the cast slot to a freshly cloned list on every Movie clone , but this would be error - prone and very inelegant .
This is where the init slot comes into play .
It is activated , if it is present , just after the creation of the clone .
Let ’s rewrite the previous piece of code :
Movie := Object clone Movie init := method( self cast := List clone )
Note that self is required , otherwise the cast slot will be local to the method .
Future directions
This is the current state of affair in Io .
But things might change , Steve Dekorte , the mad scientist behind
Io , identifies 5 different cloning strategies with regards to slots :
nil : the slot is set to nil in the clone — init := method ( self foo = nil ) shared : the slot is not created in the clone — the current default behaviour shallow : the slot is created with the original ’s value — init := method ( self foo = foo ) deep : the slot is created with a clone of the original ’s value — init := method ( self foo = foo clone ) very deep : the slot is created with a deep clone of the original ’s value — init := method ( self foo = foo deepClone )
It is probable that support for each strategy will be added to Io at some point .
For now , you have to use the init slot to implement these strategies .
Dynamic inheritance with Protos
Let ’s come back to the prototypes list .
From what I have explained so far , it seems objects can have only one parent , the original .
A list looks superfluous .
Great news for my mad- scientists readers : the answer does not follow the laws of biology .
Io makes it possible to add and remove parents to an object , at runtime , using appendProto , prependProto , removeProto and other related methods .
These methods simply manipulate the list of prototypes associated with an Io object .
LukeSkywalker := Person clone LukeSkywalker appendProto( Orphan ) LukeSkywalker fightsWith ( DarthVader ) DarthVader tellsSecretTo( LukeSkywalker ) LukeSkywalker removeProto( Orphan ) LukeSkywalker appendProto( DarthVader )
And this concludes today ’s stroll !
I hope you found it informative and entertaining .
I would like to thank everyone on the #io channel for your patience in dealing with my questions .
Most , if not all , of the information contained in this post comes from chats on IRC and from the Io documentation .
I ’ll only claim the silly examples !

In 1977 , Lew Rockwell was the editor of Private Practice , a journal of medical economics .
That year , he put together three teams of speakers to present evening seminars for physicians in three dozen cities .
The teams made the case against tax - funded medicine .
On each team was a physician from Canada , one from England , and maybe one from Australia , each with horror stories to tell on the practice of medicine under tax - funded medical health care delivery .
There was also an American physician and one non-physician .
As I recall , there was also a Congressman .
I was on one of those teams .
We hit a dozen cities in fourteen days .
It was the toughest speaking assignment I have ever had .
The reaction was not spectacular .
The physicians in the audience did not seem to recognize the threat to their practices that bureaucratic medicine involved .
Most of those physicians are in retirement today .
Before most of them had retired , they saw American medicine move in the direction of bureaucratic medicine , just as we had warned .
Younger physicians today do not recall what it was like to practice medicine in the good old days .
But the good old days of 1977 were not all that good .
From the era preceding World War I , when the Rockefeller Foundation promoted the government - licensing system that restricted entry into the profession by controlling medical education , the march into the trap of tax - funded medicine began .
When I returned from my whirlwind tour , I decided that I would write an essay on the threat to American medicine posed by the State .
I wrote it .
It was published in The Freeman in May , 1978 .
I titled it , " Walking into a Trap . "
Walking into a Trap
There is some justification at least in the taunt that many of the pretending defenders of ' free enterprise ' are in fact defenders of privileges and advocates of government activity in their favor rather than opponents of all privilege .
In principle the industrial protectionism and government - supported cartels and the agricultural policies of the conservative groups are not different from the proposals for a more far - reaching direction of economic life sponsored by the socialists .
It is an illusion when the more conservative interventionists believe that they will be able to confine these government controls to the particular kinds of which they approve .
In a democratic society , at any rate , once the principle is admitted that the government undertakes responsibility for the status and position of particular groups , it is inevitable that this control will be extended to satisfy the aspirations and prejudices of the great masses .
There is no hope of a return to a freer system until the leaders of the movement against state control are prepared first to impose upon themselves that discipline of a competitive market which they ask the masses to accept . "
– F. A. Hayek
The idea that businessmen are strong defenders of the free enterprise system is one which is believed only by those who have never studied the history of private enterprise in the Western , industrial nations .
What businessmen are paid to worry about is profit .
The problem for the survival of a market economy arises when the voters permit or encourage the expansion of government power to such an extent that private businesses can gain short - term profits through the intervention into the competitive market by state officials .
Offer the typical businessman the opportunity to escape the constant pressures of market competition , and few of them are able to withstand the temptation .
In fact , they are rewarded for taking the step of calling in the civil government .
The government 's officials approve , but more to the point , from the point of view of the businessman 's understanding of his role , shareholders and new investors also approve , since the favored enterprise is initially blessed with increased earnings per share .
The business leader has his decision confirmed by the crucial standards of reference in the market , namely , rising profits and rising share prices on the stock market .
No one pays the entrepreneur to be ideologically pure .
Almost everyone pays him to turn a profit .
This being the case , those within the government possess an extremely potent device for expanding political power .
By a comprehensive program of direct political intervention into the market , government officials can steadily reduce the opposition of businessmen to the transformation of the market into a bureaucratic , regulated , and even centrally - directed organization .
Bureaucracy replaces entrepreneurship as the principal form of economic planning .
Bureaucrats can use the time - honored pair of motivational approaches : the carrot and the stick .
The carrot is by far the most effective device when dealing with profit - seeking businessmen .
Those individual enterprises that are expected to benefit from some new government program have every short - run financial incentive to promote the intervention , while those whose interests are likely to be affected adversely — rival firms , foreign enterprises , and especially consumers — find it expensive to organize their opposition , since the adverse effects are either not recognized as stemming from the particular government program , or else the potential opponents are scattered over too wide an area to be organized inexpensively .
The efforts of the potential short - run beneficiaries are concentrated and immediately profitable ; the efforts of the potential losers are dispersed and usually ineffective .
The expansion of political power in the market process has been going on in the West for about a century , at least in the modern form of interventionism , starting with the social security legislation of Bismarck 's Germany in the 1870s .
Governments have evolved a strategy by which whole industries or professions are captured by the bureaucratic state .
While this strategy is not the only one used , in peacetime it has proven enormously successful .
( Nothing , of course , favors political centralization more than war . )
I have outlined this strategy by means of the following analogy :
Baiting the trap Setting the trap Springing the trap Skinning the victim
1. Baiting the Trap
Extra -Market Benefits
The politicians enter an otherwise competitive market situation with an offer to promote certain industrial or professional programs .
Taxpayers ' money is used to finance this program , but it is rare for the potential short - run beneficiaries to reject the offer on these grounds .
Certainly , a majority of those who are to be the recipients of the special favor gladly accept it .
They see their goals as being part of the public interest , and they view an offer of government aid as being only natural .
They see it as their due .
Those who refuse to take the special favor risk lower profits in the immediate future , since competitors in the industry or professional association will take the favor .
The general attitude is this one : " If I do n't take it , somebody else will . "
As a statement of fact , rather than principle , it is absolutely correct .
Somebody else will .
There are several possible forms in which the aid may come .
Industrial groups may receive tariff protection , which is a tax levied on consumers on both sides of a border over which trade had been carried on or over which it might be carried on in the future .
Consumers pay higher prices on both sides of the border .
There can be no grants of government economic benefits without someone or some group bearing the costs .
A tariff is a tax .
For professional groups , another approach is offered .
It is usually in the form of licensing , which is a grant of monopoly rents to those inside the protected profession .
The profession elects representatives who sit on government boards , or who actually make up the whole board .
They can police entry into the profession 's ranks by unqualified competitors , meaning those who have not passed certain educational and / or skill requirements established by the board .
Most professionals believe that such restrictions on entry are entirely natural for the sake of preserving the present - day standards of practice that the majority of the profession accepts .
Like the businessmen , they see these benefits as normal , natural , and altogether beneficial to the public .
Result : higher fees and fewer choices .
Another way to buy off almost any industry or professional association is by means of direct grants of money .
The government may simply buy products from a company .
It may establish government research grants .
It may subsidize certain industries directly .
In the case of the great railroads in the United States which were built in the 1860s and 1870s , the government offered millions of acres of land to the railroad companies as an incentive to begin and complete construction .
Perhaps the most popular form of subsidy is tax relief .
Certain occupations , companies , or organizations receive tax breaks .
In an era of growing taxation , this approach has been one of the most effective ; the higher the tax level , the more advantageous is tax exemption .
The American oil industry was the recipient of multiple tax breaks until quite recently , and they are still substantial .
All of these special favors are adopted in the name of the general welfare of the public .
All of them involve the financial incentives for private individuals and firms to conform themselves to the goals set forth by the sponsoring agency , the government .
All of them involve the transfer of wealth from consumers and taxpayers to the beneficiaries .
All of them involve a temporary suspension of market forces and a redirection of those competitive pressures .
All of them necessarily involve a reduction of the sovereignty of the recipients , since they become partially dependent on the government for continued benefits .
In short , the bait is most tempting .
2. Setting the Trap
Extra -Market Costs
The government is a political organization .
Its justification is that it is an agency of the popular will , an agent of the public in its political capacity .
It is therefore an agency of public defense .
The general public is to be protected from adversaries , including domestic adversaries .
In a limited - government system , this means that those who use fraud or violence against their neighbors are to be penalized .
In modern interventionist states , the concept of public defense is much broader .
The government cannot lawfully make grants of power or money to any group unless it is in the public interest to do so .
In short , the state must police those who are subsidized by the state .
The money cannot be used exclusively for the benefit of private citizens .
The long arm of the law is at the end of the strings attached to every grant of monopoly power or special favoritism .
In theory , every dollar spent by the government must be accounted for , to make sure that the public 's interest is upheld in each expenditure .
The result , among others , is an endless proliferation of forms .
The state grants a particular group special favors .
But it can not do so randomly .
It must have a purpose , officially and unofficially .
The official purpose is not nearly so important as the unofficial purpose .
The official purpose is offered to calm the public ( which must finance the grants ) and to make sure that the judiciary does not intervene .
The unofficial purpose is almost universally this one : the expansion of political power at the expense of private associations .
Once the grant has been made , the beneficiaries use it for their purposes .
The money is spent .
Parkinson 's
Law takes over : expenditures rise so as to equal income .
But expenditures are always difficult to reduce , especially in large , bureaucratic organizations .
The firms become used to the higher income .
The income becomes part of annual forecasts .
Managers expect it to continue .
After all , they are all agreed that such subsidies are in the national interest .
Would the nation ( the politicians ) revoke their trust ?
Never !
The organization is hooked .
It has become dependent on the continued favors , meaning the continued favor , of the state .
Inevitably , one firm or some individual begins to take advantage of his position .
He exercises the monopoly grant of power which the state provided for him .
He charges a bit too much .
He starts running a " factory . "
Or the firm or individual cuts quality .
In short , someone actually begins to milk the system .
The Patterned Response
Some of us have become cynical over the years .
We have so often seen this pattern , and the government 's equally patterned response , that we have been inclined to come to a startling conclusion , namely , that the government establishes the system in order that some beneficiary will milk it .
That is a primary purpose of the system of government favors .
Once the pattern of " exploitation " is detected by citizens or government officials , not to mention bureaucrats at any level of government , the response is politically inevitable .
Someone calls for the government to do something about the unfair use which is being made of the government 's trust .
Some firm or some professional must be stopped , and stopped now .
The industry or guild must be policed .
The consumer must receive protection from the unscrupulous .
The industry leaders naturally resent this intrusion into the semi - free market .
They resent the fact that someone is milking the system .
That person , for one thing , is trying to get more than his " fair share " of the booty .
Also , he is making the government angry .
He is threatening the continuation of the subsidy .
He is violating professional standards .
This appeal to professional standards is very important .
The government knows what appeals to make , and this is a good one .
( The industrialist is not nearly so alert to such violations , since the agreed - upon standards are not so clear . )
The ethics of the professional association are at stake .
They must be defended .
Yet it is extremely expensive to enforce standards on a colleague .
Friendships are at stake .
Careers are at stake .
And counter - suits are at stake .
Yet a small percentage of incompetents ( usually said to be about 3 percent by every representative of the professional association ) threaten the semi-autonomy of the group .
( There is no real autonomy if the government has granted some sort of favor . )
Need for Policing
The government demands that the industry or professional group police itself .
The market as a policeman has been compromised by the original grant of power or money .
This compromised policeman — the consumers — cannot enforce its decisions inexpensively , given the government grant .
So the government calls on the group to police itself , and it draws up certain standards that should be met .
The " partnership " between government and professionals grows strained .
So the industry or professional group elects ( or more likely accepts ) certain spokesmen who will " work with " the other partner .
This supposedly will insure that the interests of the government and the favored group will mesh , and that the group will continue to receive its favors .
On this point , I can do no better than to quote Enoch Powell , the former M.P. in Great Britain .
He makes quite clear what the industry can expect .
" They start more than half - beaten , by the very fact that they are , or claim to be , the spokesmen and representatives .
It has been their pride and occupation to ' represent ' industry to the Government .
Yet the safest posture for an industry confronted by Socialism would be not to have an organization or spokesmen at all .
Instead of being able to coax , browbeat or cajole a few ' representative ' gentlemen into co-operation , the Government would then , unaided and at arm 's length , be obliged to frame and enforce laws to control , manage or expropriate a multitude of separate undertakings — the true picture of private enterprise — with no means of getting at them except the policemen . "
Powell is here speaking of an industry which is not on the receiving end of major government favors .
If government has the industry on a string , it need not have to resort to the policeman .
All it needs to do is to cut off the subsidies , and the whole industry is put into a financial crisis .
The existence of the subsidies calls forth the " industry 's spokesmen . "
And to quote Powell , " As soon as ' our President , Lord So - and - So ' is in a position to talk about what such - and - such an industry ' wants ' or ' thinks ' , that industry is on the road to the scaffold … .
The Association of these , the Federation of those , present just that one neck to the Socialist garroter . "
Once the government uses the bureaucratic garrotte to strangle the representative of the industry who stands in place of all the members , there is no way out except to repudiate the compromiser who stuck their collective necks into the garrotte .
If they do not pull out their own necks , they will suffer the same fate .
The professional guild is perhaps the most vulnerable , since the very nature of the " bait , " namely , a monopoly position based of guild - policed licensure , creates the very policing organization necessary for the government to impose its will at lowest cost .
They can be appealed to on the basis of professional standards and the guild 's responsibility to a vaguely defined public , irrespective of the individual professional 's ability to satisfy the needs of specific members of the public .
3. Springing the Trap
Extra -Market Crisis
More cheaters are discovered .
The guild waffles .
The cheaters continue to operate .
The press scents blood and headlines .
Politicians scent blood and votes .
When they look into the actual operation of the industry , they find more examples of men or firms that have gouged the public , meaning people who are taking advantage of the very system that the government created - an eminently exploitable system .
So the reports of cheating and fraud continue .
The reports continue , but no prosecutions are begun by the government , since nothing specifically illegal has been detected .
The guild is powerless , obviously , for the same reason .
This means that the reports are going to continue .
The guild will still be under pressure to do something to stop the causes of the reports .
Finally , new laws are called for to clean up the industry , since the industry is seemingly incapable of policing itself .
For professional associations , this is a disaster .
Members have been led to believe that there are standards of practice within the profession .
Yet these reports keep hitting the front pages .
Their self - esteem is challenged .
They begin to wonder what has gone wrong .
Maybe the reports are correct .
Maybe the government needs to do something — not anything drastic , of course , but enough to clean up the temporary mess and let honest men continue to practice .
They miss the point : the government 's task is to alter the practice of the honest men .
The government wants to set all standards and enforce them .
There will then be no doubt about who the senior partner is .
Bureaucrats want control .
The crisis is not created by the negative reaction of consumers .
Businessmen do not find that one morning sales are down 30 percent because the public has decided to walk away from the fraudulent segments of the industry .
Professionals do not find their offices empty for weeks on end .
In short , it is not the market which drives home the message to the supposedly crisis - bound industry or profession .
The critics come from outside the market , probably from those who seldom use the products or services involved , or if they do , who find the products or services quite adequate in their particular cases .
But the crisis is no less real , for the public and even members of the associations perceive it as a crisis .
This means that the crisis is real politically .
" Politically " is what counts in an era which is socialist or interventionist in its economic outlook .
What about the representatives of the industry ?
Will they co-operate ?
Powell answers straightforwardly :
" You bet they will .
They are afraid not to .
They are afraid of being pilloried by the Government and its political supporters as ' unpatriotic ' or simply ( damning word ) ' uncooperative . '
They feel that the eye of the public will be upon them , and they do not like the adjectives which they foresee would be liberally used inside and outside Parliament — and will be , anyhow , before the end of the day .
Of course the line of true patriotism would be the opposite to the one they are going to take .
It would be to protest , by all means in their power , short of breaking the law , against every kind of error and nonsense as it comes along , and to oppose in their own industry any measure which does not commend itself to their knowledge and experience .
But they shrink from this because , although they have no seats to lose and no voters to offend , it takes courage of a special kind — political courage — to outface authority and the popular cry of the hour .
These men have commercial courage , and no doubt physical courage too ; but facing the political music is something they have neither been trained nor volunteered for .
So they play along with the search for an incomes policy , or export incentives , or whatever else it may be . "
And , as Powell points out , " The effect is doubly damaging ; for it also hamstrings any politicians who are prepared to raise their voices in protest . "
The public thinks it strange that industry representatives have not protested the accusations by the government .
Apparently , the leaders approve of the government 's policies .
" Thus the co-operators effectively expose the flank of the anti-Socialist opposition and compel it to fall back on positions which are better protected . "
But not much better protected , he might have added .
Once the crisis is admitted to exist by the leaders , though of course on a much reduced scale — 3 percent of our members , not 20 percent — the battle is pretty well lost .
To clean up that 3 percent , the government will alter the entire foundation of financing , policing , and pricing of the industry 's services .
The corruption will escalate , but now it will be a government problem , to be met by even more intervention .
More laws can be passed , more penalties handed out , more regulations enforced : the government expands its control relentlessly .
The trap has been sprung .
4. Skinning the Victims
Extra -Market Bankruptcy
There are any number of ways that the government can see to it that the former subsidies now become the straitjacket for the former beneficiaries .
The most obvious method of control over professional groups is the establishment of government control boards that will enforce standards and price .
The government begins to finance the guild more directly .
The former monopoly grant now becomes direct payments .
But these payments have no strings attached ; they are ropes , or even chains .
The government sets fees , allocates equipment , and assigns consumers ( clients ) .
The government directs the operation of the association through its captive agents , the profession 's representatives .
Members of the profession are told what they will be paid , the kind of service to be offered , and the quantity of service to be dispensed .
The government also establishes some sort of quality - control standards .
These are enforced by quality - control boards made up of compliant members of the profession and representatives of the public ( pressure groups ) and the government ( bureaucrats ) .
These quality - control boards do exactly that : control quality .
If quality , meaning cost , starts going up , then they step in and control it .
They ration equipment .
They set lower standards of care , especially in government hospitals or clinics .
They make sure that costs are held down , since the government , not the consumer , is paying the bill .
No matter what guild is involved , the government makes sure the " irresponsible quality " is avoided , meaning irresponsibly high quality .
The government forces industries to operate at a loss .
The classic example in economic history is the American railroad system .
Created by government subsidy , controlled in the name of protecting the consumer , the railroads in the Northeastern part of the United States , as well as the Midwest , have been strangled to death .
The Interstate Commerce Commission was the first Federal regulatory agency in the United States , established in 1887 .
It was established in the name of protecting the consumer , but as the New Left historian Gabriel Kolko has argued , along with free market economists like Milton Friedman , the result was a freezing out of new competition , since the ICC established rate floors as well as ceilings .
So the railroad barons were already in trouble by the late 1880s , despite the millions of dollars in subsidies .
The " protection " became a stranglehold , and by the late 1950s , the passenger - carrying railroads were in trouble .
By the early 1970s , they were bankrupt .
( Long - haul freight railroads are still able to compete . )
The government now owns and mismanages many of them ( Amtrak , Conrail ) .
The incomes of the members of the industries and professions that are now directly financed and / or directly policed by the government necessarily fall .
Envy is loose in the land .
The popular press and television reporters have accomplished their goal .
The public will not permit " profiteering . "
The politicians will not permit it .
Prices , wages , and fees are controlled , and work loads increase .
Regulatory agencies each claim a piece of the action , and the multiplication of paperwork is endless .
The formerly independent producers , who answered directly to the formerly independent consumers , now answer to a multitude of bureaucrats and enraged customers who detect the collapse of productivity on the part of the now - controlled suppliers .
Most suppliers lose , most consumers lose , and a real crisis is produced .
Conclusion : Avoid the Bait , Rely on Principle
The answer , philosophically , is to avoid sniffing at the bait .
This must be done on principle .
It would help if businessmen understood the chain of events which follows from the acceptance of a government subsidy .
Yet even if this chain of events is not understood , men should still be able to recognize a violation of basic moral principle when they see it .
They should understand that the coercive power of the state should not be used to benefit one group at the expense of another .
Such power is inevitably misused , if not immediately , then ten years or fifty years down the road .
The precedent is evil ; the results following it will also be evil .
The problem , as indicated by Hayek 's statement which introduced this paper , is that businessmen like the seeming safety of a government - restricted market , at least in the early stages , when they are given some power to set standards and direct production .
Businessmen can make very good bureaucrats , too .
The market is relentless .
It forces men to meet the demands of a fickle public .
Businessmen think they can find an escape in some sort of government business partnership .
That is the grand illusion .
Those who are offered the subsidy must say no very early .
There are strings attached to government money or power , and they become chains if the subsidies are allowed to continue .
It is easier to say no before the addiction process begins , before costs rise to meet income levels .
The longer a violation of principle continues , the more difficult the " withdrawal " process becomes

Quantum Theory : Max Planck
The Wave Structure of Matter ( WSM ) & Standing Wave Interactions ( which occur at discrete Frequencies f ) explains Quantum Energy States of Matter & Light ' Quanta ' ( E=hf )
discovered by Max Planck ( 1900 ) .
But even if the radiation formula should prove to be absolutely accurate it would after all be only an interpolation formula found by happy guesswork , and would thus leave one rather unsatisfied .
I was , therefore , from the day of its origination , occupied with the task of giving it a real physical meaning .
( Max Planck , 1919 Nobel Prize address , ' The Origin and Development of the Quantum Theory ' )
Max Planck ( 1858 - 1947 )
Consequently , there remains only the one conclusion , that previous electron theories suffer from an essential incompleteness which demands a modification , but how deeply this modification should go into the structure of the theory is a question upon which views are still widely divergent .
J. J. Thompson inclines to the most radical view , as do J. Larmor , A. Einstein , and with him I .
Stark who even believe that the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a pure vacuum does not occur precisely in accordance with the Maxwellian field equations , but in definite energy quanta hv .
I am of the opinion , on the other hand , that at present it is not necessary to proceed in so revolutionary a manner , and that one may come successfully through by seeking the significance of the energy quanta hv solely in the mutual actions with which the resonators influence one another .
A definite decision with regard to these important questions can only be brought about as a result of more experience .
( Max Planck , Columbia Lectures on Quantum Theory )
In 1900 Max Planck made a profound discovery in modern physics / Quantum Theory .
He showed ( from purely formal / mathematical foundations ) that light must be emitted and absorbed in discrete amounts if it was to correctly describe observed phenomena ( i.e. Blackbody radiation ) .
Prior to then light had been considered as a continuous electromagnetic wave , thus the discrete nature of light was completely unexpected , as Albert Einstein explains ;
About fifteen years ago [ 1899 ] nobody had yet doubted that a correct account of the electrical , optical , and thermal properties of matter was possible on the basis of Galileo - Newtonian mechanics applied to molecular motion and of Maxwell 's theory of the electromagnetic field .
( Albert Einstein , 1915 )
Then Planck showed that in order to establish a law of heat radiation ( Infra red light waves ) consonant with experience , it was necessary to employ a method of calculation whose incompatibility with the principles of classical physics became clearer and clearer .
For with this method of calculation , Planck introduced into physics the quantum hypothesis , which has since received brilliant confirmation .
( Albert Einstein , on Quantum Theory , 1914 )
In the year nineteen hundred , in the course of purely theoretical ( mathematical ) investigation , Max Planck made a very remarkable discovery : the law of radiation of bodies as a function of temperature could not be derived solely from the Laws of Maxwellian electrodynamics .
To arrive at results consistent with the relevant experiments , radiation of a given frequency f had to be treated as though it consisted of energy atoms ( photons ) of the individual energy hf , where h is Planck 's universal constant .
During the years following , it was shown that light was everywhere produced and absorbed in such energy quanta .
In particular , Niels Bohr was able to largely understand the structure of the atom , on the assumption that the atoms can only have discrete energy values , and that the discontinuous transitions between them are connected with the emission or absorption of energy quantum .
This threw some light on the fact that in their gaseous state elements and their compounds radiate and absorb only light of certain sharply defined frequencies .
( Albert Einstein , on Quantum Theory , 1940 )
Even the Greeks had already conceived the atomistic nature of matter and the concept was raised to a high degree of probability by the scientists of the nineteenth century .
But it was Planck 's law of radiation that yielded the first exact determination - independent of other assumptions - of the absolute magnitudes of atoms .
More than that , he showed convincingly that in addition to the atomistic structure of matter there is a kind of atomistic structure to energy , governed by the universal constant h , which was introduced by Planck .
This discovery became the basis of all twentieth - century research in physics and has almost entirely conditioned its development ever since .
Without this discovery it would not have been possible to establish a workable theory of molecules and atoms and the energy processes that govern their transformations .
Moreover , it has shattered the whole framework of classical mechanics and electrodynamics and set science a fresh task : that of finding a new conceptual basis for all physics .
Despite remarkable partial gains , the problem is still far from a satisfactory solution .
( Albert Einstein , on Quantum Theory , 1950 )
We can now finally solve these problems by understanding the reason for these discrete energy states , which are due to the fact that standing waves only exist at discrete frequencies , like notes on the string of a guitar , thus while the correct Spherical Standing Wave Structure of Matter predicts that energy exchanges will be discrete , as observed , the continuous e-m wave does not anticipate this .
Thus the Spherical Standing Wave Structure of Matter explains Max Planck 's ( 1900 ) discovery that there are only certain allowed discrete energy states for electrons in molecules and atoms , and further , that light is only ever emitted and absorbed by electrons in discrete or ' quantum ' amounts , as the electrons move from one stable standing wave pattern to another .
Help Humanity
" You must be the change you wish to see in the world . "
( Mohandas Gandhi )
" When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence : Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter .
...
Physical objects are not in space , but these objects are spatially extended .
In this way the concept ' empty space ' loses its meaning .
...
The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high .
...
The free , unhampered exchange of ideas and scientific conclusions is necessary for the sound development of science , as it is in all spheres of cultural life .
...
We must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing situation is possible without a severe struggle ; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm and the misguided .
...
Humanity is going to need a substantially new way of thinking if it is to survive ! " ( Albert Einstein )
Our world is in great trouble due to human behaviour founded on myths and customs that are causing the destruction of Nature and climate change .
We can now deduce the most simple science theory of reality - the wave structure of matter in space .
By understanding how we and everything around us are interconnected in Space we can then deduce solutions to the fundamental problems of human knowledge in physics , philosophy , metaphysics , theology , education , health , evolution and ecology , politics and society .
This is the profound new way of thinking that Einstein realised , that we exist as spatially extended structures of the universe - the discrete and separate body an illusion .
This simply confirms the intuitions of the ancient philosophers and mystics .
Given the current censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals ( based on the standard model of particle physics / big bang cosmology ) the internet is the best hope for getting new knowledge known to the world .
But that depends on you , the people who care about science and society , realise the importance of truth and reality .
It is Easy to Help !

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light , but rather because its opponents eventually die , and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it .

I must admit I was hesitant at first when Patrick Griffiths requested an abundance of rounded corners for the Vivabit redesign — and there ’s no shortage of them on the site — but I ’d say it turned out rather nicely in the end .

I take that back — the use of a grid in graphic design is nothing new , but the fact that their articles enticed many of us to think more seriously about using grids in web layouts is perhaps the better statement .
I know they influenced a few of my designs , some of which I may reveal at a later date .

Naming conventions
Some symbol naming conventions , distilled from CLHS , the Lisp FAQ , and comp.lang.lisp .
Widely used " need - to - know " conventions :
foo-bar " - " is used as a word delimiter * foo* ( global ) special variable foo* slightly different variant of the foo operator & foo lambda list keyword .
These symbols will be in the lambda - list - keywords list .
nfoo ( possibly ) destructive ( non-consing ) function foop predicate ( also foo - p ) ; see notes below for when to hyphenate foof place changing ( like in SETF , INCF , ... ) ( also foo - f ) + foo+ constant , or single CLOS instance % foo low - level , fast , dangerous function , or Lisp system specific implementation of foo make - foo create a foo and return it define - foo ( globally ) define a new foo ( also short version : " deffoo " ) with - foo create a dynamic context with a foo do - foo iterate through a foo foo - case foo - specific case expression foo - bar type - slot , converting FOO to BAR foo - to - bar converting FOO to BAR
Often seen , but not - quite - so - common conventions :
bar - of slot bar of an object foo / bar type / operation , foo with bar , bar version of foo foo .
bar type .
slot or , in some implementations conventional hierarchical package ( e.g. ACL and CMUCL ) ? foo variable in embedded language < foo< variable in embedded language
Occasionally seen :
< foo > class % foo % local special variable . foo .
internal special variable . foo .
private macro symbol / foo/ global lexical variable $ foo function visible from Macsyma foo& foo , operating on fixnums foo$ foo , operating on floats
Conventions in Scheme :
foo! destructive function foo ?
predicate $ foo constant call - with - foo Invoke a thunk in some dynamic context foo -> bar Coerce object of type foo to object of type bar
This is standard syntax , not convention :
: bar keyword foo : bar external symbol bar in package foo foo : : bar internal symbol bar in package foo ( do n't try this at home , kids ! ) #: bar uninterned symbol ( does not belong to any package )
These will annoy people :
CamelCaseIdentifiers
Use identifiers - like - this identifiers_with_underscores are harder to type hungarian - identifiers - pcsnsi abbrv-idntfrs Use Emacs to expand them .
Unless there is a good reason to use them ( for instance , you need to interface to a third - party package that uses them ) , they should be avoided .
Some additional style notes :
The CDMS II detectors ( hexagons ) are stacked in an icebox with six insulating layers to keep the instruments cold .
Wires carry measurements from the detectors to computers outside .
Scientists do n't know what dark matter is , but they know it 's all over the universe .
Everything humans observe in the heavens — galaxies , stars , planets and the rest — makes up only 4 percent of the universe , scientists say .
The remaining 96 percent is composed of dark matter and its even more mysterious sibling , dark energy .
Scientists recently found direct evidence that dark matter exists by studying a distant galaxy cluster and observing different types of motion in luminous versus dark matter .
Still , no one knows what dark matter is made of .
Now , a pioneering international project co-led by Stanford physicist Blas Cabrera may finally crack the case and pin down the elusive particles that form dark matter .
" It 's harder and harder to get away from the fact that there is a substance out there that 's making up most of the universe that we can't see , " says Cabrera .
" The stars and galaxies themselves are like Christmas tree lights on this huge ship that 's dark and neither absorbs nor emits light . "
Buried deep underground in a mineshaft in Minnesota lies Cabrera 's project , called the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search II ( CDMS II ) .
University of California - Berkeley physicist Bernard Sadoulet serves as spokesperson for the effort .
Fermilab's Dan Bauer is its project manager , and Dan Akerib from Case Western Reserve University is the deputy project manager .
A team of 46 scientists at 13 institutions collaborates on the project .
To catch a WIMP
The experiment is the most sensitive in the world aiming to detect exotic particles called WIMPS ( Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ) , which are one of scientists ' best guesses at what makes up dark matter .
Other options include neutrinos , theorized particles called axions or even normal matter like black holes and brown dwarf stars that are just too faint to see .
WIMPS are thought to be neutral in charge and weigh more than 100 times the mass of a proton .
At the moment these elementary particles exist only in theory and have never been observed .
Scientists think they have n't found them yet because they 're excruciatingly difficult to capture .
WIMPS do n't interact with most matter — the shy particles pass right through our bodies — but CDMS II aims to catch them in a rare collision with the atoms in the project 's special - made detectors .
" These particles mostly pass through the Earth without scattering , " Cabrera says .
" The only reason we even have a chance of seeing events is because [ there are ] so many of the particles that very rarely one will come [ into the detector ] and scatter . "
The detectors are hidden under layers of earth in Minnesota 's Soudan mine to protect them from cosmic rays and other particles that might collide with the detectors and be mistaken for dark matter .
In fact , half the battle for the scientists working on CDMS II is to shield their instruments as much as possible from everything but WIMPS and to develop elaborate systems to tell the difference between dark matter and more mundane particles .
" Our detector is this hockey - puck - shaped thing that needs to live at 50 thousandths of a degree above absolute zero , " says Walter Ogburn , a graduate student at Stanford who works on the project .
" It 's hard to make things that cold . "
To that end , the instruments are nestled in a canister called an icebox , lined with six layers of insulation , from room temperature on the outside to coldest on the inside .
This keeps the detectors so cold that even atoms can't shiver .
The detectors are made of crystals of solid silicon and solid germanium .
The silicon or germanium atoms sit still in a perfect lattice .
If WIMPS crash into them , they will wiggle and give off tiny packets of heat called phonons .
When phonons rise to the surface of the detectors , they create a change in a very sensitive layer of tungsten , which the researchers can record .
A second circuit on the other side of the detector measures ions , charged particles that would be released from a collision of a WIMP and an atom in the detector .
" Those two channels let us discriminate between different kinds of interactions , " says Ogburn .
" Some things make more ionization and some things make less , so you can tell the difference that way . "
It takes a squad of scientists at multiple facilities to build the detectors .
The team buys the crystals from an outside company , and researchers at Stanford 's Center for Integrated Systems make measuring instruments on the surfaces of the detectors .
" We use the same things to make these that people use to make microprocessors because those are also super tiny , " says Matt Pyle , another graduate student in Cabrera 's lab .
Clumps of clues
A subset of WIMPS , called neutralinos , are the lightest particles expected by supersymmetry , a theory that predicts a mate for every particle we 've already observed .
If CDMS II is successful in finding neutralinos , this would be the first evidence for supersymmetry .
" Supersymmetry suggests there 's a whole other sector out there of particles that are the partners to our existing particles , " Cabrera says .
" There are many ways in which supersymmetry looks very likely .
But there 's no direct evidence yet for any matching [ supersymmetric ] particle pair . "
The weak interactions of WIMPS are why , even though dark matter particles have mass and obey the laws of gravity , they do not clump into galaxies and stars like normal matter .
In order to clump , particles must crash and stick together .
But WIMPS most often would fly right by each other .
Plus , because WIMPS are neutral , they do not form atoms , which require the attraction of positively charged protons to negatively charged electrons .
" Dark matter permeates everything , " Cabrera says .
" It just never collapsed the way atoms did . "
Since dark matter never formed stars and other familiar heavenly objects , for a long time scientists never knew it was there .
The earliest indication of its existence came in the 1930s when Fritz Zwicky , a Swiss - American astronomer , observed clusters of galaxies .
He added up the masses of galaxies and noticed that there was not enough mass to account for the gravity that must exist to hold the clusters together .
Something else must provide the missing mass , he deduced .
Later in the 1970s , Vera Rubin , an American astronomer , measured the speeds of stars in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies .
As she looked farther out toward the edges of these galaxies , she found that the stars do not rotate more slowly as scientists expected .
" That did n't make any sense , " Cabrera says .
" The only way you could understand it is if there was a lot more mass there than what you saw in the starlight . "
Over the years , more and more evidence for dark matter has piled up .
Although scientists do n't yet know what it is , they have a better idea of where it is and how much of it there should be .
" There 's very little wiggle room left for having different quantities , " Cabrera says .
" We 've not seen anything that looks like an interesting signal to date , " he says .
But the CDMS II researchers continue the search .
So , too , do other groups .
ZEPLIN , an experiment run by physicists at the University of California - Los Angeles and the United Kingdom Dark Matter Collaboration , aims to catch WIMPs in liquid vats of xenon in a mine near Sheffield , England .
And at the South Pole , a University of Wisconsin - Madison project called IceCube is under construction that will use optical sensors buried deep in the ice to look for neutrinos , high - energy particles that are signatures of WIMP annihilations .
Meanwhile , CDMS II continues to evolve .
Its researchers are building bigger and bigger detectors to increase their chances of finding WIMPS .
In the future , the team hopes to build a 1 - ton detector that should be able to discover many of the most probable types of WIMPS , if they exist .
" We 're taking data now with more than twice as much target mass of germanium than we had before , so we 're definitely exploring new territory right now , " says Ogburn .
" But there 's a lot more to cover . "

We ’ve all felt the clean slickness of a well - oiled Ajax app .
But think back to the last time something went wrong while you were using an Ajax app : how did it feel ?
Article Continues Below
Chances are , it felt awkward and foreign .
You probably stared at the little spinning “ wait ” graphic and wondered whether or not you should reload the page .
You might have glanced at your watch and thought that the app was taking its sweet time — or maybe you wondered if your request had been made at all .
You did n’t know what was going on — and you ’re a developer !
Imagine what a non-technical user goes through every time there ’s a hiccup .
When good apps go bad #section2
Ajax is handy because it avoids needless browser behavior such as page reloads , but it can also be dangerous because it avoids useful browser behavior like error handling .
Gone are the “ Server not found ” error messages and that familiar escape hatch , the Back button .
When Ajax circumvents useful behavior , we have to make sure we replace it as well as we can .
Perfecting your backup plan#section3
One of the cardinal rules of client - side scripting is to accommodate users who have scripting turned off .
Ajax implementation makes this easy : when hijacking ( or “ hijaxing ” ) a link or form to trigger your Ajax functionality , make sure that link or form resolves to a valid URI that will carry out the intended action using the traditional method .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< form action=" traditional_action.php " method= " post " » onsubmit= " perform_ajax_action ( ) ; return false ; " >
If you take this approach , script - enabled browsers will carry out your Ajax actions and other browsers , recognizing neither the onsubmit event handler nor its return false directive which skips form submission , will submit the form normally and fall back to the traditional form action .
( Note : it ’s almost always a better idea to do the hijacking deep in your JavaScript code .
Inline JavaScript event handling is best suited to , well , demonstration . )
We could also take this a step further in anticipation of script - enabled browsers that do n’t support any type of XMLHttpRequest object .
Instead of using an explicit return false in the onsubmit event handler , we ’d test for Ajax ability in the handling function , carrying out the Ajax script if it ’s supported and triggering the form if not .
Let ’s say you have a JavaScript function named createAjaxRequest ( ) that creates a browser - appropriate XMLHttpRequest object or returns false on failure :
var request ; // our request object function perform_ajax_action ( ) { if ( ! request = createAjaxRequest ( ) ) { return true ; // abort Ajax attempt , submit form } // proceed with your regular Ajax functionality // ... return false ; // do not submit the form }
At the form level , we ’d rewrite our event handler to fall back to regular form submission at the first sign of trouble .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
< form action=" traditional_action.php " method= " post " » onsubmit= " return perform_ajax_action ( ) ; " >
If all goes well , the Ajax code will be executed and the form submission will be skipped .
If any problems occur with the user agent ’s Ajax support , the form will be submitted and the traditional version of the action will be performed .
Keeping your users informed#section4
Much Ajax functionality exists to bypass the standard browser interface , so we need to replace the core usability safeguards that your users are accustomed to .
First , we need an error handler that reports errors to your user when the browser can’t .
The way in which you deliver the error reports depends on your individual application ; in my examples , I put the error message in a hidden div that appears when an error occurs .
What kind of errors do we report ?
Connectivity errors , to begin with .
If there ’s a problem connecting to your behind - the - scenes files , the browser wo n’t report it natively .
If the response fails with a regular HTTP error code , we can pull that from the XMLHttpRequest object and report it properly .
Here ’s an excerpt from the function set as the onreadystatechange event handler , with the XMLHttpRequest object request : ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
if ( request.readyState == 4 ) { // 4 is " complete " if ( request.status == 200 ) { // HTTP OK , carry out your normal Ajax processing // ... }else{ // something went wrong , report the error error ( " HTTP " +request.status + " .
An error was » encountered : " + request.statusText ) ; } }
The next type of error to address is the application - level error .
These errors occur when something goes wrong within your application , and though the way in which you handle these errors depends on your specific application , there are some basic principles to keep in mind .
Let the cycle be unbroken#section5
Most importantly , the Ajax communication cycle must be preserved .
Your server - side execution must complete and return a valid XML document — otherwise , you leave the browser ( and user ) hanging , with no clue as to what ’s happened .
If your server - side script crashes , the error message will be lost and your application will silently fail .
That ’s why it ’s essential to perform assertions and boundary checking on anything in your code that could crash your program , like this PHP snippet which logs an error and exits when a file ca n’t be opened :
if ( !$ fp = fopen ( $ filename , " r " ) ) { $ error_msg =
" Could not open file " . $ filename ; exit ( ) ; }else{ // proceed with the rest of the program // ... }
This is good programming practice in general , but in this situation , it ’s vital to your application ’s usability .
Communicate errors#section6
Once your server - side program completes , you should check for success and report any errors to the user .
The XML document sent back from the server should show error reporting — even something basic with just a code and a message .
In this example , the XML document has a success element , which contains the value “ 1 ” for success and “ - 1 ” for failure .
The XML document also carries an error element , which contains the error message to be reported .
The server - side script performs error checking , and returns valuable error messages to keep the user informed , and guide him or her through the user process .
( The errors that the server - side script checks for in the example are simple content validation tests that should of course be performed with client - side validation ; it ’s a very basic Ajax app put together only for demonstration purposes . )
Solving the real Ajax killer : silent errors#section7
What about silent errors like timeouts and dropped packets ?
When confronted with a web application that appears to have mysteriously ceased to function , users generally respond by losing patience , hitting the Back button , and trying again .
This probably wo n’t be the ideal case for your Ajax app : with its lack of complete page reloads , the Back button will take the user back multiple steps in the user process .
If the Ajax app is well - designed , no information should be lost — after all , you ’ve been saving data to the server the whole time — but it ’s still an extra step for the user that can be avoided .
How ?
Keep your user informed .
Keep track of the time elapsed since you made your request .
If a longer - than - reasonable amount of time goes by before you get a response , pop up a warning dialogue informing the user that something may have gone wrong .
Explain the situation and offer them options : at the very least , give them a choice between waiting a little bit longer and reloading the page .
It ’s a simple but effective catch - all error handler that maintains user confidence in your application .
This second example puts this idea to use , letting you set a server - side delay to simulate a packet delay .
If a request is made and more than 30 seconds go by with no response , a dialogue pops up asking the user if they ’d like to do something about it .
Try varying the server - side delay time to see how it feels .
Pretend you ’re on a dial - up connection and are very used to dropped packets .
You ’ll be surprised at how appreciative you are of the application that ’s sensitive to your frustration .
Only the beginning #section8
This is by no means a comprehensive guide to error handling with Ajax .
There are many other ways to use Ajax to enhance your application ’s user experience , and many more problems and solutions will undoubtedly surface as Ajax grows and matures .
Whatever methods you use , remember that Ajax is meant to create a graceful , cohesive user experience , so make sure your error handling fits with that principle and complements your application .
The more graceful and cohesive your error handling , the more confidence your app will inspire — even when it ’s breaking down .

Here is a little photo - session of an abandoned city .
When the Soviet Union collapsed , government did n’t have much funds to support some small cities around strategically import objects .
People of these cities were left all by themselves .
Nobody could support them because any communication with this places terminated after the army decided that they now do n’t have money to support those objects .
People had to leave their places and move .
Some were lucky to find their place under a sun of the Army of new Russian Federation , some less fortunate had to leave such places without any hope to find a new home , just because the shops stopped working , water stopped coming out of the facet and nobody cared about them any more .
It has been said that even president Putin was thinking to retire from KGB in 1990 and go to work as a taxi driver .
Many people are now probably express great sorrow that he changed his mind at that time .
Ok , so here are the photos :
Just imagine how magnificient those buildings were before abandoned .
There were wide streets ,
big schools ,
some buildings had pillars styled by the top Soviet architects .
Areas and yards around houses are now covered with grass wich found its way through an asfalt and concrete .
You can clearly see the grass here almost destroyed the paved roads during the last 20 years .
Big buildings but nobody cares .
Nobody needs them .
Shops , schools , restaraunts .
And unknown structures whith domes covering them .
This is a cloths shop , there is still a sign “ Cloths ” on it .
And this was a school .
Let ’s come in and see what is inside …
Just a typical school .
Probably now the ghosts of the students still wander by nights , moving the chairs ,
… playing some ball in this gym ,
… walking around this stairways ,
… and trying to sit at those desks .
“ Bon apetit ” say friendly animals looking at them from the walls …
… calling them to stand up and play some funny games …
… but the ghosts ca n’t play , they only pass thru them on their way to infinity … .
They are no more interested in the books …
“ Native Language ” , who might be interested in Native language now , and what is native language for them ?
Maths is off no interest also , no new mathematical genius , future solvers of Perelman conjecture , would study here …
Only on twilight ghosts appear passing by the classrooms , just because school should not be empty .
Russian classics on the walls are the only company for the wandering ghosts .
They have to mind the distance while their midnight talks or they easily come through the wall on which writers dwell .
And that ’s another building that was visited by a photographer .
Here those students lived in happy families together with their parents .
In luxury appartments , spending their cold evenings in the reliable shelter of those houses .
Surrounded by green grass lawns .
Starring on the stars from their penthouses .
Going sometimes skatink for fun ( “ A Skating Rink ” sign is written here ) ,
… and making parties in magnificient halls ,
… chatting with their guests ,
… under those pillars .
Oh world where are all those people now ?

Writing words vs. writing software Matt 46 comments
Latest by lisa
I was reading some quotes the other day about the importance of rewriting …
“ First drafts are for learning what your novel or story is about . ”
- Bernard Malamud
“ There is no great writing , only great rewriting . ”
- Louis Brandeis
“ Books are n’t written - they ’re rewritten .
Including your own .
It is one of the hardest things to accept , especially after the seventh rewrite has n’t quite done it . ”
- Michael Crichton
… and it occurred to me how much these ideas apply to writing software too .
Grinding it out
Whether we ’re authoring software or prose , rewriting is key .
Rewriting is when you turn good into great .
It ’s true for books , blog posts , marketing copy , interfaces , code , etc .
For all of them , we grind it out .
We get something down , share it , get feedback , revise , and then do it over again .
We get where we ’re going via lots of wrong turns .
Sometimes we even throw everything away and start over from scratch .
Yeah , that can be frustrating .
But if you never throw anything away , you ’re holding on to your worst ideas .
Writing copy
For a short blurb , we just bang it out and move on .
But when we want to do it right ( e.g. when writing Getting Real , the Job Board info page , or posts like this ) , we go through a cycle of tweaking and revising .
Here ’s how the process works :
Idea .
Write a version .
Get feedback from rest of team .
People offer suggestions , post related images , and tell you if something sucks .
Sample comment : “ Here ’s another angle .
not sure if it works or not , but I ’ll freestyle it … ”
Rewrite .
We ’ll often bring ideas into Writeboard at this stage in order to collaborate on edits .
Go back to step 3 , if necessary .
Publish .
Get more feedback , this time from outside audience .
Tweak again , if necessary .
Writing software
It ’s actually the same way we create software .
There ’s a lightbulb moment .
Then sketches .
An interface is built and passed around ( seeing a real screen makes all the difference in the world ) .
Feedback pours in .
Revisions are made .
( Sometimes entire ideas are scrapped and we go back to the drawing board . )
Something gets built .
People start using it and make comments .
More tweaks .
Launch .
Listen to outside comments .
Repeat the process .
One important part of all this :
You ca n’t fall in love with your baby .
You need to realize your work is going to get twisted up and turned inside out .
It ’s better to get that over with sooner than later .
If not , you risk falling head - over - heels for your creation only to have your heart broken later .
So share stuff early and often .
We worry about memory and attentiveness .
But what about hand - eye coordination and our visual speed in tracking objects ?
The latter is really important for things likeand also noticing objects and obstacles ( when hunting for example ) .
Now you can track this as well :
This morning I was listening to Karl Fugel talk about tools developers need and thought about Doug Kaye .
Here 's why ...
Yesterday Doug sent out a note to a few friends asking what editor they used to writing code on OS X . I use emacs .
not only do I use emacs , but I thrill to emacs for one simple reason : it 's infinitely malleable .
It can be made to do almost anything and has .
I use it for just about everything I do .
Programmers should be tool builders .
If you 're not building tools to make your life easier , you 're wasting time .
That was really the point of Karl 's talk .
Although he was making the point in terms of open source projects , the concepts apply universally .
Now , back to Doug and emacs .
Doug is , unknowingly , responsible for me getting back on the tool building wagon .
I 'd fallen off and was plugging along , making do .
At ETech last year Doug saw me editing HTML in emacs and made fun of me .
He was right .
It was n't that I was writing HTML by hand , that 's perfectly reasonable .
It was that I typing all the tags by hand when there were easier ways .
Emacs has several HTML modes .
I 'd used them off an on , but unfortunately , it seemed that every time I reinstalled emacs , for whatever reason , I ended up with a different version , with different key bindings , and I just got out of the habit of using the tool .
When Doug gave me a bad time I realized I was losing productivity because I was unwilling to spend an hour sorting out the situation .
I spent a little time researching the various HTML modes and when I found one that I liked and understood ( so I could modify it ) , I put it in my personal elisp directory and made sure .emacs was set to load it .
Next , I spent some time customizing it to add features I wanted .
For example , I frequently reference books in my blog and want links to Amazon .
One action takes an Amazon product code and creates the link for that book , including my Amazon Associates ID .
That alone has saved me a ton of time .
Another small example : I recently built a tool in Perl for generating course schedules from a specification .
Students like to see the course schedule on the Web , but it 's a pain to do since the dates change every semester .
My tools allows me to create schedules like this from a simple textual specification .
Tools are n't always just for productivity .
Frequently the result in a better product because the tool automates its creation .
I 've been spending a fair amount of time with Rails lately .
This is a perfect example of this idea .
David Heinemeier
Hansson built tools to make his job easier and made them good enough that they 've sparked a revolution .
I like emacs and Perl because they 're great platforms for building tools upon .
I like OS X because with it 's Unix at its core , it comes with good shells and a full compliment of programs like awk , grep , find , and so on that frequently find their way into tools I make .
I was thinking about this the other day and concluded that it must be awful to not know how to program .
You 're at the mercy of other people to build your tools .
I 'd hate it .
It would be like not knowing how to drive .
Anytime you 've got to do the same thing more than once , consider building a tool .
And when you pick tools , be sure to pick tools that allow you to build your own tools and can be customized to meet your needs .
If you get into the habit now , you 'll be more productive down the road -- guaranteed .
One of the most prestigious journals in mathematics is called Topology .
It is based at Oxford , its first issue was in 1962 and it has published many of the most important papers in the the field of topology .
Since 1994 it has been published by Elsevier , and many mathematicians have been concerned over the high price that Elsevier has been charging for the journal ( $ 1665 / year ) .
Today the entire editorial board of the journal resigned , effective the end of the year .
In their resignation letter , they stated :
… the Editors have been concerned about the price of Topology since Elsevier gained control of the journal in 1994 .
We believe that the price , in combination with Elsevier ’s policies for pricing mathematics journals more generally , has had a significant and damaging effect on Topology ’s reputation in the mathematical research community , and that this is likely to become increasingly serious and difficult , indeed impossible , to reverse in the the future .
A few years ago a group of editors from another Elsevier journal in the area of topology , Topology and its Applications , also resigned , for similar reasons .
They founded the new journal Algebraic and Geometric Topology , a free online journal ( that also has an annual printed volume ) .
One of this group was my Columbia colleague Joan Birman , who wrote an article for the AMS Notices about the issues involved .
Berkeley topologist Rob Kirby , back in 1997 , wrote a letter to Elsevier that also discusses these issues .
John Baez has a web - page about this that he has just updated to include information about the Topology situation , including a copy of the resignation letter .

A third of male fish in English rivers are changing sex due to ' gender - bending ' pollution , alarming research shows .
Experts say female hormones from the contraceptive pill and HRT are being washed into our rivers and causing male fish to produce eggs .
The problem - which is country - wide - has raised fears that the pollutants could also be contaminating our drinking water - and even be affecting the fertility of men .
The Environment Agency study looked at the health of more than 1600 roach found in 51 rivers and streams around the country .
Overall , a third of the male fish were between sexes .
However , in one waterway , near a particularly heavy discharge of treated sewage more than 80 per cent had female characteristics .
Tests showed the males developed female sex organs and were producing eggs .
Such fish also produce less sperm and the sperm that is produced is of low quality .
Females may also be affected , producing abnormal eggs .
Previous studies have that cod , trout and flounders are all being feminised .
Researcher Professor Charles
Tyler said that the fish are swimming in a soup of oestrogen - like compounds , found in the Pill and in HRT .
The hormone , which is also produced naturally by women and found in industrial waste , is released into our waterways after surviving the sewage treatment process .
Prof Tyler , one of the country 's leading authorities on the effects of oestrogen , said : ' There is a soup of oestrogen compounds , all with different degrees of potency and they are interactive in their effects - if you add them together , you add there are additional effects .
' This soup of oestrogen is responsible for causing these changes to the fish .
It is abnormal .
These fish should be male or female .
The fact that we have got such a large proportion right across the country is not right . '
The Exeter University professor said it is too early to say what the long - term implications will be for Britain 's fishlife .
While it may not initially have a big impact on stock levels , a reduction in the number of breeding males could lead to all sorts of genetic problems in later years .
' Effects like a change in how many males can contribute to the population can change the genetic structure of the population , ' he said .
' In five years ' item , the whole system could go belly - up . '
Human health could also be at risk , with oestrogen from contaminated food and water building up in our bodies .
Although there is no conclusive proof , it is thought the hormone , which has similar actions in fish and humans , could be partly to blame for falling sperm counts in men .
British men's sperm counts dropped by almost a third between 1989 and 2002 , and one in six couples now have difficulty conceiving .
Prof Tyler said : ' There is certainly the potential for it to have an effect in humans - and possibly a marked effect . '
The Environment Agency is looking at ways of improving the sewage treatment process , to either remove oestrogen during the process or reduce the amount that is discharged into our waterways .

I am quite new to chess but i have studied a few of the openings such as the Italian game , FRence defence , caro kann , laskers defence and a few others but up until now i have been avoidin what is apparently the most popular open game .
I have tried to avoid any chance of having to play against the Ruy LOpez by playing the French or Caro Kann because i have looked at the ruy lopez and seen there are literally …

Do you agree and why ?

White plays 5.c5 .
This is the Gunderam attack in which White has the queenside pawn majority .
If White can support the c5 pawn ( b4 ) , he can try to go for a passed pawn .

This is an old and popular chess puzzle that baffled me for years .
Does anyone know the answer ??.
Well , I know the answer .
A chess game begins with 1.e4 and ends in the fifth move with knight takes rook mate .
Reconstruct the game .
hmmm
In six moves is easy , for example : 1.e5 a6 2 . Qh5 b6 3.Nf3 c6 4.Ne5 h6 5.Nxf7 g5 6.Nxg8 # Final position
Now , it seems quite difficult to do the same in just five moves .

It ’s not easy to extract a large plastic syringe that ’s submerged in a tub of very firm cream cheese , but Mercedes Brighenti performs the task with elegance and precision .
The sleeves of her white lab coat are rolled up , her long dark hair is pulled back , and her silver watch is pushed up on her slender arm .
Still , the final tug flings little globs of cheese around the university lab – one of only two in the US with a cream cheese research program .
Cheese - filled test tubes bubble nearby , and a small iron - clad oven fills the air with the smell of burnt dairy products .
Brighenti has the lab to herself this afternoon .
An embarrassed look creeps over her face .
A clump of cream cheese dangles from her hair .
“ I think people like to keep their distance when I do my research , ” the 29 - year - old Argentinean says .
Brighenti is exploring the spread - ability and texture of cream cheese .
She uses the syringe to inject 5 milliliters of the stuff into a small shatterproof dish and presses a button on a nearby computer .
A clear plastic wedge smashes into the white mass , which is smushed and compacted .
A graph depicting its load - bearing capabilities ripples onto the computer monitor .
Brighenti smiles .
She ’s a step closer to unraveling the molecular mysteries of cream cheese .
Until now , little has been published about the chemical interactions involved in its production .
Over the years , individual manufacturers have been accumulating know - how through trial and error .
Kraft , which has been perfecting its Philadelphia - brand cheese for more than 75 years , closely guards its manufacturing secrets , keeping them in a vault in Chicago .
What it knows , it is n’t sharing .
The company controls nearly 70 percent of the $ 800 million market .
Brighenti is part of a push to make the secrets of cream cheese available to anyone .
Her lab here at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is systematically investigating the spread .
The work is funded by federal grants , the dairy industry , and manufacturers who receive prepublication access to research reports and advice .
The ultimate goal is to foment innovation , and it could n’t come at a better time :
For the past five years , cream cheese sales have been flat .
But manufacturers believe that demand will pick up again if they can develop new varieties , flavors , and uses .
The problem is that these attempts often end in failure .
The industry needs a cheese whiz .
John Lucey keeps a big poster outside his office at the Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research , just down the hall from Brighenti ’s lab bench .
( He ’s her boss . )
The poster is an enlargement of the title page of one of his academic papers , “ Predicting Cottage Cheese Cutting Time Using a Light Backscatter Sensor . ”
Lucey is an associate professor of food science at the university and runs the cream cheese program .
Born in Ireland , he came to Wisconsin for a professorship after making his name in yogurt research in Europe .
He has studied most cheeses and is convinced that a cream cheese revolution is in the offing .
Most people think there ’s nothing wrong with cream cheese .
They do n’t see what Lucey sees .
Cream cheese can be challenging to produce , which accounts for the stream of calls he gets from manufacturers flummoxed by production problems .
They complain about cheese that smells like dirty socks , cardboard , or Robitussin .
Priority FedEx packages of bad cream cheese arrive regularly at the center .
Scientifically , it ’s one of the trickier dairy products .
In their natural state , the protein molecules in milk have a negative charge , so they repel one another – that ’s what keeps milk liquid .
To solidify it ( that is , turn it into cheese ) , this repellency must be overcome .
Makers of cheddar and mozzarella usually rely on enzymes in rennet – a substance derived from the stomach lining of young calves – to attack the protein molecules and shear off the section bearing the electrical charge .
Cream cheese is the result of a more technical procedure .
Acid -secreting bacteria are added to the milk , and the decreasing pH flips the chargeof some of the milk ’s proteins .
The positively charged molecules attract the negatively charged ones , coagulating the liquid and eventually turning it solid .
The key is getting the cheese to an isoelectric state – the point at which half of its proteins are positive and half negative .
Left alone , the bacteria will continue producing acid , giving all the molecules a positive charge and turning the mixture back into a liquid .
To stop the acidification , the cheese is heated until the bacteria dies .
The cheese maker has to anticipate the isoelectric state and kill the bacteria at the right time .
Lucey ’s research demonstrates that variations in flavor and texture are largely determined by subtle changes in the timing of this process .
Cream cheese also has a higher fat content than most cheeses , and since fat repels water , additives such as guar and carob gums are introduced to bind the water .
Without these so - called stabilizers , water tends to separate from the cheese , leaving a hardened gel .
Lucey ’s experiments have isolated the basic elements – protein , fat , stabilizer , water – and explored the effects of varying each one .
His writings are a sort of guidebook to the inner workings of cream cheese , and they are arming Kraft ’s competitors with new insights and production techniques .
Franklin Foods , the fifth - largest cream cheese manufacturer in the US , is a good example .
In the past few years , the company has combined cream cheese with yogurt , walnuts , maple syrup , smoked salmon , and strawberries .
It has also reengineered its spread to grip bagels better .
Franklin can’t compete with Kraft on price , but according to company president Jon Gutknecht it can try to change the way consumers think about the product .
Gutknecht believes that the cream cheese market is like the ice cream market 25 years ago – only a few flavors dominate .
People did n’t know that ice cream could be more exciting than butter pecan .
For Gutknecht , the model is obvious :
He wants to be the Ben & Jerry ’s of cream cheese .
“ The mission of our company , ” he says , “ is to reinvent cream cheese . ”
To get there , John Ovitt , head of R&D for Franklin , relies on Lucey ’s lab .
Ovitt makes yearly pilgrimages to Madison and calls on the scientist any time he has a question about how to push the cheese in a new direction .
For example , Franklin recently developed a yogurt - infused version , and the moisture content of the yogurt was preventing the cheese from hardening .
Ovitt phoned Lucey , who suggested new combinations of stabilizers and a slower acidification of the starter milk , both of which , according to Lucey ’s research , would lead to increased water retention .
It worked .
Franklin patented the new product , debuted it as Hahn ’s Heavenly Plain Yogurt Cream Cheese in June 2004 , and sold $ 1.6 million of it last year .
Lucey and his fellow researchers have seen cream cheese at its most unruly .
In one instance , a producer ’s packages were bulging on the grocery shelf and threatening to explode .
The problem occurred in a batch that had been mixed with small pieces of green pepper .
By testing the cheese ’s chemical composition , Lucey ’s team figured out that the pepper was secreting small amounts of acid .
Yeast in the cheese was fermenting the acid from the pepper and producing gas .
When the product was sealed , the gas built up until , eventually , the container would burst .
The solution : Remove the yeast .
With each problem solved , Kraft ’s rivals become more competitive .
At the moment , Schreiber Foods is in the best position to challenge Kraft ’s dominance .
Schreiber is the world ’s largest privately held cheese company , generating more than $ 3 billion in annual revenue .
It jumped into the cream cheese business only four years ago but moved aggressively , buying manufacturers that supply private - label super - market brands .
Schreiber is now the number two producer , controlling an estimated 25 percent of the market .
Schreiber also signed on Lucey as a consultant .
As part of his work with Schreiber , Lucey holds confidential briefings with the company and helps it develop products .
He offers the same opportunity to Kraft , but he notes that Kraft has less to gain from his help and has shown less interest in his research .
Kraft , in fact , has been slow to invest in experimental products .
“ Kraft ’s criterion for success is a national brand , ” explains Phil Tong , a former cream cheese researcher for Kraft and now director of the Dairy Products Technology Center at California Polytechnic State University , San Luis Obispo .
“ It ’s too big a hurdle .
It makes them a lot less likely to bring new ideas to market , and , as a result , they ’re losing their status as a technology innovator . ”
Kraft executives refused to be drawn into a conversation about Lucey ’s work or any aspect of cheese science .
James Graham , Kraft ’s senior director of R&D , would allow only that “ cream cheese is a global brand for Kraft , and we work closely with consumers to ensure the highest - quality cream cheese . ”
For Lucey , the future of cream cheese will be dictated by upstarts .
For instance , Kraft rivals have developed a kimchi flavor for the Asian market and a chipotle salsa variety for the US .
It ’s a future Lucey ca n’t wait to taste .
Mercedes Brighenti has spent the past 18 months staring at cream cheese .
She has observed its fat globules under microscopes , spun it in centrifuges , melted it , frozen it , and tasted it as if it were a fine wine .
A bumper sticker in her office demands EAT CHEESE OR DIE !
One of her favorite research subjects is cheesecake .
She likes to place a 2 - millimeter slice of cream cheese in a machine that heats it to 170 degrees Fahrenheit .
This so - called rheometric test gauges viscosity and serves as a mathematical and scientific substitute for taste - testing a cake .
By evaluating various cream cheese formulations , Brighenti is able to determine which types create brittle , firm , grainy , or sticky cakes .
It may not win her a Nobel Prize , but it could give the world a better - tasting cheesecake .

House Republicans foreclosed Democratic efforts to offer amendments on warrantless domestic surveillance and other controversial intelligence topics when the FY 2007 Intelligence Authorization
Act was brought to the floor yesterday .
Instead , the House approved by a vote of 327-96 what Rep. Leonard Boswell ( R - Iowa ) described as “ the largest intelligence budget in our history . ”
Democratic amendments , such as a proposal that domestic surveillance be conducted consistent with the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , were blocked in the Rules Committee so they could not be debated .
“ We are not even going to be allowed to vote on an amendment that would deal with this central constitutional question , ” complained Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) .

Prof Hawking is in " no hurry to die "
He told the BBC that life could be wiped out by a nuclear disaster or an asteroid hitting the planet .
But the Cambridge academic added : " Once we spread out into space and establish colonies , our future should be safe . "
Prof Hawking , 64 , was speaking before receiving the UK's top science award , the Royal Society 's Copley Medal .
My next goal is to go into space ; maybe Richard Branson will help me
Professor Stephen Hawking
Professor Hawking said that current chemical and nuclear rockets were not adequate for taking colonists into space as they would mean a journey of 50,000 years .
He also discounted using warp drive to travel at the speed of light for taking people to a new outpost .
Instead , he favoured " matter / anti- matter annihilation " as a means of propulsion .
A collision with fragments from space could end life on earth
He explained : " When matter and anti-matter meet up , they disappear in a burst of radiation .
If this was beamed out of the back of a spaceship , it could drive it forward . "
Travelling at just below the speed of light , it would mean a journey of about six years to reach a new star .
" It would take a lot of energy to accelerate to near the speed of light , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today .
Professor Hawking became famous with the publication of his book A Brief History of Time in the late 1980s .
' Goal is space '
The physicist was not given many years to live when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in the 1960s , aged 22 .
He said since then he had " learned not to look too far ahead , but to concentrate on the present " .
" I am not afraid of death but in no hurry to die , " he said .
" My next goal is to go into space ; maybe Richard Branson will help me . "
Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Group has contracted a firm to design and build a passenger spaceship .
Offshoot Virgin Galactic will own and operate at least five spaceships and two mother ships , and will charge £ 100,000 ( $ 190,000 ) to carry passengers to an altitude of about 140 km on a sub-orbital space flight .
I Steal Television Shows Because I Have To
This morning , via Cory Bergman and Lost Remote , comes word that Charter Communications has been sending letters to their customers telling them to stop BitTorrenting HBO shows .
Essentially , HBO has been watching torrents and trackers looking for the IP addresses of everyone who is “ sharing ” one of their shows .
Upon identifying an IP address and associating it with a filename like “ The . Sopranos .
S06E02.HDTV ” , HBO will send a letter to the ISP who owns that IP address urging them to revoke that customer ’s internet access altogether .
First let me say that I believe in HBO ’s right to stop their shows from being shared online .
Sorry , but I do .
The Sopranos is property of HBO and the only license they grant is for you to either a ) watch it on HBO , or b ) buy / rent the DVDs .
HBO is a premium channel so you pay for the right to watch their stuff and you do n’t have to deal with commercials .
Fair enough , as far as I ’m concerned .
Notwithstanding the above paragraph , it ’s interesting to note the steps that HBO must take in order for them to actually have these letters sent .
They must first equip themselves with the same BitTorrent software that they seem to be fighting against .
Then , they must seek out these Torrents , and I believe actually participate in them in order to verify that a file named “ The . Sopranos .
S06E02.HDTV ” is actually the Sopranos and not a one - hour home movie from god knows who .
So it ’s clear they have to actually download the file .
This would seem to be illegal , but I guess they ’d let themselves off since they own the content .
But with BitTorrent , when you download , you also upload , so not only are they sucking the file down to their machines , but they are also willingly distributing it to others .
I know the goal is to just catch thieves , but is n’t this very entrapment - like ?
I do n’t want to get any deeper into the legal aspect of this because a ) I ’m not a lawyer , and b ) it ’s probably possible to download from BitTorrent without uploading , but I just thought it was interesting .
Throwing HBO aside for a moment though , I ’d like to publicly admit to my ISP ( Qwest ) and the rest of the world that I , too , steal television shows .
My cable provider is Comcast .
I pay for a premium package including HDTV , an HD - PVR , way too many channels , and HBO .
I watch stuff live whenever I can , and I do n’t mind commercials .
I take that back .
I mind the Applebee ’s commercial with the damn Gilligan ’s Island theme song parody .
I HATE that thing .
Occasionally , however , I am doing other things , such as working , when one of my favorite shows is on .
In the past , I have either set my VCR to record these shows or set up the old Season ’s Pass on the DirecTivo to do the trick .
But since Comcast bugged me time after time to switch away from my DirecTV service and onto their HD Cable Service with PVR ( that ’s Painfully Volatile Recorder ) , I now have to rely on the technology Comcast has chosen for me in order to catch Survivor and 24 .
So without getting into the ugly specifics of the Comcastorolasoft PVR ( I ’ve done that three times on this blog already ) , let me just say that this recorder obeys orders about as reliably as Internet Explorer renders CSS .
That is to say , sporadically , sloppily , and at times , without reason .
Not only have I missed entire shows but I also missed the final minutes of two extremely important basketball games even though I set the box to record well over the allotted time of the show .
So when you ’re in the middle of a season of 24 and you miss an episode because your cable box was too busy , ummmmm , displaying the time , what do you do ?
What CAN you do ?
There are no repeats .
There are no free downloads for cable subscribers .
The only thing you can do is hop on Azureus and BitTorrent yourself the episode you missed .
And that ’s what I do .
About two or three times a month .
It ’s not clear who is at fault here on the technology side so it ’s hard to point fingers .
It ’s either Comcast ( the providers of the service ) , Motorola ( the makers of the PVR ) , or Microsoft ( the engineers of the PVR ’s operating system ) .
Those who know me would guess I ’d be most likely to blame Microsoft — and I do — but the only company I ’m willing to give a bit of a free pass to here is Motorola .
It ’s not clear they have any control over what ’s going on .
Comcast , on the other hand , does .
Even if the cause of this PVR ’s instability is the Microsoft OS , they are the ones who approved and continue to approve its use in the Seattle metro area ( other areas around the country do not use the Microsoft OS ) .
So who are the losers in this whole equation ?
TV Advertisers :
When I download a show , there are no commercials for me to watch .
TV Stations :
When I download a show , I am not tuned to a TV station , so theoretically , if Neilson homes did this , ratings would go down .
Everyone involved in creating TV shows :
By bypassing the economics of television distribution and monetization , I am decreasing the amount of money in the system and therefore the incentive to create great shows .
Qwest : Because I am downloading 350 megabyte shows , I am sucking up unnecessary bandwidth from my ISP .
Me : I hate downloading shows .
I have to watch them on my laptop instead of the HDTV and there is often a few day delay in actually procuring the program .
And who are the winners ?
The only person I can think of is perhaps the person who does n’t pay for TV at all and is receiving tons of shows by virtue of this growing TV - sharing environment on the internet .
So what ’s the solution to this whole problem ?
Well , I have a few obvious suggestions :
Cable companies , please fix your PVRs already .
Buy Tivo if you have to .
In three years using a DirecTivo , I never missed a show .
Whether you ’re a cable or satellite company , offer as many of your shows on - demand as possible .
Comcast offers most HBO shows on demand , so even if I miss an episode , I can view it whenever I want .
In other words , Comcast and HBO have seen to it that if you pay for HBO , there is no reason you should ever need to download an HBO show illegally .
Good move .
Continue the policy of prohibiting commercial - free , illegal copies of shows to be distributed over P2P networks but change the game entirely by offering perhaps both pay - per - download and ad- supported versions of shows online .
I have no indication that suggestion number one will happen anytime soon , but numbers two and three are already at various points of development .
I can only hope that when these new models mature , the economic model for television will remain viable .
Until then though , I will keep stealing TV as long as technology forces me to .
Computer Language Popularity , 1997 to 2006
This page gives a visual report of computer languages 's popularity , as indicated by their traffic level in newsgroups .
This is not a comprehensive or fair survey , but does give some indications of popularity trends .
Language Class Overview
A graph showing the newsgroup traffic for comp.lang.lisp , comp.lang.c , comp.lang.perl.misc , comp.lang.javascript .
The figure above gives a general overview of high level languages such as lisp , medium level languages such as perl and JavaScript , and low level languages such as c .
High Level “ Scripting ” Languages
A graph showing newsgroup traffic of representative high - level languages that are so - called scripting languages .
The newsgroups plotted are : comp.lang.perl.misc , comp.lang.javascript , comp.lang.python , comp.lang.ruby , comp.lang.php .
From this graph , we can see that Perl rose and fell with the dot com era .
Python rose and surpassed Perl about 2002 .
Ruby is a new kid on the block , and Pretty - Home - Page also has some presence .
Among these languages , Perl is a sys admin staple that started as a unix scripting hack around 1988 and gained a widespread popularity due to the rise of the internet , with CGI and dot com boom ( ~1995 to 2000 ) .
At the time , it was the only practical language for server - side web programing .
Also ,
Perl at the time held another unique position in unix scripting , in that it is more general and flexible than the inconsistent unix tool bags of shell , find , grep , awk .
JavaScript is invented by Netscape during the same time Perl became widely popular .
JavaScript holds the unique position where it is the only industrial language for client - side web scripting ( mostly dealing with HTML in web browsers ) , and is still so today and not likely to change in the near future .
PHP , or Pretty - Home - Page , started as a CGI script written in Perl .
Gradually , it became a language itself , dedicated to server - side programing .
It essentially is a outgrowth of a hack in the unix tradition .
( For example , c/ tcsh , sh / bash , sed / awk / perl ) Today , PHP 's popularity surpasses that of Perl in the web application industry .
PHP as a language is rather dry and business - like .
It has a lot online forums but is n't very lively in newsgroups , where chatty college students and language enthus dwell .
Python started in the early 1990s , several years later than Perl , and with much less fanfare .
It is fit for the same type of applications Perl is good for .
Its popularity rose slowly and stably .
The primary , and a very sharp , difference between Perl and Python is that Perl has lax syntax that makes
Perl code most unreadable , while Python has a syntax that requires even exact indentations , which makes it very readable .
Ruby is another language in the same class as Perl and Python .
It arose as a betterment over Perl 's problematic syntactical and semantical inconsistencies .
From the design point of view , Ruby is very clean and elegant , but as of today , it is still a toy language with no industrial foothold .
Although its popularity is on the rise , but whether it will become widely used is not clear , since there are also old and new languages such as Scheme , Haskell , Perl6 and Python3000 vying for the future .
Lisp , and Industrial Low Level Languages
A graph showing the newsgroup traffic for comp.lang.lisp , comp.lang.c , comp.lang.c++ , comp.lang.java.programmer .
The languages in this graph are all widely used industrial languages .
C and lisp share a commonality in their old age .
( LISP ~ 1960 and C ~ 1970 ) .
Lisp is a functional language distinct from the others .
C++ is more or less a compatible superset of C. Java is somewhat a betterment over C++.
The syntax of C , C++ , and Java are basically identical .
We can see that lisp is slowly but steadily on the rise , and the imperative languages rose and fell with the dot com .
C++ is a result of OOP fad in its infancy , and is functionally a OOP graft over C. Java is invented by Sun Microsystems during the dot com era , with huge investment towards marketing , to the point that even non-programers have read about it in common newspapers , with the air of some technological revolution .
( the naming of JavaScript by Netscape , is a intentional ride on Sun Microsystem 's Java marketing propaganda .
JavaScript the language has no relations , affinity , or similarity to Java the language . )
From the graph we can see , that Java 's popularity went over C++ but fell slightly below C++ after the dot com bubble burst .
Postscript and Colophon
The data source is google 's newsgroup archive .
For example , « http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.javascript/about»
A perl script is used to retrieve the data and parse it into a form readable by Mathematica .

use Data :: Dumper ; $ gp = ' comp.lang.c' ; $ gp = ' alt.usage.english ' ; $ gp = q ( misc.writing ) ; $ gp = q ( rec.arts.poems ) ; $ gp = q ( rec.juggling ) ; qx {curl -- silent -- output about.html --user-agent " Mozilla / 4.0 " http://groups.google.com/group/$gp/about} ; open ( FF , " < about.html " ) ; my @ aa =( ) ; @ aa = < FF > ; chomp @ aa ; for $ li ( @ aa ) { if ( $ li =~ m #/ group/$gp/browse_frm/month/(\d{4} ) -( \d{2} ) " >( \d+ ) # ) { push @ bb , qq ( { $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3} ) ; } } $ out = join ( " , " , @ bb ) ; print $ gp . ' ={ ' . $ out . '} ' ;
The data is then feed into Mathematica and plotted there .

Oct00 : Type -Based Alias Analysis
Mark is the CTO of CodeSourcery .
He can be contacted at [ email protected ]
Optimizing compilers try to transform source code into the most efficient machine - code equivalent .
Techniques such as alias analysis and type - based alias analysis help accomplish that goal .
In this article , I 'll examine these techniques and explain how you can write source code that is easier for the compiler to optimize .
Although C++ is often criticized as being too slow for high - performance applications , I 'll show how C++ can actually enable compilers to create code that is even faster than the C equivalent .
CodeSourcery ( my company ) contributed an implementation of these optimization techniques to the GNU C and C++ compilers ( gcc and g++ , respectively ) .
These techniques are also used by other optimizing compilers , including the MIPS compilers produced by SGI .
Thus , you can take the techniques presented here and use them to improve your code today .
Aliasing : The Problem
Two pointers alias one another if they point to the same location in memory .
For instance , in Example 1 , ip1 and ip2 are both aliases for i .
The existence of aliases makes optimization much more difficult because it is hard to tell whether a particular value is being changed .
Take a look at the function in Example 2 ( a ) .
If the compiler could deduce that ip1 and ip2 cannot point to the same array , then the compiler could compile this function to assembly code that looks like Example 2 ( b ) .
Note that there would be only one LOAD per loop iteration , except for the very first iteration .
That 's because the value of ip2 [ i+1 ] from that iteration is the same as ip2 [ i ] on the next iteration , so there 's no reason to reload the value .
Unfortunately , there 's no way to know , just from looking at the function definition , that ip1 and ip2 do not alias .
For example , the use of f in Example 3 is completely legal , even though both arguments to f are identical .
Now , the assembly code shown in Example 2 ( b ) is invalid because the value of ip2 [ i+1 ] is changed by the store into ip [ i+1 ] .
That happens because ip1 and ip2 are both aliases for ia .
Because of this possibility , a C compiler must generate an extra LOAD instruction on each loop iteration , ending up with code like that shown in Example 2 ( c ) .
Examples like these are part of the reason that Fortran is often espoused as being faster than C .
In Fortran , aliasing is illegal , so the compiler would be allowed to assume that ip1 and ip2 cannot alias .
So , while the faster code in Example 2 ( b ) would be generated by a good Fortran compiler , a C or C++ compiler must generate the slower code in Example 2 ( c ) .
Alias Analysis : The Solution
A compiler uses alias analysis to try to determine when two pointers do not alias .
If the compiler can determine that two pointers are not aliases of one another , then the compiler can generate more efficient code in cases like the aforementioned example .
There are many techniques for doing alias analysis .
One approach is the use of special keywords , such as restrict .
The next version of C , currently called " C9X , " provides this new keyword .
You can use restrict to tell the compiler that one pointer does not alias another .
This technique shifts the burden of deciding what might alias what from the compiler to you .
The advantages to this approach are that it makes the compiler easier to implement and it lets you provide the compiler with information that no amount of automated analysis might be able to provide .
CodeSourcery contributed an implementation of restrict to the GNU C and C++ compilers , so current versions of gcc and g++ support restrict .
Several other commercial compilers also support restrict .
However , restrict is no panacea for the alias ailment .
If you declare that two variables cannot alias , but then write code that causes them to alias , the program will not work correctly .
A bug like this can take days to track down .
It is cumbersome to use restrict everywhere .
Because restrict is not supported by many C and C++ compilers , it is not portable .
Finally , certain aspects of the way in which C9X defines restrict mean that there are situations where automated analysis can show that two things do not alias , but where there is no way to specify this with restrict .
In addition to using special keywords , such as restrict , compilers use lots of other techniques to establish when a pointer cannot alias some object .
For instance , in Example 4 the compiler does not have to worry about ip aliasing j because j's address is never taken .
If the address of a variable is never taken , then it 's impossible for any pointer to point to it .
In C++ , there are ways to take the address of a variable without using the & operator .
In particular , you pass the variable by reference , or call one of its member functions .
But if none of those possibilities occur , then the variable is never addressed .
Since the compiler can tell that j is never addressed , it does not need to worry that g might modify j .
That means that j can be kept in a callee - saved register ( one that is guaranteed to be preserved by called functions ) ; it does not need to be read from or written to memory on each iteration through the loop .
As a programmer , you can benefit from knowledge about how the compiler performs alias analysis .
In particular , you can write programs that run faster if you know that aliasing issues are important .
In the first version of f in Example 5 , the compiler has to worry that g might modify *p .
Therefore , *p will be reloaded on each pass through the loop as it passed to h .
In the second version , x is never addressed , so the compiler can keep it in a register , thereby improving performance .
( Of course , if g really might modify *p , you should n't use this trick . )
The downside to programming like this is that you may make your code harder to read .
It 's not a good idea to use this technique everywhere ; use it only where performance is really critical .
Type -Based Alias Analysis
A more complicated kind of alias analysis is type - based alias analysis .
It is used in top - of - the - line compilers , including the GNU C and C++ compilers .
This form of alias analysis uses the types of variables to determine what things might alias what .
Although useful in C as well , type - based alias analysis is a particularly powerful weapon in C++ , sometimes allowing C++ code to run faster than the obvious C equivalents .
The idea behind type - based alias analysis techniques is to use the aliasing rules in the C and C++ standards to assist the compiler .
For instance , the code in the first half of Example 6 is not legal ANSI / ISO C or C++ since it treats the address of d as if it were a pointer to an int , even though it is really a pointer to a double .
The technical rule in the Standards , with a few exceptions , is as follows :
" If a program attempts to access the stored value of an object through an lvalue of [ a type other than the dynamic type of the object ] then the behavior is undefined . "
That just means that you have to use the type an object really has when accessing it .
The bit about " dynamic types " means that you can use a base - class pointer to access a derived - class object .
For those that are curious , the exceptions are that you may use an lvalue ( roughly speaking , a pointer or reference ) to a signed type to access an object of unsigned type , or vice versa , that you can use an lvalue with different const-ness or volatile - ness than the object , and that you can use an lvalue of type char or unsigned char to access any object whatsoever .
That last clause implies that the code in the second part of Example 6 is legal because the modification of d happens through a pointer of type char * .
( One reason for the exception for character types is so that you can write a portable version of memcpy ; you can just iterate through the object copying it character by character . )
These rules make it possible for the compiler to do additional alias analysis .
The numerical code in Example 7 is representative of code that appears in many scientific applications .
A few instructions here or there can make a big difference in a loop this small .
There is an assignment to s -> x_m [ i ] on each iteration of the loop .
Therefore , a compiler that does n't know about type - based alias analysis would have to reload s-> a_m , s-> b_m , s->x_m , and s-> n_m on each iteration , for fear that the assignment to s -> x_m [ i ] might have altered s-> a_m .
However , a compiler that uses type - based alias analysis can recognize that the store to s -> x_m [ i ] is modifying a double , while s-> a_m is a double * .
Therefore , it would be illegal for s-> x_m [ i ] to be at the same address as s-> a_m .
Consequently , there 's no need to reload s-> a_m or s-> b_m as the program iterates through the loop .
Similar considerations apply to s-> n_m ; it need not be reloaded either .
Concretely , the second part of Example 7 shows the code that GCC would generate for a MIPS processor , without type - based alias analysis , but with all other optimizations for this loop .
( If you do n't read MIPS assembly code , do n't worry .
The code is annotated , and you 'll see the basic idea . )
In this code , the register $ f3 contains u_m , and $ f2 contains v_m .
The register $ 5 holds i .
The third part of Example 7 shows the code when type - based alias analysis is used .
The compiler counts backward in this loop , because it knows that s-> n_m cannot change .
In particular , $ 2 starts out as s-> n_m and is decremented until it reaches 0 .
In this version of the loop , there are only 11 instructions instead of 17 , representing approximately a 35 percent speedup .
Because there are fewer references to memory , the improvement could be even greater than that .
The key is that the compiler was able to avoid reloading s-> a_m , s-> b_m , and s-> x_m , and s-> n_m on each loop iteration .
Because some compilers now do type - based alias analysis , you should be careful not to violate the typing rules given in the language specification .
If you write code that uses an int* to modify a double , you may well find that , when you enable optimizations , your compiler does not do what you expect .
For example , the compiler might decide that it can treat the code in the first half of Example 8 as identical to the code in the second half , even though the last two lines have been reordered .
Since the compiler knows that ip cannot point to a double , it does not have to worry that the assignment to * ip modifies d.
Thus , the code generated wo n't behave as you expect .
You should think of breaking the type system in this way as equivalent to using uninitialized memory , accessing data after you have passed it to free , or some other equally heinous activity .
Benefits of Type - Based Alias Analysis in C++
Type - based alias analysis can be of particular benefit to C++ programmers when container classes are in use .
In C , a reusable list of abstract data types would look something like the definition in the first part of Example 9 .
Using this data structure , there would be no difference ( in type ) between a list of ints and a list of doubles ; both would be just pointers to a list_node .
For example , assume that x is a list of integers and y is a list of doubles , and take a glance at the code in the second part of Example 9 .
One drawback to the use of C is the ugly casts .
However , there 's an aliasing issue as well .
The assignment to y-> next changes a list_node * .
So , on the third line , the compiler cannot be sure that x-> next still points to the same thing it did before .
Therefore , x-> next will be reloaded from memory .
However , since x is really a list of ints , and y a list of doubles , the programmer knows these things could never alias .
Thus , the compiler will not generate code that is as good as possible , even using type - based alias analysis .
In C++ , however , the situation is different .
Of course , by using templates , ugly casts can be avoided .
In addition , however , templates can make it possible for the compiler to generate tighter code .
Assume a list_node is defined by a template such as that in Example 10 .
Then , the sample code using the data structure would be almost unchanged .
( Just remove the casts , as in the second part of Example 10 . )
But , now the compiler knows that the assignment y-> next is to a list_node < double >* , whereas x-> next is a list_node < int >*.
Therefore , there 's no way that that x-> next can change , and it does n't have to be reloaded from memory .
The stronger type system in C++ permits the compiler to generate better code .
Of course , you could make two list structures in C .
For example , you could have a list_node_int and a list_node_double .
Then , you would still reap the benefits of type - based alias analysis .
However , this approach is not nearly as convenient as using templates .
If you use a C ++ - to - C translator ( such as CodeSourcery 's mmCC ) to compile your code , the translator will automatically generate list_node_ int and list_node_double .
Then , even if you have only a C compiler available , you can have all the benefits of C++ , including type - based alias analysis .
Conclusion
I 've stressed here the ability of the compiler to avoid redundant loads and stores .
That 's probably the most important benefit of type - based alias analysis , since it reduces the instruction count in a sequence of code .
There are other benefits as well , however .
For example , the fact that two memory references do not alias gives the instruction scheduler more flexibility .
On today 's deeply pipelined machines , that translates to fewer pipeline stalls and faster code .
When writing code , you should remember that aliasing issues make it difficult for compilers to generate code that runs as fast as you might hope .
In performance - critical code , you should try to help the compiler figure out what pointers cannot alias what objects .
There are several ways to do that .
Avoid taking the addresses of objects .
Use temporary variables , rather than expressions involving pointers or references , to tell the compiler that a particular variable cannot change during a section of code .
Use the type system to help make clear what can and what cannot alias .
More globally , the next time someone starts talking about the overhead of C++ , and how performance - critical code should always be written in C or Fortran , remember that C++'s strong type system can allow for better optimization opportunities .
Features such as templates can be used not only for type safety and readability , but also to allow the compiler to generate faster code .

A . When a woman is pregnant , her breasts are much larger and her estrogen and progesterone levels are huge .
Progesterone is sending out signals that provide a skeleton to build the breasts .
Q. Was it a surprise to learn that estrogen and progestins can cause breast cancer ?
A . We ’ve known there is a cause and effect with hormones and breast cancer since 1896 .
If a woman is premenopausal and she has breast cancer and you take out her ovaries , the tumors decrease in size .
Not all the tumors — if you took 100 women who were premenopausal and took their ovaries out , 35 percent would have a response .
And you could get a dramatic response .
A tumor that was the size of a walnut could shrink in six months to the size of a pinhead .
It turned out that the tumors that responded contained estrogen receptors .
This became cause and effect — the estrogen receptor was the mechanism that estrogen used to stimulate tumors to grow .
If there was no estrogen receptor , taking away estrogen did n’t do anything at all .

Q. Did taking away estrogen ever make a breast cancer go away completely ?
A . This is the basic difficulty .
We were dealing with advanced breast cancer , and what we saw was that we could get complete remissions in 4 or 5 percent of the women .
In the majority of women , the remission would last for one to two years .
Taking away estrogen slowed things down , it reversed the process , but it did not cure .
Q . Do you agree with the latest analysis indicating that breast cancer is declining because so many women stopped taking Prempro and other menopausal hormones ?
A. Throughout the 1990s , physicians were recommending that menopausal women take hormone replacement therapy .
What happens is that you increased the rate of breast cancer in the whole country .
And it shifted the epidemiology .
We have seen an increase in the percentage of estrogen - receptor - positive tumors in the 1990s and in the beginning of the 2000s , so that now 70 percent of tumors are estrogen - receptor positive .
This was , if you like , consistent .
Everything was ticking in .
The Women ’s Health Initiative and the Million Women Study in Britain really said : “ Here ’s a controlled series of studies comparing taking nothing with taking hormone replacement therapy .
How many cancers were there at the end of the day ? ”
Valery35 and KASSPER over on Google Earth Communty pull off a great hack .
Using the online collaborative spreadsheet service www.editgrid.com, they ’ve managed to create spreadsheet - driven KML that can be linked to directly from within a network link .
It took me a while for the implications to sink in , but boy what implications .
Import any old spreadsheet with coordinate or placename data into editgrid , add a sheet or two with wrapper KML code , use the concatenate formula to wrap the data into the valid KML code , put the end result in one cell , and then link to it directly from a network link via a cell - specific URL .
Presto — your spreadsheet returns KML via some clever templating .
No programming required .
What ’s more , the spreadsheet can be altered collaboratively , and the results will change live for users , as soon as the network link is refreshed .
The best early example is this spreadsheet by Valery , where the data is concatenated into valid KML in cell K12 of sheet 4 .
Put that latter link into a network link in Google Earth , or just stick it into Google Maps , like so .
Awesome , and I ’m not using the term lightly .
The main innovation here ( in addition to the great idea ) is that editgrid.com gives individual spreadsheet cells unique URLs , and that these return the value of the cell .
I could not find an equivalent feature in Google Spreadsheets ( despite having a good look around ) .
This is a clear case of convergence outpacing Google ’s own inhouse efforts .
One of the big debates we are having at the moment in the Foundation is all about how to design a curriculum to stimulate the development of analytical skills .
The thing I care most about is that we focus not on the specific set of tools , but on the ability to “ learn and apply a current tool set ” .
The truth is that we constantly acquire and discard sets of tools .
So we should not be fixated on one specific set of tools for all of life .
Society , technology and the times change so fast that any fact , process or algorithm we learn at school is by definition not going to be useful for any length of time .
The real skills that serve us are the ability to adapt , learn , apply the products of that learning , and participate in the discussions and challenges of the day .
Tht does n’t mean that facts are useless , nor that specific tools do n’t matter .
Unless you can demonstrate an ability to absorb and apply both , fast , you have n’t actually gained the knack of becoming effective in a given environment .
I was thinking about the toolsets I ’ve had to acquire over the past fifteen years since I left school .
In university you are solving the problem - du - jour as set by lecturers and tutors .
Each year you learn a new set of theorems , axioms , rules , laws , analytical techniques , best practices , algorithms , formulae etc .
And you have to learn how to make them dance for you so that you can do well in that year .
Then , by and large , you file those away never to be used again , and learn new tools for the next year of study .
Sometimes , the tools and laws and rules are additive , you build new knowledge on the old stuff .
Sometimes , however , you just learn the tools because you need them to get through the year , and that strikes me as being makework .
See my rant on the study of economics below .
In work , you ’ll have to learn the tools of the trade or the company and how to get things done .
If you ’re a nutcase like me , you change your toolset entirely every few years – I spent two years consulting and training ( late university and early Thawte ) , two years writing database - driven web applications for crypto and PKI services ( later Thawte ) , a year studying ballistics and space vehicle operations ( Star City and the ISS ) , two years learning cooking , dancing , and the intricate details of playboyhood , and now two years learning about how to build a distribution ( Ubuntu ) , and how to build * big * web applications ( Launchpad.net ) .
In each of those phases the tools have been different .
Its hard to know what kind of schooling could have made a meaningful impression on my ability to be a better cosmonaut – or a better programmer – or a better man of leisure .
And I ’ve no idea what set of tools I ’ll have to learn next .
My experience might be extreme , but for ALL of us life consists of a constant process of reinvention , learning and discovery .
You are not doing the same job today that you were five years ago – the world is changing around you .
the most successful people learn how to spot the best tools and trends and to take advantage of them .
They also learn to LET THEM GO when the time is right .
Rather than being convinced your tools are the One True Way , recognise that they are rocking good tools right now and will also certainly be obsolete within five years .
That gives you an incentive to keep an eye out for the things you need to learn next .
Not everything that gets offered to you is likely to be of use .
I hated economics at university because it epitomised the disposability of old knowledge .
The problem was that first - year economics was basically a history lesson disguised as a science lesson .
We learned one classical set of ways of looking at the world , and how to apply them to assess an economy .
This was a bit like learning science circa 1252 and being told that you need to be able to draw up an alchemical recipe for lead - to - gold conversions that could pass for authentic in that era .
Then in second year they said “ luckily , the world has since decided that those ideas are utter crap , you ca n’t really manage an economy using them , but here ’s a new set of ideas about economics ” .
So we set about learning economics circa 1910 , and being expected to reproduce the thinking of the Alan Greenspan ’s of that era .
The same people who orchestrated 1929 - 1935 and all the economic joy that brought the world .
We knew when we were studying it that the knowledge was obsolete .
And of course , when I looked into the things we were supposed to study in third year , fourth year and masters economics programs the pattern repeated itself .
There is some value in disposable knowledge .
I like to hire guys who set out to learn a new programming language every year , as long as they are smart enough to stick to core tools for large scale productive work , and not to try and rewrite their worlds in the new language every year .
The exercise of learning new API ’s , new syntactical approaches , new styles is like jogging , it keeps you fit and energised .
It ’s useful even if are n’t a marathon runner by profession .
But it should be kept in balance with everything else you have to do .
So , back to the topic of curriculum .
We want to create a curriculum that can :
be self taught , peer mentored , and effectively evaluated without expert supervision
provide tools for analysis that will be general useful across the range of disciplines being taught at any given age
be an exercise machine for analysis , process and synthesis
The idea is not that kids learn tools they use for the rest of their lives .
That ’s not realistic .
I do n’t use any specific theorems or other mathematics constructs from school today .
They should learn tools which they use AT SCHOOL to develop a general ability to learn tools .
That general ability – to break a complex problem into pieces , identify familiar patterns in the pieces , solve them using existing tools , and synthesise the results into a view or answer … that ’s the skill of analysis , and that ’s what we need to ensure kids graduate with .

April 20 , 2006 at 17:23 Tags Lisp
There has recently been a lot of buzz in the hacker blogosphere about the deficiencies of Common Lisp , peaked in Steve Yegge 's post Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp and this discussion on comp.lang.lisp initiated by the Common Lisp veteran Ron Garret .
In one of the numerous comments , I ran into a mention of newlisp - a curious little dialect of Lisp that 's aimed at the " scripting " market - to compete with Perl , Python , Ruby and friends .
I took some time to browse the website , downloaded an played with the implementation , and asked some things on their forum to learn more about the language .
My first impression is quite positive .
However , the dwellers of comp.lang.lisp treat newlisp with dismission at best , and with disgust and mockery at worst .
They point to the following as the deficiencies of newlisp ( this probably is a partial list ) :
The name .
Oh , how much the name newlisp infuriates them .
The claim is that newlisp is not in any way more advanced than Common Lisp , so the prefix ' new ' is wrong and misleading .
There is , in fact , truth to this claim , and the newlisp fans agree that the name causes them problems .
The memory management model is very unusual , without a garbage collector per-se .
This is achieved by passing arguments to functions by value , allocating large chunks of memory and managing it internally .
Mark - n - sweep garbage collection is used only during errors .
Generally , I have n't yet found any empirical proofs of the pros or cons of this approach .
Despite the criticism , newlisp is quite fast for an interpreted language .
The default scoping in newlisp is dynamic .
Indeed , this is a serious deficiency .
Lexical scoping is supported in a specialized way , however , through the concept of " contexts " .
There is no auto - transition from fixnums to bignums .
Only 32 - bit integers and floats are supported ( on 32 - bit systems ) .
Generally , I do n't see this as a show stopper - Perl , for instance , also lacks default bignums , and newlisp has a ready - to - use binding to GMP .
newlisp 's macros can't be used for compile - time optimization , as they are expanded at runtime exactly like functions .
Support for OO is very rudimentary and " patchy " - akin to Perl 5's OO .
On the other hand , there are quite a few advantages :
Probably the most important - a tiny footprint .
All you need to deploy a newlisp script is its 170Kb interpreter .
To embed it , use the 180 Kb DLL .
The language is portable and cross-platform Despite its unusual memory management , newlisp is fast .
It measures very favorably against the mainstream scripting languages - Perl , Pyhton and Ruby .
PCRE ( Perl Compatible Regular Expressions ) that works out of the box Graphics with Tk out of the box .
The tiny footprint plays another role here - the Tk - aware newlisp interpreter is only 1.4Mb in size , and it's all you need to run swift Tk applications on all platforms .
A lot of useful and functional libraries , out of the box .
TCP / IP and UDP networking , MYSQL and SQLite access , CGI , FTP , HTTP , XML , XML - RPC , Matrices , statistics , Unicode and more .
Bindings to C / C++ code trivial - very simple to load and use a C++ DLL .
This helps bind popular libraries to newlisp ( like GMP for arbitrary - precision arithmetic ) and optimize tight pieces of code in pure C. Macros are functional and can be used to extend the language and write DSLs .
Very active development .
newlisp quickly closes the gap from the other Lisp dialects .
Its code is open ( GPL ) and looks well managed , the documentation is detailed and tidy , and the implementor is open minded for new ideas and improvements .
( There 's a page on newlisp 's website listing the differences from other Lisps )
Curiously , the slogan of quite a few newlisp enthusiasts are " newlisp - because programming is fun again " .
Recalling the claims of Steve Yegge and Ron Garret , I can't help but think - what if they are right ?
newlisp certainly is a dialect of Lisp , with everything we love in Lisp - functional programming , support for lists , automatic storage management , dynamic typing , first class functions , uniform syntax , interactive environment , extensibility through macros .
Add to this loads of useful libraries that come out of the box , the simplicity to bind to other libraries just - in - case , the small memory footprint , and you have what looks like a fun language .
It also looks like a language with a future , that is being actively developed and improved , here and now .
Most of the criticism of newlisp is about things that are simple to amend , and I have no doubt they will be fixed in time due .
It does n't make newlisp any less usable until then , though .
Sure , it is inferior to Common Lisp and Scheme from a theoretical viewpoint .
But people are writing real applications in newlisp and are enjoying it .
Besides , I 'm sure it can only do good to the Lisp community , since it may introduce more newbies to the language .
I do n't think anyone will disagree that newlisp is much more newbie - friendly than either CL or Scheme .
Jefferson 's Wall of Separation Letter
Thomas Jefferson was a man of deep religious conviction — his conviction was that religion was a very personal matter , one which the government had no business getting involved in .
He was vilified by his political opponents for his role in the passage of the 1786 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and for his criticism of such biblical events as the Great Flood and the theological age of the Earth .
As president , he discontinued the practice started by his predecessors George Washington and John Adams of proclaiming days of fasting and thanksgiving .
He was a staunch believer in the separation of church and state .
Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them written in October 1801 .
A copy of the Danbury letter is available here .
The Danbury Baptists were a religious minority in Connecticut , and they complained that in their state , the religious liberties they enjoyed were not seen as immutable rights , but as privileges granted by the legislature — as " favors granted . "
Jefferson 's reply did not address their concerns about problems with state establishment of religion — only of establishment on the national level .
The letter contains the phrase " wall of separation between church and state , " which led to the short - hand for the Establishment Clause that we use today : " Separation of church and state . "
The letter was the subject of intense scrutiny by Jefferson , and he consulted a couple of New England politicians to assure that his words would not offend while still conveying his message : it was not the place of the Congress or the Executive to do anything that might be misconstrued as the establishment of religion .
Note :
The bracketed section in the second paragraph had been blocked off for deletion in the final draft of the letter sent to the Danbury Baptists , though it was not actually deleted in Jefferson 's draft of the letter .
It is included here for completeness .
Reflecting upon his knowledge that the letter was far from a mere personal correspondence , Jefferson deleted the block , he noted in the margin , to avoid offending members of his party in the eastern states .
This is a transcript of the final letter as stored online at the Library of Congress , and reflects Jefferson 's spelling and punctuation .
Mr. President
To messers Nehemiah Dodge , Ephraim Robbins , & Stephen S. Nelson , a committee of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut .
Gentlemen
The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me , on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association , give me the highest satisfaction .
my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents , & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties , the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing .
Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , & not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should " make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , " thus building a wall of separation between Church & State .
[ Congress thus inhibited from acts respecting religion , and the Executive authorised only to execute their acts , I have refrained from prescribing even those occasional performances of devotion , practiced indeed by the Executive of another nation as the legal head of its church , but subject here , as religious exercises only to the voluntary regulations and discipline of each respective sect . ]
Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience , I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights , convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties .
I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man , and tender you for yourselves & your religious association assurances of my high respect & esteem .
( signed ) Thomas Jefferson

SAN FRANCISCO , July 31 - Briefly buoyed by their Supreme Court victory on file sharing , Hollywood and the recording industry are on the verge of confronting more technically sophisticated opponents .
At a computer security conference in Las Vegas on Thursday , an Irish software designer described a new version of a peer - to - peer file - sharing system that he says will make it easier to share digital information anonymously and make detection by corporations and governments far more difficult .
Others have described similar efforts to build a so - called darknet that aims to shield the identities of those sharing information .
The issue is complicated by the fact that the small group of technologists designing the new systems say their goal is to create tools to circumvent censorship and political repression -- not to abet copyright violation .
Such a stand is certain to test the impact of the Supreme Court ruling in June against Grokster and StreamCast Networks , publishers of peer - to - peer file - sharing software , a number of legal specialists and industry executives said .
The court ruled unanimously that the publishers could be held liable for the copyright infringement that their software enabled in the sharing of pirated movies and music .
Attacking Bank - Card PINs
Research paper by Omer Berkman and Odelia Moshe Ostrovsky : “ The Unbearable Lightness of PIN Cracking “ :
Abstract .
We describe new attacks on the financial PIN processing API .
The attacks apply to switches as well as to verification facilities .
The attacks are extremely severe allowing an attacker to expose customer PINs by executing only one or two API calls per exposed PIN .
One of the attacks uses only the translate function which is a required function in every switch .
The other attacks abuse functions that are used to allow customers to select their PINs online .
Some of the attacks can be applied on a switch even though the attacked functions require issuer ’s keys which do not exist on a switch .
This is particularly disturbing as it was widely believed that functions requiring issuer ’s keys cannot do any harm if the respective keys are unavailable .
Basically , the paper describes an inherent flaw with the way ATM PINs are encrypted and transmitted on the international financial networks , making them vulnerable to attack from malicious insiders in a bank .
One of the most disturbing aspects of the attack is that you ’re only as secure as the most untrusted bank on the network .
Instead of just having to trust your own issuer bank that they have good security against insider fraud , you have to trust every other financial institution on the network as well .
An insider at another bank can crack your ATM PIN if you withdraw money from any of the other bank ’s ATMs .
The authors tell me that they ’ve contacted the major credit card companies and banks with this information , and have n’t received much of a response .
They believe it is now time to alert the public .

With the advent of multithreaded / multicore CPUs , even embedded real - time applications are starting to run on SMP systems — for example , both the Xbox 360 and PS / 3 are multithreaded , and there even have been SMP ARM processors !
As this trend continues , there will be an increasing need for real - time response from SMP systems .
Because not all embedded systems vendors will be willing or able to create or purchase SMP real - time operating systems , we can expect that a number of them will make use of Linux .
Because of this change , a number of real - time tenets have now become myths .
This article exposes these myths and then discusses some of the challenges that Linux is surmounting in order to meet the needs of this new SMP - real - time - embedded world .
Real - Time Myths
New technologies often have a corrosive effect on the wisdom of the ages .
The advent of commodity multicore and multithreaded hardware is no different , making myths of the following pearls of wisdom : Embedded systems are always uniprocessor systems .
Parallel programming is mind crushingly difficult .
Real time must be either hard or soft .
Parallel real - time programming is impossibly difficult .
There is no connection between real - time and enterprise systems .
Each of these myths is exposed in the following sections , and Ingo Molnar 's - rt real - time patchset ( also known as the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT patchset after the configuration variable used to enable real - time behavior ) plays a key role in exposing the last two myths .
Myth 1 : Embedded Systems Are Always Uniprocessor Systems
Past embedded systems almost always were uniprocessors , especially given that single - chip multiprocessors are a very recent phenomenon .
The PS / 3 , the Xbox 360 and the SMP ARM are recent exceptions to this rule .
But what does the future hold ?
Figure 1 shows how clock frequencies have leveled off since 2003 .
Now , Moore 's Law is still in full force , as transistor densities are still increasing .
However , these increasing densities are no longer providing the side benefit of increased clock frequency that they once did .
Figure 1 . Clock - Frequency Trend for Intel CPUs
Some say that parallel processing , hardware multithreading and multicore CPU chips will be needed to make good use of the ever - increasing numbers of transistors .
Others say that embedded systems need increasing levels of integration and reduced power consumption more than they do ever - increasing performance .
Embedded systems vendors might therefore choose more on - chip I/O or memory over increased parallelism .
This debate will not be resolved soon , although we have all seen examples of multithreaded and multicore CPUs in embedded systems .
That said , as multithreaded / multicore systems become cheaper and more prevalent , we will see more rather than fewer of them .
But these multithreaded / multicore systems require parallel software .
Given the forbidding reputation of parallel programming , how are we going to program these systems successfully ?
Myth 2 : Parallel Programming Is Mind Crushingly Difficult
Why is parallel programming hard ?
Answers include deadlocks , race conditions and testing coverage , but the real answer is that it is not really all that hard .
After all , if parallel programming was really so difficult , why are there so many parallel open - source projects , including Apache , MySQL and the Linux kernel ?
A better question would be “ Why is parallel programming perceived to be so difficult ? ”
Let 's go back to the year 1991 .
I was walking across the parking lot to Sequent 's benchmarking center carrying six dual - 80486 CPU boards , when I suddenly realized that I was carrying several times the price of my house .
( Yes , I did walk more carefully .
Why do you ask ? )
These horribly expensive systems were limited to a privileged few , who were the only ones with the opportunity to learn parallel programming .
In contrast , in 2006 , I am typing on a dual - core x86 laptop that is orders of magnitude cheaper than even one of Sequent 's CPU boards .
Because almost everyone now can gain access to parallel hardware , almost everyone can learn to program it and also learn that although it can be nontrivial , it is really not all that hard .
Even so , many multithreaded / multicore embedded systems have real - time constraints .
But what exactly is real time ?
Myth 3 : Real Time Must Be Either Hard or Soft
There is hard real time , which offers unconditional guarantees , and there is soft real time , which does not .
What else do you need to know ?
As it turns out , quite a bit .
There are at least four different definitions of hard real time .
Needless to say , it is important to understand which one your users have in mind .
In one definition of hard real time , the system always must meet its deadlines .
However , if you show me a hard real - time system , I will show you the hammer that will cause it to miss its deadlines , as shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . Hard Real Time : But I Have a Hammer
Of course , this is unfair .
After all , we can not blame software for hardware failures that it did not cause .
Therefore , in another definition of hard real time , the system always must meet its deadlines , but only in absence of hardware failure .
This divide - and - conquer approach can simplify things , but , as shown in Figure 3 , it is not sufficient at the system level .
Nonetheless , this definition can be useful given restrictions on the environment , including : Interrupt rates .
Cache misses .
Memory - system overhead due to DMA .
Memory - error rate in ECC - protected systems .
Packet - loss rate in systems requiring networking .
Figure 3 .
Hard real time : sometimes system failure is not an option !
If these restrictions are violated , the system is permitted to miss its deadlines .
For example , if a hyperactive interrupt system delivered an interrupt after each instruction , the appropriate action might be to replace the broken hardware rather than code around it .
After all , if this degenerate situation must be accounted for , the latencies will likely become uselessly long .
Alternatively , “ diamond hard ” real - time operating systems and applications might run with interrupts disabled , giving up compatibility with off - the - shelf software in order to gain additional robustness in face of hardware failure .
In yet another definition of hard real time , the system is allowed to miss its deadline , but only if it announces its failure within the deadline specified .
This sort of definition can be useful in data - fusion applications .
For example , a system might have a high - precision location sensor with unpredictable processing overhead as well as a rough - and - ready location sensor with deterministic processing overhead .
A reasonable hard real - time strategy would be to give the high - precision sensor a fixed amount of time to get its job done , and if it fails to do so , abort its calculation , relying instead on the rough - and - ready sensor .
However , one ( useless ) way to meet the letter of this definition would be to announce failure unconditionally , as illustrated by Figure 4 .
Clearly , a useful system almost always would complete its work in time ( and this observation applies to soft real - time systems as well ) .
Figure 4 .
Hard real time : at least I let you know !
Finally , some define hard real time with a test suite : a system passing the test is labeled hard real time .
Purists might object , demanding instead a mathematical proof .
However , given that proofs can be subject to error , especially for today 's complex systems , a test suite can be an excellent additional proof point .
I certainly do not wish to put my life at the mercy of untested software !
This is not to say that hard real time is undefined or useless .
Instead , “ hard real time ” is the start of a conversation rather than a complete requirement .
You should ask the following questions :
Which operations must provide hard real - time response ?
( For example , I have yet to run across a requirement for real - time filesystem unmounting . )
What is the deadline ?
A ten - millisecond deadline is one thing ; a one - microsecond deadline is quite another .
What is to happen in case of hardware failure ?
What is the required probability of meeting that deadline ?
( For hard real time , this will be 100 % . )
What degradation of non-real - time performance , throughput and scalability can be tolerated ?
One piece of good news is that real - time deadlines that once required extreme measures are now easily met with off - the - shelf hardware and open - source software , courtesy of Moore 's Law .
But , what if your real - time application is to run on an embedded multicore / multithreaded system ?
How can you deal with both real - time deadlines and parallel programming ?
Myth 4 : Parallel Real - Time Programming
Is Impossibly Difficult Parallel programming might not be mind crushingly hard , but it is certainly harder than single - threaded programming .
Real - time programming is also hard .
So , why would anyone be crazy enough to take on both at the same time ?
It is true that real - time parallel programming poses special challenges , including interactions with lock - induced delays , interrupt handlers and priority inversion .
However , Ingo Molnar 's - rt patchset provides both kernel and application developers with tools to deal with these challenges .
These tools are described in the following sections .
Locking and Real - Time Latency
Much ink has been spilled on locking and real - time latency , but we will stick to the following simple points : Reducing lock contention improves SMP scalability and reduces real - time latency .
When lock contention is low , there are a finite number of tasks , critical - section execution time is bounded , and locks act in a first - come - first - served manner to the highest - priority tasks , then lock wait times for those tasks will be bounded .
An SMP Linux kernel by its very nature requires very few modifications in order to support the aggressive preemption required by real time .
The first point should be obvious , because spinning on locks is bad for both scalability and latency .
For the second point , consider a queue at a bank where each person spends a bounded time T with a solitary teller , there are a bounded number of other people N , and the queue is first - come - first - served .
Because there can be at most N people ahead of you , and each can take at most time T , you will wait for at most time NT .
Therefore , FIFO priority - based locking really can provide hard real - time latencies .
For the third point , see Figure 5 .
The left - hand side of the diagram shows three functions A( ) , B ( ) and C ( ) executing on a pair of CPUs .
If functions A ( ) and B ( ) must exclude function C( ) , some sort of locking scheme must be used .
However , that same locking provides the protection needed by the -rt patchset 's preemption , as shown on the right - hand side of this diagram .
If function B( ) is preempted , function C ( ) blocks as soon as it tries to acquire the lock , which permits B ( ) to run .
After B ( ) completes , C ( ) may acquire the lock and resume running .
Figure 5 . SMP Locking and Preemption
This approach requires that kernel spinlocks block , and this change is fundamental to the - rt patchset .
In addition , per-CPU variables must be protected more rigorously .
Interestingly enough , the -rt patchset also located a number of SMP bugs that had gone undetected .
However , in the standard Linux kernel , interrupt handlers cannot block .
But interrupt handlers must acquire locks , which can block in - rt .
What can be done ?
Interrupt Handlers
Not only are blocking locks a problem for interrupt handlers , but they also can seriously degrade real - time latency , as shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 . Interrupts Degrade Latency
This degradation can be avoided by running the interrupt handler in process context , as shown in Figure 7 , which also allows them to acquire blocking locks .
Figure 7 .
Move Interrupt Handlers to Process Context Even better , these process - based interrupt handlers can actually be preempted by user - level real - time threads , as shown in Figure 8 , where the blue rectangle within the interrupt handler represents a high - priority real - time user process preempting the interrupt handler .
Figure 8 . Preempting Interrupt Handlers
Of course , “ with great power comes great responsibility . ”
For example , a high - priority real - time user process could starve interrupts entirely , shutting down all I/O .
One way to handle this situation is to provide a low - priority “ canary ” process .
If the “ canary ” is blocked for longer than a predetermined time , one might kill the offending thread .
Running interrupts in process context permits interrupt handlers to acquire blocking locks , which in turn allows critical sections to be preempted , which permits extremely fast real - time scheduling latencies .
In addition , the -rt patchset permits real - time application developers to select the real - time priority at which interrupt handlers run .
By running only the most critical portions of the real - time application at higher priority than the interrupt handlers , the developers can minimize the amount of code for which “ great responsibility ” must be shouldered .
However , preempting critical sections can lead to priority inversion , as described in the next section .
Priority Inversion Priority inversion is illustrated by Figure 9 .
A low - priority process P2 holds a lock , but is preempted by medium - priority processes .
When high - priority process P1 tries to acquire the lock , it must wait , because P2 holds it .
But P2 cannot release it until it runs again , which will not happen while the medium - priority processes are running .
So , in effect , the medium - priority processes have blocked a high - priority process : in short , priority inversion .
Figure 9 . Priority Inversion
One way to prevent priority inversion is to disable preemption during critical sections , as is done in CONFIG_PREEMPT builds of the Linux kernel .
However , this preemption disabling can result in excessive latencies .
The -rt patchset therefore uses priority inheritance instead , so that P1 donates its priority to P2 , but only for as long as P2 continues to hold the lock , as shown in Figure 10 .
Because P2 is now running at high priority , it preempts the medium - priority processes , completing its critical section quickly and then handing the lock off to P1 .
Figure 10 .
Priority Inheritance
So priority inheritance works well for exclusive locks , where only one thread can hold the lock at a given time .
But there are also reader - writer locks , which can be held by one writer on the one hand or by an unlimited number of readers on the other .
The fact that a reader - writer lock can be held by an unlimited number of readers can be a real problem for priority inheritance , as illustrated in Figure 11 .
Here , several low - priority processes are read - holding lock L1 , but are preempted by medium - priority processes .
Each low - priority process might also be blocked write - acquiring other locks , which might be read - held by even more low - priority processes , all of which are also preempted by the medium - priority processes .
Figure 11 .
Reader - Writer Lock Priority Inversion Priority inheritance can solve this problem , but the cure is worse than the disease .
For example , the arbitrarily bushy tree of preempted processes requires complex and slow bookkeeping .
But even worse , before the high - priority writer can proceed , all of the low - priority processes must complete their critical sections , which will result in arbitrarily long delays .
Such delays are not what we want in a real - time system .
This situation resulted in numerous “ spirited ” discussions on the Linux - kernel mailing list , which Ingo Molnar closed down with the following proposal :
Only one task at a time may read - acquire a given reader - writer lock .
If # 1 results in performance or scalability problems , the problematic lock will be replaced with RCU ( read - copy update ) .
RCU can be thought of as a reader - writer lock where readers never block ; in fact , readers execute a deterministic number of instructions .
Writers have much higher overhead , as they must retain old versions of the data structure that readers might still be referencing .
RCU provides special primitives to allow writers to determine when all readers have completed , so that the writer can determine when it is safe to free old versions .
RCU works best for read - mostly data structures , or for data structures with hard real - time readers .
( More detail may be found at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCU , and even more detail may be found at www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU.
Although user - level RCU implementations have been produced for experimental purposes , for example , www.cs.toronto.edu/~tomhart/perflab/ipdps06.tgz, production - quality RCU implementations are currently found only in kernels .
Fixing this is on my to - do list . )
A key property of RCU is that writers never block readers , and , conversely , readers do not block writers from modifying a data structure .
Therefore , RCU cannot cause priority inversion .
This is illustrated in Figure 12 .
Here , the low - priority processes are in RCU read - side critical sections and are preempted by medium - priority processes , but because the locks are used only to coordinate updates , the high - priority process P1 immediately can acquire the lock and carry out the update by creating a new version .
Freeing the old version does have to wait for readers to complete , but this freeing can be deferred to avoid degrading real - time latencies .
Figure 12 .
RCU Prevents Priority Inversion
This combination of priority inheritance and RCU permits the -rt patchset to provide real - time latencies on mid-range multiprocessors .
But priority inheritance is not a panacea .
For example , one could imagine applying some form of priority inheritance to real - live users who might be blocking high - priority processes , as shown in Figure 13 .
However , I would rather we did not .
Figure 13 .
Priority Boosting for Users ?
Parallel Real - Time Programming Summary
I hope I have convinced you that the -rt patchset greatly advances Linux 's parallel real - time capabilities , and that Linux is quickly becoming capable of supporting the parallel real - time applications that are appearing in embedded environments .
Parallel real - time programming is decidedly nontrivial .
In fact , many exciting challenges lie ahead in this field , but it is far from impossible .
But there are a number of real - time operating systems , and a few even provide some SMP support .
What is special about real - time Linux ?
Myth 5 : There Is No Connection between Real - Time and Enterprise Systems
To test the fifth and final myth , and to show just what is special about real - time Linux , let 's first outline the - rt patchset 's place in the real - time pantheon .
The -rt patchset turns Linux into an extremely capable real - time system .
Is Linux suited to all purposes ?
The answer is clearly no , as can be seen from Figure 14 .
With the -rt patchset , Linux can achieve scheduling latencies down to a few tens of microseconds — an impressive feat , to be sure , but some applications need even more .
Systems with very tight hand - coded assembly - language loops might achieve sub- microsecond response times , at which point memory and I /O - system latencies loom large .
Below this point comes the realm of special - purpose digital hardware , and below that the realm of analog microwave and photonics devices .
Figure 14 .
Real - Time Capability Triangle However , Linux 's emerging real - time capabilities are sufficient for the vast majority of real - time applications .
Furthermore , Linux brings other strengths to the real - time table , including full POSIX semantics , a complete set of both open - source and proprietary applications , a high degree of configurability , and a vibrant and productive community .
In addition , real - time Linux forges a bond between the real - time and enterprise communities .
This bond will become tighter as enterprise applications face increasing real - time requirements .
These requirements are already upon us — for example , Web retailers find that they lose customers when response times extend beyond a few seconds .
A few seconds might seem like a long time , but not when you 1 ) subtract off typical Internet round - trip times and 2 ) divide by an increasingly large numbers of layers , including firewalls , IP load levelers , Web servers , Web- application servers , XML accelerators and database servers — across multiple organizations .
The required per-machine response times fall firmly into real - time territory .
Web 2.0 mashups will only increase the pressure on per-machine latencies , because such mashups must gather information from multiple Web sites , so that the slowest site controls the overall response time .
This pressure will be most severe in cases when information gathered from one site is used to query other sites , thus serializing the latencies .
We are witnessing nothing less than the birth of a new kind of real time : enterprise real time .
What exactly is enterprise real time ?
Enterprise real time is defined by developer and user requirements , as might be obtained from the real - time questions listed in the discussion of Myth 3 .
Some of these requirements would specify latencies and guarantees ( hard or soft ) for various operations , while others would surround the ecosystem , where real - time Linux 's rich array of capabilities , environments , applications and supported hardware really shine .
Of course , even the rich real - time - Linux ecosystem cannot completely remove the need for special - purpose hardware and software .
However , the birth of enterprise real time will provide a new - found ability to share software between embedded and enterprise systems .
Such sharing will greatly enrich both environments .
Future Prospects
Impressive as it is , real - time Linux with the -rt patchset focuses primarily on user - process scheduling and interprocess communication .
Perhaps the future holds real - time protocol stacks or filesystems , and perhaps also greater non-real - time performance and scalability while still maintaining real - time response , allowing electrical power to be conserved by consolidating real - time and non-real - time workloads onto a single system .
However , real - time applications and environments are just starting to appear on Linux , both from proprietary vendors and F / OSS communities .
For example , existing real - time Java environments require that real - time programs avoid the garbage collector , making it impossible to use Java 's standard runtime libraries .
IBM recently announced a Java JVM that meets real - time deadlines even when the garbage collector is running , allowing real - time code to use standard libraries .
This JVM is expected to ease coding of real - time systems greatly and to ease conversion of older real - time applications using special - purpose languages , such as ADA .
In addition , there are real - time audio systems , SIP servers and object brokers , but much work remains to provide a full set of real - time Web servers , Web application servers , database kernels and so on .
Real - time applications and environments are still few and far between .
I very much look forward to participating in — and making use of — the increasing SMP - real - time capability supported by everyday computing devices !

Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray says the alleged transatlantic liquid bomb plot is staged - managed propaganda on behalf of Bush and Blair - who yearn for a " new 9/11 " to absolve them of domestic political trouble .
Murray previously blew the whistle on how the British government was using evidence obtained from torture in Uzbekistan - inflicted on its population US - funded regime of Islam Karimov - the dictator who likes to boil people alive .
Murray questions the intent and capability of the alleged terrorists to carry out the attack and offers the likelihood that evidence of the plot was obtained through torture in Pakistan .
" None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb .
None had bought a plane ticket .
Many did not even have passports , which given the efficiency of the UK Passport Agency would mean they could n't be a plane bomber for quite some time , " says Murray ( pictured ) .
" In the absence of bombs and airline tickets , and in many cases passports , it could be pretty difficult to convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt that individuals intended to go through with suicide bombings , whatever rash stuff they may have bragged in internet chat rooms . "
" Then an interrogation in Pakistan revealed the details of this amazing plot to blow up multiple planes - which , rather extraordinarily , had not turned up in a year of surveillance .
Of course , the interrogators of the Pakistani dictator have their ways of making people sing like canaries .
As I witnessed in Uzbekistan , you can get the most extraordinary information this way .
Trouble is it always tends to give the interrogators all they might want , and more , in a desperate effort to stop or avert torture .
What it does n't give is the truth . "
Murray describes the alert as " more propaganda than plot , " and points out that of all the Muslim terror suspects who have been charged , 80 % have been acquitted and only 2 % have ever been convicted on offenses related to terrorism .
Meanwhile , Delhi police in India claim they have concrete evidence that proves collusion between Pakistani intelligence service ISI and the terror group Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) in carrying out militant attacks in India .
One of the alleged mastermind 's of the liquid bomb plot , Rashid Rauf , is a member of Lashkar - e - Taiba .
The ISI is a CIA front and the CIA have privately ignored their control of terror groups while publicly lauding Pakistan 's status as an ally in the war on terror .
On Monday night it emerged that elements of MI5 wanted the liquid bomb plot to proceed and make the arrests only after the attack had taken place - sacrificing an estimated 3,000 lives and ensuring Britain experienced its own 9/11 .
Why the U.S. Loses ‘ Small Wars ’
Mr. Kahaner is the author of AK - 47 : The Weapon that Changed the Face of War , Wiley & Sons , November , 2006 .
Click here for his website .
If history is any gauge , the US will lose the current conflict in Iraq .
Since the end of World War II , major US use of force against substantially weaker enemies – Vietnam , Lebanon , Somalia , for example – have ended poorly .
The last remaining superpower is not alone in this phenomenon of strong armies losing to lesser foes : the American colonists beat the British , the Vietnamese forced France to leave Indochina and Afghanistan ’s Mujahadeen drove the Soviets from their country .
Why do powerful armies lose against decidedly weaker enemies , and what does it say about the US involvement in Iraq ?
The answer lies in the study of “ small wars . ”
At its simplest , a small war is one in which the relationship between the combatants is decidedly unbalanced .
One side is not only militarily superior in size but its weapons are state of the art .
Some call this Asymmetric Warfare or Fourth Generation Warfare , or the more familiar guerrilla warfare , from the Spanish for ‘ small war . ’
While the larger force relies on high - tech weaponry and sophisticated air power , contemporary small forces use simple , durable and easy - to - use and obtain weapons , mainly the venerable AK - 47 rifle backed up by Rocket Propelled Grenades ( RPGs ) and Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) .
Despite reports of dramatic explosions , the ubiquitous and cheap AK - 47 still kills more people in Iraq than any other weapon .
While trying to understand how to win in Iraq , US military scholars are turning to the classics , and one of the hottest books making the rounds is , surprisingly , over a century old .
Small Wars was written in 1896 by C.E. Callwell , a colonel in the British army , for British officers posted to Africa and India .
It draws on his own experience in the Second Afghan and Boer Wars and claims that a powerful force can easily lose , if it does n’t fully understand the enemy , fails to describe clear objectives or , worst of all , pursues military objectives that do not contribute to the conflict 's political goal .
He notes that the primary object in a small war is to force insurgents to fight on the regular force ’s terms by drawing them into conflicts in which their superior firepower and discipline could prevail .
Unfortunately , the history of small wars has shown that insurgents play hit and run – striking boldy and then retreating quickly , and rarely engaging the larger force head on .
The other , and much bigger obstacle to winning small wars , brings a moral dilemma .
According to Callwell , to win small wars , mere victory is n’t enough , the enemy must be thoroughly and utterly destroyed to the last man , woman , and child – which means enormous civilian casualties .
For citizens of most modern democracies , this is an unacceptable stance .
The level of violence and barbarism it would take to beat an insurgent force -- torture , wholesale executions , leveling of towns -- is a place where most democracies refuse to go .
This keeps victory out of reach .
Small wars are also lost because of the larger army ’s lack of national commitment which ends in inadequate or misspent funds and deployment of too few troops .
For insurgents fighting for their own soil , the commitment is 100 percent .
If they lose the war they lose everything .
Without ‘ skin in the game ’ national commitment by the larger force ’s country usually wanes .
If Callwell got military scholars to think more clearly about small wars , a group of Marine Corps officers in the 1930s took it to the next level with production of the Small Wars Manual based on US experiences in Haiti , the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua .
While building on Callwell ’s work , this landmark book published in 1940 , points to what some say is one of the most important aspects of winning small wars - understanding the role of indigenous religion , ideology and tribal relationships .
The manual not only talks about the military aspects of winning small wars – and yes , they can be brutal - but of more importance is a deep understanding of a society ’s language , culture , religion , history , economic structures and mores .
The manual is a hot seller from a much - clicked website , The Small Wars Center of Excellence , run by the Marine Corps , which advocates the use of simpler weapons and more complex soldiers in small wars – the opposite of current conventional wisdom .
This is not the only take - away message from the manual , but it is a vital one .
Unfortunately the Department of Defense ’s upper echelon are heading in the wrong direction .
The proposed $ 200 billion Future Combat Systems is a mélange of expensive and complex high tech weapons that will be less effective in winning future small wars than thousands more soldiers with language skills , armed with durable rifles , who understand history , foreign culture , religion local customs and guerilla warfare .
The soldiers in Iraq understand this .
Now it ’s time for Pentagon planners to read and heed the classics .
It ’s not too late to win the ‘ small war ’ in Iraq , but the lessons of history must not be ignored .

In the simplest of terms " small wars " pit the super strong to the , relaively , weak as both defined and derermined by conventional and hence economic / political armament / power .
A review of all recent , and older than recent , " small wars " will show the all too obvious facts of the matter that :
A :
- The big party is Allways the party that starts the war with an offensive effort .
- The small party never starts a " small war " .
It could start an insurection against the big party , or its allies and representatives , but that would not be a " war " but a " revolution " .
The small party war effort would invariably be , in the srategic sense , a DEFENSIVE effort .
B :
- The small party was NOT a threat to the big party .
- The big party actually constituted a threat to the small pary .
C :
- The big party , by engaging in a small war , WAS NOT in a state of self defense or of warding off a potential threat that could present a serious threat to its national security or fundamental interests .
- The small party actually WAS in a state of self defense or of warding off a grave threat to its national security and / or fundamental interests .
D :
- The big party 's army , usually a professional army , fought on its behalf with luke warm , or no , public support for the war .
- The small party 's whole nation / community , represented by a voluntary army , fought directly and indirectly , with enthusiasm and conviction the big party .
E :
- The war ended for the big party without a clear military victory but without any serious long term disruption to its basic constituents ie its infrastructure , industrial base etc or grave human losses .
- The war ended for the small party with a clear , definite , military victory but with very serious damage to its basic constituents and very grave human losses .
F :
- The war ended with the big party DEPARTING and giving up on its real , declared and undeclared , objectives in launching the war in the first place .
- The war ended with the small pary REMAINING where it was at the outset of the war and by frustrating the objectives of the Big party .
Are these not the major traits of an attempted imperialist conquest by the big party and of its repulsion by the native , indigrnous , resistance of the small party ??
John Edward Philips - 5/12/2007 Wow .
1 . What makes us the good guys if we act like the bad guys ?
2 . It 's not just morally reprehensible it's bad policy " for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner . "
John Edward Philips - 5/12/2007 is neither the crime itself nor the coverup , but the exposure .
I 'm stunned .
Chuck Andrew Vanasse - 1/13/2007
I agree with the article .
The new commander in Iraq , General David Patreaus , believes in the " small wars " thesis , too .
He 's just written a brilliant manual on how to fight a counterinsurgencey .
My views are evolving .
I read an article in the Wallstreet Journal from last week .
I found the fact that we are fighting all sides and yet have allies on all sides - except among Al Qaeda - that the situation can be flipped to our advantage and I think there may be an effective way to fight this war .
Here it is in a nutshell ...
1. Permit the civil war - Like the Iran - Iraq war of the 80s - let the Shiites and Sunnis fight their civil war - Let America even " facilitate it " ( in an American way ) - Help each side really hurt the other side 's more monstrous incarnation .
2. Political Judo -
Help the civil war happen in a positive way .
The U.S. should act as a referee as America merely fights " contextually " on and for both sides by minimizing , as best we can , both sides ability to ethnically cleanse before the demographics can vacate their homes .
Keep the Turks , Jordanians , and Syrians out ... Vis.
Help the Shiites destroy the Sunni nationalists , Baathists and Wahhabi / Al Qaeda Sunni terrorists .
Help the Suunis go after the Iranian sponsored Shiites - Sadr and Iraqi political - religious fascists .
Civilians will naturally suffer ; encourage both sides that when they have had enough we would be happy to help them but only when their hatred has been notably exhausted .
3. Energy as primary deliverable - Manage the flow of oil through the gulf - priority on keeping oil lanes open .
Use troops to protect oil assets in Iraq .
Let the Iraqis generate cash to fund their civil war and America will charge for being the referee .
Let their oil fund our presence and value add to the siutation .
4. Neutralize Iran - Look for the next excuse for going after Iran and when that act of war ( IEDs with Iranian fingerprints ) is next identified start hitting Iran 's military infrastructure - use the U.S. Navy and Airforce ... leading eventually to the destruction of their nuclear capabilities .
5. Leader -
As soon as a despot arises in Iraq that will commit to ( 1 ) staying away from WMD ( trust but verify - or rather just verify ) and ( 2 ) not interfer in America 's energy interests ( no Kuwait invasion or Kurdish land grab ) -
We support the thug ... I mean , we support that leader .
Chuck - That Kansas Guy .
Howard C Berkowitz - 12/8/2006
I would agree that rational argument will not work with present Jihadists .
My point in identifying alternative within Islam is to work strategically in strengthening ideas that may reduce the future supply of those causing problems .
There are times and targets that can only be solved with superior firepower .
There are others that are a longer - term prospect .
I hope it is n't too tangential , but the long - term problem does include such things as better language and area studies instruction in the US .
While it 's something of a tempest in a teapot when it comes to having JROTC in high schools , I 'd far rather see the same budget go to " hard " language instruction .
N. Friedman - 12/5/2006
Howard ,
I certainly agree that there are Muslims who have no interest in fighting anyone .
And , I have no problem being supportive of people who reject Jihad or want to treat the Prophet 's injunction to make the entire world into the House of Islam as being something postponed into a millennial project .
My view , nonetheless , differs radically from yours .
My contention is that religion is among history 's most significant forces - usually an irrational force as seen by those not party to the faith .
I have no expectation - although obviously I would prefer if it could be achieved - of convincing people who adopt a religious cause to change that cause and I have no expectation of convincing other members of the faith to do it for me , especially when the position taken by the objectionable group is legitimate in that religion 's tradition - something that you would have to concede if you say that it is an accepted strain of Islamic thought .
As I see it , whether or not there may or may not be peaceful strains of Islam is largely irrelevant .
What matters is that the strain that advocates war is perceived to be legitimate , which it is , and has a large number of followers - with those taking the opposite point of view considered the enemy based on the takfir argument that traces its origins at least to the Kharajites .
You will note that thus far , there has been basically an absence of Muslim theological opposition in the Muslim regions to the effect that Jihad is illegitimate or that the spread of Islam ought be postponed to some distant date - akin to " Next year in Jerusalem , " as Jews used to say in a non-political manner .
[ Note : this is not to suggest that no one objects to the tactics of the Jihadists but , rather that opposition to the Jihadists ' basic goals is hard to find and is certainly not sustain or substantial . ]
I would contrast my point with the position adopted by many Sunni theological scholars with respect to the coming of a Mahdi .
While numerous Sunnis have claimed to be the Mahdi ( or have been proclaimed the Mahdi by followers ) , there has pretty much always been sharp theological attacks by Sunnis against the notion of any Mahdi .
Which is to say , there is a substantial counterargument that might be raised by any Muslim who opposes anyone claiming to be a Mahdi .
That , unfortunately , cannot be said about a Muslim who advocates Jihad as a war of conquest .
For example , when there was an alleged Mahdi in Saudi Arabia ( i.e. in connection with the capture , back in 1979 , of the Grand Mosque ) , sharp theological arguments opposed to Mahdism were presented by clerics and in newspapers .
See the discussion on this point in Timothy Furnish 's book Holiest Wars .
By contrast , no sustained theological argument has been raised in opposition to the Jihadists .
The reason why , frankly , is that the position taken by the Jihadists is entirely legitimate in the Islamic tradition while the view that Jihad for conquest has no place has no strong tradition .
As a result , it is rather difficult to argue against someone who accepts Jihadism .
In fact , it is a fruitless endeavor well worth trying but almost surely destined to fail .
Again : we are dealing with religion .
Those who might prefer tolerance towards others , if they challenge the Jihadists , become enemies and targets of the Jihadists .
They are , in Western parlance , excommunicated and in essence apostates who deserve to be killed , by the reckoning of the Jihadists .
And , the argument favoring Jihad is sufficiently strong that I do not imagine Jihadists succumbing to rational argument - although , I favor anything that works so if you can make it work , go for it .
Howard C Berkowitz - 12/5/2006 May
I propose refocus from an area where we , at best , can agree to disagree ?
I suggest that if one postulates that the majority of Muslims are threats , rigid containment is perhaps the most ethical of bad alternatives .
If , however , there are more tolerant subgroups , and these , as I contend , are not an insignificant number ( especially outside the Middle East ) , there is a potential benefit to engaging and encouraging them .
From my direct experience , that does characterize a fair number of Muslims from subsaharan Africa , an area where decisions are still being made .
Yehudi Amitz - 12/3/2006
Muslims should be under the same interrogation and detention rules as used in the USA if they agree with the rules and sanction them officially and in the Muslim world that means mainly fatwas .
Otherwise they should be under the rules used in their own countries , because no matter what we do they 'll follow the local rules anyway .
USA has the highest prison population rate in the world ( not in the Western world ) .
For an American being misinformed is quite normal , but you say you live in Europe .
The article in the London Times , I mentioned , was about 10 years old .
Today the UK prison population is about 80000 and the US prison population about doubled ( since 1995 ) , so if we do the population related adjustment the US prison population would be 400000 but it is about 2.2 million .
I guess China may have a higher absolute number of people in prison but USA has the highest prison population related to its population .
I consider gulag any imprisonment for ideological reasons and " tough on crime " , " the drug laws " , " three times and you are out " ( there are more ) are pure ideological reasons to put someone in prison .
The 1.8 million difference is the result of ideology , communist ideology in the Soviet Union being replaced by populist ideology in the USA and we see that both did n't / do n't work .
I am not ready to relinquish my right to read or not read anything I want , to view or not view any caricature I want , to listen or not listen any speech I want or generally speaking to use or not use any communication channel available to me .
About the Native Americans in my understanding a lot of them died of small pox and other diseases .
For me the " American empire " is USA itself , at least beginning in the 1840s with the " manifest destiny " .
If you have time to watch the link I posted below , where judge / law professor Richard Posner , you will see that FBI and criminal prosecution is n't the best way to fight terrorism .
As a general idea I am not for " an eye for an eye " policy but for " keep always your eyes open and punch the enemy in the eyes if necessary "
The Golden Rule of Mosses used by Joshua of Nazareth in the sermon on the mount is a very fine principle but if the other side does n't follow it I may not be alive to convince him about how nice it is .
N. Friedman - 12/3/2006 CORRECTION :
remove the question mark from the sentence that reads :
" The pertinent logic expression applicable to your argument is exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis "
N. Friedman - 12/3/2006 Howard ,
You write : " Depends what you mean by voting .
Ironically , the PA elections probably were more fair than those in Egypt , if for no other reason than no PA faction was able to control the elections .
Modern Egypt has not yet had free and fair elections , compared with those Maghreb states that have been independently judged to have open multiparty elections . "
I do not take any of these elections to be free by Western standards .
And , I include the PA elections .
Elections in that part of the world fit the pattern of consensus coercion events , which , in turn , is a product of a society defined primarily by religious conceptions .
You write : " Revivalism that has swept " the Muslim regions ? "
Indonesia is not Islamist , although it has the largest Muslim population of any state .
I 've mentioned Maghreb voting .
Turkey is a special case , in that the Army acts as a guarantor of secularism . "
Fair enough with respect to Indonesia .
And , it does have a large Muslim population , as you say .
I had in mind places like Egypt , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Pakistan , Afghanistan , etc. , etc .
You write : " Is Lebanon a " Muslim region " ?
Kuwait has an increasingly open political process ; why , then , are women taking an increasing role ? "
Lebanon 's modern origins relate to protecting the Maronite Christians .
However , its Muslim population has grown dramatically .
At this point , it is unclear whether it can be called a Muslim land although , no doubt , factions within the Muslim population would prefer it to be part of the House of Islam .
You write : Not necessarily .
I have not noted the governments of Syria , Egypt or Saudi Arabia being terribly concerned with the wishes of the street .
I do n't agree there has been a " clear trend " to Islamicize , but I do n't necessarily understand what you mean by " the region " .
Arab ?
Middle Eastern including what -- Persian , Turkic , Maronite , Druze ?
Central Asian ?
Maghreb ?
In Egypt , Islam has been made , as of late , the sole basis on which legislation may be made .
In Saudi Arabia , that has always been the case .
In Iran , that is now the case .
In Pakistan , such is also the case .
That will certainly be the case in whatever government arises in Iraq - at least in the Shi'a and Sunni portions .
Etc. , etc. Syria remains somewhat more secular although that most likely is a product of the waning Ba'athist movement and the fact that the ruler is neither Shi'a nor Sunni and thus protects his rule by suppressing such movements .
You write : I 'm willing to go with one of many .
Since disproof can be no more than one example , I suggest that such evidence lies in the rejection of some of the more extreme forms of the lesser jihad , such as Qutbism , or the substitution of lesser jihad for the Haj in al - Turabi 's version of Mahdist thought .
Your view appears to be that because some Islamic scholars reject the mainstream view , such fact shows that such aberrant positions were or are part of the mainstream view .
I propose two points in response .
ONE : your position is not logical if the intent is to show that such exceptional views are part of the mainstream ; and TWO your argument proves my point .
Consider this analogy to understand my first point .
There were Jewish scholars pre-20th Century who rejected aspects of legalism ( e.g. the Hasidim ) but , beyond all doubt , the mainstream view at that time was legalism , not the Hasidic view .
I trust you know this to be the case .
Which is to say , the fact that there are exceptions does not disprove the existence of a mainstream view .
I might also add : the Hasidim were and are a much , much larger movement than the few exceptions you assert yet they were certainly not the mainstream .
The pertinent logic expression applicable to your argument is exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis ?
That is , more or less , the exception proves the rule .
I am referring to the mainstream , not an unanimous view .
So , the expression is exactly applicable .
I was referring to communal activity to spread the faith and , if necessary , by violence .
Such is the mainstream view in the Muslim regions and always has been .
That is true whether or not one treats Jihad as a substitute for the Hajj .
That is true whatever the view taken by Qutb .
Again , the mainstream is not any less a mainstream due to the existence of exceptions .
That is a matter of simple logic .
And , by extension , if there is a position held by a small group , then such position is not part of the mainstream .
Howard C Berkowitz - 12/3/2006
You observe , " On the other hand , the polling is rather consistent with how people in that part of the world actually vote .
Such is clearly the case in Egypt as well as in the PA . "
Depends what you mean by voting .
Ironically , the PA elections probably were more fair than those in Egypt , if for no other reason than no PA faction was able to control the elections .
Modern Egypt has not yet had free and fair elections , compared with those Maghreb states that have been independently judged to have open multiparty elections .
" And , it is certainly consistent with religious revivalism which has swept the Muslim regions .
If people vote for Islamist parties , would they not also favor the program espoused by such parties ? "
Revivalism that has swept " the Muslim regions ? "
Indonesia is not Islamist , although it has the largest Muslim population of any state .
I 've mentioned Maghreb voting .
Turkey is a special case , in that the Army acts as a guarantor of secularism .
Is Lebanon a " Muslim region " ?
Kuwait has an increasingly open political process ; why , then , are women taking an increasing role ?
" And , is it not the case that the understanding the rulers of the various Muslim countries have taken from the " street " is that people want Islamic law ? "
Not necessarily .
I have not noted the governments of Syria , Egypt or Saudi Arabia being terribly concerned with the wishes of the street .
I do n't agree there has been a " clear trend " to Islamicize , but I do n't necessarily understand what you mean by " the region " .
Arab ?
Middle Eastern including what -- Persian , Turkic , Maronite , Druze ?
Central Asian ?
Maghreb ?
" I am thus ask that you provide evidence showing that Khaldun , Ignaz Goldhizer , Avicenna , al - Ghazali and Bernard Lewis ' understand of the mainstream view is wrong such that the pro-Jihad strain of thought is one among many mainstream views held by the bulk of Muslim scholars . "
I 'm willing to go with one of many .
Since disproof can be no more than one example , I suggest that such evidence lies in the rejection of some of the more extreme forms of the lesser jihad , such as Qutbism , or the substitution of lesser jihad for the Haj in al - Turabi 's version of Mahdist thought .

" No innocent man / woman should be adversely interrogated by the police or punished in any way "
I am glad to see this from you , but it does not fit well with your statement regarding Daniel Perl .
Would you care to disavow the former statement ?
" ... the most crowded in the world prison system ... "
Ammend this to the most crowded in the Western world and I would agree .
" ...( the American gulag ) ... "
With all of its faults , the American prison system is not near the level of the gulags .
This is more than a little bit of hyperbole , unless you have a different and broader definition of gulag , as you seem to for genocide .
" ... is full of innocent people with quite a few of them six feet under . "
I am unsure of what fraction are innocent of the crime that they are doing time for , but quite a few are imprisoned for laws that should not be on the books .
" The way Muslims relate to moral or ethics is not guided by international treaties but by religion and fatwas .
When I 'll see enough fatwas calling for humane treatment of non-Muslims in Muslim custody I 'll be able to answer your question . "
The issue here is our behavior over which we have control , not theirs over which we do not .
" Yes , we have moral / ethical obligations but the most important of them is preserving the freedoms and liberties of all the people who adhere to our moral / ethic codes . "
How does inhumane treatment of prisoners preserve our freedoms or liberties ?
" As ' seed for thought ' I 'll give you some other brainwashing sentences floating around in the USA : ' the best health care in the world ' ( very true if one has the money ) , "
Agreed .
I am currently paying about 1 / 4 the rate for the same level of care I received in the US .
" no genocides "
other than the Native Americans .
" no American empire "
carefull or Friedman will label you an anti-Imperialist .
" ' Do unto others as you would have them do unto you ' is a very nice principle but only if the ' others ' follow it . "
It is a fine principle regardless of who follows it .
BTW
All moral outrage is selective , yours , mine , everybody's .
Yehudi Amitz - 12/3/2006
No innocent man / woman should be adversely interrogated by the police or punished in any way but under the brainwashing sentence " the system works " the most crowded in the world prison system ( the American gulag ) is full of innocent people with quite a few of them six feet under .
A few years ago I 've read in the London Times an article saying that here are too many inmates in the UK prison system .
The number was about 60000 ( sixty thousands ) .
Considering the populations of USA and UK about 300000 ( three hundred thousands ) inmates in the USA would be too many but as we all know there are more 2.2 million prison inmates in the USA .
The system does n't work so let begin at home why bother about Muslims ?!
The Muslim world is mainly a patriarchal society where between religion and law , religion prevails .
The way Muslims relate to moral or ethics is not guided by international treaties but by religion and fatwas .
When I 'll see enough fatwas calling for humane treatment of non-Muslims in Muslim custody I 'll be able to answer your question .
Yes , we have moral / ethical obligations but the most important of them is preserving the freedoms and liberties of all the people who adhere to our moral / ethic codes .
As " seed for thought " I 'll give you some other brainwashing sentences floating around in the USA : " the best health care in the world " ( very true if one has the money ) , " no genocides " , " no American empire " and more ...
Sit on them and , maybe , your ethical code will not be guided by selective " moral outrage " .
" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you " is a very nice principle but only if the " others " follow it .

john crocker - 12/3/2006
What of the people we have in custody that are not guilty ?
Should all Muslims be tortured because some Muslims torture others ?
Do you really think that we have no moral or ethical obligations beyond those adhered to by the least moral / ethical of our enemies as your statement about Daniel Pearl would indicate ?
Stephen Dintino - 12/2/2006 Hi Arnold .
Thank you for your excellent reply .
Relative to the freedom and choice issue , because of the Islamic religious political state of control manifested in most Islamic countries , it is difficult to determine if any good act is freely or consciously performed .
I do n't judge any person , including terrorists .
But people who subscribe to and conduct terrorist acts are stopped only through physical intervention .
Because they believe that they are doing something good by indiscriminately killing non-muslims , and because they have the desire and the means ( horrific terrorist acts ) to control the world through Islam , other political options will not stop the acts of terrorism .
I strongly agree with what you wrote in your last sentence .
Again , thank you for your response .
Respectfully ,
Steve
Yehudi Amitz - 12/2/2006 Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the erasing of Japanese cities through conventional bombing ( mostly wood structures ) was justifiable genocide .
It saved hundreds of thousands of American lives that could have been lost in landing and conquering cities .
The same about erasing German cities for no military reasons .
The ultimate benefit was transforming Germany and Japan from irrational and violent dictatorships into civilized democratic societies .
Hiroshima , Nagasaki and Dresden were deliberate destruction of a racial and / or cultural group .
You did n't say anything about the ethnic cleansing of Germans and Jews in the post WWII Europe ?!
john crocker - 12/2/2006
I admit I did engage in a couple of ad hominem attacks in response to being attacked by you .
In the comment I am now responding to you limited yourself to two ad hominem attacks , the same number I delivered in the previous comment .
That is a bit of progress towards a more rational debate .
Let us see if we can eliminate them altogether in future interactions .
" And of course another of your ad hominem , mixing me with holocaust deniers for calling the beast by its real name . "
Sorry if this strikes you as ad hominem , but they are the only other people on this site I have seen make this argument .
For the record I do n't think you have much else in common with them other than this particular argument .
In order for what the allies did to the Japanese and Germans to be categorized as genocide it must be a " deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial , political , or cultural group . "
Do you think that the allies were attempting to deliberately and systematically destroy the Germans and / or the Japanese ?
" On the other hand , I believe that killing populations supportive of criminal regimes who perform genocide is justifiable . "
Do you believe that genocide of these populations is justifiable ?
I agree that what Stalin did was the deliberate and systematic destruction of a political group and so should be categorized as a genocide .
" As I see it , intentionally killing great numbers of unarmed people is genocide and the action is sometime justifiable from a military point of view .
When the action is done only for ideological reasons it can't be justified . "
Your definition of genocide differs substantially from Webster 's and Oxford's .
Military actions are inextricably tied to the ideological reasons for being engaged in war so all genocide is tied to ideology .
The distinction you seem to make is that if it is purely ideological , ie there is no military benefit , then it is not justified .
How much military benefit must there be for genocide to be justified ?
Yehudi Amitz - 12/2/2006 Sean ,
I understood very well Crocker 's question and a gave him my answer and also a longer analysis about what , I think , genocide is .
Who is talking about exterminating Muslims the the last man , woman and child ?
In the same time there is no reason to shed crocodile tears for bombing Fallujah or as many cities that support terrorism .
I do n't really care about the real intentions of the prophet Muhammad , though he used violence , but when Muslims kill each other and non-Muslims for caricatures published in Denmark or because of a talk given by the Pope I can only qualify them as irrational and violent .
Crocker 's ilk are bigots exercising selective " moral outrage " .
The position of these bigots towards Jews and Israel is the main ideological umbilical cord between the extreme right and extreme left , in our days ( see the love story between David Duke and Cindy Sheehan ) .
Yehudi Amitz - 12/2/2006
That 's another classic accuse while doing the same , but everyone does it , so be my guest , do your whining !
The allies , during WWII , did exactly what had to be done but in more than a few places killed civilians for no real military reason other than putting civilian population in a state of fear ( of course the living ones ) .
The burning of Japanese cities with incendiary bombs had no military purpose other than inducing fear .
The same about erasing Dresden .
And of course another of your ad hominem , mixing me with holocaust deniers for calling the beast by its real name .
WWI was an extended and bloody war , with very little intended targeting of civilians , the civilians died during the first world war mostly of disease and hunger .
During the second world war most of the disease and hunger was in concentration camps .
Bombing industry and infrastructure is more than justified militarily but extensively bombing private homes without the intention to conquer the bombed cities is a genocidal endeavor .
If not genocide how would you call it ?
On the other hand , I believe that killing populations supportive of criminal regimes who perform genocide is justifiable .
By the way what Stalin did in Ukraine in the 1930s ( letting peasants to die of hunger ) and the millions of deaths in the gulag was also genocide .
As I see it , intentionally killing great numbers of unarmed people is genocide and the action is sometime justifiable from a military point of view .
When the action is done only for ideological reasons it can't be justified .
Even if you get angry , your selective moral outrage is bigotry .
john crocker - 12/2/2006
The body of your comment consists of little other than an extended ad hominem attack .
I have previously discussed this tactic with you and you ended up looking like a paranoid loon .
Is that really where you want this to go ?
If you really want to accuse the allies of genocide against the Germans and Japanese during WWII you will find no allies in that , other than the few holocaust deniers that also comment here .
What definition of genocide are you using ?
How does your definition distinguish between genocide and any extended and bloody war ?
Was the American Civil War attempted genocide ?
By which side ?
Both ?
How about WWI ?
What about Vietnam ?
Do you disapprove of the allied actions against the Germans and Japanese that you believe to be attempted genocide ?
If not , what do you think they should have done ?
If so , under what circumstances do you approve of genocide ?
Please exclude the paranoid everyone who disagrees with me is a Jew hating bigot rant from your response .
Yehudi Amitz - 12/1/2006
I do n't cry for the Germans and Japanese killed during WWII but why do n't call the crime by its real name ?
What 's the problem , your ilk of bigots can only selectively count ?
Maybe that 's the reality , your kind of bigots counted to 30 in Jenin and begun to shout " genocide " or pretended not to see fresh cadavers brought by a mortician in Qana ( Lebanon ) .
Show me one place where left wing , Jew hating , bigots protested the disappearance of Israeli prisoners in Arab hands ?!
At least 5 million Germans were ethnically cleansed in the post WWII Europe but you and your bigots forgetting the ethnic cleansing of the Jews by Europeans only remember Palestinian rights .
Your kind of bigots have a very selective kind of morality .
N. Friedman - 12/1/2006 Howard ,
As for polling , note that I said " if we believe the polling " - and , if you read my other comments , you will see that I have been rather critical of polling in the Muslim regions , most recently polling that showed FATAH winning a substantial victory ( which , as you know , did not occur ) and polling showing that a reformer might win the Iranian election ( which also did not materialize ) but also , more generally , polling in societies where public consensus tends to stifle critical debate -.
So , I think you are on to something .
On the other hand , the polling is rather consistent with how people in that part of the world actually vote .
Such is clearly the case in Egypt as well as in the PA .
And , it is certainly consistent with religious revivalism which has swept the Muslim regions .
If people vote for Islamist parties , would they not also favor the program espoused by such parties ?
And , is it not the case that the understanding the rulers of the various Muslim countries have taken from the " street " is that people want Islamic law ?
In this regard , I note that there has been a clear trend across that region to make Islam a basis and , as of late , " the " basis for any laws .
How is the current situation any different - except by degree and the fact that , unlike in the past , there had been , for some time , an absence of Shari'a - from the idea behind customary law that existed in the Ottoman Empire which , in effect , developed a common law from the Shari'a ?
As for having a discussion , I certainly take your ideas seriously .
On the other hand , the view that the dominant view over the ages among Muslims has not been consistent with the general formula noted by Ibn Khaldun is difficult to argue factually .
I certainly agree that there have been different views but even more or less apologetic writers such as Reza Aslan concede the classical , mainstream view involves Jihad to extend Islam 's rule .
I am thus ask that you provide evidence showing that Khaldun , Ignaz Goldhizer , Avicenna , al - Ghazali and Bernard Lewis ' understand of the mainstream view is wrong such that the pro-Jihad strain of thought is one among many mainstream views held by the bulk of Muslim scholars .
My contention is that the pro-Jihad view is the mainstream view ( e.g. the view taught at al - Azhar University to this day ) although there have been , as in all religions , those who reject the mainstream position .
Sean M. Samis - 12/1/2006 Yehudi ;
I believe Crocker 's question was " should we have attempted Genocide of the Germans or Japanese " I think the claim that a genocide was attempted will not survive close scrutiny ; but even if so , SHOULD it have been done ?
I believe the point of the original blog was that extreme violence and force just do n't work in " small " wars .
I believe your moral outrage is real and sincere ; but those facts do n't transform ineffective methods into effective methods .
Unless we are actually prepared to EXTERMINATE Muslims to the last man , woman and child , we have to live with them .
Unless we are prepared to go all the way to the end of genocide , extreme measures will inevitably fail .
I do not accept the various characterizations of Muslims on this thread , presenting them as irredeemably violent or irrational .
I am not Muslim , so I cannot speak for them , but neither can I speak against them .
Islam is not what the Prophet wanted it to be , it is what living Muslims want it to be ; they may justify their choices by reference to the Quran , but scriptural writings are always fluid enough to support whatever a person wants to find support for ; that is the experience of every surviving religion ; no exceptions I am aware of .
I am not sure who qualifies to be in Crocker 's " ilk " ; but I 'm guessing that you cannot establish their indifference to the welfare of Israelis .
Perhaps you have not seen expressions of their outrage , but unless you claim omniscience , I 'm going to say that much transpires in the world you are not aware of .
Better you should have asked how Crocker et al. feels about the problem ; presuming you actually care to risk upsetting your prejudices .

Hey , thanks alot -MM
Here 's my email , if you come across anything else of interest .
I 'm in FP research ( counterterrorism policy specifically ) .
Cyclgrrl@aol.com
Arnold Shcherban - 12/1/2006 Stephen ,
I would never start with lecturing you
that " there are good and bad people " among any nation ; I 'm sorry to say , but pointing out such a deep insight into the nature of Americans cannot be qualified otherwise than an insult to the intelligence of the opponent on HNN boards .
Who do you think you debate against here , complete dopes ?
But let 's get to the more legitimate
content of your objections to my comments .
I do indict the US , not when it does good ( though , I admit that lately
I 'm able to find less and less good things it does ) , but when it does bad
or wrong .
Then you say that this country does good deliberately , because it has " the freedom to choose good " .
Firstly , you forgot to follow up with
the logical case when the America does bad , do n't you ?
( Unless you axiomatize that this country never does bad or wrong ) .
Secondly , the remark I 'm commenting on now has an awful smell of the statement that other nations or governments do n't do good or bad things ' cause they choose to do so .
But this is just a contradiction in terms , not mentioning - to facts .
Then you say that indoctrination that occurs in " Islamic world is not based
on freedom or choice . "
You do n't even notice and , therefore , realize that the above statement of yours actually legally defend the same extremist and terrorists you apparently hate so much .
And finally , your question about the reconciliation of the terrorism is sent to the wrong adress and on the wrong premise , since I 'm atheist , an American , has nothing to do with Mid-East , and as Peter Kropotkin once mentioned : " Personally , I hate these explosions , but I can not stand as a judge to condemn those who are driven to despair . " ( with the significant correction that I do condemn the killings of innocent unarmed civilians even by the folks driven to despair ) .
Howard C Berkowitz - 12/1/2006
" And , I was not being condescending .
I sensed substantial ignorance on your part . "
Oh ?
How is this not condescending , given that you have no idea of my background ?
The only data you have is that some of my ideas differ from yours .
That would seem to suggest that you consider your views on Islam , to use a delightfully mixed metaphor , are ex cathedra and infallible ; any with the temerity to disagree are ignorant and wrong .
As to polling , without extensive methodological data , I do not consider it likely that standard opinion polling is statistically valid in a society that does not assume freedom of expression .
Going back 30 years or so , I did software support of " opinion polls " of villagers in Vietnam , and saw the principal investigator produce ludicrous results .
So , as a general statement , I do not give any credibility to polls of Muslims in nondemocratic societies .
To take your example of " Egypt , the PA and Jordan " , even if the respondents answered honestly to well - designed questions , which indeed might be the case in Jordan , I 'd have to see the statistical methodology by which the results from these three significantly different populations were combined .
I am perfectly willing and eager to have a substantive discussion , but one of the prerequisites to such is that the participants respect one another sufficiently to believe that each may bring something to the table .

I am outraged by the abuse of any prisoner by anyone .
It concerns me particularly when it is perpetrated by my government as I bear some of the responsibility for the actions of my government .
You did not address the issue of the innocent victims in Abu Ghraib .
Not everyone and indeed by many accounts not even the majority of those who were held were guilty of any crime .
Do you really think that we have no moral or ethical obligations beyond those adhered to by the least moral / ethical of our enemies as your statement about Daniel Pearl would indicate ?
If you define genocide as loosely as you must to claim that the Americans engaged in genocide against the Germans and / or Japanese then you have robbed the term of all real meaning .
" Your kind of " morality " and " moral outrage " in the same sentence is against basic grammar in any human language . "
What do you mean by this ?
What happened at Abu Ghraib was worse than your characterization .
Real beatings , a few to the point of death were done by US troops and contractors and sexual assaults were committed by these people as well .
Must an outrage be the worst on earth for it to be an outrage ?
Does no injustice matters as long as you percieve some other injustice to be greater ?
Stephen Dintino - 12/1/2006
You indict the US .
The truth is , there are good and bad people in the US .
But , when an American does something good , it is because the American chooses to do good .
The American has the freedom to choose good .
Serious violent and hateful indoctrinization occurs in the radical Islamic world , which is not based on freedom or choice .
How do you reconcile the terrorists ' violent and indiscriminate acts of blowing themselves up , along with the civilians ( children , women , old people ) around them ?

It was a genocide against German and Japanese civilian population , hundreds of thousands ( maybe millions ) were killed through heavy bombing ( and the nuke ) .
Also very heavy ethnic cleansing was perpetrated against the Germans in Czechoslovakia and East Prussia .
Your selective memory is playing fairy tales on a history site .
The US army forced millions of Russian prisoners of war back into Stalin 's gulag but could n't find room in Europe for the Jews stranded in transit camps .
Your kind of " morality " and " moral outrage " in the same sentence is against basic grammar in any human language .
There is nothing close to " an eye for an eye " there was some discomfort like loud music , sleep deprivation , some sexual innuendo and some real beating for some hardened terrorist criminals done by their own security services .
I am sick and tired by yours and your ilk selective " moral outrage " !

N. Friedman - 12/1/2006 Howard ,
You are free to read what you like .
I asked you what you meant because your words were insufficiently clear .
Now , you reply , " What I stated is that there is a broad Muslim desire to bring non-Muslims into that religion .
The desire for Sha'ria is not a given , although that certainly is the position of a great many Muslims , " which is perfectly clear .
I think you are correct about the above , for what it is worth .
However , the desire to have other people join the faith is , after all , part and parcel of Islamic evangelicalism aka Jihad and dawa .
I am certainly not forcing you to speak .
And , I was not being condescending .
I sensed substantial ignorance on your part .
As for desire for Shari'a , in Egypt , the PA and Jordan , the group desiring Shari 'a law is , if we believe the polling , 65 % .
That figure comes via Martin Kramer .
That suggests that quite a large group has rather traditional Islamic views .
Do you not think so ?
john crocker - 12/1/2006
What of the people we have in custody that are not guilty ?
Should all Muslims be tortured because some Muslims torture others ?
Your position seems to be that we should work on the same moral and ethical level of our enemies in a conflict .
In WWII should the allies have attempted genocide of the Germans ?
Should we not only have imprisoned the Japanese but forced them to work without food until dead ?
Howard C Berkowitz - 12/1/2006
I will turn the tables and ask that you read what I actually wrote ,
" I do not disagree that the idea of inclusion of all within the dar il Islam is theologically desirable "
" What do you mean ?
Are you saying that you would like to live as a non-Muslim in a Muslim country under Islamic rule ?
I really do not follow what you have in mind . "
That is correct .
You do not follow what I have in mind .
I spoke of something theologically desirable through Muslim beliefs .
I am not a Muslim , so where do you get the idea that I want to live under Islamic rule ?
What I stated is that there is a broad Muslim desire to bring non-Muslims into that religion .
The desire for Sha'ria is not a given , although that certainly is the position of a great many Muslims .
Given that you have not offered any particular credentials , but continue to condescend about things such as my " naivete " , no thank you as far as your book recommendations .
I hear you as in belief that you are universally right and no one who does not agree with you could possibly have anything to contribute .
Since I look at this forum as a place for a courteous exchange of views among historians , goodbye .
N. Friedman - 11/30/2006
Howard ,
You write : " In point of fact , no , I do not accept Goldhizer as definitive .
His particular interpretation of jihad is consistent with Mahdist or Qutbist views , among others , but is by no means universal . "
Well , Goldhizer died in 1921 long before Qutb wrote his rants .
Goldhizer 's view has exactly nothing to do with Qutb - if you have actually read Goldhizer .
You might consider examining Goldhizer 's well known book Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law .
As William Montgomery Watt , also considered , until his recent death , rather enamored of Islam , notes in his book Islamic Philosophy and Theology : An Extended Survey , that the breadth of Goldhizer 's scholarship is boundless .
Moreover , Goldhizer considered himself a champion of Islam , having been the first non-Muslim ever to have permitted to study at Al - Azhar .
More than that , he was known to pray with Muslims , notwithstanding the fact that he never converted .
As for Mahdism and Goldhizer , you are mistaken .
Consider that the famed historian and sociologist Ibn Khaldun wrote tracts in opposition to Mahdism ( See Timothy Furnish 's recent book Holiest Wars : Islamic Mahdis , their Jihads and Osama bin Laden ) - and , in fact , Khaldun 's arguments are still asserted today by Sunnis who oppose Mahdism - yet , at the same time , he had this to say about spreading Islam :
In the Muslim community , holy war is a religious duty , because of the universalism of the ( Muslim ) mission and ( the obligation to ) convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force .
Therefore , caliphate and royal authority are united ( in Islam ) , so that the person in charge can devote the available strength to both of them ( religion and politics ) at the same time .
Khaldun , a non-Mahdist of great brilliance and fame - to say the least - , evidently agrees more with Goldhizer than with you .
Bernard Lewis , in his masterful work The Muslim Discovery of Europe , also agrees with the more apologetic Goldhizer .
Explaining the basic Islamic conception , Lewis writes :
" In the Muslim world view the basic division of mankind is into the House of Islam ( Dār al - Islām ) and the House of War ( Dar al - Harb ) .
The one consists of all those countries where the law of Islam prevails , that is to say , broadly , the Muslim Empire ; the latter is the rest of the world .
Just as there is only one God in heaven , so there can be only one sovereign and one law on earth .
Ideally , the House of Islam is conceived as a single community , governed by a single state , headed by a single sovereign .
This state must tolerate and protect those unbelievers who are brought by conquest under its rule , provided , of course , that they are not polytheists but followers of one of the permitted religions .
The logic of Islamic law , however , does not recognized the permanent existence of any other polity outside Islam .
In time , in the Muslim view , all mankind will accept Islam or submit to Islamic rule .
In the meantime , it is a religious duty of Muslims to struggle until this end is accomplished .
The name given by the Muslim jurists to this struggle is jihād , an Arabic word meaning effort or striving .
One who performs this duty is called mujāhid .
The word occurs several times in the Qur'ān in the sense of making war against the unbelievers .
In the early centuries of Islamic expansion , this was its normal meaning .
Between the House of Islam and the House of War there was , according to the sharī ‘a , the Holy Law as formulated by the classical jurists , a state of war religiously and legally obligatory , which could end only with the conversion or subjugation of all mankind .
A treaty of peace between the Muslim state and a non-Muslim state was thus in theory juridically impossible .
The war , which would end only with the universal triumph of Islam , could not be terminated ; it could only be interrupted for reasons of necessity or of expediency by a truce .
Such a truce , according to the jurists , could only be provisional .
It should not exceed ten years and could , at any time , be repudiated unilaterally by the Muslims who , however , were obliged by Muslim law to give the other side due notice before resuming hostilities . "
Lewis goes on to indicate that the Shari'a law 's requirements ( and its attendant theology ) did not always match the reality of what occurred and that other arrangements , supplementing the House of War and House of Islam , such as the House of Covenant , eventually arose .
As for Jihad , Lewis notes that the classical conception came to be seen , for a while , as a more millennial view ( perhaps akin to one - time classical Jewish tradition , pre-Israel , of next year in Jerusalem - with next year being some distant future time ) .
Such view was prevalent during the latter time of the Abbassid dynasty , when Muslims were under threat from all sides so that the notion of spreading the faith was rather unrealistic .
However , the millennial view did not persist long , especially but not only with the rise of the Gazis - known more to history as the Ottoman Turks - who rekindled Jihad to conquer , most specifically , Europe .
In any event , the view regarding the basic theological and legal requirement to spread Islamic rule is still taught in places like al - Azhar .
So , I can not imagine the basis for your opinion .
You will note , further , that Goldhizer does not quite speak about forced conversions of Jews and Christians - only of people who lacked a revealed prophesy .
Interestingly , historian Patricia Crone notes that , notwithstanding the commonly asserted view that Muslims did not force Jews and Christians to convert , the record shows rather plainly that such did sometimes occur .
You may say - which is correct - that Islam has no Pope or the like who states what is and is not Islam but some elements of Islam are rather well established and beyond much question .
In this regard , you might consider that classical Judaism does not have a Pope or the like but during the classical period it would be rather foolish to claim that there Kashrut laws are not part of it .
And , notwithstanding your protest to the contrary , Islam is about as evangelical a faith as has ever existed .
And , its teachings are rather blunt regarding the justification to use force in order to spread Muslim rule from the black to the red .
Note also that Goldhizer did not say that everyone must convert , as your comment suggests .
Nor did he indicate that Jihad has only one meaning .
He was writing about the religious command to spread Muslim rule .
That , frankly , is the Jihad which , to non-Muslims , matters .
You write : " I do not disagree that the idea of inclusion of all within the dar il Islam is theologically desirable "
What do you mean ?
Are you saying that you would like to live as a non-Muslim in a Muslim country under Islamic rule ?
I really do not follow what you have in mind .
So far as understanding Jihad fi sabil Allah ( i.e. Jihad war or , literally , Jihad in the path of Allah ) , I would recommend two books that might cure your naivety .
The first is David Cook 's brilliant Understanding Jihad .
It is a masterful survey of the origins and development of the Jihad war and its ongoing significance .
The second , which is not good history but which , within the book , includes a section that consists of translations of tracts by dozens of famed Islamic scholars on the issue of Jihad - from writers such Avicenna to al - Ghazali to , while probably not as great a thinker , the Ayatollah Khomeini -.
It is called The Legacy of Jihad and it is by a professor of Medicine named Andrew Bostom .
Some of the tracts included in the book have there own surveys of the views of their predecessors .
Now , you are correct that not all Muslims favor war to spread the faith .
But , such is clearly the dominant view over the course of the religion 's history .
I might add , Islam is certainly not alone in holding itself the one true faith that is the property of mankind .
That is also basically the classical Christian view .
Where Christianity differs from Islam , I think , is that the view opposing the use of force to spread Christianity has strong support in the religious writings and in actual practice - most especially after the Crusade period - while , in Islam , the view to spread Muslim rule by force , as David Cook notes , takes up around 20 % of all ahaditha - an astounding amount of religious writing on war - while the Koran itself is rather emphatic of the command to use force generally speaking ( and not merely in connection with a specific circumstance ) and , most especially , during the latter - and , hence , more important , so far as Islamic theology is concerned - period of the Prophet 's life .
And , in practice , the view opposing Jihad as war has not had great significance over the course of Islam 's history .

You yourself cite raids as opposed to actions of a civilization ( i.e. , war ) .
My comment about religion was that Islam is not unique in having branches that support violent conversion .
Under the Caliphate , how is something mainstream that was disapproved ?

James , I do n't know where you live , but here in the States , there have been some peace demonstrations ; there has n't been as many as in past wars because more effective means of mass mobilization and protest are available now .
After all , this is the 21st century now .
Leftists here have not been quiet at all .
They may not be as noisy as some would like -- or in the WAY some would like , but much of the noisy efforts in past crises were counter - productive .
The recent elections here show that the Peace - Movement 's efforts are working better now .
The Press Muzzled ?
One need only browse right - wing sources to hear how the press is beating the drum - beat of bad - news .
The press is doing it 's job , reporting on events .
They must be doing a good job : EVERYONE is pissed at them .
Perhaps anti-war elements are not conducting their campaign the way you want them to , but they are active and increasingly effective .
HOWEVER , whether they are effective or not has little to do with the war 's success ; I sincerely doubt that the Iraqi insurgents look to the American left for motivation .
It also is not for sure that the war is lost ; gone badly yes , but lost ?
Not yet .
But with Bush et al. in charge , the odds of defeat are good ...

Small wars are sold to the ruling elites ( then to the masses ) as cheap with a definable profit .
Iraq - cheap war was sold as a cheap war , paid for by oil and then with cheap oil as the profit .
When those wars end up costly with no forseeable profit , then the masses get nasty and the elites scramble for excuses .
The interesting aspect of the Iraq War , is that peace demostrations have been non existant , the leftists quiet for the most part , and the press muzzled .
Yet the war was lost .
Yehudi Amitz - 11/30/2006 Salman Rushdie published his book in UK and he did n't force any Iranian to read it .
The cartoons in the Danish newspaper were for the eyes of the danish readers of this newspaper and no Muslim was forced to buy it .
The western world can't renounce its freedoms and liberties because some backward people feel offended .
The only rule that applies to media channels of any type , in the free world , is " use it only if you like it " .
The main and most violent attack against our freedom of expression comes in our days from the Islamic world and Muslims living here have the obligation to clearly take sides and condemn the vicious attacks .
Arnold Shcherban - 11/29/2006 is the fact that the US does n't loose
the wars ( the military campaigns ) - it looses peace - cultural , ideological and socio-political transformations in the countries that become the victims of the US agression .
It happens on one major reason that the US mainstream ideologues can never admit , but which is painstakingly clear to the majority in the world : the US does not care and does not support real democracy ( it actually torpedoes it everywhere around the world ) , but just the democracy for the economic minority - the rich and collaborators of US Big Business .
That 's exactly what has been happening all over South - East Asia , Central and Latin America , Africa , and Mid-East .
That 's exactly why this country sponsors and support , exclusively , right dictatorial regimes , right ideological and religious fanatics and terrorism .
The real democracy , i.e. the power of majority for the majority is the scariest monster for the US plutocracy , slightly covered with the fig leaf of religious pseudo - fanaticism .
That 's why the enemies are perpetually needed and created by
this country 's real owners : corporate
business .
N. Friedman - 11/29/2006
Howard ,
It might help if you read more carefully the position I asserted .
The notion that Islam is properly the property of all of mankind that ought be spread , as a communal - and I used the word communal intentionally - activity , is not a recent view .
It is the mainstream view and has been for more than a millennium .
What follows is the formulation as set forth by , among others , famed Islamicist Ignaz Goldhizer ( d. 1921 ) :
In addition to the religious duties imposed upon each individual professing Islam , the collective duty of the " jihad " (= " fighting against infidels " ) is imposed on the community , as represented by the commander of the faithful .
Mohammed claimed for his religion that it was to be the common property of all mankind , just as he himself , who at first appeared as a prophet of the Arabs , ended by proclaiming himself the prophet of a universal religion , the messenger of God to all humanity , or , as tradition has it , " ila al - aḥmar wal - aswad " ( to the red and the black ) .
For this reason unbelief must be fought with the force of weapons , in order that " God 's word may be raised to the highest place . "
Through the refusal to accept Islam , idolaters have forfeited their lives .
Those " who possess Scriptures " ( " ahl al - kitab " ) , in which category are included Jews , Christians , Magians , and Sabians , may be tolerated on their paying tribute ( " jizyah " ) and recognizing the political supremacy of Islam ( sura ix . 29 ) .
The state law of Islam has accordingly divided the world into two categories : the territory of Islam ( " dar al - Islam " ) and the territory of war .
( " dar al - ḥarb " ) , i.e. , territory against which it is the duty of the commander of the faithful ( " amir al - mu' minin " ) to lead the community in the jihad .
Are you really saying that Goldhizer is wrong ?
Note , that he is as close to being an apologist for Islam while being honest as anyone who ever lived .
And , he is surely one of the greatest scholars of Islam who ever lived .
Maybe , you do not believe him .
I , for one , do , having studied Islam 's theology and having found it fascinating .
I might recommend that you pick up a book of the writings of Muslim theologians on Jihad .
If you did , you would not write what you wrote .
As for your comment that bringing religion into this is pointless , my view is that careful description of phenomena is important .
In this case , understanding that we are dealing with people drunk on religion is not just a fact , it is likely the most important fact about the dispute .
Addressing the point you mistakenly associated with my analysis - i.e. Qutbism - , while the view that individual Jihad is contrary to Islam has a theological basis , history tells a very , very different story .
In this regard , you might read Patricia Crone 's book Gods Rule : Government and Islam .
She notes Jihadis living on the border of Islamic territory and conducting regular raids into non-Muslim - most especially Christian ruled - territory .
Such was not limited to a few years but went on over the course of centuries at a time .
Such razzia , in fact , often occurred against the wishes of the Caliph .
Other writers have noted such razzia including , rather regularly , from Andalusia into France .
In my view , the non-Muslim regions , in fact , face people employing tactics rather similar to razzia .
And , the razzia traces all the way back to the time of the Prophet .
Howard C Berkowitz - 11/29/2006
" My point here is to note that this talk of non-monolithic faith serves to avoid facing the elements of Islam that are rather dogmatic and , in fact , pretty monolithic . "
Any arguments suggesting " the Muslims should " fall flat when faced with the very wide range of political opinions and actions belonging to them .
Most discussions of exported terror tend to focus around Qutbist extremists of Wahabbist or Salafi origin ; the " true Salafi " position is frequently argued among believers .
The most effective politicomilitary actions are precisely targeted , in theories from Sun Tzu to John Boyd .
Taking on a religion seems a bit dubious .
Failure to do what the US Army calls psychological preparation of the battlespace , before providing what can be politicized as enemies of the Caliphate and threats to the Holy Places , is , to put it mildly , unwise .
Hand me a sniper rifle and I would n't be unwilling to take down , precisely , a leader of a Qutbist movement to impose Shar'ia on unwilling people , put People of the Book into dhimmitude , and kill pagans .
Actually , I 'd prefer something a little more subtle and deniable than a Barrett M82 .
Taking on an entire religion is rather like trying to teach a pig to sing : it accomplishes nothing but annoying the pig .
Howard C Berkowitz - 11/29/2006 Correct .
There was no real protest against the fatwa against Rushdie .
There was no real protest against Eric Rudolph or Baruch Goldstein .
Given your position that American Muslims should protest anything done by Muslims anywhere , should this not be the case for Christians and Jews ?
Is this merely limited to religion ?
Should all second - generation US citizens of origin in country X continue to protest against actions by the government of X ?
So far , I hear you assuming that Muslims must act differently than virtually any set of actors in the American political scene .
Further , I suggest that your idea that there should be marches on Washington is an increasingly archaic idea for any group .
Martin Luther King did not have access to the communications techniques of today .
Those American Muslims that I know well are n't all that faithful to religious doctrine ; one makes the best glazed ham I 've ever had .
Where I do see faith is in hard work , education , and family -- the classic American road to success .
When they " conspire " , it 's for microinvestment , as probably best demonstrated by Korean - Americans .
N. Friedman - 11/29/2006
Howard ,
You write : " Muslims are no more monolithic than Buddhists "
Is your statement offered as an important observation ?
Is there anything on which Muslims are monolithic ?
Are there any features that distinguish Muslims from non-Muslims ?
Are there any beliefs that are universal to those claiming to be Muslim ?
Here is my suggestion .
While it may be true that Muslims are not monolithic , it is not , as I see it , an important or pertinent observation to the topic at hand .
By analogy : Christians are not monolithic but there are distinguishing beliefs that distinguish Christians from , say , Buddhists .
Hence , there are times when noting that Christians are not monolithic is pertinent and / or important but there are times when the observation is not .
In the case of Muslims , we should presumably limit ourselves to believers , not secret and quasi - secret non-believers or heretics , etc .
Of those believing / devout Muslims , what percentage believes that Islam is the one true religion ?
Of those believing Muslims , what percentage believes it a communal duty to spread Islam to the red and black ( i.e. the Islamic formula meaning , to the entire world ) ?
Of those believers who actually have sufficient education to understand normative Islam , what percentage believes in the above - which is the view taken by the vast majority of Muslim theologians since that view generally crystallized into a dogma during the religion 's first 150 or so years -?
My point here is to note that this talk of non-monolithic faith serves to avoid facing the elements of Islam that are rather dogmatic and , in fact , pretty monolithic .
mark safranski - 11/29/2006 Hi Miriam ,
COIN doctrine is about emphasizing the other 80 % and connecting with the local population , not blowing things up .
General Abizaid is a smart man , the best choice for command in Iraq but he did not oversee a COIN campaign in Iraq but a conventional one directed at insurgents .
Perhaps that was decided over his head .
Perhaps not but in any case , I hope the Army takes that statement of his to heart .

Yehudi Amitz - 11/29/2006
Islam tries to limit western freedom of expression through :
- killing a TV director
- widespread violence because of caricatures published in a newspaper
- killing people and acting in a violent way because the Pope tried to engage a discussion about Islamic violence
I can continue the list but I limit it to the events closer in time .
No real protest against the above events came from important Islamic personalities in the west .
If the American Muslims are real American citizens they have to be very clear about what they think about the First Amendment !
There was no protest coming from American Muslims when the life of Salman Rushdie was in danger because he wrote a book .
Howard C Berkowitz - 11/29/2006
Why do Muslims not march on Washington ?
Perhaps because over the years , the role of any demonstration in Washington has become far less important than direct media coverage , legislation and lobbying .
Perhaps you have missed that American Muslims are first and foremost American citizens , and do not take a great deal of responsibility for actions of their coreligionists elsewhere .
This is not unique to Islam .
Given the history , for example , of Sunni - Shia violence , varied opinions that Mahdists and Qutbists are heretics , and the Muslim - on - Muslim fighting in Darfur , I find the idea of a monolithic Islam rather difficult to justify .
Anecdote is not the singular of data , but I have enough close Muslim colleagues and friends to see a lack of common political belief .
Of course , given that most are West African , politics in that region are more important than the Middle East .
Blaming all Middle Eastern violence on Islam acting out against all else also is a bit naive , when the discussion ignores Arab , Persian , and Turkic nationalism , as well as politics of former Western colonies .

Before all you dudes go off to fight your imaginary battles , clutching make - believe weapons in your hands and salivating at the mouth ( gonna do it right this time , of course ) ... sit back on the couch and put down the remote control ( the thing you were trying to fire ... ) .
Quote from General John Abizaid in his recent address to the Kennedy School of Gov't at Harvard ( it was kickass - find the video on the Kennedy School website 11/17/06 date ) .
" The military comprises 20 % of the actual solution in a situation like Iraq " .
Yeh - that 's a 4 - star ( and head of Centcom for the region ) speaking .
Definitely sounds like that small wars manual is on the same track .

What a chillingly cynical amoral article .
Michael Barnes Thomin - 11/28/2006
And of course as Mr. Thomas mentioned , the French had problems of their own to contend with , although there was considerable effort on their part to gain control over Haiti and squash the revolution .
Michael Barnes Thomin - 11/28/2006
The Haitian Revolution is indeed fascinating , but there are quite a few reasons the Haitian slaves successfully kicked the Europeans out and forged the first ex-slave nation .
Surely , the reasons listed above played a part , but as Laurent Dubois has painstakingly acknowledged in his book Avengers of the New World , the success of the Haitian Revolution can be attributed to several factors .
The Haitian slaves were faced up against the powerful countries of Britain , Spain , and France , yet they prevailed and eventually gained their freedom ( although almost immediately proto - dictatorships were established by the Haitian leaders themselves ) .
Some of the reasons why a “ weak ” nation defeated a “ strong ” nation in the Haitian Revolution are as follows :
1 ) Most of the Africans originally brought over to Saint - Domingue ( Haiti ) originated in the regions of Dahomey , Kongo , and Angola .
Because they originated from areas that were somewhat homogeneous , the Haitian slaves had a similar language , culture , and religion upon their arrival to the French colony of Saint - Domingue .
As a result , Haitian slaves were united on many fronts and Europeans could not adequately wedge them apart and make them fight against each other ( for the most part ) .
Divide and conquer is a great tactic that has worked for the Romans and British , but the Haitians would have no part in it .
2 ) Haitians had a long tradition of resistance , so they were accustomed to fighting Europeans .
Although most resistance in Haiti typically was not violent per se , some in fact were .
Makandel , a runaway slave , for example , poisoned white slave owners in Haiti in an attempt to abolish slavery and came to be a sort of national hero for Haitians .
In addition , maroon communities were regularly in open , armed conflict with plantation society .
The hardships and brutality of conflict seasoned Haitians long before the revolution erupted .
3 ) Many Haitian slaves had prior military experience before the revolution , so the Haitians that fought against the French , Spanish , and British were by no means militarily unproven .
Several Africans who fought in the civil wars in the Kongo were brought over to Haiti , and these “ African veterans ” knew how to use weaponry effectively , were knowledgeable of war strategy , and tactics .
Additionally , many slaves in the revolution fought for the French Colonial Militia , or mareehaussee , and had military experience as well .
Related to this aspect , Haitian slaves who were former overseers , drivers , and on the police force were ideal in leadership and organizational roles .
And slaves themselves were ideal soldiers because they were well disciplined and conditioned to follow orders ( just think of what the 300 disciplined Spartans accomplished on Thermopylae ) .
4 ) Disease largely contributed to the success of the Haitian Revolution , particularly yellow fever .
When French commander Charles Leclerc , for example , sent two regiments of Polish troops to Tiburon over half died from disease alone .
In the first month in his campaign , Leclerc lost 1200 to fever , and in the second month lost 1800 ; Leclerc himself later died of disease .
Hence , unlike the Haitians , Europeans were highly susceptible to catching diseases in the hot climate of Haiti and were utterly ignorant of the knowledge on how to prevent it .
5 ) Toussaint L’Ouverture , as already mentioned by the Mr. Matthewson , was the key to Haitian success because of his leadership and foresight .
As a former driver and spiritual man he wielded experience and respect as a leader .
L’Overture was able to communicate with all types of people in society , and he could be brutal when he had to be ( brutality was a prerequisite for success in this war ; he even had his own nephew Moise executed for encouraging revolts ) .
Through strict labor decrees he rebuilt Haitian economy because he knew Europeans would invade , thus he maintained a strong , capable army .
Moreover , the tactics he employed nicely fitted the conflict he was engaged in .
6 ) The Haitians greatly outnumbered the whites 500,000 to 20,000 , so they had a large pool of people to recruit from .
The principles they fought for aided them as well : the Haitians fought for liberty and quoted from the Rights of Man , whereas European soldiers fought to enslave a people who were basically fighting for what they purported to represent .
In fact , this eventually dismayed many European soldiers , particularly the Polish mercenaries who only joined Bonaparte ’s army in the first place to gain their independence .
Consequently , several Polish soldiers defected and fought on the Haitian side .
The enslaved Haitians fought for clear political and social objectives and their principles upheld morale .
The Europeans , however , were there to satisfy a dictator ’s sweet tooth .
One Polish officer cynically wrote that they were there to “ fight the negroes for their sugar . ”
7 ) The horrible atrocities committed by the French , ironically , assisted the Haitians as well by alienating the population .
Rochambeau ’s brutality in particular ( live burnings , drowning in sacks , crucifixions , and asphyxiating captured civilian and military Haitian with sulphur fumes en masse in ship holds ) disaffected and disgusted steadfast French supporters .
Accordingly , many people of color originally against Toussaint switched sides and joined in the revolution .

Muslims are very monolithic in condoning violence .
They may be afraid to protest as individuals because they may be killed but why not group marches on Washington DC , if there are really moderate Muslim voices ?
Howard C Berkowitz - 11/28/2006
What book did you have in mind , with what goal ?
So far , you have n't described anything except a desire for revenge , as opposed to influencing the behavior of anyone .
Muslims are no more monolithic than Buddhists ; punishing a Theravada is n't likely to change the behavior of Mahayanas not in your hands .
While there is a limited provision for reprisals in the Fourth Geneva Convention , could you point to evidence , in your book , that reprisals have any positive value in a guerilla situation ?
I assume you believe the Germans won in Yugoslavia and the Japanese in Manchuria ?

Thanks for recounting a good example , but guerrilla tactics were nothing new at the time of the Haitian conflict .
Arminius used ambush tactics to annihilate superior Roman forces ( 2 legions , I believe ) at Teutoberger Heide , two millenea ago , which have been much studied since .
Sun
Tsu has whole chapters dedicated to tactics to employ when a given side is smaller and weaker than another .
I believe that the larger reason for Haiti 's success is that France was completely absorbed by two much bigger problems , the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars .
These same distractions are why Napoleon sold Louisiana to us so very cheaply .
Today , by contrast , we lose such small wars for a simpler reason : outright sabotage of the effort by our lefties , following their initial support .

Thanks for the overview .
Years ago I mused on a forum about the Jordan option , but everyone then ... on all sides of the issue ... essentially told me that I 'm nuts .
Maybe so , maybe not totally .
It 's hard to imagine Jordan wanting that hornet 's nest of psychotics in their lap , but having them run around unsupervised in a mockery of a nation - state might be an even less attractive option .
As for last night 's lecture with its surprise ending which did n't match the hour - long analysis , I thought either that I misunderstood Ya'ari , or that he was making an odd joke which did n't translate well into English .
So , I called my friend Rick Kardone of the Canadian Jewish Tribune , whom I spotted in the front row last night , and he too was blown away by Ya'ari 's " prescription . "
He tried to get a clarification , but Ya'ari refused questions and interviews , which is unusual for these kind of events .
In any case , Rick 's article will be appearing a fortnight from now , although it might be a while before they post the issue in the archives ( http://www.bnaibrith.ca/tribune/tribune.htm).
Back to the Kadima , someone remarked that the Yesha folks do n't appear to be too concerned about Olmert 's " convergence " plans , and probably for a good reason .
Any attempt to realize them will blow - up in Olmert 's face and see him turfed - out along with his union rep for a defense minister in matter of months .
My guess is that even he does n't mean it , but hopes to mollify Condoleeza and Bush with their quixotic " nation - building " project .
Yehudi Amitz - 11/28/2006
In my book the old American principle " there is no free lunch " applies here too .
Yehudi Amitz - 11/28/2006
Ya'ari is an expert in Arab affairs , a fluent Arabic speaker and I believe that what he said will be a part of any deal with the Palestinians , if any .
I do n't know if the situation of Kadima is clear when reading Jerusalem Post .
From the Hebrew newspapers , I read , the situation is that Kadima does n't have any grass roots organization , there are no Kadima local organizations at all in Israel .
The small success they had in the last elections was on what remained from the merits of Ariel Sharon .
If this government does n't get a real deal with the Palestinians in up to a year and the Palestinians continue to attack Israel , I believe that early elections will have to be organized in Israel .
Probably Netanyahu will be the next PM and Ehud Barak the next Defense Minister .
Could be the other way around but less likely .
On the Palestinian side the state is n't the only solution , the old Jordanian option is still possible .
I 've read in a Hebrew newspaper that Jordan has already a plan to include Palestinian representatives in the Jordanian parliament .

Thank you , Mr. Amitz , I regret that you 're out of a buck ... not that Mr. Crump could benefit much from your clarifications , seeing how he reduced himself to stealing one of my cheesier lines to our mutual friend , Omar .
If we ever meet , I 'll cover Mr. Crump with one of our dollar coins , the Loonie , as we call it .
Judging by your name , I guess this might interest you , as it concerns a probable countryman of yours .
I just came back from a lecture , here in Toronto , by Ehud Ya'ari of Israel 's Channel 2 and The Jerusalem Report .
Brilliant man , an incisive analyst .
He covered the current political " lay of the land " in the region as few can , took a few mild digs at Mr. Olmert , and all went rather well until literally the last minute of his presentation .
After describing the utter mess among the so - called Palestinians and the replacement of nationalists among them by the Islamist Hamas , he concluded by saying that the train of the bi-national solution is about to leave the station , and Israel must hurry to evacuate the hilltop settlements , move out of the West Bank , hammer out provisional borders and give the Arabs a state before it 's too late .
The prescription did n't match his diagnosis and I had to double - check with my equally surprised neighbour that this is in fact what he said .
The largely Reform crowd gave the chap a standing ovation , of course , since all .
So , what 's going on ?
The OU just received Olmert like a long - lost brother , and the big shots here in the Canadian Jewish community are sponsoring talks by Kadima reps , consuls and embassadors .
They could n't really be planning another bargain basement land give - away for pieces of paper again , could they ?
I mean , not with those flying garbage cans landing in Sderot and the Katyushas in the North right after Gaza .
Someone better tell Caroline Glick to run for prime minister , before it 's Israel 's train that leaves the station .

Germany and Japan after WWII became democracies only after brutal destruction ( atomic destruction in Japan ) of many cities and mass killing of the popular support for the dictatorships in both countries .
The 1938 Munich pact for the appeasement of Germany was an example of temporary truce hailed as " eternal peace " and gave Germany time to became more powerful and harder to defeat .
The Ribbentrop Molotov pact was the other side of the same coin .
On the other hand if given the opportunity , the terrorists of today ( and the supporting states ) will not wait for one moment before they begin to destroy the democracies of the western civilization .

Peter Kovachev - 11/27/2006 ... part of the puzzle why soft , kindly and liberal systems are so historically rare and short - lived .
The best systems and clever tactics in the world are duds without a measure of brutality and the will to badly maul or even destroy an enemy .
The most significant indicator of this slide to a chani of defeats and historical oblivion is reliance on tribute payments ( today under the cover of " international aid " ) and temporary truces , ( hailed by our brave leaders as monumental and eternal " peace agreements " ) .
These work for a while , until the pay - offs and retreats become insupportable .

Intelligence answers the questions that the Leadership asks .
If they ask the wrong questions , or omit the correct questions ( if that 's not redundant ) then Military Intelligence will not provide the information required .
I believe Mr. Kahaner 's point is that our Leaders have not been asking the right questions .
That , of course , is an occupational hazard for those who were Chosen By God to bring Democracy to the World .
When you think your orders come from God , asking questions is not encouraged .

It is very clear that Abu Ghraib was endorsed at the highest political and military levels but a redneck and a dyslexic girl paid the price .
The real worry here is the low quality of the military intelligence people at Abu Ghraib who did n't understand that taking pictures and sending emails about what happened there is a no - no .
I believe that intelligence people should be ivy league educated but in a volunteer army we can't get very smart and educated people in the military intelligence .
Too bad !
During the WWII the letters home were censored for military secrets but today the " intelligence " is n't intelligent enough to understand that for some secret operations should n't be a paper ( electronic , in our days ) trail about .

Doctors warn that any amount of smoking is dangerous
Their work suggests the health impact is stronger for women and that even " light " smokers face similar diseases to heavier smokers , including cancer .
The team tracked the health and death rates of almost 43,000 men and women from the mid 1970s up to 2002 .
Their findings appear in the journal Tobacco Control .
Lung cancer
Compared with those who had never smoked , the men and women who smoked between one and four cigarettes a day were almost three times as likely to die of coronary artery disease .
Among women , smoking one to four cigarettes daily increased the chance of dying from lung cancer almost five times .
Men who smoked this amount were almost three times as likely to be killed by lung cancer .
However , due to the relatively small number of men that this applied to in the study sample , this finding could have been due to chance .
There is no safe level of smoking
Amanda Sandford from ASH
So - called " light " smokers were also found to have a significantly higher risk of dying from any cause - 1.5 times higher generally - than those who had never smoked , when researchers looked at deaths among those studied over the duration of the research .
Death rates from all causes rose as the number of cigarettes smoked every day increased .
Sporadic smoking
The researchers believe their conclusions are accurate , even though they had to estimate the projected impact of smoking one to four cigarettes for five years in those light smokers who had smoked for less time .
This indicated that the risk of death from coronary artery disease for both sexes would have been 7 % higher , and the risk of lung cancer would have been 47 % higher in women .
A significant proportion of the light smokers had also increased their daily consumption over the period of the study .
However , this had not exceeded nine cigarettes a day .
The only way to protect smokers from heart disease , cancer and other killer diseases is to quit completely
A spokesman from the British Medical Association
Author Dr Kjell Bjartveit also pointed out that it was not possible to tell from the findings what impact sporadic smoking - such as a few cigarettes on a Saturday night out - might have on health .
Dr Ken Denson of the Thame Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research Foundation questioned the validity of the figures .
He said other large studies had not found that smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes daily increased the risk of heart disease .
' No safe level '
Amanda Sandford from Action on Smoking and Health said the conclusions were clear .
" This study should dispel the myth once and for all that smoking just a few cigarettes a day wo n't do you any harm .
" Quite simply , there is no safe level of smoking . "
A spokesman from the British Medical Association said : " All smokers are putting their health on the line when they smoke - even if they only define themselves as social smokers .
" The only way to protect smokers from heart disease , cancer and other killer diseases is to quit completely . "
The Department of Health estimates 106,000 people die every year in the UK as a direct result of smoking .
It said quitting was the only way to avoid the serious health risks .
Jean King of Cancer Research UK said : " Although more research is needed , this study suggests that the health implications for ' light smokers ' are much more serious than previously thought .
" This is particularly worrying as a third of smokers in the UK - an estimated 3.7 million people - smoke less than 10 cigarettes a day . "

Artificial Mini-Black Holes
“ According to some theoretical models , tiny black holes could be produced in collisions at the LHC .
They would then very quickly decay into what is known as Hawking radiation ( the tinier the black hole , the faster it evaporates ) which would be detected by experiments . ”
Dangers
“ It is not inconceivable that physics could be dangerous too .
Some experiments are designed to generate conditions more extreme than ever occur naturally .
Nobody then knows exactly what will happen .
Indeed , there would be no point in doing any experiments if their outcomes could be fully predicted in advance .
Some theorists have conjectured that certain types of experiment could conceivably unleash a runaway process that destroyed not just us but Earth itself . ”
“ There have been speculations that future high - energy particle accelerator experiments may cause a breakdown of a metastable vacuum state that our part of the cosmos might be in , converting it into a ‘ true ’ vacuum of lower energy density .
This would result in an expanding bubble of total destruction that would sweep through the galaxy and beyond at the speed of light , tearing all matter apart as it proceeds . ”
The controversial document , produced by the Congregation for Catholic Education and Seminaries , the body overseeing the church 's training of the priesthood , is being scrutinised by Benedict XVI .
It been suggested Rome would publish the instruction earlier this month , but it dropped the plan out of concern that such a move might tarnish his visit to his home city of Cologne last week .
The document expresses the church 's belief that gay men should no longer be allowed to enter seminaries to study for the priesthood .
Currently , as all priests take a vow of celibacy , their sexual orientation has not been considered a pressing concern .
Vatican - watchers believe the Pope harbours doubts about whether the church should publish the document , which has already been the subject of three drafts .
' Inevitably , such a directive will be met with opposition , ' said John Haldane , professor of moral philosophy at the University of St Andrews .
The instruction tries to dampen down the controversy by eschewing a moral line , arguing instead that the presence of homosexuals in seminaries is ' unfair ' to both gay and heterosexual priests by subjecting the former to temptation .
' It will be written in a very pastoral mode , ' Haldane said .
' It will not be an attack on the gay lifestyle .
It will not say " homosexuality is immoral " .
But it will suggest that admitting gay men into the priesthood places a burden both on those who are homosexual and those they are working alongside who are not . '
The instruction was drawn up as part of the Vatican 's response to the sexual abuse scandal that surfaced in the American church three years ago , which has seen hundreds of priests launch lawsuits against superiors whom they accuse of abusing them .
As the former head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith , the Vatican body charged with looking into the abuse claims , Benedict , then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , was made acutely aware of the scale of the problem .
He is thought to have made clearing up the scandal one of the key goals of his papacy .
Next month the Vatican will send investigators to the US to gauge the scale of the scandal .
More than 100 bishops and seminary staff will visit 220 campuses .
They will review documents provided by the schools and seminaries and may interview teachers , students and alumni , then report directly to the Vatican , which could choose to issue the instruction barring homosexuals from entering the priesthood as part of its response .
Studies show that a significant proportion of men who enter seminaries to train for the priesthood are gay .
Any move signalling that homosexuals will not be allowed to join the seminaries , even one couched in the arcane language of the Vatican , could reduce the number of recruits to the priesthood .
In a further sign of the instruction 's deeply controversial nature , it is expected the document would be signed by a cardinal rather than the Pope himself if the Vatican decides to publish it .
The Vatican has been carefully trying to soften Benedict 's image since he was elected earlier this year .
In recent weeks he has reached out to the Jewish and Muslim communities as well as young Catholics during the church 's World Youth Day .
The initiatives have been seen as a significant PR success .
A decision to publish an instruction that would underscore his religious conservatism would be detrimental to Benedict 's standing as he enjoys his ' honeymoon period ' on the world stage .
The Specter Monstrosity Marty Lederman After the Hamdan decision , the Administration 's legal defense of the NSA non-FISA - compliant domestic surveillance program is much weaker than ever -- and that 's saying something .
And Senator Specter has been a vocal critic of the Administration on this issue , reaching his apex of pique when the Vice President snubbed him by trying to influence the Judiciary Committee without telling Specter -- even though at a Republican caucus Specter had " walked directly in front of [ Cheney ] on at least two occasions enroute from the buffet to my table . "
So what does Specter do in the wake of the momentous Hamdan decision , which put all the cards in Congress 's hands ?
He introduces a bill , with Administration blessing , that gives the Administration everything it ever wanted , and much , much more .
Indeed , come to think of it , the Specter bill is basically the sort of legislation one would expect if the Supreme Court had just held that Congress is powerless to enact legislation constraining the President 's " inherent " war powers -- something that not a single Justice in Hamdan so much as suggested .
[ NOTE to Washington Post :
When the President takes a legislator to the cleaners , the proper headline is NOT " Bush Compromises On Spying Program . "
That 's as if a newspaper were to use the headline " U.S. Shifts Policy on Geneva Conventions " to describe the case where the Administration ( i ) has , at best , merely announced its intent to abide by a Supreme Court holding ( imagine that ! ) ; ( ii ) in fact has decided on business as usual ; and ( iii ) has even plotted legislation to allow breaches of Geneva .
Oh , wait .
Never mind . ]
The bill is difficult to follow , almost unreadable .
I must confess that I 've only given it a ten - minute once - over , which is probably more than it deserves .
[ Orin Kerr promises to take " a while to work through it . "
Keep your eyes on Orin 's space for trustworthy , sober analysis . ]
As best I can tell -- and I 'd greatly appreciate corrections if , as is likely , I 've missed or misunderstood something -- this is the " Specter National Security Surveillance Act " in a nutshell :
1 . At least with respect to terrorism - based electronic surveillance , all of the limits Congress imposed on electronic surveillance in FISA are in effect repealed .
The statute does not require the Executive branch to meet any statutory standard for terrorism - based surveillance , and eliminates the FISA provision that prescribes FISA and Title 18 as being the " exclusive means " of electronic surveillance , i.e. , the provision that principally limits what the President can do .
[ UPDATE : Eric Umansky writes : " One other thing flagged by the [ Washington Post ] in the 28th paragraph [ of its story ] : ' Specter agreed to repeal a section of the original FISA law that made it the exclusive statute governing such intelligence programs .' . . . .
[ T ] hat might have been worth mentioning , oh , say , 27 paragraphs higher . " ]
2 . The FISA court would have jurisdiction to " authorize " a broad " electronic surveillance program , " whatever that is .
( A " program " apparently is a whole bunch of actual instances of surveillance , conveniently grouped together in a manner of the Atorney General 's choosing , for faster " approval . " )
But nothing requires the AG to obtain any court approval before engaging in the electronic surveillance .
3 . If for some reason the AG does , voluntarily , go to the FISA court for approval -- again , not that there would be any obstacle to surveillance if he did not obtain such approval -- the standard imposed by FISA for approval would be completely gutted .
Under FISA , a particular case of surveillance may be approved only upon a showing of probable cause to believe ( i ) that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power , and ( ii ) that each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used , or is about to be used , by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power .
50 U.S.C. 1805 ( a ) ( 3 ) .
There 's nothing even remotely like that in the Specter bill .
Under the Specter bill , the FISA court could approve an entire program of electronic surveilance -- presumably tens of thousands of cases -- merely upon a showing that the " program " is constitutional ( as if the Fourth Amendment question can be evaluated on a " program " - wide basis by a court sitting ex parte ) and that the program as a whole is " reasonably designed " to ensure that the intercepted communications are of or with ( i ) a foreign power engaged in or preparing for " terrorism activities " ; ( ii ) an agent of such a foreign power ; or ( iii ) " a person reasonably believed to have communication with or be associated with " such a foreign power or agent thereof . "
In other words , the FISA court would have to " approve " the " program " -- all of it -- if the AG could show , e.g. , that the program writ large is " reasonably designed " to ensure that one end of the the intercepted communications consists of persons who are " reasonably believed " to communicate with agents of a foreign terrorist power .
( In other words , persons can be surveilled if they are three degrees of separation from the guys actually planning the terrorist activities -- or even further removed , as long as the " program " as a whole is " reasonably designed " to pick up folks you can connect to Al Qaeda in three notes . )
And the court would never have to make any part of its review -- including the outcome -- public .
4 . But wait -- there 's more !
The Specter bill would delete the " exclusive means " provision of FISA and would replace it with the guarantee that " nothing in this Act [ i.e. FISA ] shall be construed to limit the constitutional authority of the President to collect intelligence with respect to foreign powers and agents of foreign powers . "
In other words , to the extent any FISA limitations are left in place after this bill , never mind them -- because the President would be authorized to do whatever he could do under the Constitution if FISA did not exist !
5 . Just in case any individuals were actually to challenge the legality of particular surveillance , the Specter bill would permit the AG to transfer all such cases to the FISA court if the AG swears under oath that our national security would be harmed by keeping the case in ordinary courts .
In the FISA court proceedings , the court would not be able to require disclosure of any " national security information " to anyone .
And get this :
The FISA court and FISA Court of Review " may dismiss a challenge to the legality of an elctronic surveillance program for any reason . "
( Because it 's Thursday ?
Or the judge does n't like the looks of you ?
Can you imagine the conversation in the Vice President 's Office on this one ?
" OK guys .
We 've eliminated FISA .
Resurrected unlimited Executive power even after Hamdan .
Made Specter 's beloved ' FISA Court review ' voluntary and pursuant to a standard that amounts to nothing .
Shifted all litigation challenging our conduct to the FISA court , where all the evidence is off limits to the plaintiffs .
Anyone else got anything they 've been wanting ?
Come on , use your imagination . . . . "
" Hey , I 've got an idea ! :
Let 's give the FISA courts the power to dismiss challenges to the Executive branch for any reason . "
" Yeah , that 's the ticket ! " )
It is a mistake to characterize this " accord " as involving " a reversal of Bush 's position that he would not submit his program to court review . "
The program already has been " submitted " by plaintiffs for review to several federal courts -- and the Bush Administration has little choice but to defend those lawsuits .
If Senator Specter really wanted to improve the odds that a federal court will actually reach the merits of one of those cases , he 'd line up his support behind the Schumer bill .
What Specter 's bill does , in contrast , is to drastically diminish , if not eliminate altogether , any court review of the program .
It does not require Bush to " submit " anything anywhere , and it would basically be the death - knell for the challenges to the program that are currently ongoing .
I 'm sure there 's more ( such as in the new and improved and diminished definition of " electronic surveillance " that triggers FISA in the first place ) .
But that ought to give you a flavor .
As far as I can tell , this bill would appear to give the President far more authority to wiretap U.S. persons than he has ever perviously had .
Best I can tell , this is the gist of what the Washington Post calls the " compromise " :
On the one hand , Congress enacts a statute making it legal for the President to do everything that 's been illegal for the past three decades .
But on the other hand , Congress also empowers the FISA court , upon a request of the Attorney General , to confirm that what the President is doing is now , in this post - FISA world , legal .
[ Just noticed when I posted : Jack was ahead of me .
He has even more details . ]
I hope that a bill such as this , which would thoroughly unravel three decades of carefully crafted statutory regulation of electronic surveillance , is a non-starter in Congress .
If so , please allow me this opportunity to make another plea : Everyone behind the Schumer bill , please !
Let 's get the question of NSA legality before the Supreme Court right now , and after that we can worry about how to amend FISA in a responsible manner sensitive to changing needs , such as perhaps along the lines of the models suggested by David Kris or in Jane Harman 's bill .
With this giveaway bill , and the DOJ letter defending the NSA program in the teeth of Hamdan , and the Administration 's proposal to have Congress codify the President 's military commissions , and the Administration 's proposal to authorize Cold Cell and Long Time Standing and other conduct that will result in a breach of the Geneva Conventions , and Jim Haynes getting one step closer to a lifetime judgeship , and with a compliant Congress not really understanding what gift they 've been given in Hamdan ( predicted headline in the near future : " Flush with Success in Court , Congress Capitulates . " ) . . .
Well , we 've rarely if ever seen a week with more , and more audacious , moves in the direction of Executive prerogative .
Which naturally brings to mind this question :
Can you imagine what the Administration would have done this week if they had won Hamdan ?

A curious teenager in Argentina has discovered the fossil skull of the biggest bird ever found -- a swift , flightless predator 10 feet tall that pursued its prey across the steppes of Patagonia 15 million years ago , researchers at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County announced Wednesday .
The skull , tapering to a cruel beak curved like a brush hook , belongs to a previously unknown offshoot of extinct birds known as phorusrhacids -- “ terror birds . ”
Weighing perhaps 400 pounds , the bird most likely preyed on rodents the size of sheep that once grazed on the South American savanna .
“ It is an unbelievable creature , ” said paleontologist Luis Chiappe , director of the museum ’s Dinosaur Institute , who documented the find in the journal Nature .
“ This is the largest known bird , with a skull bigger than a horse ’s head . ”

Measuring more than 28 inches long , the fossil skull is at least 10 % bigger than the largest previously known species , Chiappe and his colleagues reported .
An Argentine high school student , Guillermo Aguirre - Zabiala , found the fossil two years ago among the rock outcrops between two houses by the railroad station in his village east of Bariloche .
The young man was so galvanized by his discovery that he changed his course of study from psychology to paleontology and Earth science , Chiappe said .
“ This discovery has shaped his life . ”
The fossil also is altering how scientists understand the evolution of South America ’s largest prehistoric terror birds .

Until now , scientists thought that these unusual flightless birds had become more portly and less agile as they evolved into bigger and bigger carnivores .
The slender leg and foot bones found with the immense skull , however , closely resemble those of a typical running bird , the scientists reported .
“ It was a speedy bird , ” Chiappe said .
“ I am not saying this animal ran as fast as an ostrich , but it was clearly a good runner . ”

結果を先に言うと、サイボウズ社はセキュリティポリシーによって、（アカウントを持つユーザからしか攻撃され得ないなどの）危険な状況が少ない脆弱性については告知するが、第三者から攻撃され得る脆弱性については告知しない（更新履歴やFAQには書いておくが積極的に知らせることをしない）という方針で、今回も、過去もそうしてきたし、今後もそうしていくつもりなのだという。
複数のサイボウズ製品にセキュリティ・ホール，情報漏洩などの恐れ , 日経IT Pro , 2006 年8月28 日 （1）は，細工が施されたリクエストを送信されると，公開を意図していないファイル（公開用フォルダに置いていないファイル）を表示してしまうセキュリティ・ホール（略）
（ 2）は ，Office 6に関するセキュリティ・ホール（略）。細工が施されたリクエストを送信されると，ログイン・アカウントを持たないユーザーに対して，Office 6に登録されているユーザー／グループ情報を公開する恐れがある。（略）
サイボウズによれば，同社の「 ガルーン 2 」および 「 ワークフロー for ガルーン 2 」 にはSQLインジェクションのセキュリティ・ホールも見つかっているという（略）
という記事が出ている。3つの脆弱性があるわけだが、サイボウズ社のホームページの「重要なお知らせ」で告知されている「サイボウズ製品で発見された脆弱性についてのお知らせ」では、
上 記2件の脆弱性の問題を改修したプログラムを公開しています。
改修プログラムのダウンロード、および適用をお願いいたします。
となっており、( 2)の脆弱性のことが書かれていない。
最初は問題を認識していないだけだろうと思ったので、問題点を指摘するべく電話したのだったが、「お客さま対応の責任者」に代わってもらって話をすると、これらはサイボウズ社のセキュリティポリシーに従って行っていることなのだという。
やりとりは概ね次のようになった。（前半は堂々巡りが多かったので概略。後半はメモを取りながら話したのでほぼそのまま会話通りになっている。）
私 : 御社の告知では、今回の脆弱性は2つだということになっていますが、日経BPの記事を見て、実際には3つだと知りました。どうして1つを隠すのですか？
サ : 隠しているということはございません。製品のホームページ、つまりサイボウズOffice 6のサイト、これは弊社のトップページから行けますが、そこにあるダウンロードのページに「更新履歴」というところがありまして、製品名をクリックすると「サイボウズ
Office 6.6 における改修内容」というリンクがありまして、そこに書いてございます。
私 : そんなところは誰も見ていないのではありませんか？ SQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルの件は、サイボウズ社のトップページで「重要なお知らせ」として告知しているのに、なぜこの件については同じように告知しないのですか？
サ : サイボウズ社のセキュリティに対する考え方として、セキュリティの情報を公表することは、お客さまにセキュリティの問題をもたらすことになると考えておりまして……
私 : じゃあ、どうし てSQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルは告知するわけですか？
サ : SQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルについては、重要なことと捕らえましてお客さまに告知させていただいているしだいです。
私 : ユーザ名が見えてしまう脆弱性は、重要ではないということですか？
私は、こっちの方が重大だと思いましたが？
サ : お客さまと弊社の認識のズレがあったようで申し訳ございません。弊社ではこのように判断したものです。
私 : 今からでも遅くないので、ユーザ名が見えてしまう脆弱性も告知するべきではないですか？
サ : 最新版にアップデートしていただければ、そちらの問題も解消されますので。
私 : つまり「闇改修」ということですか。定期点検の際にこっそり欠陥を直しておけば大丈夫だから客に告知はしないという、自動車の闇改修と同じじゃないですか。
サ : そのようなことはございません。更新履歴に書いております。
私 : だから、SQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルと同じように、そこに加えて、ユーザ名が見える件も書けばいいのに、と言っているのですが。
サ : 繰り返しになりますが、弊社のセキュリティポリシーとして、セキュリティの情報を公表することは、お客さまにセキュリティの問題をもたらすことになると……
私 : だから、なん でSQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルはトップページで告知するのかって聞いているわけですよ。危ないというなら、消したほうがいいんじゃないですか？
サ : SQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルについては、重要なことと捕らえまして……
私 : だから、ユーザ名が見えてしまう脆弱性は重要じゃないから知らせる必要がないってことですか？
って聞いているわけですよ。
サ : セキュリティの情報を公表することは、お客さまに……
（繰り返し ）
私 : SQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルの脆弱性は、「ユーザーが」とあるので、ログインした者にしか攻撃できないという意味ですよね？
サ : はいそうです 。
私 : 一方、ユーザの名前が見えてしまう脆弱性は、ログインしていなくても見えてしまうということですね。当然ながら。
サ : はい。
私 : 私としては 、SQLインジェクションもディレクトリトラバーサルも、緊急事態だとは思わなかったのですよ。なぜなら、うちのサイボウズを使っている他のユーザたちが、ログインしたうえでSQLインジェクションやディレクトリトラバーサルで攻撃するなんてことは、ないだろうと思ったからです。
サ : はい。
私 : だから、最新版に入れ替える必要はないと思いましたよ。ところが、日経BPの記事を読むと、ログインしていなくてもユーザの名前が見えてしまう別の脆弱性もあるのだと。これで初めて、緊急事態だと思いましたが、あなたがたが告知しないから、この事態に気づかないままになるところでしたよ？
サ : 弊社のセキュリティポリシーとして、セキュリティの情報を公表することは、お客さまにセキュリティの問題を……
私 : つまり、SQLインジェクションとディレクトリトラバーサルは、実際には危険な状況は少なめだから公表したけれども、ユーザ名は誰でも見えてしまう問題だから隠したということですか？
サ : 隠すということはございません。更新履歴での公表とするのが適切だというのが、当社のセキュリティポリシーです。
私 : ところで、もう一件あるのですが、去年の3月に、 「 「クロスサイトスクリプティング脆弱性」の影響を受けることはありますか？」というFAQを出してらっしゃいますね？ 「 サイボウ ズ クロスサイト」でGoogle検索すれば見つかります。
（場所を説明している様子を略）
私 : この脆弱性について告知をなさいましたか？
サ : 確認します 。
私 : それから、この脆弱性は修正されているのですか？
サ : 確認します 。
私 : 下の方に 「 警告画面を表示するよう、設定を変更することができる」とありますが、これはデフォルトでオフということですよね？
管理者が設定を変えてオンにしないとその警告は出ないのですよね。
サ : 確認します。こちらからかけなおします。
サ : この件については昨年、セキュリティ強化についてのメールマガジンを出しました。修正については、Office 6.5 で警告が出る機能を設けました。デフォルトはオフです。
私 : つまり、直していないということですね？
サ : 直すといいますか、回避できるように警告が出る機能を設けました。
私 : なぜ直さないのですか。
サ : 弊社の製品の問題ではなく 、Internet Explorerの問題もありまして。
私 : ブラウザのせいだというのですか ？ Yahoo!メールとかHotmailとかのWebメールは、HTMLメールを表示しますが、そのときに、スクリプトが含まれていたら排除するようにしているわけです。どこのWebメールもやっていますよ？ サイボウズはWebメールでHTMLメール表示機能を追加したのに、スクリプト排除をやっていないわけです。指摘されても、直さず、警告機能を付けただけですか。
サ : ……。
私 : 警告には何と書いてあるのですか？ ユーザは、その警告で踏みとどまらずにHTMLメールを開くとどうなるか、理解できるのですか？
サ : 警告の内容については調べます。
私 : しかもデフォルトでオフだから誰も警告機能をオンにしていないでしょ。告知をすることもなく、FAQにひっそりと書いているだけなんだから、誰も知らないでしょ。なぜ告知しないんですか。
サ : 弊社のセキュリティポリシーに沿って、脆弱性が見つかっても大きく取り上げて発表することはありません。
私 : それがサイボウズ社のセキュリティポリシーなんですか？
サ : 昨年のそのときは、この対応でした。
私 : 間違っていたのなら、今からでも遅くないので告知したほうがよいのではないですか？
サ : サイボウズ社としては表記等を変更をしないという見解です。
私 : なぜですか ？
サ : さきほどと同じで、公開することによるお客さまへの影響範囲と深刻さから判断して、どういった媒体がよいかと判断しています。
私 : つまり、FAQが適切な媒体だということですか？
サ : セキュリティの強化がされたというメールマガジンを出しました。
私 : そのメールマガジンにどこがセキュリティの強化なのかは書いてあるのですか？
サ : どこがセキュリティの強化なのかは書いていません。
私 : じゃあ、何を書いたというのですか。
サ : 個人情報保護対策で、アドレス帳とメール機能を強化したことを書いています。
私 : メール機能の強化とは何のことですか？
サ : 更新履歴へのリンクを設けていました。
私 : リンクがあるだけですか。リンク先に何が書いてあるのですか？
サ : 「 受信メールの添付ファイルを開くときに警告表示を出すようにしました」ということが書いてあります。
私 : デフォルトでオフなのに？ 添付ファイルじゃないですよ 。HTMLメールですよ？ FAQ へのリンクを示して告知しないと、誰も設定を変更しないでしょ。
サ : それは理解していますが、それが弊社のセキュリティポリシーです。
私 : 今後も、サイボウズに脆弱性が見つかっても、影響範囲に応じで、告知しない場合があるということですか？
サ : 変更履歴に書いています。
私 : 変更履歴なんか告知じゃないでしょ。去年のクロスサイトスクリプティング脆弱性で、警告機能を追加したことを変更履歴に書いたとき、その意味を説明したFAQへ、リンクしましたか？
サ : FAQ へのリンクはございません。
私 : じゃあ誰も読まないでしょ。
サ : 「 サポート」というコーナーから見つけることができます。
私 : そんなとこ誰が見るんですか。社員であり、おそらくユーザでもあるであろうあなたも、さっき調べるまでこれの存在を知らなかったわけなんだし。サーポートというのは実際に問題が出てから見に行くところですよね？
「 よくある質問と答え」とおっしゃるけども、 「クロスサイトスクリプティング脆弱性の影響を受けることはありますか？」なんて質問が「よくある」わけないでしょ。知らなきゃ質問できないんだから。
サ : これが弊社の案内のポリシーです。
私 : 脆弱性を気にする人は 、FAQ の全部に目を通せということですか？
サ : 当時のFAQに関してはそういう対応になっています。
私 : これは間違いだったんじゃないですか？
サ : まああのー、この対応に関してもサイボウズ社の中での方針というかポリシーとしてそういう公開のしかたにさせていただいたものです。
私 : 今後も同じことをするんですか？ と聞いているわけです 。
サ : そこに関しては、あくまでも脆弱性が発見されたところではお客さまへの告知は必要だと考えています。公開することによって既存のお客さまに危険を与えてしまうという箇所に関しましては、大々的に公開するかどうかというところについては社内にて検討させていただくということになります。隠すということについては、弊社としては、変更履歴に記載することであくまでも隠しているというつもりはないといことで、ご理解頂ければと。
私 : もう一回だけ同じことを言います。脆弱性を気にする人は、FAQ の全部に目を通さなくてはいけないのでしょうか？
サ : 今後に関しましては脆弱性が見つかった段階で、アナウンスをさせていただきますので。FAQを全部見る必要はありません。
私 : 脆弱性を気にする人は、変更履歴の全てに目を通さなくてはいけないのでしょうか？
サ : …………………………………… 。
サ : そうですね、今回の対応ですとそうなります。
私 : で、去年のクロスサイトスクリプティングですけども、変更履歴を見ればわかるんですか？
対応が必要だということが、変更履歴を見ればわかるんですか？
サ : 去年の件については、変更履歴には明確に記述されていません。
私 : では、去年の件は間違いだったということですか？
サ : 間違いというのはどういう？
私 : こんな方法では不適切だったということですか？
サ : そうでございますね。不明瞭なところでお客さまにご迷惑をおかけしたということで、適切な表現ではなかったと考えております。
私 : 今からでも遅くないので、告知するべきではないですか？
サ : 去年の内容に関してですか？
私 : はい。
サ : 去年の内容をホームページのトップへということですか？
私 : はい。
サ : 去年の内容をホームページのトップへということは予定しておりません。
私 : 不適切だったって言ったじゃないですか。
サ : 変更履歴に記載するべきであったが、トップページに告知することは予定していません。
私 : で、どうするんですか、これから。
サ : 脆弱性というものが見つかった際には、お客さまへの通知等は必要だと考えていまして、公表する内容に関しましては、お客様への影響範囲を考えまして、ホームページにするか、メールにするか、変更履歴、FAQのどの媒体に記載するのがよいか検討してまいります。
私 : いや、この去年のはどうするんですか？ と聞いているんです 。
サ : これをホームページからリンクをはるということは考えていません。
私 : 不適切でない、問題ないからですか？
サ : 変更履歴に載せるべきだったという意味で不適切とは言いました。
私 : でですよ、今から変更履歴に載せるということが考えられますが、いまから去年のバージョンアップについて変更履歴を改定しても、誰も読みませんね？
サ : そうでございますね 。
私 : どうするんですか ？
サ : …………………………………… 。えとー、今後もFAQ に関してですね、えとー、なにかあのー、表示等のアナウンスなどの変更をする予定はありません。
私 : では、誰が警告の設定をオンにする必要性についてついて、気づけるのですか？
サ : 今の状況ですと 、FAQ をご覧になられた方ということになります。
私 : では私が 、FAQを見る必要があることについて、みなさんに伝えようと思います。よろしいですか？
サ : どういうふうにですか？
私 : FAQ に色々書いてあると。しかし設定はデフォルトでオフなので、自力でオンにしないといけない。なぜオンにする必要があるのかについて、みなさんに伝えます。ホームページ等を通じて。よろしいですか。
サ : どちらのホームページですか？
私 : 個人のです 。
サ : 個人のホームページでですか。
私 : あなた方が伝えないなら、私から、 「 みなさん、オンにしないといけません。警告が出ても開いてはいけません。」ということをみんなに知らせるのが、社会正義だと思いますね。
サ : 個人のホームページでお知らせされることを、弊社が止めるとか止めないという権利はないと思いますので。
私 : わかりました 。
一般的に言うと、こうした 「 お客さま対応」窓口から問題点の指摘をした場合、指摘が判断能力のある部署に伝わらないことがある。その場で矛盾のない回答をすることばかりに注力して、対応から変えなければならないような指摘に耳を傾けないということが起きがちのように思う。そこで今回も、そういう状態になっているのではないかと問い、回答を繰り返すのではなく判断のできる人と話をさせて欲しいと話したが、「自分が責任持って対応する」とのことで、何度も時間をおいて折り返し電話をもらうことになった。したがって、「当社のセキュリティポリシーに従っている」というのは本当なのだろう。
サイボウズ社は技術者たちによって起業された若い会社だと聞いていたから、こういうポリシーになることは考えにくいことだった。非技術系営業マンの判断がこうした事態を一時的に招いただけならよいものの、本当に社の方針になっているのなら、もう、安心して使えない。なにしろ、悪用の現実性が高いものは告知してもらえないというのだから。
ちなみに 、 「 サイボウズ青野の3日ボウズ日記 : セキュリティに関するお知らせ」（8月29日）に、
基本的にはイントラネットで使うソフトであり、悪意ある攻撃を受けるケースは少ないかも知れませんが、見つかった脆弱性に対しては、迅速に対応していきたいと考えています。
と書かれているが、社外から直接サイボウズを使うようにしているところは少なくない。Googleで検索してみればサイボウズのログイン画面はたくさん出てくる。
ところで、去年、日 経IT Proの 「 記者の眼 」に次のコラムが出ていた。
勝村幸博 , セキュリティ・ホールは公開しない者勝ち？ , 記者の眼 , 日経IT Pro , 2005 年 10 月26 日 「 情報は公開している」というベンダーでも，信じられないくらい“深い”ディレクトリにセキュリティ情報ページを用意しているところもある。トップページからはとてもアクセスできないようなところに置いて，「情報を公開している」と言えるのだろうか。
あるベンダーの方からは，「どうして（わが社の製品の）セキュリティ・ホールの記事を書くのか分からない。一度，理由を聞きたいと思っている」という言葉をいただいたこともある。筆者としては，その製品のユーザーの一助になると思って記事を書いているのだが・・・。
広告で成り立っているマスコミはあてにならないのだろうか。

Subtyping , Subclassing , and Trouble with OOP
An extensive discussion of subtyping , insidious problems with subclassing , and practical rules to avoid them .
A more formal and general presentation of this topic is given in a paper and a talk at a Monterey 2001 workshop ( June 19 - 21 , 2001 , Monterey , CA ) : Subtyping - OOP.ps.gz [ 35 K ] and MTR2001 - Subtyping - talk.ps.gz [ 67 K ]
Does OOP really separate interface from implementation ?
Decoupling of abstraction from implementation is one of the holy grails of good design .
Object - oriented programming in general and encapsulation in particular are claimed to be conducive to such separation , and therefore to more reliable code .
In the end , productivity and quality are the only true merits a programming methodology is to be judged upon .
This article is to show a very simple example that questions if OOP indeed helps separate interface from implementation .
The example is a very familiar one , illustrating the difference between subclassing and subtyping .
The article carries this example of Bags and Sets one step further , to a rather unsettling result .
The article set out to follow good software engineering ; this makes the resulting failure even more ominous .
The article aims to give a more - or - less " real " example , which one can run and see the result for himself .
By necessity the example had to be implemented in some language .
The present article uses C++.
It appears however that similar code ( with similar conclusions ) can be carried on in many other OO languages ( e.g. , Java , Python , etc ) .
Suppose I was given a task to implement a Bag -- an unordered collection of possibly duplicate items ( integers in this example ) .
I chose the following interface :
typedef int const * CollIterator ; // Primitive but will do class CBag { public : int size ( void ) const ; //
The number of elements in the bag virtual void put ( const int elem ) ; //
Put an element into the bag int count ( const int elem ) const ; //
Count the number of occurrences // of a particular element in the bag virtual bool del( const int elem ) ; //
Remove an element from the bag // Return false if the element // did n't exist CollIterator begin( void ) const ; // Standard enumerator interface CollIterator end( void ) const ; CBag ( void ) ; virtual CBag * clone ( void ) const ; //
Make a copy of the bag private : // implementation details elided } ;
// Standard " print - on " operator ostream& operator << ( ostream& os , const CBag& bag ) ; // Union ( merge ) of the two bags //
The return type is void to avoid complications with subclassing // ( which incidental to the current example ) void operator += ( CBag& to , const CBag& from ) ; // Determine if CBag a is subbag of CBag b bool operator <= ( const CBag& a , const CBag& b ) ; inline bool operator >= ( const CBag& a , const CBag& b ) { return b <= a ; } // Structural equivalence of the bags //
Two bags are equal if they contain the same number of the same elements inline bool operator == ( const CBag& a , const CBag& b ) { return a <= b && a >= b ; }
It has to be stressed that the package was designed to minimize the number of functions that need to know details of CBag 's implementation .
Following good practice , I wrote validation code ( file vCBag.cc [ Code ] ) that tests all the functions and methods of the CBag package and verifies common invariants .
Suppose you are tasked with implementing a Set package .
Your boss defined a set as an unordered collection where each element has a single occurrence .
In fact , your boss even said that a set is a bag with no duplicates .
You have found my CBag package and realized that it can be used with few additional changes .
The definition of a Set as a Bag , with some constraints , made the decision to reuse the CBag code even easier .
class CSet : public CBag { public : bool memberof ( const int elem ) const { return count ( elem ) > 0 ; } // Overriding of CBag : : put void put( const int elem ) { if(!memberof( elem ) ) CBag : : put ( elem ) ; } CSet * clone ( void ) const { CSet * new_set = new CSet ( ) ; * new_set += * this ; return new_set ; } CSet ( void ) {} } ;
The definition of a CSet makes it possible to mix CSets and CBags , as in set += bag ; or bag += set ;
These operations are well - defined , keeping in mind that a set is a bag that happens to have the count of all members exactly one .
For example , set += bag ; adds all elements from a bag to a set , unless they are already present .
bag += set ; is no different than merging a bag with any other bag .
You too wrote a validation suite to test all CSet methods ( newly defined and inherited from a bag ) and to verify common expected properties , e.g. , a + =a is a .
In my package , I have defined and implemented a function :
// A sample function .
Given three bags a , b , and c , it decides // if a+b is a subbag of c bool foo ( const CBag& a , const CBag& b , const CBag& c ) { CBag & ab = *( a.clone ( ) ) ; //
Clone a to avoid clobbering it ab += b ; // ab is now the union of a and b bool result = ab <= c ; delete &ab ; return result ; }
Later on , I revisited my code and found my implementation of foo ( ) inefficient .
Memory for the ab object is unnecessarily allocated on heap .
I rewrote the function as
bool foo ( const CBag& a , const CBag& b , const CBag& c ) { CBag ab ; ab += a ; //
Clone a to avoid clobbering it ab += b ; // ab is now the union of a and b bool result = ab <= c ; return result ; }
However , when you run your code with the new implementation of foo( ) , you notice that something has changed !
You can see this for yourself : download the complete code from [ Code ] .
make vCBag1 and make vCBag2 run validation tests with the first and the second implementations of foo( ) .
Both tests complete successfully , with the identical results .
make vCSet1 and make vCSet2 test the CSet package .
The tests -- other than those of foo( ) -- all succeed .
Function foo( ) however yields markedly different results .
It is debatable which implementation of foo ( ) gives truer results for CSets .
In any case , changing internal algorithms of a pure function foo ( ) while keeping the same interfaces is not supposed to break your code .
What happened ?
What makes this problem more unsettling is that both you and I tried to do everything by the book .
We wrote a safe , typechecked code .
We eschewed casts .
g++ ( 2.95.2 ) compiler with flags - W and - Wall issued not a single warning .
Normally these flags cause g++ to become very annoying .
You did n't try to override methods of CBag to deliberately break the CBag package .
You attempted to preserve CBag 's invariants ( weakening a few as needed ) .
Real - life classes usually have far more obscure algebraic properties .
We both wrote regression tests for our implementations of a CBag and a CSet , and they passed .
And yet , despite all my efforts to separate interface and implementation , I failed .
Should a programming language or the methodology take at least a part of the blame ?
[ OOP - problems ]
Subtyping vs. Subclassing
The problem with CSet is caused by CSet design 's breaking of the Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP ) [ LSP ] .
CSet has been declared as a subclass of CBag .
Therefore , C++ compiler 's typechecker permits passing a CSet object or a CSet reference to a function that expects a CBag object or reference .
However , it is well known [ Subtyping - Subclassing ] that a CSet is not a subtype of a CBag .
The next few paragraphs give a simple proof of this fact , for the sake of reference .
One approach is to consider Bags and Sets as pure values , without any state or intrinsic behavior -- just like integers are .
This approach is taken in the next article , Preventing - Trouble .html .
The other point of view -- the one used in this article -- is Object - Oriented Programming , of objects that encapsulate state and behavior .
Behavior means an object can accept a message , send a reply and possibly change its state .
Let us consider a Bag and a Set separately , without regard to their possible relationship .
Throughout this section we use a different , concise notation to emphasize the general nature of the argument .
We will define a Bag as an object that accepts two messages :
( send a - Bag ' put x ) puts an element x into the Bag , and ( send a - Bag ' count x ) gives the count of occurrences of x in the Bag ( without changing a - Bag 's state ) .
( send a - Set ' put x ) puts an element x into a - Set unless it was already there , ( send a - Set ' count x ) gives the count of occurrences of x in a - Set ( which is always either 0 or 1 ) .
( define ( fnb bag ) ( send bag ' put 5 ) ( send bag ' put 5 ) ( send bag ' count 5 ) )
(+ 2 ( send orig - bag ' count 5 ) )
Technically you can pass to fnb a Set object as well .
Just as a Bag , a Set object accepts messages put and count .
However applying fnb to a
Set object will break the function 's post - condition , which stated above .
Therefore , passing a set object where a bag was expected changes behavior of some program .
According to the Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP ) , a Set is not substitutable for a Bag -- a Set can not be a subtype of a Bag .
Let 's consider a function
( define ( fns set ) ( send set ' put 5 ) ( send set ' count 5 ) )
put
count
fns
fns
Therefore , from the OO point of view , neither a Bag nor a Set are a subtype of the other .
This is the crux of the problem .
Bag and Set only appear similar .
The interface or an implementation of a Bag and a Set appear to invite subclassingof a Set from a Bag ( or vice versa ) .
Doing so however will violate the LSP -- and you have to brace for very subtle errors .
The previous section intentionally broke the LSP to demonstrate how insidious the errors are and how difficult it may be to find them .
Sets and Bags are very simple types , far simpler than the ones you deal with in a production code .
Alas , LSP when considered from an OOP point of view is undecidable .
You can not count on a compiler for help in pointing out an error .
You can not rely on regression tests either .
It 's manual work -- you have to see the problem [ OOP - problems ] .
Subtyping and Immutability
class BagV { virtual BagV put( const int ) const ; int count ( const int ) const ; ... // other similar const members } ; class SetV { virtual SetV put( const int ) const ; int count ( const int ) const ; ... // other similar const members };
Instances of BagV and SetV classes are immutable , yet the classes are not subtypes of each other .
To see that , let us consider a polymorphic function
template < typename T> int f( const T& t ) { return t.put ( 1) .count ( 1 ) ; }
f( bag ) == 1 + bag.count(1 )
If we take an object asetv = SetV ( ) . put ( 1 ) and pass it to f( ) , the invariant above will be broken .
Therefore , by LSP , a SetV is not substitutable for BagV : a SetV is not a BagV .
In other words , if one defines
int fb( const BagV& bag ) { return bag.
put ( 1).count ( 1 ) ; }
reinterpret_cast<const BagV&>( aSetV )
C++ objects are record - based .
Subclassing is a way of extending records , with possibly altering some slots in the parent record .
Those slots must be designated as modifiable by a keyword virtual .
In this context , prohibiting mutation and overriding makes subclassing imply subtyping .
This was the reasoning behind BRules [ Preventing - Trouble.html ] .
However merely declaring the state of an object immutable is not enough to guarantee that derivation leads to subtyping :
An object can override parent 's behavior without altering the parent .
This is easy to do when an object is implemented as a functional closure , when a handler for an incoming message is located with the help of some kind of reflexive facilities , or in prototype - based OO systems .
Incidently , if we do permit a derived object to alter its base object , we implicitly allow behavior overriding .
For example , an object A can react to a message M by forwarding the message to an object B stored in A 's slot .
If an object C derived from A alters that slot it hence overrides A 's behavior with respect to M .
For example , http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/index.html#pure-oo implements a purely functional OO system .
It supports objects with an identity , state and behavior , inheritance and polymorphism .
Everything in that system is immutable .
And yet it is possible to define something like a BagV , and derive SetV from it by overriding a put message handler .
Acting this way is bad and invites trouble as this breaks the LSP as shown earlier .
Yet it is possible .
This example shows that immutability per se does not turn object derivation into subtyping .

TOTAL PLAYING TIME : ABOUT 80 MINUTES
One of my basic assumptions about digital media is that it wants to be free and the consumers want it to be free .
I wrote the following in my initial The Future of Media post :
Leaving aside the rights issues , which I know are large , if I were a television executive right now , I 'd take my content , microchunk it , put a couple calls to a video ad server in the middle of it , and let it go whereever it wants to go , safe in the knowledge that whenever the show is viewed , I 'll get to run a couple 15 second spots in the middle of it ( which I could change whenever I wanted to and which I could measure ) .
That is not what the TV execs are doing for the most part .
What they are doing is putting Desperate Housewives up on iTunes for a $ 1.99 download or reruns of I Love Lucy on Google for a $ 1.99 download .
I think that 's not a mass market service .
I 've watched I Love Lucy for years for free in my home , I 've Tivo'd it and can go back and watch it anytime , and I am not excited about paying $ 1.99 to download and watch The Courtroom episode .
What I am excited about is downloading The Courtroom episode for free from Google , Yahoo ! , iTunes , and whereever else it may be made available .
Then cutting and pasting it to get to the scene I love and then posting it on my blog for others to do the same thing with it .
Free content without rules ( DRM ) is The Future of Media .
The business model will be advertising and its coming , quickly .
Where we are now is an interim step because nobody is yet willing to make the leap .
But someone will soon and they will be rewarded for it with a advertising market that will compare with and possibly beat the size of the paid search market .
But I have been saying this for a while now based mostly on gut instinct .
Now we have some research to support my thesis .
Yesterday MediaPost published an article about a consumer survey on these exact issues .
The headline quote is :
consumers , almost three to one , would rather see commercials than pay a fee --$ 1.99 a download
The numbers are even more telling in the all important 18 - 24 age group ( who is the future of media ) :
Consumers 18 - 34 prefer free , ad - supported content 68 percent of the time -- as compared to 26 percent , who prefer to pay a fee .
Five percent of those consumers were undecided .
And the notion that just because you 've paid for the content you wo n't see ads is a false hope .
Just yesterday , Mel Karmazin was quoted as saying that Sirius will sell over $ 600 million in advertising this year on its PAID sattellite radio service .
If you think you are going to avoid ads by paying for content , you are wrong about that .
But paid content online is a niche business .
Free content online is a mass market business .
How many websites require a subscription ?
Very few .
Why ?
Because content on the web wants to be free .
Links are the essential currency of the web and when you click on a link and get asked to pay , most of the time you move on to something else .
The big media owners do n't get this right now .
It will take a while of flailing around with paid content models before someone follows the four rules of The Future of Media .
But when they do , they will end up with a very large business quickly and the others will follow .
That 's my prediction .
Thanksgiving , is it ?
Well , despite occasional headaches , technology has also brought us plenty to be thankful for : safety , convenience and entertainment on the go .
Next time you ’re running late , lost or lonely , ask yourself : are n’t you grateful for your cellphone ?
Actually , do n’t answer yet .
With every passing month , cellphones are becoming even more useful .
Sure , it ’s nice that they let you call people from the road .
But lately , their reach has grown , thanks to clever programmers making links between the cellular world and the Internet .
Here , for your gratitude - generating pleasure , is a rundown of some of the most exciting and powerful services awaiting your cellphone at this very moment .
Better yet , at the moment , they ’re all free .
FREE DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE
By this time , it ’s quite clear that nobody with a “ $ 50 a month ” calling plan actually pays only $ 50 a month .
The cellphone companies will do anything to puff up your bill — like charging you $ 1.50 or $ 2 every time you dial 411 to find a phone number .

The My Book Your Book website goes live on Monday at 2200 BST
The My Book Your Book website does not go live until Monday evening , but has already received 750 applications .
All of its " founder members " will be able to access thousands of paperback novels - provided they donate 10 books each to the co-operative scheme .
" I always thought it would work , but I 'm surprised how quickly it 's taken off , " Peter Baillie told BBC News .
" The response has been remarkable . "
The website asks its members to add a list of 10 books they own to its online catalogue .
The listed books can then be exchanged between members for the cost of postage and packing .
Sister schemes
" Our community of readers can save money , have a bigger library and help the environment by saving a few more trees , " said Mr Baillie .
" Instead of spending £ 4 to £ 8 on each novel they desire , members could join and never buy a book again . "
Members who join once the site is active , from 2200 BST on Monday , will be asked to pay an annual subscription of £ 8.95 .
However , those who sign up beforehand will receive free membership for one year .
Mr Baillie told the BBC news website he had received backing from Friends of the Earth , the Arts Council and the Literary Trust .
He said he had also been in touch with readers in South Africa , France and New Zealand eager to set up sister schemes .
Worse Than Fossil Fuel
Biodiesel enthusiasts have accidentally invented the most carbon - intensive fuel on earth
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 6th December 2005
Over the past two years I have made an uncomfortable discovery .
Like most environmentalists , I have been as blind to the constraints affecting our energy supply as my opponents have been to climate change .
I now realise that I have entertained a belief in magic .
In 2003 , the biologist Jeffrey Dukes calculated that the fossil fuels we burn in one year were made from organic matter “ containing 44 x 10 to the 18 grams of carbon , which is more than 400 times the net primary productivity of the planet ’s current biota . ” (1) In plain English , this means that every year we use four centuries ’ worth of plants and animals .
The idea that we can simply replace this fossil legacy – and the extraordinary power densities it gives us – with ambient energy is the stuff of science fiction .
There is simply no substitute for cutting back .
But substitutes are being sought everywhere .
They are being promoted today at the climate talks in Montreal , by states – such as ours – which seek to avoid the hard decisions climate change demands .
And at least one of them is worse than the fossil fuel burning it replaces .
The last time I drew attention to the hazards of making diesel fuel from vegetable oils , I received as much abuse as I have ever been sent by the supporters of the Iraq war .
The biodiesel missionaries , I discovered , are as vociferous in their denial as the executives of Exxon .
I am now prepared to admit that my previous column was wrong .
But they ’re not going to like it .
I was wrong because I underestimated the fuel ’s destructive impact .
Before I go any further , I should make it clear that turning used chip fat into motor fuel is a good thing .
The people slithering around all day in vats of filth are perfoming a service to society .
But there is enough waste cooking oil in the UK to meet one 380th of our demand for road transport fuel ( 2 ) .
Beyond that , the trouble begins .
When I wrote about it last year , I thought that the biggest problem caused by biodiesel was that it set up a competition for land ( 3 ) .
Arable land that would otherwise have been used to grow food would instead be used to grow fuel .
But now I find that something even worse is happening .
The biodiesel industry has accidentally invented the world ’s most carbon - intensive fuel .
In promoting biodiesel – as the European Union , the British and US governments and thousands of environmental campaigners do – you might imagine that you are creating a market for old chip fat , or rapeseed oil , or oil from algae grown in desert ponds .
In reality you are creating a market for the most destructive crop on earth .
Last week , the chairman of Malaysia ’s Federal Land Development Authority announced that he was about to build a new biodiesel plant ( 4 ) .
His was the ninth such decision in four months .
Four new refineries are being built in Peninsula Malaysia , one in Sarawak and two in Rotterdam ( 5 ) .
Two foreign consortia – one German , one American – are setting up rival plants in Singapore ( 6 ) .
All of them will be making biodiesel from the same source : oil from palm trees .
“ The demand for biodiesel , ” the Malaysian Star reports , “ will come from the European Community … This fresh demand … would , at the very least , take up most of Malaysia ’s crude palm oil inventories ” ( 7 ) .
Why ?
Because it ’s cheaper than biodiesel made from any other crop .
In September , Friends of the Earth published a report about the impacts of palm oil production .
“ Between 1985 and 2000 , ” it found , “ the development of oil - palm plantations was responsible for an estimated 87 per cent of deforestation in Malaysia ” ( 8 ) .
In Sumatra and Borneo , some 4 million hectares of forest has been converted to palm farms .
Now a further 6 million hectares is scheduled for clearance in Malaysia , and 16.5 m in Indonesia .
Almost all the remaining forest is at risk .
Even the famous Tanjung Puting National Park in Kalimantan is being ripped apart by oil planters .
The orang - utan is likely to become extinct in the wild .
Sumatran rhinos , tigers , gibbons , tapirs , proboscis monkeys and thousands of other species could go the same way .
Thousands of indigenous people have been evicted from their lands , and some 500 Indonesians have been tortured when they tried to resist ( 9 ) .
The forest fires which every so often smother the region in smog are mostly started by the palm growers .
The entire region is being turned into a gigantic vegetable oil field .
Before oil palms , which are small and scrubby , are planted , vast forest trees , containing a much greater store of carbon , must be felled and burnt .
Having used up the drier lands , the plantations are now moving into the swamp forests , which grow on peat .
When they ’ve cut the trees , the planters drain the ground .
As the peat dries it oxidises , releasing even more carbon dioxide than the trees .
In terms of its impact on both the local and global environments , palm biodiesel is more destructive than crude oil from Nigeria .
The British government understands this .
In the report it published last month , when it announced that it will obey the European Union and ensure that 5.75 % of our transport fuel comes from plants by 2010 , it admitted that “ the main environmental risks are likely to be those concerning any large expansion in biofuel feedstock production , and particularly in Brazil ( for sugar cane ) and South East Asia ( for palm oil plantations ) .
” ( 10 ) It suggested that the best means of dealing with the problem was to prevent environmentally destructive fuels from being imported .
The government asked its consultants whether a ban would infringe world trade rules .
The answer was yes : “ mandatory environmental criteria … would greatly increase the risk of international legal challenge to the policy as a whole ” ( 11 ) .
So it dropped the idea of banning imports , and called for “ some form of voluntary scheme ” instead ( 12 ) .
Knowing that the creation of this market will lead to a massive surge in imports of palm oil , knowing that there is nothing meaningful it can do to prevent them , and knowing that they will accelarate rather than ameliorate climate change , the government has decided to go ahead anyway .
At other times it happily defies the European Union .
But what the EU wants and what the government wants are the same .
“ It is essential that we balance the increasing demand for travel , ” the government ’s report says , “ with our goals for protecting the environment ” ( 13 ) .
Until recently , we had a policy of reducing the demand for travel .
Now , though no announcement has been made , that policy has gone .
Like the Tories in the early 1990s , the Labour administration seeks to accommodate demand , however high it rises .
Figures obtained last week by the campaigning group Road Block show that for the widening of the M1 alone the government will pay £ 3.6 billion – more than it is spending on its entire climate change programme ( 14 ) .
Instead of attempting to reduce demand , it is trying to alter supply .
It is prepared to sacrifice the South East Asian rainforests in order to be seen to do something , and to allow motorists to feel better about themselves .
All this illustrates the futility of the technofixes now being pursued in Montreal .
Trying to meet a rising demand for fuel is madness , wherever the fuel might come from .
The hard decisions have been avoided , and another portion of the biosphere is going up in smoke .

Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratana
Chapter 13
Mindfulness ( Sati )
Mindfulness is the English translation of the Pali word Sati .
Sati is an activity .
What exactly is that ?
There can be no precise answer , at least not in words .
Words are devised by the symbolic levels of the mind and they describe those realities with which symbolic thinking deals .
Mindfulness is pre-symbolic .
It is not shackled to logic .
Nevertheless , Mindfulness can be experienced - rather easily - and it can be described , as long as you keep in mind that the words are only fingers pointing at the moon .
They are not the thing itself .
The actual experience lies beyond the words and above the symbols .
Mindfulness could be described in completely different terms than will be used here and each description could still be correct .
Mindfulness is a subtle process that you are using at this very moment .
The fact that this process lies above and beyond words does not make it unreal - quite the reverse .
Mindfulness is the reality which gives rise to words - the words that follow are simply pale shadows of reality .
So , it is important to understand that everything that follows here is analogy .
It is not going to make perfect sense .
It will always remain beyond verbal logic .
But you can experience it .
The meditation technique called Vipassana ( insight ) that was introduced by the Buddha about twenty - five centuries ago is a set of mental activities specifically aimed at experiencing a state of uninterrupted Mindfulness .
When you first become aware of something , there is a fleeting instant of pure awareness just before you conceptualize the thing , before you identify it .
That is a stage of Mindfulness .
Ordinarily , this stage is very short .
It is that flashing split second just as you focus your eyes on the thing , just as you focus your mind on the thing , just before you objectify it , clamp down on it mentally and segregate it from the rest of existence .
It takes place just before you start thinking about it - before your mind says , " Oh , it 's a dog . "
That flowing , soft - focused moment of pure awareness is Mindfulness .
In that brief flashing mind - moment you experience a thing as an un-thing .
You experience a softly flowing moment of pure experience that is interlocked with the rest of reality , not separate from it .
Mindfulness is very much like what you see with your peripheral vision as opposed to the hard focus of normal or central vision .
yet this moment of soft , unfocused , awareness contains a very deep sort of knowing that is lost as soon as you focus your mind and objectify the object into a thing .
In the process of ordinary perception , the Mindfulness step is so fleeting as to be unobservable .
We have developed the habit of squandering our attention on all the remaining steps , focusing on the perception , recognizing the perception , labeling it , and most of all , getting involved in a long string of symbolic thought about it .
That original moment of Mindfulness is rapidly passed over .
It is the purpose of the above mentioned Vipassana ( or insight ) meditation to train us to prolong that moment of awareness .
When this Mindfulness is prolonged by using proper techniques , you find that this experience is profound and it changes your entire view of the universe .
This state of perception has to be learned , however , and it takes regular practice .
Once you learn the technique , you will find that Mindfulness has many interesting aspects .
Mindfulness is mirror - thought .
It reflects only what is presently happening and in exactly the way it is happening .
There are no biases .
Mindfulness is non-judgmental observation .
It is that ability of the mind to observe without criticism .
With this ability , one sees things without condemnation or judgment .
One is surprised by nothing .
One simply takes a balanced interest in things exactly as they are in their natural states .
One does not decide and does not judge .
One just observes .
It is psychologically impossible for us to objectively observe what is going on within us if we do not at the same time accept the occurrence of our various states of mind .
This is especially true with unpleasant states of mind .
In order to observe our own fear , we must accept the fact that we are afraid .
We can't examine our own depression without accepting it fully .
The same is true for irritation and agitation , frustration and all those other uncomfortable emotional states .
You can't examine something fully if you are busy reflecting its existence .
Whatever experience we may be having , Mindfulness just accepts it .
It is simply another of life 's occurrences , just another thing to be aware of .
No pride , no shame , nothing personal at stake - what is there , is there .
Mindfulness is an impartial watchfulness .
It does not take sides .
It does not get hung up in what is perceived .
It just perceives .
Mindfulness does not get infatuated with the good mental states .
It does not try to sidestep the bad mental states .
There is no clinging to the pleasant , no fleeing from the unpleasant .
Mindfulness sees all experiences as equal , all thoughts as equal , all feelings as equal .
Nothing is suppressed .
Nothing is repressed .
Mindfulness does not play favorites .
Mindfulness is nonconceptual awareness .
Another English term for Sati is ' bare attention ' .
It is not thinking .
It does not get involved with thought or concepts .
It does not get hung up on ideas or opinions or memories .
It just looks .
Mindfulness registers experiences , but it does not compare them .
It does not label them or categorize them .
It just observes everything as if it was occurring for the first time .
It is not analysis which is based on reflection and memory .
It is , rather , the direct and immediate experiencing of whatever is happening , without the medium of thought .
It comes before thought in the perceptual process .
Mindfulness is present time awareness .
It takes place in the here and now .
It is the observance of what is happening right now , in the present moment .
It stays forever in the present , surging perpetually on the crest of the ongoing wave of passing time .
If you are remembering your second - grade teacher , that is memory .
When you then become aware that you are remembering your second - grade teacher , that is mindfulness .
If you then conceptualize the process and say to yourself , " Oh , I am remembering " , that is thinking .
Mindfulness is non-egoistic alertness .
It takes place without reference to self .
With Mindfulness one sees all phenomena without references to concepts like ' me ' , ' my ' or ' mine ' .
For example , suppose there is pain in your left leg .
Ordinary consciousness would say , " I have a pain . "
Using Mindfulness , one would simply note the sensation as a sensation .
One would not tack on that extra concept ' I ' .
Mindfulness stops one from adding anything to perception , or subtracting anything from it .
One does not enhance anything .
One does not emphasize anything .
One just observes exactly what is there - without distortion .
Mindfulness is goal - less awareness .
In Mindfulness , one does not strain for results .
One does not try to accomplish anything .
When one is mindful , one experiences reality in the present moment in whatever form it takes .
There is nothing to be achieved .
There is only observation .
Mindfulness is awareness of change .
it is observing the passing flow of experience .
It is watching things as they are changing .
it is seeing the birth , growth , and maturity of all phenomena .
It is watching phenomena decay and die .
Mindfulness is watching things moment by moment , continuously .
It is observing all phenomena - physical , mental or emotional - whatever is presently taking place in the mind .
One just sits back and watches the show .
Mindfulness is the observance of the basic nature of each passing phenomenon .
It is watching the thing arising and passing away .
It is seeing how that thing makes us feel and how we react to it .
It is observing how it affects others .
In Mindfulness , one is an unbiased observer whose sole job is to keep track of the constantly passing show of the universe within .
Please note that last point .
In Mindfulness , one watches the universe within .
The meditator who is developing Mindfulness is not concerned with the external universe .
It is there , but in meditation , one 's field of study is one 's own experience , one 's thoughts , one 's feelings , and one 's perceptions .
In meditation , one is one 's own laboratory .
The universe within has an enormous fund of information containing the reflection of the external world and much more .
An examination of this material leads to total freedom .
Mindfulness is participatory observation .
The meditator is both participant and observer at one and the same time .
If one watches one 's emotions or physical sensations , one is feeling them at that very same moment .
Mindfulness is not an intellectual awareness .
It is just here .
Mindfulness is objective , but it is not cold or unfeeling .
It is the wakeful experience of life , an alert participation in the ongoing process of living .
Mindfulness is an extremely difficult concept to define in words - not because it is complex , but because it is too simple and open .
The same problem crops up in every area of human experience .
The most basic concept is always the most difficult to pin down .
Look at a dictionary and you will see a clear example .
Long words generally have concise definitions , but for short basic words like ' the ' and ' is ' , definitions can be a page long .
And in physics , the most difficult functions to describe are the most basic - those that deal with the most fundamental realities of quantum mechanics .
Mindfulness is a pre-symbolic function .
You can play with word symbols all day long and you will never pin it down completely .
We can never fully express what it is .
However , we can say what it does .
Three Fundamental Activities
There are three fundamental activities of Mindfulness .
We can use these activities as functional definitions of the term : ( 1 ) Mindfulness reminds us of what we are supposed to be doing ; ( 2 ) it sees things as they really are ; and ( 3 ) it sees the deep nature of all phenomena .
Let 's examine these definitions in greater detail .
Mindfulness reminds you of what you are supposed to be doing .
In meditation , you put your attention on one item .
When your mind wanders from this focus , it is Mindfulness that reminds you that your mind is wandering and what you are supposed to be doing .
It is Mindfulness that brings your mind back to the object of meditation .
All of this occurs instantaneously and without internal dialogue .
Mindfulness is not thinking .
Repeated practice in meditation establishes this function as a mental habit which then carries over into the rest of your life .
A serious meditator pays bare attention to occurrences all the time , day in , day out , whether formally sitting in meditation or not .
This is a very lofty ideal towards which those who meditate may be working for a period of years or even decades .
Our habit of getting stuck in thought is years old , and that habit will hang on in the most tenacious manner .
The only way out is to be equally persistent in the cultivation of constant Mindfulness .
When Mindfulness is present , you will notice when you become stuck in your thought patterns .
It is that very noticing which allows you to back out of the thought process and free yourself from it .
Mindfulness then returns your attention to its proper focus .
If you are meditating at that moment , then your focus will be the formal object of meditation .
If your are not in formal meditation , it will be just a pure application of bare attention itself , just a pure noticing of whatever comes up without getting involved - " Ah , this comes up ... and now this , and now this ... and now this " .
Mindfulness is at one and the same time both bare attention itself and the function of reminding us to pay bare attention if we have ceased to do so .
Bare attention is noticing .
It re-establishes itself simply by noticing that it has not been present .
As soon as you are noticing that you have not been noticing , then by definition you are noticing and then you are back again to paying bare attention .
Mindfulness creates its own distinct feeling in consciousness .
It has a flavor - a light , clear , energetic flavor .
Conscious thought is heavy by comparison , ponderous and picky .
But here again , these are just words .
Your own practice will show you the difference .
Then you will probably come up with your own words and the words used here will become superfluous .
Remember , practice is the thing .
Mindfulness sees things as they really are .
It adds nothing to perception and it subtracts nothing .
it distorts nothing .
It is bare attention and just looks at whatever comes up .
Conscious thought pastes things over our experience , loads us down with concepts and ideas , immerses us in a churning vortex of plans and worries , fears and fantasies .
When mindful , you do n't play that game .
You just notice exactly what arises in the mind , then you notice the next thing .
" Ah , this ... and this ... and now this . "
It is really very simple .
Mindfulness sees the true nature of all phenomena .
Mindfulness and only Mindfulness can perceive the three prime characteristics that Buddhism teaches are the deepest truths of existence .
In Pali these three are called Anicca ( impermanence ) , Dukkha ( unsatisfactoriness ) , and Anatta ( selflessness - the absence of a permanent , unchanging , entity that we call Soul or Self ) .
These truths are not present in Buddhist teaching as dogmas demanding blind faith .
The Buddhists feel that these truths are universal and self - evident to anyone who cares to investigate in a proper way .
Mindfulness is the method of investigation .
Mindfulness alone has the power to reveal the deepest level of reality available to human observation .
At this level of inspection , one sees the following : ( a ) all conditioned things are inherently transitory ; ( b ) every worldly thing is , in the end , unsatisfying ; and ( c ) there are really no entities that are unchanging or permanent , only processes .
Mindfulness works like an electron microscope .
That is , it operates on so fine a level that one can actually see directly those realities which are at best theoretical constructs to the conscious thought process .
Mindfulness actually sees the impermanent character of every perception .
It sees the transitory and passing nature of everything that is perceived .
It also sees the inherently unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned things .
It sees that there is no sense grabbing onto any of these passing shows .
Peace and happiness cannot be found that way .
And finally , Mindfulness sees the inherent selflessness of all phenomena .
It sees the way that we have arbitrarily selected a certain bundle of perceptions , chopped them off from the rest of the surging flow of experience and then conceptualized them as separate , enduring , entities .
Mindfulness actually sees these things .
It does not think about them , it sees them directly .
When it is fully developed , Mindfulness sees these three attributes of existence directly , instantaneously , and without the intervening medium of conscious thought .
In fact , even the attributes which we just covered are inherently arbitrary .
They do n't really exist as separate items .
They are purely the result of our struggle to take this fundamentally simple process called Mindfulness and express it in the cumbersome and inherently unsuitable thought symbols of the conscious level .
Mindfulness is a process , but it does not take place in steps .
It is a holistic process that occurs as a unit : you notice your own lack of Mindfulness ; and that noticing itself is a result of Mindfulness ; and Mindfulness is bare attention ; and bare attention is noticing things exactly as they are without distortion ; and the way they are is Anicca , Dukkha , and Anatta ( impermanent , unsatisfactory , and self - less ) .
It all takes place in the space of a few mind - moments .
This does not mean , however , that you will instantly attain liberation ( freedom from all human weaknesses ) as a result of your first moment of Mindfulness .
Learning to integrate this material into your conscious life is another whole process .
And learning to prolong this state of Mindfulness is still another .
They are joyous processes , however , and they are well worth the effort .
Mindfulness ( Sati ) and Insight ( Vipassana ) Meditation
Mindfulness is the center of Vipassana Meditation and the key to the whole process .
it is both the goal of this meditation and the means to that end .
You reach Mindfulness by being ever more mindful .
One other Pali word that is translated into English as Mindfulness is Appamada , which means non-negligence or an absence of madness .
One who attends constantly to what is really going on in one 's mind achieves the state of ultimate sanity .
The Pali term Sati also bears the connotation of remembering .
It is not memory in the sense of ideas and pictures from the past , but rather clear , direct , wordless knowing of what is and what is not , of what is correct and what is incorrect , of what we are doing and how we should go about it .
Mindfulness reminds the meditator to apply his attention to the proper object at the proper time and to exert precisely the amount of energy needed to do the job .
When this energy is properly applied , the meditator stays constantly in a state of calm and alertness .
As long as this condition is maintained , those mind - states called ' hindrances ' or ' psychic irritants ' cannot arise - there is no greed , no hatred , no lust or laziness .
But we all are human and we do err .
Most of us are very human and we err repeatedly .
Despite honest effort , the meditator lets his Mindfulness slip now and then and he finds himself stuck in some regrettable , but normal , human failure .
It is Mindfulness that notices that change .
And it is Mindfulness that reminds him to apply the energy required to pull himself out .
These slips happen over and over , but their frequency decreases with practice .
Once Mindfulness has pushed these mental defilements aside , more wholesome states of mind can take their place .
Hatred makes way for loving kindness , lust is replaced by detachment .
It is Mindfulness which notices this change , too , and which reminds the Vipassana meditator to maintain that extra little mental sharpness needed to keep these more desirable states of mind .
Mindfulness makes possible the growth of wisdom and compassion .
Without Mindfulness they cannot develop to full maturity .
Deeply buried in the mind , there lies a mental mechanism which accepts what the mind perceives as beautiful and pleasant experiences and rejects those experiences which are perceived as ugly and painful .
This mechanism gives rise to those states of mind which we are training ourselves to avoid - things like greed , lust , hatred , aversion , and jealousy .
We choose to avoid these hindrances , not because they are evil in the normal sense of the word , but because they are compulsive ; because they take the mind over and capture the attention completely ; because they keep going round and round in tight little circles of thought ; and because they seal us off from living reality .
These hindrances cannot arise when Mindfulness is present .
Mindfulness is attention to present time reality , and therefore , directly antithetical to the dazed state of mind which characterizes impediments .
As meditators , it is only when we let our Mindfulness slip that the deep mechanisms of our mind take over - grasping , clinging and rejecting .
Then resistance emerges and obscures our awareness .
We do not notice that the change is taking place - we are too busy with a thought of revenge , or greed , whatever it may be .
While an untrained person will continue in this state indefinitely , a trained meditator will soon realize what is happening .
It is Mindfulness that notices the change .
It is Mindfulness that remembers the training received and that focuses our attention so that the confusion fades away .
And it is Mindfulness that then attempts to maintain itself indefinitely so that the resistance cannot arise again .
Thus , Mindfulness is the specific antidote for hindrances .
It is both the cure and the preventive measure .
Fully developed Mindfulness is a state of total non-attachment and utter absence of clinging to anything in the world .
If we can maintain this state , no other means or device is needed to keep ourselves free of obstructions , to achieve liberation from our human weaknesses .
Mindfulness is non-superficial awareness .
It sees things deeply , down below the level of concepts and opinions .
This sort of deep observation leads to total certainty , and complete absence of confusion .
It manifests itself primarily as a constant and unwavering attention which never flags and never turns away .
This pure and unstained investigative awareness not only holds mental hindrances at bay , it lays bare their very mechanism and destroys them .
Mindfulness neutralizes defilements in the mind .
The result is a mind which remains unstained and invulnerable , completely unaffected by the ups and downs of life .

He has a nimbleness of being able to understand a challenge , be it in original concept or in feedback , and execute against it in a way that 90 % there on his first try .

I watch movies and other DVDs on a computer rather than by using a dedicated DVD player box .
For various reasons , it is more comfortable to watch a movie by first copying it on a hard disk .
For example , often vobcopy will be able to rip it even though there are scratches or other errors .
Watching directly from the DVD will fail or be painful , because of frequent stops .
The command to rip a DVD is vobcopy -m .
I wrote a little script around that that also creates a . desktop file so that I can just double - click on it to start Totem .
Double - clicking on the directory opens a new Nautilus window , which is not useful for viewing a movie .

I went to FOSDEM in Brussels for the weekend .
I had a great time .
Some scattered notes :
Air travel still makes me feel like I 'm treated as cattle .
Leaving unnecessary stuff ( like my laptop ) at home was a good idea .
My luggage was lighter , and I spent less time fiddling with my computer and more time speaking with people .
Or at least trying to , I 'm still shy and introverted , so it 's hard to strike up conversations .
I still brought unnecessary stuff with me , like a sweater I never used .
It took up a lot of space in my backpack .
Djelibeybi , the Samsung YP- T portable music device that plays Ogg Vorbis files , turns out to be a really good idea for trips .
It 's small and light , and drowns out other people 's conversations on planes so that I can get some sleep .
A checklist of all the things I had with me made packing for the return trip a lot easier , since I did n't have to worry that I forgot something somewhere .
A paper notebook for taking notes in works as well as a laptop , except that my handwriting font is worse than the one in my editor .
An inflatable neck pillow made my sleeping on the plane almost comfortable , until it stopped keeping the air inside .
The " cork " that plugs the hole would n't stay inside anymore .
There must be a better way for this .
The pre-FOSDEM gathering in the Roy d'Espange restaurant is a wonderful thing .
It 's way too crowded and noisy , however .
Lots of people told me they were sorry to see me drop out of the DPL elections , and that they would really have liked to vote for me .
Thanks for that .
A few of them spent some energy trying to convince me to not drop out , but had no luck .
If you liked my draft of a platform , please try to push ideas from it to the candidates .
It 's the issues and goals that count , and what actually gets done , after all , not the person .
Conferences make sleeping difficult .
I was tired all the time .
Also , I walked around or was otherwise on my feet most of the time , and my feet are really , really sore .
Jeroen 's and Enrico's talk about the DPL team was nice .
My main impression , however , was that the DPL and DPL team have mainly concentrated on diplomacy between various parts of the project , and to me , that 's an indication that there 's something seriously wrong that needs fixing .
I brought four Debian amulets of glass and tin with me to be sold , and they were all sold , and at least one person was left without .
They 're made by a Finnish artist / craftsperson , and cost ten euros ( though the price may go up a bit the next time ) , and were not sold for profit .
Leena " Droidy " Romppainen arranged for them to be made .
If anyone wants one , we could have some more made and I can bring them to , say , Debconf in May .
Mail me .
Holger and Herman recorded talks in the Debian devroom .
This is a very nice thing , I can't wait to see mine .
It would be ultracool if we could get a setup where such recordings could easily be made whenever Debian people gather .
That 's a lot of work , though .
Martin Krafft 's talk was inspiring , and gives me hope that he will come up with good things in the future .
It was a talk about work to be done , so not yet concrete advice of how things can be done in better ways .
Ideas , not experiences , at this stage .
The next couple of years will hopefully be interesting .
My talk seems to not have been disliked .
Incidentally , Wouter , I did n't make a conscious reference to Hanna 's talk the previous year with the title of my talk , but it might have been unconscious .
Or it might just be that we 're both infested by Monty Python .
Hanna 's talk was as good as ever .
The factoid that stuck into my mind : 80 % of the men in the free software world claim they have not seen discriminatory behavior towards women , and 80 % of them women claim they have .
Also , the distinction of active versus passive discrimination seems to me to be important .
The former is usually easy to recognize and deal with , the latter is not .
There might be a parallel here to other kinds of abusive behavior on , say , Debian mailing lists .
Conferences == cool .

I have a tendency to sit statically for too long when using my computer , and this hurts my back .
To force myself to have breaks , I use GNOME 's Typing Monitor , set at a five minute break after 60 minutes of use .
This seems to work fairly well .
An unexpected result of this is that those frequent breaks are a great time to do housework , like putting things in their proper place , wash some dishes , or such .
Nothing major , but a little bit every hour makes a significant difference .

I 'm back from FOSDEM 2006 .
I had a very nice time , and will be writing a fuller entry about that later ; this is entry is to mention that I 've made my slides available .
I 'll be giving an updated version of the talk at Debconf6 in Mexico , so beware if you fear spoilers .

It has been a while since kmuto advertised this : Debian GNU / Linux device driver check page .
It is time to advertise it again , I think .
Basically , you paste the output of " lspci - n " , and it tells you which hardware on your PCI bus is supported , and by which driver .
Very , very cool , and makes it much easier to see what to buy ( assuming you can find a store that lets you , say , boot a machine with a live cd ) .
Many , many thanks to kmuto !

The nomination period for the Debian Project Leader is on again .
This means that the Finnish winter is at its worst , and indeed , as I write this , it is - 22 degrees Celsius outside .
The sun went down about six hours ago ; I woke up quite late , so I only saw half the sunset .
Back in November , while vacationing , I spent some time thinking about what the role of the DPL is , and now seems a good time to say it .
The actual work of developing and maintaining Debian is done by package maintainers , translators , a handful of infrastructure teams or other special purpose teams , bug reporters , and others .
It is not the job of the DPL ( in their role as DPL ) to take charge of the actual development : the DPL is not expected to administer debian.org machines , to fix RC bugs themselves , or to make decisions about release management .
Instead , the DPL's job is to help everyone else do those things .
If some part of project is n't working well due to resource shortage , or personality conflicts , or other issues , it is ultimately the DPL who needs to facilitate , mediate , or otherwise deal with it .
This is not uniquely the DPL 's job : any Debian member could step into a situation and help , but the project does need someone whose job it is to do that if no - one else will or succeeds .
Another important job of the leader ( again not uniquely ) is to provide inspiration .
Our leaders in the past few years have provided fairly little of that .
I would like us to have a DPL that inspires the project into setting and achieving goals that make us happy and make Debian the best operating system ever .
The important thing is to inspire , not to force , cajole , or otherwise unilaterally decide .
Not quite sure now how that should happen .
Perhaps the Finnish military saying that " leading is best done at the front " is applicable : an inspiring DPL is one who by his own work , and his own behavior , shows by example what a good , productive member of the Debian development community is like .
A third important job of the leader is to be the project 's public face to the rest of humanity .
Again , not uniquely , we have other members who are often prominently in the public eye , such as release managers or security people , but the DPL is the main such public face .
And finally , the fourth important job of the leader is to do the tasks assigned to him in the Debian Constitution .
These are not daily tasks , but they 're important , and these , at least , are uniquely the DPL 's domain .

My friend Kenneth " Cessu " Oksanen , who has only recently started writing a web log , wrote a response to my previous log entry : YASSSP = Yet Another Seven Secret of Successful Programmers .
I have no further comments on Cessu 's list .
I think it 's a swell list .
Permanent link to this entry
The Seven Secrets of Successful Programmers article was on reddit today .
I found it to be simplistic enough to be inane .
Also not particularly good advice in all parts .
For example , the article says that " [ m ] ost compilers will strip the comments from the executable program " .
Strictly speakig this is true : there is probably one or two compilers out there that retain comments in the binary code they put out .
They 're so rare , though , that it is quite utterly pointless to say anything about it .
Anyone who needs to be told that comments do n't impact performance or executable code size needs a course in basic programming , not secrets about being successful .
" A good indication that you have got the level of comment right : could someone understand what your program does if all but the comments were removed ? "
I disagree with this : better advice would be " could someone understand the code if you remove all the comments ? "
It 's the code that gets executed and so it is the code that should be used to communicate and not comments , except when code can't be made clear enough .
For example : if you write a wrapper around malloc to check that it succeeds , a comment explaining why it is acceptable to just kill the application on failure would be good , and very hard to express with code .
" In particular any code branch ( an IF .. THEN ... ELSE construction ) and any code repetition ( a WHILE ... END WHILE construction ) should be indented so that it is easy to see where they start and end . "
Gee , that surely is a big secret that only successful programmers know about .
" Expect the unexpected and deal with it .
Before you open a file , make sure that the file is present . "
That 's not a good way to deal with it .
It 's a race condition just waiting to blow in your face .
The correct way is to attempt opening a file and then deal with an error if it failed .
" Name your variables to aid readability .
- - -
The key is to be consistent and to be as informative as possible . "
Packing as much information as possible into a variable name can be a hindrance to readability .
Too many people read advice like this given in well - meaning but misguided articles and then go on to name loop variables nElementIndex .
The loop gets more readable if you name your loop variable just plain i .
The loop variable is not significant enough to warrant all the attention from a reader that a long name requires .
A short name in this context makes it much faster and easier to glance at the loop and see what it is doing .
Obviously names with scopes longer than a ( fairly short ) loop need to be more descriptive .
Here 's my seven secrets of being a successful programmer .
Learn to worship the goddess of simplicity .
KISS a lot .
This is much harder than it seems : it 's more difficult to be simple and good than to be complicated and adequate .
Simplicity starts with the specification of the program or system , and needs to permeate the design , and the implementation , at every step .
Pick good tools , and learn them well .
You need to know many tools , and know them well , or you 'll waste time on doing unecessary things .
Tools include software programs , books , algorithms , data structures , and mental models .
Learn editors , programming languages , Unix command line tools , and so on .
Learn at least three different paradigms for programming .
Learn how to learn and keep on learning .
New stuff is invented daily , and you need to keep up with it , or you 'll end up as useless as a COBOL programmer doing a web shop .
Develop debugging muscles .
This is perhaps the hardest thing to learn , since no - body seems to be teaching it .
You 'll be spending most of your time doing it .
Learn how to do testing well .
Unit tests , test driven development , black - box testing , integration testing , regression testing , test automation , ...
There 's lots of ways of reducing the likelyhood that code escapes your hands with bugs still in it .
It will inevitably happen , but if you know what you do , you can be better than most everyone else .
The industry standard for commercial , proprietary code seems to be around 20 to 30 bugs per thousand lines of code ; the Linux kernel has less than 1 , and is known as a cesspool of bug - infested muck , so surely you can do better ?
Learn to write prose well .
Then write a lot .
If you can't write a README , a manual page , or the specification for your next work project , who 's going to know about your great programming ?
Oh , you need to learn how to program well as well , and that is n't so easy either .
Knowing how to program well merely is n't enough to be a successful programmer .

Technical Issues of Separation in Function Cells and Value Cells

1. Preface
This paper is an adaptation of a report produced for X3J13 by the authors , a technical working group engaged in standardizing Common Lisp for ANSI
2. Introduction
In 1981 the emerging Common Lisp community turned to Scheme for some of its motivation and inspiration [ Steele 1984 ] .
Adopting lexical scooping proved one of the most important decisions the Common Lisp group ever made .
One aspect of Scheme that was not adopted , however , was a single namespace for functions and values , along with uniform evaluation rules for expressions in function and argument positions within the language .
At the 1986 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming , members of a part of the European Lisp community ( called the EuLisp group ) involved in the design of a Lisp dialect suggested that Common Lisp should have adopted this paradigm and that it might still be appropriate to do so .
Many people in the Common Lisp community were unhappy about the proposed change .
Technical , philosophical , and political arguments on both sides of the issue became quickly apparent .
Since the issue is controversial , the Common Lisp community felt that the technical issues should be clearly documented before any decision was attempted .
This paper addresses those technical issues .
3. Notation and Terminology
We shall begin by establishing some standard terminology .
Some readers may wish to skip this section and refer to it only if a question arises about some term .
A function is anything that may correctly be given to the FUNCALL or APPLY function and is to be executed as code when arguments are supplied .
A nonfunction is any other Lisp object .
An identifier is the name of a symbol or a variable .
This is not an exclusive partition : a variable can be a symbol .
An identifier is essentially a print name .
A symbol is a Lisp data structure that has a value cell , a property list , a function cell ( in Common Lisp ) , and so on .
A variable is an identifier that names a location
A binding is a pairing of an identifier with a location in which a Lisp object may be placed .
A lexical variable is a binding in which the identifier is not taken to refer to a symbol .
A symbol with a value in its value cell is taken to be a binding in that the name of the symbol is paired with the value cell of the symbol .
A special variable is a binding in which the identifier is taken to refer to a symbol .
An environment is the set of all bindings in existence at some given time .
We shall call a subset of an environment a subenvironment .
A namespace is a subenvironment .
Often the location parts of the bidings in a namespace contain objects used for some purpose , and the identifiers of the namespace are said to " name objects " used for that purpose ; if the types of objects that can be stored in the location parts of bindings in a namespace are used for a purpose such that only objects of a certain type can be used for that purpose , then we say that " the objects in the namespace are restricted " to that type of object .
The objects that are stored in the location parts of bindings in a namespace are not necessarily restricted to first - class Lisp objects .
In this paper , there are two namespaces of concern , which we shall term the " value namespace " and the " function namespace . "
Other namespaces include tag names ( used by TAGBODY and GO ) and block names ( used by BLOCK and RETURN - FROM ) , but the objects in the location parts of their bindings are not first - class Lisp objects .
The value namespace is a subenvironment whose location parts are not restricted to any particular kind of object .
The purpose of this namespace is to associate values with variables when those variables occur in certain textual contexts .
The binding of an identifier referring to a symbol along with a value cell is in the value namespace .
Lexical variables , such as those introduced by LET , LAMBDA , and MULTIPLE - VALUE - BIND , are in the value namespace .
The function namespace is a subenvironment whose purpose is to associate functions with variables when those variables occur in certain textual contexts .
We assume that the location parts of a function namespace always contain functions .
The binding of an identifier referring to a symbol along with a function cell is always in the function namespace .
Functional lexical variables , such as those introduced by FLET , LABELS , and MACROLET , are in the function namespace .
Lisp 's evaluation rules tell , given an expression and an environment , how to produce a value or values and a new environment .
In order to do this , the meanings of identifiers in a program text need to be determined , and this requires determining in which namespace to interpret the identifiers .
For example , a symbol can have something in its value cell and something else in its function cell ; which of these objects is referred to by the symbol in a piece of code depends upon which namespace is defined to be used for the context in which the symbol appears .
The function and value namespaces are distinct in Common Lisp because , given a single name , the function namespace mapping and the value namespace mapping can yield distinct objects .
The two mappings might yield the same object , but that would be mere coincidence .
In this paper , we shall refer to two abstract dialects of Lisp called Lisp 1 and Lisp 2 .
Lisp 1 has a single namespace that serves a dual role as the function namespace and value namespace ; that is , its function namespace and value namespace are not distinct .
In Lisp 1 , the functional position of a form and the argument positions of forms are evaluated according to the same rules .
Scheme [ Rees 1986 ] and the language being designed by the EuLisp group [ Padget 1986 ] are Lisp 1 dialects .
Lisp 2 has distinct function and value namespaces .
In Lisp 2 , the rules for evaluation in the functional position of a form are distinct from those for evaluation in the argument positions of the form .
Common Lisp is a Lisp 2 dialect .
4. Historical Perspective
Most Lisp dialects adopted a two - namespace approach to the naming problem .
To some extent this is because most dialects followed Lisp 1.5 [ McCarthy 1965 ] or dialects derived from Lisp 1.5
Lisp 1.5 broke symbols into values and functions ; values were stored on an association list , and function on the property lists of symbols .
Complied and interpreted code worked in different ways .
In the interpreter , the association list was where all bindings were kept .
When an identifier was encountered ) an ' atomic symbol ' in Lisp 1.5 terminology ) , it was taken as a variable to be evaluated for its value .
First the APVAL part of the symbol was interrogated -- an APVAL was " A Permanent , system - defined VALue " .
Stored in a specific place in the symbol .
Second , the association list was searched .
Finally , if no binding was found , an error was signaled .
When a combination was encountered , the function position was evaluated differently from other positions .
First , the symbol was interrogated to see whether there was a function definition associated with it ; then the association list was searched .
Here we can see two namespaces at work , though nonsymbol variables were treated somewhat uniformly ( Lisp 1.5 did not have lexical variables in interpreted code ) : when there were no function definitions associated with a symbol , there was one namespace , which was explicitly represented by the association list .
Complied code worked a slightly different way , and from its internals we can see where the two namespaces came about in descendants of Lisp 1.5 .
The Lisp 1.5 compiler supported ' common ' and ' special ' variables .
A common variable enabled compiled and interpreted code to communicate with each other .
A common variable was bound on an explicit association list ; to evaluate such a variable , a call to EVAL was emitted to determine the value .
A special variable was the compiler 's modeling of free variables and closely matched what is now called ' shallow binding . '
Ordinary variables compiled into what we have termed lexical variables .
Thus , we see all of the components of the two - namespace world in Lisp 1.5 , along with some of the components of the one - namespace world .
It seems that the designers of Lisp 1.5 thought of function names as being different from variable names -- the Lisp 1.5 interpreter looked at the property list of the named atomic symbol first , and so it can be argued that a function was considered a property of a symbol .
The designers used the terminology that a symbol " stands for " a function while a variable " refers " to a value .
Lisp for the PDP - 6 at MIT adopted the style of the Lisp 1.5 special variables for dynamic binding in both compiled and interpreted code , thereby eliminated common variables .
Compilers were still written that were to try to interpret special variables as lexical variables in as many places as possible .
The value of a symbol was stored in the value cell of the symbol , and the function remained on the property list as it did in Lisp 1.5 .
MacLisp [ Pitman 1983 ] is a direct descendant of the PDP - 6 Lisp and is a Lisp 2 dialect .
MacLisp uses a sophisticated form of link table , which is made possible by the separation of namespaces .
In particular , function - defining functions have controlled access into the places where functions are stored so that the link tables can be correctly maintained .
Vax NIL is a descendant of MacLisp and was intended to be the successor to MacLisp running on the Vax .
It uses the same sort of link table ideas found in MacLisp for fast function calling .
The designers of MacLisp and NIL had performance in mind when they designed the two - namespace layout .
A description of Vax NIL can be found in [ Gabriel 1985 ] .
S - 1 Lisp [ Brooks 1982 ] is a dialect of NIL for the S - 1 Mark IIA , and therefore it is a Lisp 2 dialect .
Spice Lisp is an intellectual descendant of MacLisp and this is a Lisp 2 dialect .
A description of Spice Lisp can be found in [ Gabriel 1985 ] .
ZetaLisp [ Symbolics 1986b ] is an intellectual descendant of MacLisp and , for reasons like those that motivated the NIL designers , became a Lisp 2 dialect .
Common Lisp was the result of a compromise between a number of dialects of Lisp , most of them descendants of MacLisp , all of them Lisp 2 s. A major aspect of the Common Lisp movement was compromise along political lines .
5. Notational Simplicity
Many believe that having the evaluation rules for expressions treat the function position and the argument positions differently is inelegant .
In Lisp 2 different treatment of functional and argument positions is needed because there are different namespaces or environments , for function bindings and for value bindings .
Lisp 2 is slightly more complicated than Lisp 1 in situations where we would want to do either of the following :
Fetch the value of an identifier in the value namespace and call it as a function
Fetch the value of an identifier in the function namespace and pass it around as a value .
To use the value of an identifier in the value namespace as a function , Lisp 2 provides this notation :
( FUNCALL < identifier > . < arguments >)
For example , in Lisp 2 one would write
( DEFUN MAPC - 1 ( F L ) ( DOLIST ( X L ) ( FUNCALL F X ) ) )
In Lisp 1 , one would write
( DEFUN MAPC -1 ( F L ) ( DOLIST ( X L ) ( F X ) ) )
To use the value of an identifier in the function namespace as a normal value , Lisp 2 provides this notation :
( FUNCTION < identifier > )
which is often abbreviated as simply
#'<identifier >
For example , in Lisp 2 one would write
( MAPC #'PRINT '( A B C D ) )
In Lisp 1 , one would write
( MAPC PRINT '( A B C D ) )
The differences are more striking in a larger , more complex example .
In Lisp 2 , one can write the Y operator as
( DEFUN Y ( F ) ( ( LAMBDA ( G ) #'( LAMBDA ( H ) ( FUNCALL ( FUNCALL F ( FUNCALL G G ) ) H ) ) )
#'( LAMBDA ( G ) #'( LAMBDA ( H ) ( FUNCALL ( FUNCALL F ( FUNCALL G G ) ) H ) ) ) ) )
while in Lisp 1 , one can write
( DEFUN Y ( F ) ( ( LAMBDA ( G ) ( LAMBDA ( H ) ( ( F ( G G ) ) H ) ) ) ( LAMBDA ( G ) ( LAMBDA ( H ) ( ( F ( G G ) ) H ) ) ) ) )
The call to this operator in order to compute 6 ! in Lisp 2 would look like
( FUNCALL ( Y #'( LAMBDA ( FN ) #'( LAMBDA ( X ) ( IF ( ZEROP X ) 1 (* X ( FUNCALL FN (- X 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
6 )
In Lisp 1 , the same call would look like
((Y ( LAMBDA ( FN ) ( LAMBDA ( X ) ( IF ( ZEROP X ) 1 (* X ( FN (- X 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) 6 )
Some argue that the Lisp 1 form is easier to read because it is more concise .
Others feel that the Lisp 2 form is easier to read because the use of functions whose names are not constant is clearly marked .
Probably a programmer who frequently passes functions as arguments or who uses passed arguments functionally finds Lisp 1 syntax easier to read than Lisp 2 syntax ; the programmer who infrequently passes functions as arguments and rarely uses passed arguments functionally probably prefers to use a different syntax on those occasions .
6. Multiple Denotations for a Single Name
Some find it simple and clear to have a single meaning for a name .
Fewer meanings mean less to remember .
For example , suppose a programmer has defined the function F as
( DEFUN F ( X ) (+ X 1 ) )
Then suppose the programmer is writing a new function , G , and wants it to take the functional parameter F , which is to apply to its other argument .
Suppose the programmer writes
( DEFUN G ( F ) ( F 3 ) )
Issues of defined program semantics aside , it 's probably obvious that the programmer meant to call the function named by the formal parameter F on the argument 3 .
In Lisp 2 , however , this function will ignore its argument named F and simply invoke the globally defined function named F on 3 .
Notice that this is precisely what Lisp 1.5 would have done .
Unfortunately , not all situations are as clear - cut as this .
For example , consider the following :
( DEFUN PRINT - SQUARES ( LIST ) ( DOLIST ( ELEMENT LIST ) ( PRINT ( LIST ELEMENT ( EXPT ELEMENT 2 ) ) ) ) )
In this definition , there are three uses of the name LIST .
The first is in the function 's formal parameter list .
The second is in initialization of the DOLIST variable .
The third is in the PRINT expression .
This program , which is valid in current Common Lisp , would not be valid in Lisp 1 because the name LIST could not simultaneously denote a list of numbers and a function .
Such uses are familiar cause of programmer errors in Lisp 1 .
In Lisp 1 , a common way to write this definition would be
( DEFUN PRINT - SQUARES ( LST ) ( DOLIST ( ELEMENT LST ) ( PRINT ( LIST ELEMENT ( EXPT ELEMENT 2 ) ) ) ) )
In the function PRINT - SQUARES , the parameter named LST is better named LIST - OF - NUMBERS , though some programmers would not use such a long name .
As should be clear from these examples , the advantage of treating the function and argument positions the same is that using parameters as functions is made more convenient syntactically .
The disadvantage is that not using parameters as functions is made less convenient syntactically because parameter names must be more carefully chosen so that they do not shadow the names of globally defined functions that will be needed in the function body .
Of course , care in naming must be observed in Lisp 2 anyway to ensure that variable names chosen for some inner binding do not shadow the names of the variables bound by outer binding constructs .
Consider this example :
( DEFUN HACK -LIST ( LIST ) ( LET ( ( LST ( HACK - LIST LIST ) ) ) ( HACK - SOME -MORE LIST LST ) ( SHUFFLE LIST LST ) ) )
There are two variables that could naturally be named ' LIST , ' and the programmer must choose which one to so name .
Nevertheless , the degree of care required to avoid name collisions in Lisp 1 is more theoretically no less than that required in Lisp 2 but has been observed to be far more , a point to which we shall return later .
The following is a simple example of some of the important issues in variable naming ( using mixed Lisp 1 and Lisp 2 notation ) :
( DEFUN ODDITY ( LIST ) ( LIST LIST LIST ) ) ( ODDITY #'CONS )
Depending on which way the issue is decided , the possible return values from this function might be
(#< SUBR CONS > .
#< SUBR CONS >) ( #< SUBR CONS > #< SUBR CONS >)
7. Referential Clarity
In Lisp 2 , deciding whether to use the function or the value is impossible unless the context is known .
These two forms result in different interpretations of an expression , x :
( x ... )
(... x ...)
To some programmers , a basic ' rule ' of Lisp style is that code is clearest when the least amount of context is necessary to determine the meaning of an expression .
Unfortunately , that rule is violated in Lisp 2 .
In a presentation at the 1986 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming , Steele complained that the α operator in Connection MachineTM Lisp [ Steele 1986 ] , which he wanted to implement as a simple read macro , could not be implemented that way because of this context problem .
The expansion of the α operator depended on whether it was expanding in a functional or an argument position .
In Lisp 1 this problem would not have arisen .
In Lisp 2 the problem could be solved by introducing ' lambda macros ' such as those that are already used in ZetaLisp .
8. Compiler Simplicity
Current Common
Lisp compilers use special case code when deciding which namespace mapping to use when examining a variable .
The maintainers of some Common Lisp compilers claim that a change from Lisp 2 to Lisp 1 semantics would result in simpler , smaller , faster compilers .
One reason is that knowledge about which namespace is in effect at any point is often procedurally embedded .
By merging the two namespaces , the same pieces of code can be used in more places , thus reducing the number of places where such information is represented and this making maintenance simpler .
The maintainers of other Common Lisp compilers claim , however , that a change from Lisp 2 to Lisp 1 semantics would reduce the complexity of their compilers little if at all -- that it might force small changes at points distributed throughout the system , but that the compiler would not change very much .
There is even some concern that the complexity of compilers might increase because of such a change .
This belief is based on the observation that the change would effectively cause type information to be lost .
Specifically , for Lisp 2 a compiler writer can assume that whatever is in a function cell must be a function ; for Lisp 1 a compiler writer cannot assume that if a programmer has written an expression that invokes a function associated with a symbol , the contents of the value cell of that symbol will be a function when the function invocation is performed .
In Lisp 1 , this information sometimes may be recoverable , but the compiler may have to perform extensive type inference to do so .
Often , the compiler will have to take an unnecessarily conservative approach .
Consider a Lisp 2 function such as
( DEFUN F ( X ) ( G X ) )
Even in this simple function , we are assuming that
( SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'G )
is a function .
When a good compiler is directed to produce safe code , that compiler must concern itself with the question of whether a cell will ever contain a nonfunction .
For some computers , if the compiler cannot show that the contents of the function cell is always a function , it must generate less efficient code .
Common Lisp compilers can be written that assume that function cells always contain functions in Lisp 2 because it is legal to forbid nonfunctions from ever being placed in the function cell .
For example , Vax Lisp [ Digital 1986 ] does this .
Consequently , the Vax Lisp compiler can safely generate code that simply jumps to the contents of the value cell of G .
In Lisp 1 , however , this is not possible unless new declarations are introduced .
The conclusion here is not that some compilers are better than others , but that compilers may vary widely in their nature , and therefore the effects of the proposed change may vary widely depending upon the implementation .
9. Higher Order Functions
While functions , like Y , that directly manipulate other functions can be written in either Lisp 1 or Lisp 2 , many programmers feel that they can be written more perspicuously in Lisp 1 ; therefore , the more cumbersome notation of Lisp 2 does nothing to encourage and may even discourage the writing of such functions .
10 . Abstraction Sharing
In Lisp 1 it is easier to define a piece of code that shares abstractions between data and functions .
Again , this is possible in Lisp 2 , but it is not an encouraged style .
The problem is that it is a burden to think about which namespace will be used for various variables .
11 . Multiprocessing
A pure or side - effect - free functional programming style has been seen to be successful in multiprocessing ; therefore it would seem that a Lisp - like functional style would be conducive to multiprocessing .
That is , a functional style of programming might result in programs that are more easily rendered into a parallel style .
For evidence of this , look at typical Common Lisp programs and contrast their style and suitability for parallelization with the same programs as they might be written in Scheme .
By transitivity , since Lisp 1 tends to encourage functional programming style , it is also more conducive to multiprocessing .
Of course , Common Lisp is not designed to accommodate multiprocessing , and it would take more than uniting of the function and value namespaces to allow Common Lisp to seriously support multiprocessing .
Integrated support of multiprocessing is not currently an explicit goal of Common Lisp .
Nevertheless , it seems apparent that experience with a more functional programming style will provide a good foundation for programmers who later move to a language that does support multiprocessing .
12 . Number of Namespaces
There is really a larger number of namespaces than just the two that are discussed here .
As we noted earlier , other namespaces include at least those of blocks and tags ; type names and declaration names are often considered namespaces .
Thus , the names Lisp 1 and Lisp 2 , which we have been using are misleading .
The names Lisp 5 and Lisp 6 might be more appropriate .
Since there are other namespaces , the uniting of the function and value of namespaces does not accomplish as much as might initially appear .
Even if they are united , the interpretation of a symbol in a Common Lisp program would still depend on the context to disambiguate variables from symbols , symbols from the type names , and so on .
On the other hand , some proponents of uniting have suggested that in time these other namespaces would be collapsed as well .
Dialects of Scheme have done this -- some to a greater extent than others .
The hope is that when all namespaces are reduced to a single one , there will be a single simple evaluation rule for all identifiers .
Because Lisp contains QUOTE , there is actually an arbitrary number of namespaces because of the existence of functions like GET , and GETHASH that allow users to effectively associate new kinds information with symbols .
Even if the underlying Lisp supports exactly one namespace , programmers will be able to invent other namespaces .
Reducing the number of namespaces in the Lisp to one will help programmers keep track of their own namespaces , but the " one identifier , one meaning " motto will not necessarily apply to user code .
Suppose a programmer has defined a macro like this :
( DEFMACRO ADD - AUTOMOBILE ( AUTO SPECS-FN DATABASE ) `( LET ( ( THE - CAR ( GETHASH ( QUOTE , AUTO ) * AUTO - HASH- TABLE * ) ) )
( ADD - AUTOMOBILE-INTERNAL THE -CAR ( FUNCALL , SPEC-FN THE - CAR ) , DATABASE ) ) )
Then interpreting the identifier CAR - HPM in the next form is not very different from interpreting other identifiers using the built - in namespaces :
( ADD - AUTOMOBILE CAR-HPM CURRENT -YEAR -SPECS CAR-DATABASE )
An argument has been presented that may have left the impression that because a Lisp 1 compiler can be simpler than a Lisp 2 compiler there is an implied simplicity of Lisp 1 over Lisp 2 .
But the question of whether a compiler for Lisp 1 is more or less complicated than a compiler for Lisp 2 is a statement about the abstract effect of the different namespace complexities .
The additional meanings that can be associated with symbols can and do have a very powerful effect .
Indeed , much of the power of associative functions like GET derives from a structured pun -- the fact that a single symbol may have more than one kind of information associated with it .
The power and importance of this kind of structured interplay between arbitrary namespaces is hard to deny .
13 . Macros and Name Collisions .
Some contend that macros as they exist in Common Lisp have severe semantic difficulties .
Macros expand into an expression that is composed of symbols that have no attached semantics .
When substituted back into the program , a macro expansion could conceivably take on quite surprising meaning depending on the local environment .
Some symbols that ultimately appear in the expansion of a macro are obtained during macro definition through its parameter list from the macro consumer .
It is possible to use those symbols safely .
However , writers of macros often work on the hypothesis that additional functional variables may be referenced in macros as if they were globally constant .
Consider the following macro definition for Lisp 1 or Lisp 2 :
( DEFMACRO MAKE -FOO ( THINGS ) `( LIST ' FOO , THINGS ) )
Here FOO is quoted , THINGS is taken from the parameter list for the Macro , but LIST is free .
The writer of this macro definition is almost certainly assuming either that LIST is locally bound in the calling environment and is trying to refer to that locally bound name or that list is to be treated as constant and that the author of the code will not locally bind LIST .
In practice , the latter assumption is almost always made .
If the consumer of the above macro definition writes
( DEFUN FOO ( LIST ) ( MAKE - FOO ( CAR LIST ) ) )
in Lisp 1 , there will probably be a bug in the code .
Here is another example of code that would be a problem in Lisp 1 :
( DEFMACRO FIRST ( LIST ) `( CAR , LIST ) ) ( DEFMACRO REST ( LIST ) `( CDR , LIST ) ) ( DEFUN TEST -CAR ( CAR TEST - LIST )
" The ' driver ' program for Frobozz Automobile , Inc. 's quality assurance test . "
( DO ( ( TESTS TEST - LIST ( REST TESTS ) ) ) ( ( NULL TESTS ) ) ( ( FIRST TESTS ) CAR ) ) )
It 's worth emphasizing , however , that these problems occur in either Lisp 1 or Lisp 2 .
the issue is that they are more likely to occur in Lisp 1 because there is less contextual information available .
Here is an example of how the problem arises in normal Common Lisp :
( DEFMACRO FOO ( X Y ) `( CONS 'FOO ( CONS ,X ( CONS , Y NIL ) ) ) ) ( DEFUN BAZ ( X Y ) ( FLET ( ( CONS ( X Y ) ( CONS Y X ) ) ) ( FOO X Y ) ) )
( BAZ 1 2 ) returns ( (( NIL .
2 ) .
1 ) . FOO ) even though it seems that ( FOO 1 2 ) might have been intended by the programmer .
Although few implementations support its full generality in file compilation , a strict reading of the Common Lisp specification seems to imply that writing the following should be acceptable :
( DEFMACRO FOO ( X Y ) ; take deep breath `( FUNCALL ', #' CONS 'FOO ( FUNCALL ', #' CONS ,X ( FUNCALL ', #' CONS , Y NIL ) ) ) ) ( DEFUN BAZ ( X Y ) ( FLET ( ( CONS ( X Y ) ( CONS Y X ) ) ) ( FOO X Y ) ) )
Here ( BAZ 1 2 ) should evaluate to ( FOO 1 2 ) just as everyone expected .
Of course , FUNCALL is subject to the same problems as CONS was ; either FUNCALL must be considered a constant function or a construct such as
('#< COMPILED-CODE CONS > ...)
Should be specially understood by the compiler and interpreter .
Given all of this , the thoughtful reader might ask :
Why do macros appear work as often as they do ?
The answer seems to be based in history and statistics rather than in some theoretical foundation .
In dialects preceding Common Lisp , such as MacLisp , it was fortunate that FLET , LABELS , MACROLET did not exist .
Thus in these dialects there was an extremely high likelihood that the function bindings of identifiers in the macro expander 's environment would be compatible with the function bindings of the same identifiers in the program environment .
This coupled with the fact that the only free references that most macro expansions tend to make are functional meant that writers of macros could guess enough information about how the expansion would be understood and could develop fairly reliable macro packages .
With the advent of FLET , LABELS , and MACROLET , the risk of conflict is considerably higher .
The Scheme community , which has long had constructs with power equivalent to that of these forms , has not adopted a macro facility .
This is partly because macros have generally seemed like a semantically empty concept to many of the Scheme designers .
Common Lisp programmers probably have little trouble because they are still programming in a MacLisp programming style , using forms like FLET and LABELS in limited ways .
People who use FLET and LABELS heavily may well have learned Lisp with Scheme and do not use macros heavily , or they understand the issues outlined here and write macros carefully .
As time goes on , it should not be surprising to find users of Common Lisp macros reporting more name collision problems .
A change from Lisp 2 to Lisp 1 semantics for identifiers would probably speed up the increase in these problems .
14 . The Benefits of Macros
Although macros have semantic difficulties , they are pragmatically useful , as are other constructs that do n't add semantic power to a language .
For example , in a Lisp with IF and PROGN , the additional semantic power of COND is null .
Yet COND buys stylistic improvements to some Lisp code , especially to code written with IF and PROGN that would be indented too far to the right in proper indentation style or code that would not highlight the relationships of the conditions being tested because they would not be placed , vertically , near each other .
Therefore , semantically poor constructs like macros can help programmers organize their code to be more readable and maintainable , and so that it expresses the abstractions in such a way that the code runs efficiently .
Common Lisp programmers are judged on their ability to use macros appropriately and judiciously .
Without the pervasive use of macros , a modern Lisp programming style would not have been developed , and Lisp as a mature programming language would have never come about .
Many believe that the powerful Lisp macro facility is the main reason that Lisp has been successful over the years .
Macros have formed the basis for efficient abstraction within Lisp .
They can be used to optimize the generated code by examining the forms passed to the macro definition function , and different code can be produced depending on the shape of those forms .
Macros can be used to define extensions to Lisp because macros enable the programmer to define new evaluation rules .
Most programmers simply do not experience the name collision problems mentioned in the previous section with the frequency that seems to be appropriate to the depth of the problem , largely because of the existence of a function namespace .
FLET and LABELS define functions , and programmers treat function names more carefully than nonfunction names .
Therefore , letting function names be freely referenced in a macro definition is not a big problem .
There are two ways to look at the arguments regarding macros and namespaces .
The first is that a single namespace is of fundamental importance , and therefore macros are problematic .
The second is that macros are fundamental , and therefore a single namespace is problematic .
15 . Space Efficiency
If a symbol is used both for its value and as a function , it currently costs on additional space .
Any program that has symbols that are used to denote distinct functions and values , however , would have to be changed .
In general , this means that some new symbols would be introduced .
In most cases , the number of new symbols introduced would probably be small , but there might be pathological applications that would be exceptions .
In the Lucid Lisp system [ Lucid 1986 ] , there are 14 of these symbols , and in these cases the value cell is being used as a cache for an object related to the function .
In the MACSYMA system [ Symbolics 1986a ] there are roughly 35 of these symbols out of a total of 10,000 .
Using the same name to refer to both a function and a value cell can be more space efficient , since it means only one additional cell to an existing data structure that already has on the order of 5 to 10 cells .
This issue can be illustrated quantitatively .
Let n be the number of symbols in a system , let S 1 be the space occupied by the average symbol in an implementation of Lisp 1 , let S 2 be the space occupied by the average symbol in an implementation of Lisp 2 , and let x be the number of symbols that must be added to a system to resolve name conflicts .
Then the space saved by having separate environments is
( n + x ) S 1 - nS 2
For example , if n is 8000 , x is 14 , S 1 is 28 ( bytes ) , and S 2 is 32 ( bytes ) , then the space saved by Lisp 2 is - 31608 ( bytes ) .
That is , 12 % of the symbol space used by such a Lisp 2 implementation might be saved if it were made to be a Lisp 1 implementation .
For there are to be no net change in the amount of storage between two - namespace and a one - namespace Lisp , more than 1100 symbols would need to be added to the system to resolve name conflicts .
The issue is not likely to be important .
16 . Time Efficiency
In Lisp 2 , a function call to a function associated with a symbol involves the use of indirection through the symbol 's function cell , which points to a piece of code possibly with an intermediate pointer through a procedure object , as in S - 1 Lisp .
An optimization to this is to eliminate the indirection through the symbol 's function cell and have a function call jump directly to the correct code object , perhaps indirecting through a link table in order for DEFUN and SETF of SYMBOL - FUNCTION to cause existing running code to call a redefined function , the operation of changing a symbol 's function cell must invalidate the link table or otherwise cause the correct new link to be made .
In Lisp 1 , the straightforward implementation of function calling would check the value cell for a valid function on each function call .
To use the link table optimization in Lisp 1 , SETQ rather than SETF of SYMBOL - FUNCTION must do the invalidating or relinking .
Of course , only an assignment to a symbol needs to be checked .
In the worst case SETQ would become a function call rather than being open - code ; in this situation , the speed loss could be the difference between a single instruction and about 30 instructions .
In the expected case a single SETQ would become two SETQ s .
The implementation for this case is for each symbol to have a hidden function cell that always contains a valid function , perhaps a trap function .
Function calls go through the hidden function cell as usual , but DEFUN and SETQ always manipulate both the value cell and the hidden function cell .
Every SETQ also assigns a trap function to the hidden function cell , so that the next function call through that symbol runs trap code that establishes the valid link to the real code or signals an error .
On some stock hardware , tricks with the addressing hardware and word alignment can be played to get away with having only a value cell and not having SETQ implementation the additional overhead for the SETQ of symbols should not cause more than 10 % degradation in the most pessimistic inner loop , and overall it is unlikely to cause a noticeable degradation in a large system .
The number and complexity of space and time trade - offs discussed here might be confusing .
First , the reason that a sophisticated function - calling method is chosen by Lisp implementors for stock hardware implementations is that a shorter and faster function - calling sequence can be gained using various tricks , some of which require tables of information needed when functions are redefined ; usually the objects representing compiled functions in these implementations can be shortened as well .
The space gained by these shortenings is balanced fairly well with the storage needed for the tables .
Second , changing from Lisp 2 to Lisp 1 results in a smaller Lisp image because of the reduction in storage needed for symbols .
Third , the additional code needed for testing assignment of symbols decreases the speed of running code and increases its size .
If a function cell is supported as a means of providing fast function calling , then there is no space gained by eliminating the function cell - - each symbol still has one .
Because assignment to symbols is infrequent and because changing function definitions associated with symbols is rare , the speed trade - off probably results in a negligible loss in speed , and the space trade off probably results in a small space increase .
This issue is an illustration of the earlier claim that simplifying the surface language might not always result in a simpler implementation strategy :
This is one of several ways that the implementation might become more complicated as a result of such a change .
17 . Global Variables , Special Variables , and Constants .
A free variable in Common Lisp is currently taken to be a dynamic rather than a lexical reference because there is no global lexical environment in Common Lisp .
In this code
( DEFUN PLUS ( X Y ) (+ X Y ) ) ( DEFUN SOMEWHAT-MORE -THAN ( X ) ( PLUS X * SOMEWHAT * ) )
The reference to * SOMEWHAT * is special ( dynamic ) .
On the surface , in Lisp 1 the reference to PLUS is free also , and thus it is special ( dynamic ) .
When a variable is declared special , a free reference to it is to the most recent dynamically bound value for it ; all bindings of it become special ( dynamic ) bindings .
When a variable is declared constant , free references to it are to its permanent constant value , and compilers are free to fold that constant into the code they emit .
We introduce the concept of global variables ; when a variable is global , free references to it are to the value cell of the symbol named by the variable , and all bindings of it are still lexical .
To avoid a compiler warning for free use of a variable like * SOMEWHAT * , the variable is declared SPECIAL .
In order to have compilers for Lisp 1 not to warn about the free use of PLUS , it would be unfortunate to have to declare it SPECIAL .
As noted , in Common Lisp the default for free variable references is SPECIAL ; that is , a free variable reference is taken to be a special variable reference .
If the default in Lisp 1 were that free variable references were global ( lexical ) , then it would make sense for a compiler not to warn about such free variable references .
17.1 An Approach to Free Functional Variables
One approach to this problem would be to introduce a new declaration that made a variable ( lexically ) GLOBAL but not SPECIAL .
DEFUN could implicitly declare function names GLOBAL .
With such a declaration , in a deep - bound Lisp 1 , the compiler would not need to emit code to search the dynamic binding chain to determine what code to invoke for PLUS in SOMEWHAT - MORE - THAN .
Given such a declaration , it would still be possible in Lisp 1 to write definitions such as the following :
( DEFUN ZAP ( FN X Y ) ( LET ( ( PLUS ( LAMBDA ( X Y ) ( MAPCAR PLUS X Y ) ) ) ) ( LIST ( PLUS ( FN X ) ( FN Y ) ) ( PLUS ( FN ( FN X ) ) ( FN ( FN Y ) ) ) ) ) )
where PLUS is defined above , without worrying that the LET - binding of PLUS would affect the argument FN .
To explain the issues better , here the references to PLUS are numbered and the definition is shown in a different typeface :
( DEFUN ZAP ( FN X Y ) ( LET ( ( PLUS 1 ( LAMBDA ( X Y ) ( MAPCAR PLUS 2 X Y ) ) ) ) ( LIST ( PLUS 3 ( FN X ) ( FN Y ) ) ( PLUS 4 ( FN ( FN X ) ) ( FN ( FN Y ) ) ) ) ) )
PLUS 1 is a lexical binding of the variable named PLUS ; PLUS 2 references the global value of the symbol named PLUS ; PLUS 3 and PLUS 4 are lexical references to the binding of PLUS 1 .
If FN is bound to a function that is defined likes this , for instance ,
( DEFUN BAZ ( X ) ( LIST X ( PLUS 5 X X ) ) )
then PLUS 5 refers to the global value of PLUS rather than to the LET - bound value in FOO .
If DEFUN were to declare function names SPECIAL , then PLUS 2 and PLUS 5 would refer to the SPECIAL binding for PLUS , namely PLUS 1 , in this example .
17.2 A Second Approach to Free Functional Variables
An alternative approach is for DEFUN to implicitly declare function names constant .
Redefining a function might cause some compilers to warn that some constant function definitions had been folded into code .
A mixed approach would be for all built - in Common Lisp functions to be declared constant , while DEFUN would implicitly declare function names global .
Closely related to this issue is the fact that there is currently no system - provided dynamic variation of FLET and LABELS in Common Lisp , although in a nonmultiprocessing environment they can be simulated by creative use of UNWIND - PROTECT .
If Common Lisp were made a Lisp 1 dialect , dynamic functional variables would be something the language would get ' for free . '
And if their use became popular , it might be desirable to have two kinds of DEFUN -- one that created special definitions and another that created lexical definitions .
18 . Compatibility Issues .
A transition from Lisp 2 semantics to Lisp 1 semantics would introduce a considerable amount of incompatibility .
There is the question of implementor problems as well as user problems .
18.1 Change Existing Code
Large bodies of code already exist that assume the current semantics .
That code would not have to be changed .
Users who did not favor this change would probably resent the amount of work required to make the change , which might be nontrivial .
In some cases , mechanical techniques could be used to diagnose which programs need to be changed .
However , because of the pervasive use of macros and of automatic programming techniques , it would not be possible to do such diagnosis with 100 % reliability .
As a sort of machine - gun approach to the problem , compilers could be modified to provide the user with information about conflicts as they occur .
This would address some problems in automatic programming that could not be detected by statically examining the code that does such programming .
However , some situations are still more complicated because they do not directly produce code ; instead , they examine and modify code .
For example , compilers , translators , macros , and code walking utilities may have built - in assumption about the number of namespaces ; if these assumptions are never explicitly represented , they might elude automatic techniques , which could lead to errors or inefficiencies later on .
18.2 Compatibility Packages
Various compatibility schemes have been proposed that allow these problems to be moderated .
For example , we might have a Common Lisp with Lisp 1 semantics that has a compiler switch that allows Lisp 2 code to be compiled and run .
Symbols would have function cells , but function cells that were possibly represented as properties on property lists .
All old Common Lisp code on the form :
( F ... )
Would be transformed to this :
( FUNCALL #'F ...)
Where FUNCTION would look things up in the ' function cell . '
FUNCALL would be retained in the compatibility package .
A bigger example is more convincing :
( LET ( ( LIST ... ) ) ( LIST ... ) )
would become
( LET ( ( LIST ... ) ) ( FUNCALL #'LIST ... ) )
During the transformation process , variables bound by occurrences of FLET and LABELS in the old code would be renamed to new names produced by GENSYM , and the Lisp 1 versions of FLET ( which is LET ) and LABELS would be substituted for the function namespace versions .
Some compilers may already perform this transformation internally and will be simplified after the change .
And perhaps an implementor will want to provide a real function cell for this compatibility in order to run old code relatively fast .
Lisps that normally have link tables will need to provide separate linking code ( possibly the old link code ) for the compatibility package .
This type of compatibility takes a Lisp 2 program and produces a Lisp 1 program that uses some compatibility features for Lisp 2 programs added to the Lisp 1 .
In theory , the Lisp 2 source for the transformed program could be thrown away , and then only the Lisp 1 code with the compatibility features could be used for the feature .
Unfortunately , there are several problems with this simple kind of compatibility .
First , it does not easily lend itself to mixing compiled and interpreted code , especially when such code is produced at runtime .
It becomes important , for example , to clearly document and control whether functions that receive expressions to be evaluated or code - walked are receiving expressions in Lisp 1 or Lisp 2 .
Also , the compatibility package might expand expressions into code that was opaque to code walkers , compilers , and macro facilities , which might have built - in assumptions about the expected kinds of expressions .
For example , the proposed compatibility translation may involve treating some forms that were documented as special forms as if they were macros .
Possibly a code - walker expecting to see a certain class of expressions would see a different class of expressions after compatibility translation .
Another problem occurs when both the compatibility code and the Lisp 2 code to be translated use property lists to hold the ' function cells . '
In this case the running Lisp 1 version of the Lisp 2 code might destroy part of the compatibility information .
There is a class of Lisp 2 programs that could be safely run under this translation style of compatibility .
There is also , clearly , a class of programs that require a stricter compatibility .
A second stage of compatibility would require , essentially , a complete implementation of the semantics of Lisp 2 existing alongside of and sharing code with the Lisp 1 .
For example , a ' real ' function cell would need to be implemented along with an EVAL and a compiler -- the compiler would be a combination of the translator mentioned above and the Lisp 1 compiler .
Some programs may function correctly but suffer an efficiency loss that is greater than the simple loss that might be assumed by just analyzing the theoretical speed of the compatibility code .
For example , the compiler might be able to perform better optimizations on the original program than on the same program under the compatibility package .
As mentioned , a simple compatibility package can probably take care of a certain class of Common Lisp programs , but for programs that would require an implementation of Lisp 2 in Lisp 1 for compatibility , it is probably best to require programmers to translate those programs to Lisp 1 .
19 . Standardization
In standardizing a language , we should take care to standardize those things that have had proven success and acceptance by a user community .
It is often dangerous to standardize on the most recently formulated ideas .
The new macro solution by Kohlbecker [ Kohlbecker 1986 ] is of this form .
20 . Summary
The bulk of arguments that focus on clean semantics and notational simplicity tend to favor uniting the function and value namespaces .
In spite of this , there are those who hold strongly to a belief that a two - namespace system affords useful expressive power that they are unwilling to do without .
In the end , practical considerations favor the status quo for Common Lisp .
There is a large number of improvements beyond a single namespace that could be made to Common Lisp that would clean it up and simplify it .
We feel that the time for such radical changes to Common Lisp passed , and it would be the job of future Lisp designers to take lessons from Common Lisp and Scheme to produce an improved Lisp .

Why Pentagon released tape
The crash came shortly after two other hijacked airlines were flown into the twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York .
Judicial Watch filed the freedom of information request in 2004 , but the Pentagon refused to release the video because it was part of the investigation involving al - Qaeda plotter Zacarias Moussaoui , the group said .
This February the group sued the government over its refusal , saying there was " no legal basis " for it .
Washington agreed to release the video after a court sentenced Moussaoui to life in jail for his role in 9/11 earlier this month , a Judicial Watch spokeswoman told the BBC .
The group said it fought to obtain the video because " it was very important to complete the public record " on the attacks .
French author Thierry Meyssan alleged that Flight 77 did not crash into the Pentagon and suggested a truck bomb or missile caused the damage .
Such views are challenged by witness testimony at the scene of an aircraft fitting the description of Flight 77 crashing into the site .
Correspondents say the release of the video is not unhelpful to the Bush administration .
The footage serves as a graphic reminder of why the US launched its global " war on terror " and is still fighting it , the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says .
In his book America the Virtuous and in articles published on LewRockwell.com and elsewhere , Professor Claes Ryn has clearly defined what he calls the " Jacobin ideologues " in American society , otherwise known as Straussians and neocons .
Since I consider Abraham Lincoln to have been a Jacobin , and his war a Jacobin revolution , I have been a close follower of Professor Ryn ’s work and its relevance to American history .
I have been struck by how Professor Ryn ’s definitions fit so many of today ’s Lincoln idolaters like a glove .
In his writing he refers most often to Harry Jaffa and his fellow " Straussians " as the chief Jacobin ideologues and contrasts them sharply to genuine limited government conservatives .
Let ’s take a look at some of his definitions .
1 . The Jacobin ideologue expresses no humility .
I have seen this time and again with the Straussian Lincoln cult .
A good example would be one humorous response to my book , The Real Lincoln , by one of Jaffa ’s fellow cultists , one Ken Masugi , who announced that cult leader Jaffa had apparently " settled " all these issues 50 years ago .
Of course , nothing is ever settled permanently in the social sciences , especially when it comes to something as complicated as a war .
Only members of a cult , who believe that THE TRUTH comes only from the mouth of the cult leader , would believe such a thing .
No one with intellectual integrity would ever make such a totalitarian - minded claim .
2 . The Jacobin ideologue has no use for actual history because he claims to have special knowledge of " universal principles . "
This explains why so much of what the Straussians say about Lincoln and the war are flat out contradicted by real history .
They do n’t care about real history .
All they want to do is to repeat Jaffa ’s false theory that Lincoln was devoted to natural rights .
The fact that Lincoln repeatedly denied that black people should be able to exercise these rights does n’t matter .
What matters is the fanciful theory put forth by the cult leader .
3 . The Jacobin ideologue makes sweeping , categorical assertions as a substitute for the real complexity of the world .
This is another reason why America ’s Jacobins do not care about history .
History is complicated .
War is complicated .
All wars have multiple causes and effects .
But not the Jacobins ’ wars .
Lincoln ’s war was caused by slavery and slavery alone , despite the fact that Lincoln himself — and the entire U.S. government — insisted otherwise .
And the war in Iraq is a war " for democracy " and nothing else , period .
4. Jacobin ideologues have unquestioning faith in their own moral superiority .
This explains why the Straussians so often behave in such a completely vulgar , mannerless , and uncivilized way whenever anyone questions any of their precepts .
This is radically different from the normal state of affairs in academe where such criticism is viewed as the means of arriving at the truth through discussion and debate .
It is also why the Straussians are so despised ( and largely ignored ) by the rest of academe .
The Straussian Jacobins are not necessarily interested in the pursuit of truth : they already know THE TRUTH .
Harry Jaffa and other cult leaders have revealed it to them .
That ’s why they so often attempt to assassinate the character of anyone who dissents with the views of the cult leader .
A case in point is the viscous and hysterical smear campaign against the late Professor Mel Bradford , a preeminent Lincoln critic , after President Reagan nominated him to head the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1981 .
He eventually withdrew his own nomination in disgust .
Several years later , in an article entitled " Against Lincoln : A Speech at Gettysburg , " Professor Bradford cynically recalled how " I have found that I u2018 favor slavery , ’ consider it to be a u2018tenuous multiracial experiment ’ yet to receive the final verdict of history , and that I censure Lincoln because of u2018 what he did for racial equality . ’
My reservations [ about Lincoln ] are described as u2018insulting to Lincoln ’s idea of liberty . ’
And the very errors embodied in such wild charges , requiring as they do some rejoinder , u2018 prove ’ that there is something wrong with my character , regardless of their implausibility .
. . .
I have u2018overturned the Declaration of Independence , ’ called Lincoln a u2018 villain , ’ and argued that u2018 there is no right principle of action but self interest . ’
None of which can be documented from anything I have written " ( emphasis added ) .
He was also falsely accused of being a " Hitler admirer . "
What we had here was one of the first shots in the Straussian / Jacobin / neocon takeover of the old conservative movement that really did believe in limited government .
Thus , Jaffa can be thought of as a sort of Iranian Mullah light .
He has no ability to issue a death warrant to any Salmon Rushdies who might question or mock his " civil religion " ( a coin termed by Rousseau , the ideological godfather of the French Jacobins and one of Jaffa ’s favorite phrases ) , but he can orchestrate smear campaigns against them such as the one that was directed at Professor Bradford .
This episode , and many others like it , prove the truthfulness of another of Professor Ryn ’s characteristics of a Jacobin ideologue : 5 . The desire to dominate and silence one ’s ideological opponents rather than engage in civilized discourse with them .
6. Jacobin ideologues are also narrow - minded nationalists .
They believe that their country is morally superior to all others , and by virtue of that " fact " they have a right and a duty to impose their " moral " will on others .
This of course is the old New England Yankee impulse , derived from the Puritans , whose modern - day ideological descendants are the neocons .
Lincoln mythology plays an important role here , for the nonsense about America being the " last best hope of earth " has long been used to assert American moral superiority in world affairs .
Hence when William Bennett , the " Washington Fellow " of the Claremont Institute , made a case for the Iraq War on the CBS " Sunday Morning " television show on March 19 , his closing line was , " we truly are the last best hope of earth . "
( At which time the entire nation is apparently supposed to collectively wet its pants and sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic ) .
7 . The Jacobin ideologue is constantly warning about THE ENEMY , who is so depraved , and so evil , that no compromise of any kind is possible .
Total
War is the only solution , whether it ’s the war on drugs or the war in Iraq .
This of course began with the demonization of southerners prior to the War to Prevent Southern Independence , which continues to this very day .
Thus , I would add another characteristic to Professor Ryn ’s list : hatred of the south , its citizens , its history , and even its contemporary institutions , from NASCAR to country music .
( Recall the hysterical and hate - filled responses by the media to the movie " Gods and Generals , " which portrayed Stonewall Jackson as the deeply religious man that he was . )
Thus , Saddam Hussein had to be compared to Hitler .
As evil as Hussein was , he was no Hitler .
In making his case for the Iraq War William Bennett cited an anonymous " observer " from the Washington Post who asserted that Hussein and his thugs " starved babies , " " gouged out the eyes of children , " raped women in front of their husbands , and even " slowly immersed victims in a vat of acid . "
Wow .
Too bad Bennett could n’t provide an actual factual reference for such shocking claims .
8 . The Jacobin ideologue has no fear of unlimited government as long as Jacobins in good standing are in charge .
Thus , the Straussians defend the " Lincoln dictatorship " and its obliteration of constitutional liberties in the northern states .
They also routinely point to Lincoln ’s trashing of the Constitution in his day to " justify " the Bush administration ’s unprovoked war in Iraq , domestic spying , the imprisonment of war opponents , the use of torture chambers , and any and all usurpations of the Constitution .
Neocon " godfather " Irving Kristol has mocked the entire classical liberal tradition of limited constitutional government by mocking Friedrich Hayek ’s rendition of it in The Road to Serfdom .
And the neocon Bush administration has certainly done nothing at all , whatsoever , to limit government in any way .
9 . The Jacobin ideologue will redefine the Constitution in his pursuit of unbridled political power .
Again , Lincoln is the role model when it comes to acting like a dictator by asserting that the Constitution says something different from what actually appears in the document .
Jaffa has devoted much of his career to unsuccessfully defending the Lincoln dictatorship against the facts of history .
Today , the Jacobin ideologues who run the Bush administration ( and their supporters in the media ) tell us that the Constitution allows the government to spy on every citizen , to torture prisoners in American prisons — even American citizens , and even to imprison outspoken war opponents if necessary .
10 .
The Jacobin ideologue is also opposed to decentralization and true federalism because such a system is too difficult to control in dictatorial fashion .
Once again , Lincoln is the role model here since he destroyed the system of federalism that was established by the American founding fathers and did more than anyone else to usher in the centralized , bureaucratic state that we all slave under today .
This is why there has been no consideration given to a series of republics in Iraq ; several different republics populated by the various ethnic tribes there would be more difficult to control and dictate to than one centralized state that can be more easily managed by the U.S. government .
It would be much more conducive to a peaceful and prosperous Iraq , but that ’s not the goal of the American Jacobins .
Their goal is a puppet government .
This is also why the idea of states ’ rights is always immediately associated with slavery and racism .
The purpose of this is to censure discussion of the oldest of American political traditions , a tradition that the founding fathers thought of as the most powerful protection against centralized governmental tyranny .
In short , the phony and misdirected hatred of the French people that was ginned up by the Bush administration and its media mouthpieces at the beginning of the Iraq war should really be directed at America ’s Jacobin ideologues , who have adopted every destructive aspect of the French Jacobin tradition , and then some .
The French people eventually beheaded Robespierre , the leader of the French Jacobins .
Figuratively speaking , that would also be the well - deserved fate of America ’s Jacobin ideologues .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
December 7 , 2006 Spectrolab has achieved a new world record in terrestrial concentrator solar cell efficiency .
Using concentrated sunlight , Spectrolab demonstrated the ability of a photovoltaic cell to convert 40.7 percent of the sun 's energy into electricity .
The U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) verified the milestone .
High efficiency multijunction cells have a significant advantage over conventional silicon cells in concentrator systems because fewer solar cells are required to achieve the same power output .
This technology will continue to dramatically reduce the cost of generating electricity from solar energy as well as the cost of materials used in high - power space satellites and terrestrial applications .
" This solar cell performance is the highest efficiency level any photovoltaic device has ever achieved , " said Dr. David Lillington , president of Spectrolab .
" The terrestrial cell we have developed uses the same technology base as our space - based cells .
So , once qualified , they can be manufactured in very high volumes with minimal impact to production flow . "
" These results are particularly encouraging since they were achieved using a new class of metamorphic semiconductor materials , allowing much greater freedom in multijunction cell design for optimal conversion of the solar spectrum , " said Dr. Richard R. King , principal investigator of the high efficiency solar cell research and development effort .
" The excellent performance of these materials hints at still higher efficiency in future solar cells . "
Spectrolab is reducing the cost of solar cell production through research investments and is working with several domestic and international solar concentrator manufacturers on clean , renewable solar energy solutions .
Currently , Spectrolab 's terrestrial concentrator cells are generating power in a 33 - kilowatt full - scale concentrator system in the Australian desert .
The company recently signed multi-million dollar contracts for its high efficiency concentrator cells and is anticipating several new contracts in the next few months .
Development of the high - efficiency concentrator cell technology was funded by the NREL's High Performance Photovoltaics program and Spectrolab .

Guiltless grill ?
Is there another kind ?
I was looking over a menu in a restaurant the other day when I saw a section for vegetarians ; I thought to myself " boy , I sure am glad that I 'm not a meat - hating fascist " and I skipped on to the steak section ( because I 'll be damned if I 'm going to pay $ 15 for an alfalfa sandwich , slice of cucumber and a scoop of cold cottage cheese ) , but before I turned the page something caught my eye .
The heading of the vegetarian section was titled " Guiltless Grill , " not because there were menu items with fewer calories and cholesterol ( since there were " healthy " chicken dishes discriminated against in this section ) , but because none of the items used animal products .
Think about that phrase for a second .
What exactly does " guiltless grill " imply ?
So I 'm supposed to feel guilty now if I eat meat ?
Screw you .
What pisses me off so much about this phrase is the sheer narrow - mindedness of these stuck up vegetarian assholes .
You think you 're saving the world by eating a tofu - burger and sticking to a diet of grains and berries ?
Well here 's something that not many vegetarians know ( or care to acknowledge ) : every year millions of animals are killed by wheat and soy bean combines during harvesting season ( source ) .
Oh yeah , go on and on for hours about how all of us meat eaters are going to hell for having a steak , but conveniently ignore the fact that each year millions of mice , rabbits , snakes , skunks , possums , squirrels , gophers and rats are ruthlessly murdered as a direct result of YOUR dieting habits .
What 's that ?
I 'm sorry , I do n't hear any more elitist banter from you pompous cocks .
Could it be because your shit has been RUINED ?
That 's right : the gloves have come off .
The vegetarian response to this embarrassing fact is " well , at least we 're not killing intentionally . "
So let me get this straight ; not only are animals ruthlessly being murdered as a direct result of your diet , but you 're not even using the meat of the animals YOU kill ?
At least we 're eating the animals we kill ( and although we also contribute to the slaughter of animals during grain harvesting , keep in mind that we 're not the ones with a moral qualm about it ) , not just leaving them to rot in a field somewhere .
That makes you just as morally repugnant than any meat - eater any day .
Not only that , but you 're killing free - roaming animals , not animals that were raised for feed .
Their bodies get mangled in the combine 's machinery , bones crushed , and you have the audacity to point fingers at the meat industry for humanely punching a spike through a cow 's neck ?
If you think that tofu burgers come at no cost to animals or the environment , guess again .
To even suggest that your meal is some how " guiltless " is absurd .
The defense " at least we 're not killing intentionally " is bullshit anyway .
How is it not intentional if you KNOW that millions of animals die every year in combines during harvest ?
You expect me to believe that you somehow unintentionally pay money to buy products that support farmers that use combines to harvest their fields ?
Even if it was somehow unintentional , so what ?
That suddenly makes you innocent ?
I guess we should let drunk drivers off the hook too since they do n't kill intentionally either , right ?
There 's no way out of this one .
The only option left for you dipshits is to buy some land , plant and pick your own crops .
Impractical ?
Yeah , well , so is your stupid diet .
Even if combines are n't used to harvest your food , you think that buying fruits and vegetables ( organic or otherwise ) is any better ?
How do you think they get rid of bugs that eat crops in large fields ?
You think they just put up signs and ask parasites to politely go somewhere else ?
Actually , I would n't put that suggestion past you hippies .
One of the methods they use to get rid of pests is to introduce a high level of predators for each particular prey , which wreaks all sorts of havoc on the natural balance of predator / prey populations -- causing who knows what kind of damage to the environment .
Oops , did I just expose you moral - elitists for being frauds ?
Damndest thing .
A number of people have pointed out that the amount of grain grown to feed animals for slaughter every year is greater than the amount of grain grown for humans .
So I guess the amount of grain grown for human consumption suddenly becomes negligible and we can conveniently ignore the fact that animals are still ruthlessly murdered either way because of your diet , right ?
Not to mention that the majority of grain grown for livestock is tough as rocks , coarse , and so low - grade that it 's only fit for animal consumption in the first place .
Spare me the " you could feed 500 people with the grain used to feed one cow " line of shit ; it 's not the same grain .
Then there are the people who jump on the bandwagon with " you could plant billions of potatoes on the land used for cows " -- good point , except for the fact that not every plot of land is equally fertile ; you think farmers always have a choice on what they do with their land ?
Also , many vegetarians do n't know ( or care to acknowledge ) that in many parts of the United States they have " control hunts " in which hunting permits are passed out whenever there is a pest problem ( the pest here is deer , elk and antelope ) that threatens wheat , soy , vegetable and other crops ; this happens several times per year .
Then some of you throw out claims that " we are trying to limit the suffering . "
How about you limit MY suffering and shut the hell up about your stupid diet for a change ; nobody cares .
Even if the number of animals that die in combine deaths every year is n't in the millions , even if it 's just one , are you suggesting that the life of one baby rabbit is n't worth saving ?
Are you placing a value on life ?
Enjoy your tofu , murderers .

This could be just a false alarm , see Update on Siberian UFO Crash .
Reports of an Unidentified Flying Object crashing in the Krasnoyarsk Region of Siberia have surfaced on Russian news website MosNews .
Nothing has been confirmed , but officials ( Police investigators and representatives from the Transport Prosecutors Service ) are on route to investigate the crash site .
They will also speak to locals who it is thought witnessed the crash and clam that what ever it was also started a massive forest fire .
The UFO could have be just a meteorite , but interestingly , a quick Google for the words Krasnoyarsk and UFO reveals some interesting results .
Does anybody have any stories of UFO activity in this region of Russia / Siberia ?
An unidentified flying object has crashed in Krasnoyarsk Region , Siberia , causing a forest fire , the RIA - Novosti news agency reported on Friday .
The crash took place in the taiga between the towns of Yeniseisk and Lesosibirsk , the agency said quoting the local Interior Ministry directorate .
The crash was reported by local villagers and traces of forest fire can be seen on the site .
Air traffic officials said that no aircraft were scheduled to fly in the region at the time of the crash and no air vessels were missing .
A group formed of police investigators , representatives of the Transport Prosecutors Service and representatives of the aircraft safety watchdog Rosavianadzor has started to the site of the crash from Krasnoyarsk .
Local Emergencies Directorate has sent a helicopter to the site .

Kids and adults will stay glued to video games this holiday season because the fun of playing actually is rooted in fulfilling their basic psychological needs .
Psychologists at the University of Rochester , in collaboration with Immersyve , Inc. , a virtual environment think tank , asked 1,000 gamers what motivates them to keep playing .
The results published in the journal Motivation and Emotion this month suggest that people enjoy video games because they find them intrinsically satisfying .
" We think there 's a deeper theory than the fun of playing , " says Richard M. Ryan , a motivational psychologist at the University and lead investigator in the four new studies about gaming .
Players reported feeling best when the games produced positive experiences and challenges that connected to what they know in the real world .
The research found that games can provide opportunities for achievement , freedom , and even a connection to other players .
Those benefits trumped a shallow sense of fun , which does n't keep players as interested .
" It 's our contention that the psychological ' pull ' of games is largely due to their capacity to engender feelings of autonomy , competence , and relatedness , " says Ryan .
The researchers believe that some video games not only motivate further play but " also can be experienced as enhancing psychological wellness , at least short - term , " he says .
Ryan and coauthors Andrew Przybylski , a graduate student at the University of Rochester , and Scott Rigby , the president of Immersyve who earned a doctorate in psychology at Rochester , aimed to evaluate players ' motivation in virtual environments .
Study volunteers answered pre- and post - game questionnaires that were applied from a psychological measure based on Self - Determination Theory , a widely researched theory of motivation developed at the University of Rochester .
Rather than dissect the actual games , which other researchers have done , the Rochester team looked at the underlying motives and satisfactions that can spark players ' interests and sustain them during play .
Revenues from video games -- even before the latest Wii , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox systems emerged -- surpass the money made from Hollywood films annually .
A range of demographic groups plays video games , and key to understanding their enjoyment is the motivational pull of the games .
Four groups of people were asked to play different games , including one group tackling " massively multiplayer online " games -- MMO for short , which are considered the fastest growing segment of the computer gaming industry .
MMOs are capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of players simultaneously .
For those playing MMOs , the need for relatedness emerged " as an important satisfaction that promotes a sense of presence , game enjoyment , and an intention for future play , " the researchers found .
Though different types of games and game environments were studied , Ryan points out that " not all video games are created equal " in their ability to satisfy basic psychological needs .
" But those that do may be the best at keeping players coming back . "

You know , when Americans see their president giving every job to the same old cronies , they use words like “ loyal to a fault ” and “ stubborn ” and “ close - minded , ” “ lives in a bubble , ” “ sock - puppet , ” “ asshole . ”
“ Worst president ever . ”
But they ’re missing the point .
The problem is n’t his political philosophy - “ kill people and animals and take their gas ” - the problem is he has to expand his circle of friends beyond his mom , Karen Hughes and the House of Saud .
Which is why before George Bush makes another political appointment , he has to join Friendster .
This week , President Bush had to nominate a Supreme Court judge , and he picked the most qualified person within 30 feet of his office .
Her qualifications : well , she is a lawyer and former commissioner of the Texas State Lottery .
And she ’s seen every episode of “ Judging Amy . ”
Abortion , affirmative action , separation of church and state .
Yeah , let ’s ask the lady who peddled scratch tickets to liquor stores .
Does he just go with the first person he sees ?
I would n’t be surprised if Laura was his sister .
Now , of course - I keep checking with him - of course , George Bush is n’t the first politician to hand out graft gigs to his pals , but he does n’t seem to understand that that ’s what the bullshit jobs are for : ambassador to the Bahamas .
The Recycling Czar . Head of the CIA .
But George Bush puts stooges where they can do real damage : Director of FEMA ?
That guy from the horsie show is available .
U.N. Ambassador ?
Dick Cheney knows a guy with a mustache and anger issues .
Supreme Court justice ?
Lady down the hall .
Labor Secretary ?
The guy who helped me move that hooker ’s body at Yale could probably do it .
You know - you know , Mr. President , when you got elected , we all figured you were no genius , but smart enough to hire qualified people .
But it turns out you ’re just a dimwit who enjoys feeling superior .
And the only way to accomplish that is to surround yourself with the likes of Mike Brown and Harriet Miers : Goober and Aunt Bea .
Unspectacular souls who make you feel comfortable and unthreatened .
Kind of like when Madonna used to hang out with Rosie O’Donnell .
Well , I hate to burst your bubble .
But real friends are the ones who tell you the truth .
They ’re also the ones who work hard so as not to embarrass you .
These people who work for you are n’t behaving like friends .
They ’re behaving far worse .
They ’re behaving … like family .
Yes , it ’s almost enough to make you miss the old pre -” honor and integrity ” days .
Because at least when Clinton talked about tapping the woman down the hall , he was just having sex with her .
Long before the Internet exposed the Wal - Mart set to the world of conspiracy theories and esoteric religious beliefs there was a series of books collectively known as Illuminatus !.
Illuminatus !
purports to tell the story of the world ’s oldest secret society and the many conspiracies it has contrived to bring about the end of the world .
The book is a rambling tale of conspiracies within conspiracies , and secret societies within secret societies , laced with liberal doses of sex , drugs , and paranoia .
It ’s hard to believe Hunter Thompson had nothing to do with it .
In the 30 years since the release of Illuminatus !
the book has become a counter - culture bible and co-author Robert Anton Wilson the Pope .
I first discovered Illuminatus !
when a friend who is an avid sci - fi reader was talked into buying the book by an overly enthusiastic bookstore clerk .
After a few weeks of wrestling with the lunacy my friend eventually tossed the book my way , exclaiming , “ this seems like something you might like ” .
In retrospect , I ’m not sure he meant that in a good way .
To fully comprehend Illuminatus !
you need the Wikipedia as a reading guide .
The sheer density of conspiracies , cults , paranoia , political intrigue , and religious fanaticism presented in the 805 page volume defies all reason .
The fact that the book was written in the pre-Internet era is simply mind boggling .
Illuminatus ! was so unlike anything publisher Dell had ever seen , they requested Wilson and his co-author Robert Shea cut 500 pages and break the novel into three separate books .
Who knows what Dell was thinking when they agreed to publish the books in the first place .
I suspect some high ranking Illuminati official was probably involved in the decision .
Prior to Illuminatus !
Wilson worked as an editor at Playboy , back in the days when people still claimed to read the magazine for the articles .
It was at Playboy that Wilson came in contact with both Shea , and an army of anonymous crazies who inundated him with mail about every imaginable conspiracy theory ( he ’s lucky he did n’t have email ) .
Wilson and Shea were eventually inspired enough by those letters to write Illuminatus !.
Improbable as it may seem , large portions of Illuminatus ! were researched by the Playboy editorial staff .
Talk about leveraging your day job .
If Wilson had only co-authored Illuminatus !
his place in history would be assured .
Instead , he went on to write at least 35 other books of both fiction and non-fiction .
His novels include :
SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger ’s Cat – Another trilogy , although this time by choice .
Wilson has hinted that this book includes quite a bit of the material that was hacked out of Illuminatus ! .
It ’s been called the most scientific of all sci- fi novels by New Scientist magazine .

Masks of the Illuminati – Wilson ’s admittedly failed attempt to write a normal mystery novel .
In this case “ normal ” means a plot with James Joyce and Albert Einstein downing pints of Guinness while trying to solve a mystery involving Al Crowley and the Loch Ness Monster .
It may not be a traditional mystery , but it ’s my kind of book .

It may not be a traditional mystery , but it ’s my kind of book .
The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles – Wilson ’s prequel to Illuminatus ! was a couple of decades ahead of Dan Brown ’s Da Vinci Code , but covered much of the same territory .
To be fair , Wilson was fictionalizing many theories that have been floating around for hundreds of years .
While Wilson ’s fiction is usually weird and mind - bending , his non-fiction is as well , but for entirely different reasons .
Wilson ’s non-fiction combines philosophy and science to explore the nature of knowledge and to question the fundamental structure of belief systems .
In books like Quantum Psychology and Prometheus Rising Wilson synthesizes and integrates a huge number of complex topics including quantum physics , general semantics , and hermetic philosophy .
It ’s hard to overestimate the profound influence Wilson ’s books have had on my thinking — partially because of his own writing , and partially because he ’s proven to be a gateway author to a world of books and subjects I might never have discovered without him .
Without Wilson I probably would have never read Terrance McKenna , Alfred Korzybski , or Aleister Crowley .
It was Wilson who helped me realize that Crowley was more than just a perpetual reference in bad heavy metal songs .
Unfortunately , Wilson is not doing so well these days .
Paul Krasner has recently reported that Wilson may only have days left to live .
Not surprisingly , Wilson has a few opinions on the subject of death , among them :
A sinister rumor , widely believed in the Occident , holds that after death we go to a place called Heaven .
From all the descriptions I ’ve read , it sounds dreadful to me .
It seems to have a population made up entirely of some gang of Christians ; the experts on Heaven disagree about which conglomeration of Christians will qualify , but they always seem to think that they personally belong to that elite group .
An eternity with people that conceited seems intolerable to me , but fortunately I am not a Christian so I wo n’t be consigned to such a boring place .
Here ’s hoping that some bureaucratic snafu does n’t accidentally land Robert Anton Wilson in heaven .
Hail Eris , All Hail Discordia !

WRONG ‘SHOW ’ FOR MAG EXECS
JON Stewart was the wrong pick to emcee the Magazine Publishers of America panel at Lincoln Center featuring Graydon Carter ( Vanity Fair ) , Jim Kelly ( Time ) , Kate White ( Cosmopolitan ) and Dave Zinczenko ( Men ’s Health ) .
The “ Daily Show ” host was derisive and insulting .
“ He went to a dark place , ” said one magazine exec .
Stewart asked Zinczenko , “ Do all the men on the cover have to be - what ’s the word - glistening ? …
When I read it , I do n’t know whether to go to the doctor or rub my nipples …
Why is your magazine so gay ? ”
Stewart challenged Carter over VF ’s recent Paris Hilton cover : “ That was ironic , right ? ”
He accused Time ’s Kelly of cowardice in cooperating with federal prosecutors .
And Stewart , apparently unaware he was being paid by magazine publishers ( $ 250,000 supposedly ) to perform for magazine advertisers , confessed he did n’t have time to read and found the entire industry “ irrelevant . ”
Said one witness , “ They all could n’t get off the stage fast enough - and I overheard Graydon Carter saying , ‘ Never again ! ’ “
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate approved Sept. 21 a bill that would clear the way for NASA tobuy the Russian Soyuz vehicles it needs to continue to occupy the InternationalSpace Station beyond this year .
The billwas introduced Sept. 15 by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman RichardLugar ( R - Ind. ) to provide temporary relief from provisions in the IranNonproliferation
Act of 2000 that bar U.S. purchases of Russian humanspaceflight hardware as long as Russia continues to help Iran in its pursuit ofnuclear know - how and advanced weapons technology .
Lugar 'sbill , S. 1713 , changes the law to permit NASA to buy any Russian space hardwareor services it needs for the International Space Station program until 2012 .
The billwas approved the morning of Sept. 21 by unanimous consent , a Senate procedurethat allows non-controversial legislation to bypass a floor vote .
The U.S. House of Representatives also is considering amending the Iran NonproliferationAct to permit NASA to buy Soyuz vehicles , but it has yet to take anylegislative action .
The Housecould either pick up and pass the Senate 's bill or introduce a bill of its ownthat would have to be reconciled with the Senate version before becoming law .
Withoutrelief from the Iran act , NASA could soon find itself unable to send itsastronauts to the space station for extended stays .
A Soyuz capsule set to carry anew two - personcrew - and one space tourist - to the station Sept. 30 is the last one Russiais obligated to provide at no charge to the United States under a bilateralagreement .
NASA andthe U.S. State Department formally asked Congress in June to amend the Iran actto permit the United States to make use of Russian space technology in itsspace exploration plans .
One of the few benefits to being a technology investor based outside of Silicon Valley is that I do n’t spend all my time in the valley .
While I 'm out in California every few weeks , I get to spend most of my time in the " real world . "
Over the last several weeks , I ’ve been on several phone pitches from west - coast companies that are looking to be the “ flickr of XXXX ” or “ like del.icio.us but YYYY ” or “ the Digg killer ” .
It got me thinking – how many people outside of the valley have ever heard of these companies ?
I asked a bunch of local ( Philly - area ) acquaintances and the answer came back loud and clear : none – nada - zip .
People here have barely heard of Myspace and Craigslist – let alone any of the “ hot ” Web 2.0 companies .
As more and more entrepreneurs start building what Fred Wilson referred to as second derivative companies , I think they run a big risk of designing a product / service that is targeted at too small of an audience .
Too many companies are targeting an audience of 53,651 .
That ’s how many people subscribe to Michael Arrington ’s TechCrunch blog feed .
I ’m a big fan of Techcrunch – and read it every day .
However , the Techcrunch audience is NOT a mainstream America audience .
A good review in Techcrunch can get a company their first 5 - 25 K beta users very quickly .
However , I ’d strongly caution entrepreneurs from taking their initial consumer adoption metrics and extrapolating them too far into the future .
I believe startups will find it difficult to cross the “ Techcrunch chasm ” between the Web 2.0 geeks and Mainstreet USA .
If we could get access to the usage logs of the top 10 Web 2.0 properties , I would bet that their 10,000 most active users would all be the same .
As I evaluate new startups these days I ’m finding it harder and harder to see the big ideas that will appeal to a large , non -geek consumer audience .

O'Reilly has posted an interesting factoid .
For the first time ever , Ruby book sales have surpassed Python book sales .
In the article he also names Rails as the primary catalyst for Ruby 's massive growth in popularity .
Then he briefly discusses Python 's attempt to respond to Rails .
I do n't believe Python will be able to catch up to let alone surpass Rails in terms of popularity for a few reasons .
By way of background , I have programmed professionally in Python for 3 years , and have been programming as a career for about 13 years now .
I have tried a great number of the various web frameworks ASP , ASP / MTS / COM ( ugh ! ) , PHP , J2EE , ASP.NET ( C# ) , Cold Fusion , Zope , mod_python , Twisted , Ruby on Rails .
I spent significantly more time in some frameworks than others , but I never really * loved * any of them until Rails .
In fact J2EE and ASP.NET were so bad in my opinion that I gave up entirely on web programming for a few years and just wrote python scripts to crunch data .
After working with Python for a few years I felt like I was ready to venture back into the world of Web Systems .
I thought Python would be the ideal language to use because of it's flexibility and general cleanliness .
I thought because Python had a relatively active community I would be able to find a really nice Web Framework to use .
However after trying numerous frameworks , I came away with the following conclusion : Python sucks for the web .
The biggest problem for Python on the web is the same thing that makes Python so clean in the first place , significant whitespace .
The second biggest problem Python programmers face is the mindset of the Python community , which is that there should be only one way to do things .
The " one way to do things " mantra certainly seems nice to someone coming from Perl , but the general inflexibility of this rule began to wear on me after a while .
It started to feel like I was using tools that did n't quite match the job .
The quintessential example of this inflexibility is the refusal of the python core team to add a case statement to the language .
There are numerous cited reasons , but the net effect is you have to use rather ugly nested if / else statements in the place of a well designed case statement .
While that mindset may be good for a niche group , most mainstream programmers tend to prefer practical flexibility to dogmatic adherence to aesthetics .
Significant whitespace in your code can be a beautiful and readable thing if you work in a relatively homogenous environment .
It 's definitely a pain if you have to merge code written by someone else , in a different environment , into yours ( especially when they use tabs , or 3 space indents instead of 4 ) .
That problem is severely compounded when it comes to web programming .
It 's so serious in fact , that when it comes to templating , virtually all python web frameworks use some other language to do the templating .
Primarily they use Kid and CherryPy .
Both of those templating languages grated on me .
I wanted something more consistent , more elegantly designed , and definitely something that was better integrated .
Then I came to Rails and my first serious introduction to Ruby .
Let me tell you , both Ruby and Rails knocked my socks off .
The beauty , simplicity , and power of Rails is rooted in something deep within Ruby itself .
Despite the claim that Ruby has weird syntax , I found it 's syntax to be very clean and straightforward .
As far as languages with syntax go , I would say Ruby has just the right operators in just the right places , which in my opinion make programs very readable .
Something that definitely struck me while using Rails was just how much Ruby is used .
It is used absolutely everywhere , to a degree that I have never seen in any other language .
Whereas with Python you have to learn another entire mini-language to do web programming , with Ruby I could use the full power and expressiveness inside the .rthml file just as well as I could within the .rb files .
Instead of finding some obscure tool and trying to get it setup and installed and working with my Python Web Framework , with Ruby I could just use RubyGems to automatically download and install the latest version of whatever item I needed .
It 's literally as easy asto download and install Ruby on Rails .
When it comes to testing my application , Ruby comes with an incredibly powerful tool called Rake .
Rake is essentially a build tool similar in concept to Make , but it allows you to express everything in Ruby .
Rake is so powerful in fact that deploying to your production server has been canonized into a set of Rake tasks known as SwitchTower ( once again included with Rails ) .
With SwitchTower you can deploy effortlessly withThere are numerous things that I could mention about Ruby on Rails that are better than what I 've seen in other frameworks .
But instead of a laundry list of things that you may or may not like I 'll leave you with this comparison .
In terms of design , Windows is to the Mac as Python Frameworks are to Ruby on Rails .
Windows is a powerful operating system , and you can kind of get it working most of the time .
But if you use it a lot , there are things you will find frustrating and poorly designed .
Whereas the Mac is a beautifully designed and tremendously well thought out system .
The most common description is that it just works .
So too with Ruby on Rails , from top to bottom , it just works .
On his blog , Aaron Schwartz , while discussing the Reddit re-write , said he created web.py because all of the other Python web frameworks suck .
I agree with his assessment , if not with his conclusion .
The Python frameworks do n't suck because the people who wrote them are bad programmers .
They suck because they are trying to build a framework to solve a problem in an environment that Python is fundamentally not suited for .
Python is a great language in and of itself , and there are numerous things it is well suited to , web programming just is n't one of them .
If you are serious about building web applications , I strongly suggest you take a good look at the benefits and productivity offered by Ruby on Rails , I can almost guarantee your competitors will .
Guides Dec 6 , 2006 The 2006 Good Gift Games
Around the holidays there are always two to four players within earshot .
Every year dozens of board games are marketed into existence , but some are so fun they stand alone .
The board - game store at my local mall is ephemeral ; it suddenly appears — as if by magic — the day after Thanksgiving , and remains open until New Year ’s Day , whereupon it vanishes and is instantly replaced by the next in the series of rotating , holiday - themed boutiques that occupy that space .
The store ’s owners obviously recognize that the holidays were designed for game playing , as families and friends gather together to re-forge ties and wait out inclement weather .
But it ’s not until you browse the store ’s inventory that you realize why they pack up and hit the bricks so quickly after the season ’s festivities have concluded .
Most of their titles are designed to be gifts — games to be bought and hastily pawned off onto someone else , as the average patron would never dream of playing them himself .
Fun fact :
No one in the history of the Republic has ever purchased the Family Guy Chess
Set for himself , ( though countless people have brought the copy they received for Christmas back to the mall on January 4th in the hope of a refund , only to find a Bric - A - Black : The Martin Luther King Jr. Day Superstore at the address printed on the receipt ) .
No , these are not good gift games , and it need n’t be this way .
Every year scores of fantastic new board games are released , even if they are not showcased as prominently at your local mall .
To rectify this error , I assemble an annual Good Gift Games ( G3 ) Guide , the goal of which is to tout those games that meet these three criteria :
Easy to learn , with rules that can be explained in less than five minutes
Entertaining enough that even the guy who comes in dead last has a great time playing
Quick , lacking downtime , and requiring an hour or less to complete
So this year just say no to the Limited Edition Lanthanides - themed Monopoly set ( “ Hooray , I landed on Gadolinium ! ” ) , and pick up something that you , or your lucky recipient , will truly appreciate .
Vegas Showdown
Avalon Hill , 3 to 5 players , 75 minutes , $ 35
Based on the title , you might think the goal in Vegas Showdown is to make money off gambling .
But in fact this game is about the real purpose of Vegas : making money off gamblers .
Players own casinos and vie for slot machines , restaurants , and theaters , each trying to maximize profits by making their establishments the most attractive to customers .
Intrigued ?
You can see a slick online demo of the game here .
But a word of warning : Despite having only been released a year ago , and recently being named GAMES Magazine ’s “ Game of the Year , ” Vegas Showdown is inexplicably out of print .
Though there are still copies available through many online retailers , if you want to purchase a copy , I ’d advise you do so ASAP .

Wits & Wagers
North Star Games LLC , 3 to 20 players , 20 minutes , $ 24
I hate trivia games , as I can never master the winning strategy of being the smartest guy in the room .
And let ’s face it : Trivial Pursuit , despite its reputation , is not a stellar family game , as no one wants to get shown up by a know - it - all cousin .
But Wits &
Wagers takes the classic trivia game and turns it on its head by adding a number of clever twists to the formula .
Each question has a specific , numeric answer ( e.g. , “ In dollars , what was Julia Roberts ’s salary for her role in the hit movie Pretty Woman ? ) .
After players have all submitted their written guesses , each reply is assigned a “ payout ” based on where it falls on the distribution : guesses in the middle of the pack give you even money , while outliers can pay out as much as 4 to 1 .
Players then bet on which answer they think is correct .
I usually lump trivia games in with Lars Von Trier films in terms of “ fun , ” but this one is a genuine blast .

Thurn & Taxis
Rio Grande Games , 2 to 4 players , 60 minutes , $ 27
And speaking of ampersands …
In 2004 my top pick was a train game called Ticket to Ride , one of the finest G3s ever designed .
Thurn & Taxis is frequently ( and often favorably ) compared to Ticket to Ride , and , like its predecessor , won the coveted Spiel Des Jahres Award , which is to board games what a “ Best Picture ” Oscar is to film .
Players seek to establish mail routes across Germany , much as the historical family of Thurn and Taxis did in the 15th century .
Thurn & Taxis is a bit more strategic than Ticket to Ride , though its theme is a little less appealing .
So while there may be no need to own both games , you should certainly snag one or the other .

Parlay
Real Deal Games , 2 to 6 players , 45 minutes , $ 12
As George Carlin once observed , “ If you nail two things together that have never been nailed together before , some schmuck will buy it from you . ”
Accordingly , entrepreneurs have tried combining everything from chocolate and peanut butter to O.J. Simpson and horribly offensive book ideas in an effort to create the next hot thing .
Board - game designers are no different , and alas , their hybrids are about as frequently successful ( i.e. , almost never ) .
So it ’s always a treat to see someone pull it off .
Case in point : Parlay somehow manages to splice poker and Scrabble .
The game is played with a standard deck of cards , except each card also bears a letter and a point value ; players receive a number of cards , and attempt to assemble both a high - scoring word and a decent poker hand .
The game makers have even managed to throw in a “ hold or fold ” element , giving the game that tense feeling of regular poker .
Games that try to appeal to two different markets are nearly always disliked by both ; Parlay , on the other hand , is likely to be well received by either the poker player or the Boggler on your list .

Masons
Rio Grande Games , 2 to 4 players , 45 minutes , $ 32
Another year , another G3 from designer Leo Colovini .
Colovini has a knack for creating games that are intuitive , engaging , brief , and addictive .
His newest offering , Masons , is no exception .
Players build walls on a map of the countryside , scoring points for enclosing areas , building palaces , and establishing towns .
As with all Colovini games , Masons is a masterful balance of luck and skill , offering a light strategic challenge without becoming too competitive .
And the game bears another of the Colovini hallmarks : as soon as you finish one game , you ’ll be eager to play it again .

GiftTRAP
GiftTRAP
Enterprises , 3 to 8 players , 60 minutes , $ 30
A number of cards are revealed , each showing a present of some sort : a diamond ring , a new lawn , a Stratocaster electric guitar , etc .
Players secretly indicate which of the available gifts they would give to each of their opponents ; they also rank the presents in order of desirability .
Lastly , each player “ opens ” the presents he received from the others , scoring points for presents he wanted , but deducting them for duds ; players giving well - received gifts also score points for thoughtfulness .
That ’s GiftTRAP in a nutshell .
I was prepared to dismiss this game as little more than a celebration of materialism , but unexpectedly found myself loving it :
It ’s well - designed , hilarious , and a terrific conversation stimulant .
( I discovered that a good friend of mine is afraid of flying when I gave her “ Flying Lessons , ” a gift to which she had assigned a preference of “ No Way ! ” )
Plus , if you do n’t know what to get someone for the holidays , it ’s a great way to find out .

Hey !
That ’s My Fish !
Mayfair Games , 2 to 4 players , 20 minutes , $ 20
Occasionally I ’ll play a new game so elegant in design that I ’ll come away amazed that it had n’t been thought of before .
Hey !
That ’s My Fish ! is the most recent example .
Sixty small hexagons ( each showing one , two , or three fish ) are assembled into an ice floe .
Players then place their penguins onto the board , and play begins .
On a turn , a player moves one of his penguins and then claims the hex the penguin just vacated , scoring points for the fish shown thereon .
The ice floe slowly melts as more and more hexes are taken .
Eventually there will be no more legal moves , and the person with the most fish wins .
It ’s extremely simple and remarkably strategic .
It ’s also perfect for the Al Gore on your list , as I bet it would go great with the global warming PowerPoint he just happened to bring with him .

Rum & Pirates
Rio Grande Games , 2 to 5 players , 60 minutes , $ 32
While you may no longer spend your nights staggering around town , drinking rum , and starting brawls ( ah , college ) , you can still relive those glory days with Rum & Pirates .
Each round has two parts .
First , you send your brigands out to loot the city , snatching up rewards , including treasures and new recruits .
Afterwards , those corsairs who remained on the boat skirmish to see who gets the top bunk , and who gets stuck on the bedroll .
Man , that ’s living .
Rum & Pirates is a great family game , easy enough for kids , engaging enough for adults .
Plus : pirates !

Khet : The Laser Game
Innovention Toys , 2 players , 20 minutes , $ 42
The problem with gimmick games is that rarely is there anything beyond the central whatever to hold your attention when the novelty wears off .
In fact , the gimmick usually is nothing but smoke and mirrors , to disguise the fact there ’s no real game in the box .
So it would seem to be literally true with Khet : the Laser Game , in which a number of the pieces bear angled mirrors .
But , surprisingly , they come as part of a well - designed two - player abstract .
A player first moves or rotates one of his men , then fires a laser into the field of play , which bounces around until it either hits a wall or illuminates a piece , thereby removing it from the game .
And I ’m not speaking metaphorically , here : the game actually has a built - in laser , which a player can fire by pressing a button .
This is the sort of thing the word “ cool ” was coined to describe .

Blue Moon City
Fantasy Flight Games , 2 to 4 players , 60 minutes , $ 32
If you have a friend who ’s into fantasy but rarely plays board games , pick him up a copy of Blue Moon City — the theme will sucker him in .
If you have a friend who ’s not into fantasy but likes board games , buy him a copy of Blue Moon City and tell him to ignore the fairies ‘ n ’ crap — they ’re just window dressing for a solid and entertaining title .
Players strive to rebuild a city shattered by war , calling upon the elemental dragons for aid and collecting holy crystals to — jeez , this sounds so complicated and overwrought I can’t even bear to go on .
Just trust me :
At its core , Blue Moon City is a clever and quick family game , and geared toward more than guys who can recite passages from The Dungeonmaster ’s Guide from memory .
( more info )
You may not find these board games at Ye Olde Temporal Mall Game Shoppe , but check your Yellow pages :
There are likely to be a few specialty game stores in your area that might have them in stock .
If not , there ’s no shortage of online retailers that can have them on your doorstep in time for the yuletide : Funagain Games , Boulder Games , Boards & Bits , Gamefest , and Amazon.com , to name a few .
Have fun , and happy holidays !
Why was the 20th century unique ?
Well , OK , England won the World Cup , and that may never happen again .
But I am thinking about something even more profound , something fundamental to the story of Homo sapiens .
The 20th century saw by far the largest growth in world population in history .
Furthermore , since population growth is now slowing down sharply , the last century will always retain its crown .
Hitler , Stalin , Mao , eat your hearts out - the defining feature of the 20th century will forever remain the explosive growth of our species .
The United Nations Population Division reckons that it was only in 1800 that global population reached 1 billion for the first time .
Since life expectancy at birth for most of mankind 's history was only about 10 years , it took a birth rate of over 80 per 1,000 even to prevent the species from becoming extinct .
But after 1800 , in a succession of countries , a mixture of medicine , sanitation and nutrition began to reduce the death rate .
And a common feature of almost every country is that the death rate falls for a long period before economic progress begins to cut the birth rate .
Only once the birth rate starts to fall toward the long - term stabilisation rate of two children per woman per lifetime does the population growth rate start to fall .
Then it takes many decades for the total population to stabilise .
It took 127 years after 1800 for the world population to rise from 1 billion to 2 billion .
The subsequent time periods to add an extra billion were 34 years , 13 years , 13 years and 12 years , which means we passed the 6 billion threshold in 1999 .
The total increase in global population during the 20th century was 4.31 billion , seven times the increase in the previous century .
But we are now at a crucial inflection point .
The time it will take to add the next billion will rise to 14 years , and then the gaps will be 15 , 26 and 129 years respectively .
The UN reckons that we might reach long - term stabilisation at just over 10 billion , two centuries from now .
It will therefore take us the whole of the next two centuries to add the number of people that we managed in the past 100 years .
You may well ask how on earth the UN thinks it knows this .
A fair point , but we can already see that in most rich countries , the population has now stabilised , and the birth rate in some countries , like Italy , has now dropped to only 1.3 children per woman , which is probably the lowest fertility rate in human history .
A decline in the birth rate is also happening in most developing nations , but at a much slower rate .
Therefore , the population of the developed world will be static at 1.2 billion between now and 2050 , while that of the developing regions will rise from 5.2 billion to 7.8 billion .
Some may say that none of this really matters .
But apart from the effect of population size on global warming and the sustainability of the planet , I ask you this : how can England be expected to win the World Cup when we will be so heavily outnumbered by the footballers of the developing world in centuries to come ?

Cosmonaut space stunt will put balls into orbit .
Cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin works with a sleeve of a Russian Orlan spacesuit in the Pirs Docking Compartment .
NASA
What would you do if you were taking a stroll in space ?
Take some souvenir snaps ?
Do some somersaults in zero gravity ?
Or perhaps you would practice your golf swing .
That is exactly what Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin is planning to do during his space walk from the international space station ( ISS ) later today .
The stunt is a promotional gimmic for Canadian club maker Element 21 Golf , which is paying the Russian space agency for Tyurin 's time .
Unlike most commercial gimics , this one has caused massive debate about safety within government agencies — NASA has spent months deciding whether or not to agree to the ploy .
“ He 's not going to get the kind of swing Tiger Woods gets . ” Jeffrey Hoffman , MIT , Cambridge
Tyurin will gently tap up to three specially designed golf balls , with a mass of just 3 grams , at a maximum speed of 1.2 metres per second .
He will aim backwards , away from the station , to minimize the chances of causing any damage to it .
" Once clear of the station , the ball will have a sufficient de-orbital trajectory that it will not pose a re-contact hazard to the station , " says NASA spokesperson Grey Hautaluoma .
If a ball were to hit , it could do serious damage to the solar panels .
Predictions for the ball 's survival time vary .
NASA predicts the ball will drop out of orbit and burn up in the Earth 's atmosphere within 3 or 4 days .
But the Russian space agency Roscosmos and the Canadian golf equipment firm sponsoring the event have suggested that the ball will keep going for up to 3 years .
NASA suggests that this longer estimate may be the result of assuming that the ball will be a regular 45 grams , rather than the slimmed - down version actually being used in the stunt — a lighter object is much more heavily influenced by the tiny amount of atmospheric drag at that altitude , which should degrade its orbit more quickly .
Round and round
The direction the ball is hit is critical .
At the point of contact , the ball and the ISS are , obviously , in the same circular orbit .
As soon as the ball 's velocity changes , so will its orbit .
If hit forwards , the ball will speed up relative to the ISS and go into a higher - energy elliptical orbit ; if hit backwards , it will slow down and drop into a lower - energy orbit .
In either case , the golf ball will always return one orbit later to the exact spot it was hit .
This does n't mean that the ISS is in danger of a golf - ball bombardment explains ex-astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman , now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge .
" The period of the orbit is changed , so although the ball comes back to exactly the same point in space one orbit later , it will get there before or after the space station does .
If the ball is hit backwards , as planned , its orbital period will be decreased , and it will get back before the ISS returns to that point . "
And without thrusters to keep the ball in place , its orbit will quickly spiral in towards the Earth , taking it out of the path of the ISS altogether .
The ISS orbits the Earth 15.72 times a day .
After a few days , the golf ball could be whipping around a bit more than 16 times a day , estimates William Ailor , director of the Centre for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies in Los Angeles .
That would put it thousands of kilometres away from the ISS on its nearest pass .
The one danger is if the ball is hit sideways at exactly 90 degrees .
It would then come back and wallop the station half an orbit later , says Hoffman .
Thankfully Tyurin wo n't be able to slice his shot , as the ball will be guided backwards by a restraining mechanism with a 60 - degree safety cone .
Need for speed
If Tyurin were to give it his all , how fast would the ball go ?
Terrestrial golfers would typically hit a ball with a force that would see it accelerate from 0 to 160 kilometres an hour in about one two - thousandth of a second , although for professional golfers the ball might get up to more than 200 kilometres an hour , says Steve Mather , a sports scientist from Nottingham University , UK .
The lack of air resistance in space would make little difference to this speed , says Mather .
More restricting would be the bulky space suit worn by the golfer .
" He 's not going to get the kind of swing Tiger Woods gets , " says space - walking veteran Hoffman .
" Tiger Woods would n't get a Tiger Woods swing in a space suit . "
So Tyurin 's planned tap might be more accurately described as a gentle putt , probably done one - handed .
ADVERTISEMENT
Tyurin will have to be well anchored throughout his golfing adventure .
Golfers wear spiked shoes for good reason — to keep them in one spot and compensate the reaction from the force of hitting the ball .
" We rely on the fact that gravitational acceleration keeps us on the floor , " says Mather .
If Tyurin were not tethered , the equal and opposite force of hitting the ball would send him off in the opposite direction .
The stunt will probably remind space nostalgists of Alan Shepard — the only person to ever play golf on the Moon , which he did during the 1971 Apollo 14 mission .
The fate of that ball is uncertain ; presumably future colonists might one day find it .

An anti-poverty campaigner and a bank in Bangladesh have won this year ’s Nobel Peace Prize .
The purpose of the prize has become muddled .
It may be better to withhold it next time
BRAVERY is a characteristic shared by most winners of the Nobel Peace Prize .
On Friday October 13th , the Norwegian part of the Nobel Institute ( a Swedish body that dishes out the other coveted prizes , for science and literature ) named the recipient of the 2006 peace award .
An unofficial shortlist included a pair of Irish rock stars who have received a lot of attention for trying to promote development in Africa , a Finnish diplomat who works at the UN and who has lobbied for peace in Indonesia and a Vietnamese Buddhist .
In fact the award was given to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen bank in Bangladesh , which promotes lending to the poorest , especially women .
But the Nobel committee could have made a braver , more difficult , choice by declaring that there would be no recipient at all .
That might ruin a good party — each year the lucky winner ( who also gets a cash prize of $ 1.3 m or so ) is honoured with a lavish award ceremony in Oslo , Norway 's capital , given a commemorative medal , and attention is shone on his particular good cause .
Some recent examples include a campaign to ban landmines ; the promotion of peace in Northern Ireland ; efforts to bring democracy to Myanmar ( which used to be called Burma ) .
Withholding the prize for a year , or possibly five , might seem rather callous .
But the institute would not be suggesting that the world has become sufficiently peaceful now .
Some do argue that wars are generally in decline .
Last year a think - tank in Canada released a “ Human Security Report ” which noted that 100 - odd wars have expired since 1988 .
Their study found that wars and genocides have become less frequent since 1991 , that the value of the international arms trade has slumped by a third ( between 1990 and 2003 ) , and that refugee numbers have roughly halved ( between 1992 and 2003 ) .
Yet , despite all that , there are clearly enough problems today — Darfur , Sri Lanka , Somalia , Afghanistan , Iraq , international terrorism — to keep the hardest - working peace promoters busy .
The reason for the institute to withhold the prize , instead , would be to preserve its value .
There is a risk that its worth is being eroded as the institute scrambles to find an eye - catching recipient every year .
There is the problem of Buggins 's turn , an expectation ( as with some other prizes ) that the award should rotate between regions of the world .
This year it is Asia , last year the recipient was from the Middle East , the year before from Africa .
Some recipients seem less than deserving .
Vietnam 's Le Duc
Tho declined the award in 1973 when he was asked to share it with America 's Henry Kissinger .
The two had signed a ceasefire agreement that year , but fighting continued in Vietnam for another two years .
The recent decision to give the prize to a Kenyan environmentalist , Wangari Maathai , was also odd : she has done a lot to plant trees in Kenya , but not much to promote peace .
Worse , she holds bizarre views on AIDS , suggesting that HIV was created by evil scientists to kill black people .
This year 's winner is an admirable anti-poverty campaigner , but it is a stretch to call him or the Grameen bank peacemakers .
In searching out individuals to praise for a variety of good deeds , to make celebrities of the well - meaning in various walks of life , is to confuse the purpose of the prize : to promote peace .
The organisers could recall that on 19 occasions since the prize was first given out in 1901 , the institute declared that it could find no fitting winner .
During much of the first and second world wars , for example , no winner was named .
But the last time the institute dared to do that was in 1972 .
What has changed since then , one might suspect , is that the institute has found it has a great need — for marketing purposes perhaps — to give out the prize .
The challenge , for the next few years , will be to find the bravery to hold back .
Just a few days after the release of Terra Soft Solutions ' Yellow Dog Linux v5.0 , hackers found a way to rip Blu-ray movies onto the PS3 hard drive .
Yellow Dog Linux v5.0 , which can be , allows users to turn their PlayStation 3 into a personal computer .
The hard drive is segmented to prevent users from manipulating the PS3's own software , but that has n't stopped hackers from exploiting Sony 's new console .
Multiple sites , including PVRWire , are demonstrating methods to illegally copy Blu-ray movies to the PS3 hard drive .
Since Blu-ray drives are not yet available on PCs , the PS3 version of Linux is the first user - accessible OS capable of working with the new media .
Unlike music CDs , which allow users to create back - up copies for personal use , Blu-ray and DVD movies carry express copyright laws forbidding any form of duplication .
Even ripping a Blu-ray disc to a PS3 for your own enjoyment is in violation of these laws .

What are your thoughts ?
Instead of waiting for the next welfare check , Heino Wittstock is picking asparagus .
The German construction worker has been unemployed for three years .
But this spring , he joins some 280,000 Polish migrant farmhands , plucking the foot - high green and white sentinels from the rich Brandenburg loam .
" I need to do something ; Sitting at home on the couch is not an option , " he says .
In an unusual effort to address its 11.9 percent unemployment rate , Berlin is also trying to answer a common refrain in many industrial nations : " Foreigners are taking jobs away from us . "
In Germany , the spring asparagus is harvested by migrant farmworkers .
But the labor ministry has a new rule that says 10 percent of seasonal farmworkers should be German .
With only 170 German field hands in the state of Brandenburg so far , the experiment is off to a rocky start .
And German farmers are angry , saying native - born pickers are only half as efficient as the Poles .
Unemployed Germans lack both practice and motivation , farmers here say .
" You can't force people into work , " says Dietrich Paul , spokesman for asparagus farmers in the state of Lower Saxony , one of Germany 's biggest asparagus regions , " especially not this line of work . "
Adding to the farmers ' concern is the feeling that Germany , already one of the most restricted labor markets for unskilled workers , is putting up hurdles that will push Eastern European workers to increasingly look elsewhere in Europe for work .
Germany 's enforcement this year of an EU rule requiring Polish migrant workers to pay social security on the wages they earn has already decreased the numbers coming over for the annual harvest , say farmers .
" These seasonal workers are the basis of the biggest farms , " says Mr. Paul .
" They are the reason ... permanent jobs are created .
If less and less come , then the farms will shrink . "
Labor ministry officials deny they have anything to do with the decrease in foreign workers .
The 10 - percent rule introduced this season is about integrating Germans into the agricultural workforce , not trimming foreigners from it .
And in contrast to failed attempts to do similar things in the past , the labor ministry is not trying to " force " anyone , says Ulrich Waschki .
Cash on top of a welfare check
Rather , he says , they 're trying to recruit volunteer field hands from the ranks of the unemployed who will be attracted by the prospect of earning money on top of their monthly unemployment checks .
Depending on the region , the labor agency will pay German farm workers between 13 and 20 euros ( $ 16.50 - $ 25.50 ) a day on top of the hourly wage they receive working on the farm , according to a spokesman .
At the end of a month of work , that can mean as much as 480 euros , tax - free , from the labor agency .
The additional income appeals to Mr. Wittstock , who has struggled to support his girlfriend 's three children from another relationship .
" The children also want things , and we can't afford them [ on unemployment ] alone , " says Wittstock , who gets 298 euros a month in spending money from the government in addition to a housing subsidy .
German officials say that more important than the short - term cash injection is the hope that regular work will give people like Wittstock the psychological boost needed to get back into the regular job market .
" The harvest , at the very least , gives them some perspective , " says Dirk Johl , second in command at Agrotime , a private job search agency for the agricultural sector .
" And they need that . "
Mr. Johl works to place jobless Germans as seasonal workers in Brandenburg 's biggest asparagus farms .
Before sending them to the farms , he makes sure the Germans understand the strenuous work demanded of them .
He even sets up beds of asparagus to train them .
Thanks to the 10 - percent rule this year , he 's been able to place 170 unemployed Germans at 12 farms in the region , more than in years past .
( The harvest just began this month , so no national statistics are available yet . )
An advocate for the jobless , Johl nevertheless is a realist when it comes to his trainees ' limits .
" The average Polish worker can harvest up to 400 kilograms [ 881 lbs. ] a day of asparagus , " he says .
The average German , picks about 200 kilograms , he says .
" The Germans get tired quickly .
We 're happy to work more , " says Karolina Pawlak , taking a break from sorting asparagus at a farm not far from where Wittstock was working .
2,000 euros in six weeks
A nurse from the town of Konin , in central Poland , Ms. Pawlak took paid vacation for six weeks from her job and drove some 370 miles to Beelitz to work on the Jakobs Farm .
She says she 'll earn 2,000 euros during her time at the farm , the equivalent of six months pay at her hospital .
" I like to work and I 'd like a better life in Poland , so that I 'm not just living month to month , " she says .
With the money she 's earned this year and last year , she 's building a house .
But German farmers are increasingly concerned reliable workers like Pawlak will move on to more flexible labor markets in the coming years .
The EU rule requiring Polish migrant workers to pay up to half of the wages they earn during the two - month asparagus harvest into social security has been in effect since Poland joined the EU in 2004 .
German and Polish authorities have been trying to reach an understanding that would be more agreeable to migrant workers , but have n't yet .
" Many Poles will no longer come to Germany , " predicts Joerg Buschmann , co-owner of Buschmann & Winkelmann , the region 's largest asparagus farm .
" They will go to Spain , England , or Denmark , where the labor market is a bit loose , " meaning the enforcement of the EU social security rule is more lax .
During the harvest season , his farm employs 1,350 people , 800 of them Polish workers picking white and green asparagus on the farm 's 889 acres .
When asked about the importance of his foreigners , Buschmann likes to reply that three harvest workers secure one German job , meaning the high productivity of Polish laborers allows the farm to employ Germans in other parts of the industry .
" Were it not for the Poles , we 'd have to close down , " he says .
Last Thursday the German police arrested Katharina Plett , a homeschooling mother of twelve .
Yesterday her husband fled to Austria with the children .
Homeschooling is illegal in Germany since Hitler banned it in 1938 .
The Plett family belongs to a homeschooling group of seven Baptist families in Paderborn .
We wrote about their case last year .
Stefan Sedlaczek of the Catholic website kreuz .
net heard about her arrest on Saturday .
He reports today that a female plain - clothes police officer rang at Katharina Plett ’s house on Thursday around 11:00 am .
When she opened the door other police officers , who had hidden themselves , forced their way in .
Mrs Plett was allowed to change , but a police officer followed her into her bedroom in case “ she would arm herself and shoot us all . ”
The woman was able to inform her husband by mobile phone before the police brought her to Bielefeld .
The authorities later informed her husband that she has been imprisoned in Gelsenkirchen .
Apparently she has been given a ten day prison sentence .
When Sedlaczek rang the Gelsenkirchen prison authorities to get confirmation of Katharina Plett ’s whereabouts , he was told that no information would be given .
A written request for information has so far not been answered either .
Unless we are mistaken , the German mainstream media have not written anything about this case yet .
Yesterday , Katharina ’s husband fled with their children to a Christian family center in Wolfgangsee in Austria .
A homeschooling couple from Hamburg has also fled to Wolfgangsee .
Their case was covered in the media .
In Austria parents are entitled to homeschool during a one year trial period , after which the authorities decide whether the parents are allowed to continue homeschooling or not .

NEW ! 12 June 2011 : It 's been almost ten whole years since the original version of Press Start came out ( it 's been that long ? ) , and I thought that it was worth a complete revamp .
And so ... that 's exactly what I 've done .
This font is based on the fonts from a number of classic Namco arcade games , as immortalized in the Namco ' 70s - ' 80s Arcade Videogames Font Museum .
More specifically , it 's based on the character set from Return of Ishtar , one of the first Namco games to include and make use of a full lowercase font .
No , I 'm not the first to have ported this font to TrueType , even with lowercase ; Genshichi Yasui did a number of wonderful 8 - bit font conversions , including the Return of Ishtar font .
However , this font differs from Yasui's in a very significant way : it includes the entire Latin Extended A block of Unicode , allowing this font to be used in a variety of European languages .
And that 's not the end of it —
I 've extended this even further with Cyrillic and Greek letters as well , and may eventually get around to also adding katakana ( which were included in Yasui 's version ) .
Also , as in the previous version , I 've added a few symbol characters — even a few that were n't in the original .
UPDATED 1 November 2012 : Version 2.14 .
Although the font has had Cyrillic and Greek support for a year , it was n't correctly recognized by Windows as supporting those code pages ; this is now fixed .

[ Note ( 2019/12/07 ) : Although I 'm still offering this font for download for historical reasons , I highly recommend VileR 's conversion of the IBM BIOS font from the Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack , as it's much more extensive and Unicode - friendly than my take from over a decade ago . ]
Brings back some memories , does n't it ?
Yes , this is the font used in the console mode of myriad old computers ; indeed , it can be found buried within the ROMs of video cards even today , but so few programs call upon it anymore ( and with good reason , considering the much higher resolutions available ! ) that it 's been more or less forgotten ... until now .
Yes , I know such fonts as E. A. Behl 's " Video Terminal Screen " exist , but that particular font is a conversion of the default 8x16 VGA font .
I wanted to go back even further to the long - forgotten but nostalgia - inducing 8x8 font used on CGA cards ( and , for that matter , in the 320x240 graphics mode on VGA adapters ) , but I had n't seen a TrueType version of that font around anywhere , so I decided I 'd create one myself .
Background information :
This font was converted using Softy and Font Creator Program from character bitmaps found on the Internet , including a public - domain Windows bitmap font which can be downloaded below .
And yes , the name is a pun on IBM's PC Jr , now a veritable dinosaur of a computer ...

This is , of course , the font from Squaresoft 's classic Super Nintendo RPG Secret of Mana .
I chose the name because at the time , more and more games ( such as Zelda 3 , for instance ) were gravitating toward the use of proportionally - spaced fonts to display dialogue , but Secret of Mana still used a monospaced font ( albeit a newly and nicely designed one ) to display its text .

Scientific Consensus or Religious War ?
By Arnold Kling
Mark Thoma writes ,
Paul Krugman tackles the trashing of science by oil companies , Exxon in particular , to cloud research pointing to global warming .
He quotes from the Krugman piece , which appears to be a typical type M argument .
At the movies this weekend , I saw a trailer for An Inconvenient Truth , described in the review as
the gripping story of former Vice President Al Gore , who became interested in this startling issue while at college 30 years ago , and now devotes his life to reversing global warming .
Traveling the world , he has built a visually mesmerizing presentation designed to disabuse doubters of the notion that climate change is debatable .
The heart of Davis Guggenheim ’s film is this elegant multimedia lecture itself , where Gore indisputably correlates CO2 emissions with exponentially rising temperatures , already responsible for dramatic climactic shifts like ice - cap melting , drought , and rising sea levels .
Interwoven with this riveting public address are intimate moments revealing the poetic , searching side of Gore as he struggles to define his purpose in the aftermath of the 2000 election .
This is activist cinema at its very best , for it serves to popularize and demythologize a problem long obscured by those most threatened by the solution .
With humor and searing intelligence , Gore outlines crucial steps we must take to avert impending disaster and proves that inaction is no longer an option–in fact , it ’s immoral .
My concern is with how “ scientific consensus ” is reached .
In economics in the 1960 ’s , there was a “ scientific consensus , ” embedded in sophisticated macro-econometric models , that inflation reflected a competition over income shares , and that government policies to interfere with wage - and price - setting were the solution .
Milton Friedman ’s contrary views were outside the “ scientific consensus . ”
By 1985 or so , the “ scientific consensus ” had shifted , in part because policies based on that consensus were tried in the 1970 ’s , leading to the worst macroeconomic performance of the post - war period .
By the 1990 ’s , large macro-econometric models had pretty much disappeared from the economics literature .
The problem with macro-econometrics is that the models continually broke down out of sample .
That is , a model estimated through 1969 would work terribly in predicting the early 1970’s .
A model estimated through 1975 would work terribly in predicting the late 1970 ’s , and so on .
Milton Friedman ’s dissenting views of 1967 are close to the consensus views today .
I wish that climate - change models did not remind me so much of macro-econometric models .
I wish that the contempt that the Left expresses for dissenting views in climate science did not remind me of the contempt that the Left expressed for Milton Friedman .
And I wish that the debate over climate change were being waged over substance , rather than with type M arguments and on film .
Movies are a propaganda medium , not an information medium .
I worry that the environmentalists are motivating themselves to stage a religious war over global warming .
My guess is that mankind will not be well served by such a religious war .
A New mammal species - thought to be the first discovered in Europe for more than a century - has been identified by a scientist based at the University of Durham .
The grey mouse , found in Cyprus by Thomas Cucchi , has been confirmed as an entirely new species by genetic tests , overturning the widespread assumption that Europe had no mammals left to be discovered .
Dr Cucchi , who is French , was working on the Mediterranean island studying mouse teeth from the Stone Age period and comparing them with those of four modern mouse species when he came across a variety that seemed to differ from all known European mice .
The species , named Mus cypriacus , or the Cypriot mouse , has a larger head , ears , eyes and teeth than previously known examples .
It is described in the journal Zootaxa .

* When presidents fail to make hard choices , those who serve must make them instead .
Soldiers must choose whether to stay with their families or to stay in the armed forces at all .
Sending our military on vague , aimless , and endless missions rapidly saps morale .
Even the highest morale is eventually undermined by back - to - back deployments , poor pay , shortages of spare parts and equipment , inadequate training , and rapidly declining readiness .
* Nor should the intelligence community be made the scapegoat for political misjudgments .
A Republican administration working with the Congress will respect the needs and quiet sacrifices of these public servants as it strengthens America ’s intelligence and counter - intelligence capabilities and reorients them toward the dangers of the future .
* The rule of law , the very foundation for a free society , has been under assault , not only by criminals from the ground up , but also from the top down .
An administration that lives by evasion , coverup , stonewalling , and duplicity has given us a totally discredited Department of Justice .
In the course of reading the 2000 GOP Platform in preparing the prior post , there were several passages that seemed worth noting : Independently , Anonymous Liberal astutely recalls that in 2003 , CBS caved to pressure by refusing to broadcast The Reagans , as a result of protests from right - wing bloggers and other ideologues ( who had not seen the film ) that it was insufficiently reverent of Ronald Reagan and took liberties in documenting events in his life .

報告 書 「 IPv4アドレス枯渇に向けた提言」公開にあたって
現在のインターネットの運営に不可欠なIPv4アドレスは、
世界的にインターネットの利用が盛んになり始めた1990年代中盤から、
近い将来全てのアドレスを使い尽くして枯渇してしまう日が訪れることが指摘され、 これを受けてIPv4アドレス枯渇の解決を含む新たなバージョンのインターネットプロトコル、
IPバージョン6(以下 IPv6 ) の開発が始まりました。
IPv6は機器への実装やネットワークへの適用も少しずつ進んできているところですが、
昨年IPv4アドレスの枯渇があと数年で訪れるとする研究結果が複数提示され、
IPv4アドレス枯渇が急激に現実味を帯びるところとなっています。
社団法人日本ネットワークインフォメーションセンター( JPNIC)ではこのような状況を精査することを目的に
2005年12月に有識者による専門家チームを設立し、
その専門家チームにおいて検討を重ねて参りましたが、 今般その検討が「 IPv4アドレス枯渇に向けた提言」という報告書にまとまりましたので公開いたします。

… IPv4アドレスの割り振り・割り当てはそう遠くない将来において終了することは明らかである。
これによって直ちにIPv4を基盤としたインターネットが終了する訳ではない。 しかし、新しいIPv4アドレスが割り当てられないことから、
IPv4を基盤としたインターネットの成長は停止あるいは縮退していくことになる。
インターネットを利用するすべての者は、この事実を受け止め、
必要な対策を順次講じるべきである。
IPv4アドレスの枯渇に向けて、インターネットに関わる者は、 特にIPv6インターネットへの対応を検討・実施することが急務であると考えられる。
今後、ユーザに向けて何らかの新しいサービスを提供する場合は、
IPv4を基盤としたインターネット上のみで提供されるのではなく、
IPv6を基盤としたインターネット上でも提供するべきである。
この冒頭の後に連なる提言は、IPアドレスを管理するインターネットレジストリ、
インターネットサービスプロバイダー、インターネット上の各種サービス提供者、
インターネットを利用する企業ユーザー、一般ユーザー、ベンダーを含む技術開発者など、
インターネット上のあらゆるプレイヤーの皆様に、IPv4アドレス枯渇に向けた対応と、
枯渇の後には必ず必要となるIPv6インターネットへの準備を喚起するもので、
これらの提言につながる報告書上の他の全ての内容は、
この提言を裏付ける論拠あるいは参考資料として提示されるものです。
このように枯渇により惹起される状況の予測や今後に備えるための提言も含めて総合的に記述された文献は、

Will New Wal - Mart Policy Help Catch More Drunken Drivers ?
If you are a retailer , setting a policy for handling shoplifters is n’t simple .
Do you call the police for every shoplifter , even a kid who pockets a box of crayons ?
What about a senior citizen taking some batteries ?
Do you treat first - timers the same as pros ?
Wal - Mart has long been known for a very strict policy : call the police on anyone who takes anything .
But that policy is over .
Wal - Mart , which I am guessing may be the largest shoplifting target in history , is no longer prosecuting first - time shoplifter unless they are between 18 and 65 and have stolen more than $ 25 worth of stuff .
According to today ’s N.Y .
Times , this change puts Wal - Mart in line with most other chains ’ policies .
Why the change ?
Plainly , Wal - Mart had a strong preference for a zero - tolerance policy .
But as it turned out , it was the economics — of their business and of policing — that produced the change .
For the store , the opportunity cost had come to severely outweigh the shoplifting cost .
“ J.P. Suarez , who is in charge of asset protection at Wal - Mart , said it was no longer efficient to prosecute petty shoplifters , ” Michael Barbaro wrote in the Times .
“ ‘ If I have somebody being paid $ 12 an hour processing a $ 5 theft , I have just lost money , ’ he said .
‘ I have also lost the time to catch somebody stealing $ 100 or an organized group stealing $ 3,000 . ' ”
But , although the article does n’t quite say so , I am guessing it was the pressure from police departments that truly forced Wal - Mart ’s hand .
The Times quotes Don Zofchak , police chief in South Strabane Township , Pa. , as saying that Wal - Mart “ would arrest somebody for stealing a pair of socks .
I felt we were spending an inordinate amount of time just dealing with Wal - Mart . ”
It would n’t surprise me if police in many small cities and rural areas had stopped responding to Wal - Mart ’s daily requests to pick up their shoplifters , or at least grumbled mightily about having to do so .
Wal - Mart has taken lots of heat for lots of reasons over the years — including , for instance , the fact that many of its low - wage employees also receive public assistance , which has led some critics to say that the U.S. Government in effect subsidizes Wal - Mart ’s business .
I can imagine how its old shoplifting policy may have led to even more damaging criticism — that Wal - Mart has turned local police forces into Wal - Mart police forces , preventing them from doing their real jobs .
Wal - Mart is famously protective of its data , and I am sure it will not divulge much about how this new policy plays out .
( The Times article , e.g. , was based on internal documents leaked to the paper by WakeUpWal - Mart.com , “ a group backed by unions that have tried to organize Wal - Mart workers in the U.S. ” )
But if for someone could figure out exactly how and when each Wal - Mart store changes its shoplifting policy , and how many fewer times it calls the police , it would be really interesting to see what else the police in those places end up doing : do they make more arrests for drunken driving or domestic abuse or meth distribution ?

Anthony Lawrence
BBC News , Vietnam
This From Our Own Correspondent was first broadcast on 23 May , 1970 .
Driven by Cold War concerns over the spread of communism , the US sent troops to South Vietnam in 1954 .
By 1970 , 400,000 soldiers were stationed there .
In Vietnam , Anthony Lawrence discovered what life was like for the US soldiers on the front line .
Soldiers ' morale is difficult to analyse , especially here in Vietnam .
Wars are different now .
The old vocabulary - words like " bravery " , " discipline " , " morale " - does not meet the problem .
In the Vietnam War you mostly do not need brave men , you need efficient ones able to handle highly - sophisticated instruments of transport and death .
And the standard length of service in Vietnam is one year .
For most of the 400,000 Americans still out here , the best morale builder of all is that you can actually count the days to going home .
But there are tremendous contrasts .
Tough conditions
There are about 80,000 men , less than a fifth of the total US army in Vietnam , who really meet the enemy close - up : killing and getting killed
Many are better off than they would be in the States .
But when you leave the big bases and maintenance areas and get out into the wilds , then it is different .
There you meet the real soldiers : the men of the infantry , and the air cavalry units .
There are about 80,000 men , less than a fifth of the total US army in Vietnam , who really meet the enemy close - up : killing and getting killed .
They are young , mostly drafted men , graduates , college dropouts , a large proportion of negroes .
Their nickname is " grunts " , from the way the soldier grunts as he shoulders his heavy pack .
You can go for months and meet nothing , and then three times in one week you meet some awful ambush or firelight
They may be out for as long as a whole month at a time .
And when they return it is not to a camp with cinema shows and hot showers , but to a so - called fire - base with gun-pits and holes in the ground to sleep in .
And their chance of getting killed or wounded is very high .
That is the sector where morale is under pressure .
' A nightmare '
It is such a chancy business , this patrolling .
You can go for months and meet nothing , and then three times in one week you meet some awful ambush or firelight .
The man next to you goes down yelling with a leg blown off .
The platoon commander is bleeding to death against a tree .
In this infantryman 's life , the great thing is to come safe home , ' to keep your arse covered ' , as the soldiers call it
When you get back from all that , the re-enlistment sergeant is waiting for a little chat .
He can get you out of all that , he says , if you are ready to sign on for a longer spell in the army , get you a cushier job .
Morale
In this infantryman 's life , the great thing is to come safe home , " to keep your arse covered " , as the soldiers call it .
There is a vast gap between , on the one side , the junior officers , NCOs and men , and on the other , the higher ranks , the career officers , the so - called " lifers " .
It is the " lifers " who believe in conventional discipline .
It is the case of old soldiers doing what cannot be got out of , doing their duty
" I never thought about morale , " said one young lieutenant .
" The life certainly changes you a lot .
" Luxury , to me , is staying in a forest clearing for one whole afternoon without having to move on .
A drink from a cold stream 's a gift from heaven .
A bed to sleep on , unimaginable . "
Duty calls
What about pot-smoking ?
Platoon commanders confirmed to me that a lot goes on .
But there would be big trouble if some idiot smoked just before going on patrol .
It brings on enormous thirst and for a while dulls perception , which is fatal .
Their only respect is for each other and for the enemy who kills and dies like they do , along the forest trails
But that is not bad morale .
They would not run away .
It is the case of old soldiers doing what can not be got out of , doing their duty .
And again , in the old tradition , their main contempt is for the overweight sergeants back at the base , the generals ' talk of kill ratios .
Their only respect is for each other and for the enemy who kills and dies like they do , along the forest trails .
And they know , too , that when they get back to the States , there is no one to talk to about what they have been through .
No one who wants to listen .
Tiananmen Square never seems to leave the news .
People jailed during the uprising are still being released from prison , records previously guarded as state secrets are coming to light , and books on the topic keep coming out .
China 's status as one of the world 's fastest growing economies , ever transitioning toward a market model , draws our attention to these fateful days of the summer of 1989 .
The political dynamic was always more complicated than it appeared on television .
It was not merely a case of freedom - loving students protesting a totalitarian state , as it seemed to many people at the time .
It is entirely possible that if the protestors demands had been met , China would be less free than it is today .
And yet there are still lessons for those who love liberty in what occurred in those days .
The main one is something most people miss : the manner in which the protest movement formed and organized itself demonstrates that liberty does not need political democracy in order to work to the benefit of everyone .
It all started out very simply .
Dissatisfied with unemployment , inflation , general living conditions , and the government response to the death of Hu Yaobang , Chinese students made some relatively modest demands of the government .
They wanted better food and dorms , official recognition of a relatively liberal leader , Yaobang , and a more daring demand of democratic change .
Others complained that the pace of economic reforms was moving too quickly , and that China was backing away from its commitment to Communist ideology .
Still others had some inchoate sense that something had gone wrong and wanted some way out .
This would become the 1989 demonstrations , a period of two months in China from April to June of 1989 in which millions of Chinese citizens with disparate interests and goals protested their oppressive government .
No such demonstration against the People 's Republic of China had ever been seen in one of the greatest single prospects for freedom in the last century .
But such demonstrations were not poised to bring freedom for the reasons most people believe .
Western observers , and indeed the student protestors themselves , saw democracy as the means to free the poor , the oppressed , unemployed , and political prisoners from Communist leadership .
Interestingly , the state controlled education in China meant that nobody protesting knew what democracy really was .
They thought it must have been a good thing , and believed Western nations were freer because of it and wanted it .
When millions were gathered in Tiananmen Square and student leaders considered withdrawing because of the looming threat of martial law being declared , they decided to vote on the matter .
As author Jan Wong pointed out , because of their lack of understanding of how western democracy worked , the students did n't withdraw because they thought only a unanimous vote could justify it .
And thank goodness they did n't .
As is to be expected when government power is threatened , and American observers such as Henry Kissinger had later justified , the politicians showed a perverse , infantile kind of anger .
Any such threat to power surely is n't out of a desire for prosperity , freedom , and peace , the politicians argue .
It is always just some radical minority who wishes to cause trouble .
As the official Chinese newspaper , the People 's Daily , said of what they claimed was a minority of counterrevolutionaries , " Their goal is to poison people 's minds to create turmoil throughout the country . "
The Communist Party was split over how to deal with the millions of protestors , with some favoring diplomacy and others favoring a declaration of martial law .
One party leader met with student leaders who were weakened from a hunger strike and wearing pajamas .
The party leader planned on lecturing the students in an arrogant display of paternalism as if they were his children .
Instead , the students dared to interrupt , and even wagged their finger at the politician , something unheard of in China .
But something even more astonishing happened within the structure of the protest movement itself .
As Dean of U.C. Berkeley 's School of Journalism , Orville Schell , noted of Tiananmen Square ,
" It was like a miniature city .
There were places where the contributions were collected by banks .
There were food commissary areas .
There were sleeping areas .
There were hospital areas .
Self police .
No violence .
No theft .
The whole city for this amazing period of weeks became a city of tranquility and brotherhood . "
Not " like " , Professor Schell .
It was a city .
And a stateless one at that .
No majority vote or democratically elected leader , and certainly not a socialist planner , was necessary to make such order arise out of the apparent chaos of the free market that existed in Tiananmen Square .
Apparently , when people are free to act on an unhampered market where titles of ownership are respected and exchanged , the interests of everyone involved are in harmony with one another .
This truly was an original revolution for the people .
Curiously enough for the People 's Daily , turmoil was not erupting around China .
In fact , a great ordering of society was finally taking place .
It was only when the government stepped in with its guns on its own people that chaos took hold .
The People 's Republic of China had only been used to reorganizations ( rather , disorganizations ) of society as decreed by the state .
Order was supposed to come from the top down .
If only the Chinese government could have backed off and let capitalism spread , the students may have realized that they did n't need democracy .
They had all they needed at their disposal .
They needed no political consultants or economists to tell them what to do .
No one needed to tell them what transactions benefited them more than others , or where they were willing to buy or sell a good at a certain price .
If the student leaders calling for democracy realized the logical implications of these free - market actions , then perhaps they would have rejected democracy outright .
As it was , they had full fledged anarchy in the square , and they were thriving on it .
While observers such as Professor Schell may look upon the peace and prosperity that arose in anarchy as a peculiar phenomenon , it should be no surprise to anyone who understands how freedom works .
Such order would have spread and continued to thrive in the absence of government intervention .
This is simply what happens when you let people be free .
As of May 17 , 1.2 million people were in the square , and there was still no overpopulation problem .
Professor Schell states ,
" Looking down the Avenue of the Eternal Peace in either direction for miles and miles and miles you saw nothing but well over a million people flooding into the square .
Banners [ were ] flying , and every conceivable organization in the city — the air force , the police , the hotels , universities , factories , the post office , all flying these banners and marching into the square … "
Yet , statists and supporters of democracy necessarily overlook the fundamentals of how the order and prosperity that arose in Tiananmen Square entails no principles different from what would arise in the absence of democracy , say , in the United States today .
Many people who would have expressed support for the protestors would be glad to have mired them in majoritarianism and bureaucracy .
Imagine the horror that left - liberals such as Molly " Government is Efficient " Ivins would feel in the absence of nanny - state interventions and price controls .
Communist China was and is uncomfortably closer to their ideals than anything for which the protestors demonstrated .
And conservatives such as Jonah " Libertarianism is for Kids " Goldberg would be delighted to reinstitute measures the Communists had over the lives of the Chinese to keep kids from being libertines .
With good guys in charge , of course .
In short , we can see a heartening example of what capitalism in the absence of the state will yield when , for a brief but glorious time , a free market thrived in China .
Though there are good reasons to use priority - based preemption in some applications , preemption also creates a number of problems for embedded software developers .
Programming in such an environment necessarily creates excess complexity when the application is not well suited to being coded as a set of tasks that can preempt each other .
Sometimes this added complexity results in system failures .
It almost always also lengthens development and debug cycles .

Priority - based Scheduling
There is a relatively simple explanation for the observed regularity of RTOS designs : academia .
In the 1970's and 1980 's the concept of " fixed - priority scheduling " was widely studied .
This research culminated in the canonical 1991 research paper : " Rate Monotonic Analysis for Real - Time Systems " by Sha , Klein and Goodenough .
There is a technical description of RMA , as it is abbreviated , here : http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/descriptions/rma_body.html and a concise overview by David Stewart and your author here : http://www.netrino.com/Publications/Glossary/RMA.html
Assign the priority of each task according to its period , so that the shorter the period of a task the higher is its priority .
RMA , the academics ultimately determined , is the optimal fixed - priority scheduling algorithm .
If a specific set of tasks cannot be scheduled to meet all deadlines using the RMA algorithm , it cannot be scheduled using any fixed - priority algorithm
Given this " optimality " of RMA , it was natural for operating systems vendors to offer products that provide fixed - priority preemptive scheduling .
Once Ready Systems ' VRTX and a few other early RTOS players made a space for this technology , the other major market participants quickly followed suit .
The herd behavior had begun : a technique that solves one kind of problem best became the norm .
Other kinds of problems would need to be solved by the brute force of fitting a square peg into the round hole of priority - based preemption .
Despite the fact that all our RTOS choices are designed for compatibility with RMA , these facts persist : few engineers are working on problems with hard real - time deadlines ; very few folks outside of that group are using RMA to prioritize tasks ; and measuring the worst - case execution time of each periodic task and finding a way to calculate the worst - case behavior of aperiodics ( e.g. , interupt service routines , or ISRs ) needs to be done at each recompile and is so labor intensive it is probably only done on less than 1 in 10,000 embedded projects that use an RTOS .
Implications of Preemption
Aside from RMA compatibility , the one positive implication of preemption is task responsiveness .
A preemptive priority - based scheduler effectively treats software tasks as hardware treats ISRs .
As soon as the highest - priority task ( ISR ) is ready to use the CPU , the scheduler ( interrupt controller ) makes it so .
The latency in response time for the highest - priority ready task is thus minimized to the context switch time .
( For a more thorough introduction to preemption read : http://www.netrino.com/Publications/Glossary/Preemption.html)
By contrast , there are at least ten negative implications of preemption , as indicated in Figure 1 below .
Figure 1 - Ten Negative Implications of Preemption
The figure shows how these implications ripple out of the " Preemption " node .
As we talk about what these implications are , you 'll see that these are the very problems we encounter Let 's start our analysis with the simple stuff .
For example , the three yellow bubbles immediately surrounding the Preemption bubble are Schedulable Bound , Multiple Stacks , and Context Switches .
Yellow is meant to indicate that , though these are serious issues , they are more annoyances than the Orange - colored system failures .
The Schedulable Bound implication refers to the fact that to gain the maximum benefit from RMA , the user must be willing to give up use of up to 31 % of CPU cycles .
That is , the CPU - intensive work to meet all the deadlines for all N tasks in your system is limited to 69 % ( ln over and over in embedded software design .
They result from fitting our square peg ( a certain set of requirements that are generally soft real - time at worst ) into a round hole ( a solution meant for a specific set of requirements associated with hard real - time ) .
The Schedulable Bound implication refers to the fact that to gain the maximum benefit from RMA , the user must be willing to give up use of up to 31 % of CPU cycles .
That is , the CPU - intensive work to meet all the deadlines for all N tasks in your system is limited to 69 % ( ln 2 , to be precise ) CPU utilization .
Put another way , you 'll need to pay for about 45 % ( 31/69 ) more CPU cycles than you 'll actually use .
The Multiple Stacks implication goes like this :
If your system will have ten tasks and preemption is present , then all ten of those tasks needs to have its own private stack space .
Because stack space must be allocated on a worst - case - ever - needed basis , this requires the use of up to 10 times the amount of RAM that would be required to complete the same set of work in the absence of preemption .
And unless you have also a distinct " interrupt stack " for processing worst - cast ISR nesting , each of the ten task stacks must be that much larger .
The third immediate resource wastage implication of preemption is the need to perform a " Context Switch " each time preemption occurs .
The process of performing a context switch varies by processor , as some CPUs are set up to handle this rather efficiently .
In the typical case , however , the CPU must effectively push the contents of all its registers and flags into RAM , then pop the same type of information for the next task from another RAM storage area .
This wastes CPU cycles in addition to those already out of reach because of RMA 's schedulable bound .
A fourth and more dangerous preemption implication is the ubiquitous Race Condition .
In real systems , tasks do not execute in isolation from each other .
Real tasks need to share data to get work done .
In a system that lacks preemption , there is no risk of tasks corrupting data in the process of sharing it .
A good analogy here is of two co-workers who share the same job and office , but work on alternating days .
Though Worker A and Worker B each operate on the same files , there is no chance for the files themselves to be corrupted in the process .
A pair of tasks running in a preemptive RTOS and manipulating the same areas of RAM or hardware registers , though , will create numerous opportunities each second for data corruption .
There are at least three second - order implications of race conditions : Interrupt Latency , Reentrant Libraries , and Mutexes .
Interrupt Latency increases in preemptive systems as a result of the potential for race conditions .
The issue here is that there are potential race conditions within the OS itself .
For example , in order to select the highest - priority task to run , the scheduler must keep an internal linked list or other data structure with information about each task that wants to use the CPU .
To prevent these internal data structures from being corrupted by interrupts that result in system calls , interrupts must be disabled during every critical section of OS code that touches these data structures .
Interrupt latency for the system as a whole increases by the worst - case length of an OS critical section .
In a nutshell , systems with an RTOS respond more rapidly to software tasks but more slowly to hardware interrupts .
Since the application code in several tasks may call the same shared library routines , such as a driver for a UART , it is possible the task preemption will take place inside one of those shared functions .
To prevent race conditions from occurring in the shared library routines , that code must have its critical sections identified and protected .
That means that every shared library routine must be made reentrant , meaning both longer ( more code space ) and slower to run .
Finally , as a workaround for race conditions in the tasks and shared library routines ( which cannot safely disable interrupts ) , a new OS primitive is required : the mutex ( a.k.a. , binary semaphore ) .
Mutexes provide a rather nifty way of protecting shared data from race conditions .
To use them , programmers first identify shared data and the critical sections of code in each task that uses that data ; next they create and associate a mutex object with that shared data ; finally , they surround each critical section with calls to " take " and " release " the mutex .
The only problem with mutexes is that you should n't actually use them in practice .
( Despite what you learned in Operating Systems class , the right way to share data between tasks is to use mailboxes to send data from one task to another for the next stage of processing in an always - safe manner .
You should always keep redesigning your task interactions until you do n't need a single mutex to get the job done . )
Mutexes do solve the race condition problem quite nicely .
However , mutexes are fraught with negative implications of their own : Starvation , Deadlock , and Priority Inversion - all of which are ultimately associated with difficult - to - diagnose product lockup and failures in the field .
Put simply , Starvation is the death of one task .
The affected task withers on the vine unable to make progress because it never is able to obtain a needed mutex .
The trouble here is the whole priority - based scheduling paradigm .
A second - tier task may never be selected to run if some higher priority task is always using the processor .
It 's called starvation if this condition exists for any length of time that prevents proper operation of the affected task .
Deadlock involves two or more tasks and is also known as a " deadly embrace " .
Any text about operating systems will tell you more about deadlocks .
Suffice it to say that the problem here is circular blocking ;
Task A has a mutex Task B is waiting for , and vice versa .
Neither task will ever be able to progress and those tasks can only be restarted via system reboot .
Finally , there is the implication of Priority Inversion .
Priority inversion is more subtle than starvation or deadlock .
In short , a medium - priority task prevents a high - priority task from using the CPU by preempting a low - priority task that holds the mutex needed by high .
This is a system failure because it violates the basic assumption of priority - based preemptive scheduling :
The highest priority ready task is NOT using the CPU for the length of the inversion — the length of which may even be unbounded because of potential starvation of the low - priority task .
( For more details on Priority Inversion including a helpful diagram , check out : http://www.netrino.com/Publications/Glossary/PriorityInversion.html).
Several workarounds to priority inversion exist , but they always result in wastage .
For example , under the Priority Ceiling Protocol each shared resources has a priority at least as high as the highest - priority task that ever uses it .
Unfortunately , this popular workaround results in another violation of the basic assumption of priority - based preemptive scheduling : A medium priority task may NOT use the CPU because a low - priority task is running and using a resource sometimes used by a high - priority task .
Conclusions
Many embedded developers vastly underestimate the true costs and skills needed to program with a preemptive RTOS .
The truth is that all traditional RTOS mechanisms for managing concurrency such as semaphores , mutexes , monitors , critical sections , condition variables , event flags , and others are tricky to use and often lead to subtle bugs that are notoriously hard to reproduce , isolate , and fix .
There are several useful alternatives to priority - based preemptive scheduling , ranging from infinite loop cyclic executives to run-to - completion processing kernels .
The " killer app " for the existing crop of RTOSes is a set of tasks that are each similar or identical to their brethren and running without interaction among tasks .
In this type of design , the preemptive scheduler serves the function of load balancer .
Examples of such applications are an embedded Web ( HTTP ) server or any telecom / datacom switch with multiple channels .
Many other types of applications are poorly served by priority - based preemptive scheduling .
Trying to fit the square peg problems into the round hole of a commercial RTOS leads to frustration , bugs , and overly - complicated designs .
So next time you 're trying to figure out why your system just locked up unexpectedly in the lab or in the field , spend some time thinking about why you chose an RTOS .
If you are n't in need of the one positive thing from priority - based preemptive scheduling , why are you paying the price ten - fold !

Nadia Eweida refuses to wear her cross under her uniform
Mr Straw was asked by Labour MP Ian Austin whether there could be a debate on the treatment of Nadia Eweida , who lost an appeal against the ban .
Other items of religious significance , such as turbans or hijabs which cannot be hidden , can be worn under BA policy .
Mr Straw said it was inexplicable that crosses were not included .
Mr Austin said more than 100 MPs had signed parliamentary motions asking BA to re-think the ban , and constituents and the Church of England were also upset by it .
I have a great admiration for British Airways as an airline , but I find their position on this quite inexplicable
Jack Straw
Leader of the House of Commons
Mr Straw , in the Commons on Thursday , said : " I speak personally on this - and the government does n't have a particular government position - I share his concerns about this .
" I have a great admiration for British Airways as an airline , but I find their position on this quite inexplicable . "
He added : " I have strongly supported the right of Sikhs to wear turbans both in private companies and the police service and the Army , [ and ]
I have strongly supported the right of women of the Muslim faith to wear the hijab ... in all circumstances .
" I therefore find the ban on wearing a cross or indeed a Star of David in equivalent circumstances wholly inexplicable . "
Appeal
Nadia Eweida , 55 , of Twickenham , London , has been on unpaid leave from Heathrow since her bosses said she could not wear her cross over her uniform at the check - in counter .
She lost her appeal against BA 's decision , but has the opportunity for a second appeal .
BA said last week : " The policy does not ban staff from wearing a cross .
It lays down that personal items of jewellery , including crosses may be worn - but underneath the uniform .
Other airlines have the same policy . "
I ’m somewhat of an expert on anger .
I think I ’ve had good teachers , which is to say , I ’ve worked for some very bad managers who were absolute masters in the art of infuriating their employees .
I ’ve decided to distill all the worst anger - instilling behaviour I ’ve witnessed over the years into a top ten list – the things that absolutely guarantee an angry workforce .
This is not intended as a how - to guide for wannabe satanic managers .
I did briefly consider that this might be akin to distributing a bomb - making recipe ( very dangerous information in the wrong hands ) but I actually believe most bad managers are n’t deliberately bad .
They are far more likely to be ignorant of how destructive their actions are .
As Hanlon ’s Razor states : “ Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . ”
So please , anyone in doubt , this is top 10 list of things NOT to do .
So here are my top 10 tips for guaranteeing an angry workforce :
1 . Do n’t communicate –
That ’s right , do n’t tell ’em anything .
Why do they need to know ?
They ’re not the all - powerful manager – you are .
Here ’s a tip : if you are n’t communicating , your staff are filling in the gaps themselves .
And they rarely put the most positive spin on things .
Case in point : in one job the IT manager went on a trip to the branch office in India without telling anyone what he was doing .
As a joke , I said he was going to outsource the whole department .
Everyone believed me .
I assured everyone it was a joke and I had no reason to think we were being outsourced and everyone calmed down .
Then he came back and still did n’t tell anyone the purpose of the trip or what he did while he was there .
Then I started to think he really was outsourcing us .
2. Encourage a culture of blame –
Things go wrong from time to time , that ’s unavoidable .
But if you spend more energy fixing the blame than you do fixing the problem people will know not to make mistakes again .
Actually if you make people think your first reaction to discovering a problem is to look for someone to blame , they ’ll stop coming to you with problems .
And then you ’ll never find out about problems until things are totally and irretrievably screwed .
3 . Do n’t recognise achievements – if you congratulate people for doing a good job they ’ll expect pay raises and that will ruin your budget .
Actually , recognising achievements can create more positive feelings in a workplace than money but still , they ’ll get all uppity if you congratulate them for a job well done .
4 . Impose arbitrary rules – There ’s no end to how far you can take this one .
The rule can be no talking to co-workers , limits on software , hardware and / or peripherals available or even no drinking coffee at the desk .
The important thing is not to waver from arbitrary rules no matter how logical the counter - argument made by employees .
Change one rule and they ’ll think they can change any rule they can build a compelling case for .
5 . Play favourites – Some people are just more likeable than others .
Everyone tells you to treat staff equally but how will your favourites know you like them more unless you give them preferential treatment ?
And besides , what ’s the worst that could happen ?
The rest of the staff get resentful ?
You do n’t like them anyway , maybe they ’ll stay the hell away from you .
6 . Be inconsistent – Even arbitrary rules can be made worse by enforcing them inconsistently .
If staff do n’t know how you ’re going to react to a given situation , they ’ll never relax .
And relaxed staff are unproductive staff .
Probably .
Best not to take the risk .
7 . Be secretive – This is not exactly the same as not communicating .
Being secretive is making it obvious that something is happening but not telling staff exactly what .
It ’s even better if you tell them there ’s a big secret that you ca n’t tell them the details .
Combine this with playing favourites for extra effect – make it obvious you ’ve told your personal pet but forbid them from telling anyone else .
8 . Be unresponsive – Do n’t respond to email .
Stare in the general direction of your staff with a peeved expression but do n’t say anything .
Respond to any questions or ( god forbid ) small talk from staff with a grunt .
Agree to meeting requests then do n’t show up .
This will let staff know exactly where they stand and exactly how powerful you are .
9 . Refuse to listen –
When staff come to you with important issues , brush them off .
If you listen once they ’ll expect you to listen all the time .
How they think their concerns can have any effect on managing the department is anybody ’s guess .
They ’re probably just complaining that they think your favourite never does any work .
And you would n’t play favourites with anyone who ’d exploit that favoured position , would you ?
10 . Refuse to change – Sometimes staff will go to the trouble of presenting a case for changing your way of doing things .
Sometimes that case will seem compelling .
Sometimes you will be tempted to think about changing because it seems like the best thing to do .
Banish that thought from your head !
Are these schmucks managers ?
How could a non-manager possibly be smarter than a manager ?
Make sure to mark them down in their next annual review .
These are not the only ways to make staff angry but they are methods I ’ve seen successfully employed many times over the years .
Sometimes very successfully .
So successfully that sometimes I formed the obviously mistaken impression that the manager concerned was a deranged psychopath .
It ’s a consistent disappointment to me that all the best staff quit when faced with managers like this .
Where do they get off making logical choices to protect their own well - being ?
And how do quality staff always manage to find another workplace where they are n’t subjected to such negative behaviour ?
Do n’t people like a challenge any more ?
THE COURAGE OF THEIR CONVICTIONS ….
Taegan Goddard reprints the following from the Evans - Novak Political Report :
Important Bush Administration officials are ready to leave the government rather than undergo two years of hell from Democratic committee chairmen in Congress .
Leading the exodus are officials of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , fearing investigation by two chairmen , Representatives Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) and John Dingell ( D - MI ) .
Golly .
I wonder what they ’re so afraid of ?
Netscape may be known now for losing the so - called browser war to Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
But Netscape.com , the default home page for users of the fading browser , continues to have its following — so much so that when its owner , AOL , tried to update it last month , it received some surprisingly angry feedback .
AOL , part of Time Warner , formally introduced a redesigned version of Netscape.com on June 29 , after offering a preview version for two weeks .
The new site , modeled after Digg.com , was a news site where users essentially help editors create the home page by submitting and voting on the articles and other links posted there .
The new format seemed aimed at attracting and engaging visitors in the increasingly interactive style of “ social news , ” or blog aggregator Web sites .
But instead of embracing the new format , some of the site ’s longtime fans used those interactive features to vehemently protest the change .
One dismayed user posted an item titled “ Netscape ’s blunder !!! ” on Netscape.com a few hours after the redesigned site was online .
It elicited more than 300 comments , including pleas to “ please bring the old Netscape.com back . ”
Follow these 17 guideline s to kill the logic of any sentence .
Start with this familiar example :
Jack and Jill climbed up the hill to fetch a pail of water .
Use weak verbs :
Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a pail of water .
Use unfamiliar words :
Jack and Jill climbed up the hill to fetch a ewer of water .
Put introductory phrases at the beginning to push the subject back :
To fetch a pail of water , Jack and Jill climbed up the hill .
Keep the subject and the verb as far apart as possible :
Jack and Jill , to fetch a pail of water , climbed up the hill .
Put the action at the end of the sentence :
Jack and Jill , to fetch a pail of water , climbed up the hill .
Keep modifiers as far as possible from the words they modify :
Jack and Jill climbed to fetch a pail of water up the hill .
Use passive voice :
The hill was climbed by Jack and Jill so that a pail of water could be fetched .
Put the doer at the end of the sentence :
To fetch a pail of water , the hill was climbed by Jack and Jill .
Introduce false subjects :
It was Jack and Jill that climbed up the hill to fetch a pail of water .
Pile on the gobbledygook :
Jack and Jill ascended the acclivity to retrieve a vessel of Adam 's ale .
Turn verbs into nouns :
Jack and Jill did the hill climb for the purpose of water retrieval .
Use unnecessary technical jargon :
Jack and Jill traversed the gradient to fetch an alembic of H2O .
Feature inappropriate precision :
John Q. Wembley and Jillian Fitzgerald climbed 1.6093 kilometers to fetch 3.785 liters of water .
Add wordy phrases :
Jack in the company of Jill climbed their way up the hill for the purpose of fetching water in the approximate amount of a pail 's full .
Multiply redundant words :
Both Jack and Jill climbed all the way up to the top of the hill 's summit to fetch a pail filled to its capacity with water .
Throw in clichés indiscriminately :
Jack and Jill , who need no introduction , climbed up the hill by leaps and bounds to fetch through their good offices a pail of water by hook or by crook String lots of nouns together to form the subject :
The Jack and Jill water retrieval hill climb was achieved .
Put all 17 together :
It was the Jack and Jill H2O retrieval in an alembic vessel that was achieved via the ascent of the acclivity up to its summit in leaps and bounds through the good offices of John Q. Wembley and Jillian Fitzgerald who need no introduction .
Email from Crassius of the Great Jazz Hall
The remains of what has been described as a huge lost city may force historians and archaeologists to radically reconsider their view of ancient human history .
Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres ( 120 feet ) underwater in the Gulf of Cambay off the western coast of India could be over 9,000 years old .
The vast city - which is five miles long and two miles wide - is believed to predate the oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years .
The site was discovered by chance last year by oceanographers from India 's National Institute of Ocean Technology conducting a survey of pollution .
Using sidescan sonar - which sends a beam of sound waves down to the bottom of the ocean they identified huge geometrical structures at a depth of 120 ft .
Debris recovered from the site - including construction material , pottery , sections of walls , beads , sculpture and human bones and teeth has been carbon dated and found to be nearly 9,500 years old .
Lost civilisation
The city is believed to be even older than the ancient Harappan civilisation , which dates back around 4,000 years .
Marine archaeologists have used a technique known as sub - bottom profiling to show that the buildings remains stand on enormous foundations .
The whole model of the origins of civilisation will have to be remade from scratch
Graham Hancock
Author and film - maker Graham Hancock - who has written extensively on the uncovering of ancient civilisations - told BBC News Online that the evidence was compelling : " The [ oceanographers ] found that they were dealing with two large blocks of apparently man made structures .
" Cities on this scale are not known in the archaeological record until roughly 4,500 years ago when the first big cities begin to appear in Mesopotamia .
" Nothing else on the scale of the underwater cities of Cambay is known .
The first cities of the historical period are as far away from these cities as we are today from the pyramids of Egypt , " he said .
Chronological problem
This , Mr Hancock told BBC News Online , could have massive repercussions for our view of the ancient world .

No SMS sending Symbian bluetooth viruses sighted Posted by Jarno @ 15:49 GMT
Today we have received several questions concerning a new Symbian worm that spreads via Bluetooth and sends premium rate SMS messages .
We were puzzled about those questions however , as we have n't seen any such malware .
And obviously we have not made any warnings of such , otherwise you would have seen it on our weblog .
So to clarify things , there are only two known malwares that send SMS messages : Java / Redbrowser .
A and SymbOS / Mquito.A .
Both of these malwares are trojans , which means that they do n't spread by themselves and need users to download and install them before they can do anything .
Redbrowser .
A is a trojan that sends SMS messages to a Russian premium rate number and does not use the country code .
That means that the premium rate number works only in Russia .
And since the user interface of Redbrowser is in Russian , it is not a problem anywhere else other than Russian speaking countries .
Mquito .
A is a cracked version of the game Mosquitos that sends SMS to a UK based premium rate number .
But the premium rate number has been discontinued , and thus causes only the cost of a normal SMS .
Other than these two trojans , we do n't know of any other case of malware on any platform that would send SMS messages .
And most certainly we have not seen a bluetooth worm that would do so .
Edited to add : This blog entry was rewritten on Friday the 28th .
The original version referred to an article on VNUNet and made it sound like a journalist at VNU would have gotten details wrong in an article - when in reality our country manager had provided incorrect information .
Sorry for the hassle .
New Century in Mobile Malware Posted by JP @ 12:42 GMT
In less than half a year our tally of mobile malware has doubled to 200 .
Many of those in that count are variants of already detected viruses , but the speed at which the number grows has real implications for all those with unprotected smartphones .
At the least , this is a testing ground .
What comes next ?
FlexiSpy demonstrates well that your privacy can be violated .
RedBrowser is a good example of social engineering being implemented .
The techniques that work with PC malware are being tested on the mobile side .
Text - Payment and Mobile Wallet services are now being introduced by Mobile Service Operators - and where there 's money , there 's motive .
Growth of these services could easily augment malware 's attention to mobile platforms .
Operators and device vendors need to continue to factor this into their business strategy and design .

Sometimes Those Error Messages Actually Mean Something Posted by Mika @ 12:19 GMT
Sometimes a support issue can lead to the detection of malware .
As an example , this case of a blue screen error points to a rootkit as its cause .
Removing spyware from a computer is becoming an increasingly difficult task .
Look2Me , a displayer of pop-up advertisements , is a good example of a persistent malware application that just wo n't go away .
It uses some interesting techniques to remain installed .
Look2Me hooks into the winlogon process as a notification package .
If the user tries to unregister the notification package , it is immediately reinstated .
Look2Me also removes the administrator group 's debug privileges and thereby disables the user from interfering .
This , along with some other tricks , makes manual removal close to impossible .
The removal of the debug privileges has resulted in some BlackLight support calls for us .
And so , even though it does n't have any rootkit functions , the SeDebugPrivilege error inadvertently turns our BlackLight tool into a Look2Me detector !
One of our researchers has spent a good deal of time fighting with Look2Me and the result is a removal tool that can be downloaded from here .
Greetings from RSA Japan Posted by Mikko @ 07:15 GMT
Greetings from the RSA Japan conference in Tokyo !
There are about 6000 delegates in this Asian version of the RSA security happening .
I snapped the photo above with a Nokia 3250 .
This is a new phone running Symbian 9.1 ( S60 3rd edition ) with a pretty impressive camera .
Just look at this full - resolution image .
I 'll be speaking later today about mobile malware and specifically about the situation in Japan .
The Japanese phone systems are way ahead of the ones in Europe or in the USA .
They are also ahead in security : we do n't get infection reports from Japan at all .
There are several reasons , but this is largely because of the operating systems in use here .
Almost all of the currently known mobile malware targets Symbian Series 60 phones .
Most smartphones in Japan are running Linux , iTron or Symbian - but not Symbian Series 60 .
Additionally , local operators are heavily restricting on who can write native code for their phones .
End result : so far Japanese phones have been quite well protected against mobile virus problems .
I 'd be interested to know if they got my name right above .
I 'm afraid I 'll just have to take their word for it ...
Signing off ,

First virus for Matlab Posted by Mikko @ 07:09 GMT
We 've today received a sample of something that seems to be the first virus for Matlab m-files .
We are calling it MLS / Lagob .A .
Matlab ( made by Mathworks ) is a high - level programming language for mathematical problem - solving .
Matlab source files are known as " m- files " .
The virus ( known as " Bagoly " ) is not in the wild .
It infects m- files parasitically by prepending it's own replication code to the beginning of other m- files it finds .
It does n't do anything else in addition to spreading .

Patching an OS is n't new , but patching an OS to enable a virus ?
That might be .

Fixing the bug enables the virus to work as it should .
Though Torvalds does n't seem to think that Virus .

Image stealing by phishers Posted by Mikko @ 09:51 GMT
Lazy phishers are often simply making a copy of the original bank site with some malicious modifications .
As an example , take a look at this currently active phishing site targeting Chase Bank .
This phishing site is running on an infected home computer in Spain .
Only the html is hosted there ; all the images are actually loaded directly from a real chase.com server .
Now , activity like this could be detected by the website of the bank automatically .
How about modifying the logic of the bank web server to do something along these lines :
If somebody
a ) loads my images but
b ) does not load the corresponding html file and
c ) has http referrer - values outside of my domain
then , for this user , lets change this image :
to this image :
This could be activated only after the activity has happened from , say , 10 different IP addresses , to make it harder for the attackers to spot it until it 's too late .
And , in most cases the REFERRER fields would directly point the bank staff to the real phishing site which they could now start closing down .
Eventually , attackers would move to host their own images , but for now they still typically do n't .
This site needs to be shut down Posted by Mikko @ 09:28 GMT
There 's another Bagle - related run going on .
One of the download URLs that infected machines are polling for new content became active a couple of hours ago .
This is one of those new nasty download links that provide a new , uniquely repacked version of the malware every 50 seconds or so .
This download link resides on a website belonging to some sort of real estate agency in Slovakia : www.bbrealservis.sk.
We 've been trying to get the download link on this site inactivated but so far nothing has happened .
Easter holidays are n't exactly helping here either .
Bottom line : if you 're a sysadmin , block access to any URL under www.bbrealservis.sk for now .
If you have contacts to this Slovakian company or their upstream provider ( Active 24 ) , have them take action as soon as possible or have them contact us .
Thanks .
Edited to add : We now detect all the modified versions of the downloaded file as SpamTool .
Win32.Bagle.g.
Edited to add :
The download link is now down ( the site itself works fine but the malware has been removed ) .
Thanks Palo !
Edited to add : Ten hours later , they are now repeating the same operation from a URL under www.benininfo.com.
Abuse messages have been sent .
Edited to add [ on Tuesday the 18th ] : After several attempts , the benininfo.com site has finally been shut down by the ISP .
Edited to add [ on Tuesday the 18th ] :
And now they 've moved to www.bestcheapdomainregistration.info.
Feel free to block access to this site at your gateways .
Edited to add [ on Friday the 21st ] :
Three days later , www.bestcheapdomainregistration.info is shut down by their ISP .
We have n't seen a replacement domain pop up yet .
Edited to add [ on Sunday the 23rd ] :
Now the replacement appeared .

Forget about Windows update Posted by Mikko @ 12:43 GMT
Two days ago , we recommended that you get the latest Microsoft patches and to visit www.windowsupdate.com.
But nowadays it really makes more sense to recommend Microsoft Update instead of Windows Update .
Microsoft Update does everything Windows Update does plus , in addition to patching the operating system , it also patches other common Microsoft software .
This includes patching software like Word , Excel , SQL Server etc .
In fact , many people probably thought Windows Update did this already !
Patching
Word is quite important - we 're regularly seeing targeted attacks made by e-mailing booby - trapped DOC files to companies .
Word is n't often patched as well as Windows itself is , and DOCs go through gateway filters much more easily than EXEs do .
The URL for Microsoft Update is - get this : http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/
Makes you wonder why they are n't using www.microsoftupdate.com for this - they do own the domain .
Edited to add : Turns out not all versions of Microsoft Office are supported by Microsoft Update .
If you are running Office 2000 , you still need to visit Office Update .

Design Flaw in Human Brain Prevents Detection of Phishing Websites Posted by Sean @ 07:59 GMT
" Why Phishing Works " is a recent study ( PDF ) that examines phishing website techniques .
The most visually deceptive website spoof in the study was able to fool 90 % of the study 's participants .
That 90 % figure includes the most technically advanced users among the participants .
It was the look , not the spoofing of security features that did the job - something that our resident phishing expert found quite interesting .
Crossing disciplines and summing up this article published last summer in the journal Neuron -
If you do n't see something often , you wo n't often see it .
Perhaps you could also say -
If you do n't see fakes often , you wo n't often see fakes .
Therefore , many phishers while designing visually deceptive phishing sites count less on technical subterfuge than on the failings of the human brain 's power of perception .
If it looks like what the brain is expecting , then the brain often wo n't see that it is n't .
Why do n't banks allow you to customize your online banking interface with a picture of your preference ?
Like your own mugshot ?
Your pet ?
Your girlfriend ?
The logo of your favorite team ?
Your country 's entry to the Eurovision song contest ?
Something that would relate to you - something that you 'd miss if it were n't there .
There are companies that are working on visual personalization technology ; we think it 's a good idea that could help to reduce the size of the phishing net .

Exhibit 5 - A Better Internet ?
Posted by Stefan @ 14:20 GMT
In case we did n't already know - people do n't like Spyware .
Well , they really do n't like Spyware .
The New York Attorney General 's office has brought suit for illegal practices against Direct Revenue and the exhibits make for interesting reading .
Ben Edelman has a copy of the case documents here .
Exhibit 5 has more than a few examples of the hate mail that Direct Revenue received .
This is one of the less vulgar :
Direct Revenue , makers of VX2 , ABetterInternet , and BestOffers , is a company that is known for its use of less than honest affiliates .
Those affiliates have the very bad habit of installing software without user consent .
Due to the method of installation , even the uninstaller offered by Direct Revenue did n't always work - evidenced by the table in the exhibit .
Direct Revenue has gone from shady to less shady over the years , but perhaps not quickly enough to avoid the eye of Attorney General Spitzer .

Nordea Phishing is Back Posted by Katrin @ 13:42 GMT
We blogged about Nordea phishing cases in October and December of last year .
Today we have reports of a new phishing case targeting Nordea 's online banking .
As before , this kind of phishing is an attempt to steal the customer 's one - time passwords .
Here is an example of one of the phishing e-mails :
The link in the e-mail is obfuscated , it does n't lead to where it points , instead it opens another web page where the victim is supposed to fill in their unused passwords and all of the confirmation codes for Nordea 's online banking .
The new phishing attempt is very much similar to the previous two .
What 's new is the e-mail 's content , the link is obfuscated , and it collects the e-mail address of those who click the link .
Moomin Anti-Virus is for Real Posted by Sean @ 13:36 GMT
For some reason , a surprising number of people thought that our new cartoon - themed security product was an April Fool 's Day joke .
Well , we suppose that 's what you get when you announce something this groundbreaking on the 1st of April !
But the Moomin - themed product is very real and it will soon hit the shops .
It 's already for sale in Japan - and there 's good reason for that .
The worldwide popularity and merchandising of the Moomin family dramatically increased in the 1990's when a Japanese production studio animated the stories , making them massively popular there .
We can also recommend Tove Jansson 's Moomin books , which are available in English at many major online retailers .

F - Secure Internet Security & the Moomins !
Posted by Mikko @ 14:25 GMT
Good morning .
Today , on the 1st of April , we have announced the release of Moomin - character themed F - Secure Internet Security product .
Moomins are a popular series of cartoon characters , created in the 1940s by Tove Jansson .
And now they have their own computer security product .
The user interface of the Moomin - themed F - Secure Internet Security looks really cool , check this out :
The product will be available ( in Japanese and English ) from our online store in two weeks time or so .
For more information , see our Japanese site or the press release .
A number of people have commented on my invitation to OpenSuSE developers to join Ubuntu Open Week , some have expressed dismay that I would risk creating discord in the free software universe by inviting developers to leave one project and join another .
There have also been plenty of reasonable comments and suggestions , and I hope the net effect is to leave both communities better informed about the efforts of the other .
I think it may be worth having public “ town hall meeting ” in the usual Ubuntu style to discuss the invitation and make sure everyone has a fair chance to air their views .
Feel free to continue to comment on this blog – I do the spam - moderation thing about once a week usually , will try to get to it more this week .
Till then , let me say the following :
No offense was intended to SuSE – it ’s a great distribution .
This is about Novell ’s extraordinary decision to legitimise Microsoft ’s IP claims over Linux in general .
I have serious concerns about the Novell - Microsoft deal – and so do other people who make huge contributions to the body of free software .
Novell and SuSE are of course deeply linked , and so the actions of one do have consequences for the other .
I would expect the same sort of consequences in Ubuntu if Canonical made poor decision .
In the past two weeks I ’ve fielded many mails from SuSE developers in regard to this , so I believe it was reasonable to point out the timely Ubuntu Open Week .
I very much hope all of this helps to bring home to Novell executives the folly of their course , and results in the termination of the patent - related aspects of the deal .
Collaboration between SuSE and Ubuntu is welcome , and I would support efforts to make that collaboration happen in practice .
Most free software developers want to see the whole free universe succeed , not just one or other distribution , and collaboration is a good step towards that goal .
Ubuntu is not free of controversy , and neither is Debian .
I was not suggesting that Ubuntu or Debian are somehow perfect – only that we would have nothing to do with Ballmer ’s offer and are deeply conscious of the impact of this sort of deal on the long term future of free software .
Apologies to anybody who was offended by my extension of the invitation to OpenSuSE developers , it was certainly not my intent to upset you .
Thanks to cool heads on both sides who have kept the discussion focused on our shared goals of improving the quality of free software and ensuring that it continues to be widely and freely available .

Apparently the electronic voting machines are not working in many parts of Montgomery County .
I know definitely that Sligo Creek Elementary School and East Silver Spring Elementary School machines were down this morning .
At Sligo Creek they were n't even offering provisional balloting until precinct chair Mitch Warren insisted .
At East Silver Spring , they are offering provisional ballots but only allowing 1 person to vote at a time , which means people are leaving because the line is too long ; some people were told to go home at both locations .
At Sligo Creek machines did come up just before 8 AM , not sure about East Silver Spring .
Lawyers for the Democratic Central Committee as well as the Washington Post have been notified .
This is Robert Lanza 's [ a local paper ballot activist from TrueVoteMD ] nightmare coming true ...
- Lane , Silver Spring
My wife and I arrived at our voting place at Temple Emanuel in Kensington at 7:30 , only to be told that the " cards " for the machines had n't been delivered yet .
Somehow Election
Day snuck up on the people who are supposed to be in charge ?
We left without voting , as did many others .
We hope that matters will be fixed by this evening , although this latest snafu should make for some very long lines .
Oy. Welcome to Florida / Ohio/ Iraq .
- Martin , Kensington
And I heard of another story in Silver Spring where a woman was signed in but could not get a provisional ballot completed before she had to leave for work .
Because she already signed in she will likely not be allowed to vote this evening and be yet another disenfranchised voter .
I 'm not sure how primary day is going acroos the state but here in MC things are totally FUBARed .
So much for technology when organization is lacking .........
And on top of it all .... turnout has been TERRIBLE thus far .
Call your family and friends and urge them to vote in this important primary .
In spite of the problems , most polls do have some machines working so far .
But this does not bode well for the General Election in 8 weeks .
UPDATE : Still having sporadic problems with the sign in terminals .
This is seperate from the Diebold voting machines .
These terminals are the new way for you to get signed in , as opposed to the old book and card system .
The problem is three terminals are available but only ONE has a printer .
A printout receipt is required for the sign in .
( Yet not for recording your votes !!!!)
So basically only one terminal at each voting place is functional .
This makes the sign in process slow if there are any number of people .
There has n't been any lines at my polling place because turnout is awful .
But I fear the evening rush will produce long lines .
There have been a few people who have left before voting when there have been incidents of terminal problems ... seems like they 've had to reboot or something a few times .
The reason for there being only one printer is the rest of the printers are on a ship somewhere and they did not arrive .
My question is why did n't they stick to the old method with the books and cards ????
The lack of printers I 've been told is a State Board of Elections Issue .
The missing voter access cards for the Diebold machines was a County Board of Elections Issue .
The whole thing is one big mess .
Thankfully some people are continuing onward and voting in spite of the issues .
Thanks for all the comments and recommends .... I 'm floored .
Will try to read through them all later .
Gotta get back to my poll so I can continue to record any more issues I hear about .
UPDATE 2 : Polls will be open until 9 pm. HOWEVER ..... the Diebold machines will be shutdown at 8 pm .
All ballots cast after 8 pm will be provisional ( paper ) ballots .
This is supposed to be in case anyone challenges the polls staying open late .
We 'll see what happens ......
Today ( 15/11 ) in the press conference by Bluetooth SIG celebrating numbers of Bluetooth devices exceed 1 Billion , MoGo shows a Bluetooth mouse which is as thin as 5 mm .
Yes , not typo , 5 mm , as thin as a PC Card .
You may then ask , How can i use it ?
Well , there is a stand in the mouse , you can open it when you want to use the mouse .
When you are not using the mouse , just close the stand and plug the mouse into the PC Card slot in your laptop .
It can then get charged in the PC Card slot .
It is really easy to carry , but may not be easy to use and it costs about US $ 60 .
One more pic after the break .

To dip briefly into the Botchgate fray , when Bush called for an apology from Kerry during a campaign stop in Georgia yesterday it marked the tenth time that the word “ apology ” has been used in official speeches or remarks by the President and VP in their nearly six years in office .
( “ Apologize ” shows up 24 times , mostly when the press apologize for interrupting , Bush for inconveniencing folks with his bike riding , etc. )
Bush has always ducked from apologizing or taking any onus where things go awry , in Iraq and elsewhere .
It ’s not like he has n’t been asked :
April 13 , 2004 – Question re 9/11 Intelligence :
Q Two weeks ago , a former counterterrorism official at the NSC , Richard Clarke , offered an unequivocal apology to the American people for failing them prior to 9/11 .
Do you believe the American people deserve a similar apology from you , and would you be prepared to give them one ?
THE PRESIDENT : Look , I can understand why people in my administration anguished over the fact that people lost their life .
I feel the same way .
I mean , I ’m sick when I think about the death that took place on that day .
And as I mentioned , I ’ve met with a lot of family members and I do the best I do to console them about the loss of their loved one .
As I mentioned , I oftentimes think about what I could have done differently .
I can assure the American people that had we had any inkling that this was going to happen , we would have done everything in our power to stop the attack .
Here ’s what I feel about that .
The person responsible for the attacks was Osama bin Laden .
That ’s who ’s responsible for killing Americans .
And that ’s why we will stay on the offense until we bring people to justice .
April 6 , 2006 – Response to a Question re NSA Wiretapping :
THE PRESIDENT : I ’d like to describe that decision I made about protecting this country .
You can come to whatever conclusion you want .
The conclusion is I ’m not going to apologize for what I did on the terrorist surveillance program , and I ’ll tell you why .
We were accused in Washington , D.C. of not connecting the dots , that we did n’t do everything we could to protect you or others from the attack .
And so I called in the people responsible for helping to protect the American people and the homeland .
I said , is there anything more we could do .
June 14 2006 – Question re Plamegate :
Q Mr. President , when you ran for office for the first time , you said you would hold the White House to a higher ethical standard .
Even if Karl Rove did nothing illegal , I wonder whether you can say now whether you approve of his conduct in the CIA leak episode , and do you believe he owes Scott McClellan or anyone else an apology for misleading them ?
THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate the job that the prosecutor did .
I thought he conducted himself well in this investigation .
He took a very thorough , long look at allegations and rumors .
And I , obviously , along with others in the White House , took a sigh of relief when he made the decision he made .
And now we ’re going to move forward .
And I trust Karl Rove , and he ’s an integral part of my team .
Katrina , Iraq , the list goes on .
No apologies .
Much of the Earth 's species diversity is concentrated into a few relatively small areas .
Twenty - five regions have been identified which together cover only 1.4 % of the Earth 's land surface but contain nearly half of all plant species and a third of all terrestrial vertebrate species .
All are under pressure from human activities .
BBC News
Online looks at range of biodiversity hotspots .
California Floristic Province
California 's extensive area and great diversity of habitats means it has a very large range of animal and plant species , which includes the world 's largest redwood trees .
The California Floristic Province covers 70 % of the state and spreads into Oregon and northern Mexico .
It is one of the few Mediterranean - type climates in the world and is home to populations of the California condor , the giant salamander and the mountain lion .
Over 2,000 of the plant species that grow in the province occur nowhere else in the world .
But urban and agricultural development is eating into the area , especially along the central and southern coasts of California .
At present , 9.7 % of the total land area of the California Floristic Province is protected .
It contains 12 threatened species and two endangered ones .
Central America
The forests of central America contain a wealth of species , including jaguar , sloths , morpho butterflies and 24,000 plant species .
Mexico is trying to protect monarch butterflies
Today , only about 20 % ( 231,000 sq km ) of the original forests remain in a relatively natural state - and those are under threat .
Some conservation efforts are under way , however .
The Mexican authorities are cracking down on illegal logging in the hope of protecting the millions of migrating butterflies .
Caucasus
The Caucasus hotspot covers an area of over 500,000 sq km between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea , and includes parts of Georgia , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Russia , Iran and Turkey .
It contains more than twice the animal diversity found in adjacent areas in Europe and Asia .
The conservation organisation WWF has named the Caucasus as a large herbivore hotspot .
Eleven species of large herbivore , as well as five species of large carnivore , are found over a relatively small area .
Conservation is problematic in the region because the hotspot straddles so many nations .
Polynesia and Micronesia
Polynesia and Micronesia represent over 1,000 islands scattered across 21.6 million sq km of the southern Pacific Ocean .
The region includes ecosystems ranging from lush forests to mangroves and savannahs .
High levels of species diversity exist because of the way species have evolved in isolation from each other on different islands .
But the isolated island habitats mean species are less resistant to introduced predators and other human pressures .
Human occupation in the last 200 years has seen 22 bird species become extinct .
Among the 88 threatened species are the Hawaiian crow , the Samoa flying fox and the Fijian ground frog .
Atlantic Forest , Brazil
The Atlantic Forest is less well known than the Amazon rainforest but it , too , is a hot - spot for biodiversity .
The forest makes up 13 % of Brazil 's territory and is the third largest major vegetation formation in the country after Amazonia and the Cerrado ( an area of woodland savannah in north - east Brazil ) .
Many of the species found there are unique .
Seventy - two of the 620 bird species are thought to be endemic ; 60 of 2,000 reptiles , 253 of 280 amphibians and 160 of 261 mammals .
There is great concern about the golden lion tamarin
Primates are particularly affected - they represent nine of the 10 critically endangered mammals found in the Atlantic Forest .
There is also great concern about the golden lion tamarin , whose numbers in the wild are estimated at around 500 .
East Africa
Much of East Africa 's biodiversity is concentrated in the Eastern Arc mountains and coastal forests of Tanzania and Kenya .
The Eastern Arc mountain chain is a series of heavily forested isolated peaks , where there are 1,500 plant species and 50 endemic reptiles .
Because of this density of species , the region is thought to be the hotspot in the world most likely to suffer the greatest plant and vertebrate extinction .
Agriculture and the encroachment of human development , along with logging , are the greatest threats to biodiversity in the region .
Several species of colobus monkey are endangered along with three species of sunbird .
Only about 2,000 sq km or 6.7 % of the original hotspot remains unspoiled .
Madagascar
Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands pack a great deal of biodiversity into a relatively small area .
Deforestation is putting many species under strain in Madagascar
The island has lost about 90 % of its original vegetation , placing many species in great danger .
Western Ghats , India
The Western Ghats are a mountain range that runs along the western coast of India .
The mountains cover an area of about 160,000 sq km stretching from the country 's southern tip to Gujarat in the north .
Of the 372 species of mammal found in India , 63 are in the Western Ghats .
Sixteen of these are endemic .
Faced with enormous population pressure , the lush mountains are at risk of a biodiversity crisis .
Important populations of Asian elephants , Indian tigers , and the endangered lion - tailed macaque are threatened as agriculture and logging intensify .
Indonesia
Indonesia has around 500 species of mammal , which is second only to Brazil .
Indonesia has around 500 species of mammals
Critically endangered animals include the Javan rhinoceros , the Sumatran orang - utan and the silvery gibbon , which is endemic to Indonesia .
Although Indonesia has been criticised for excessive logging , timber is a major source of revenue and supports millions of people .
South - west Australia
The native forests of south - west Australia retain only 10 % of their original 310,000 sq km of vegetation and yet they contain over 5,000 plant species and nearly 500 vertebrate species .
Despite early deforestation , the remaining forests are now well protected .
Amongst the unique creatures living in the area is the swamp turtle , which is thought to be the most threatened fresh water turtle in the world .
The hotspot is also home to the honey - possum and the red- capped parrot .
U.S. eases limits on single - sex schools School districts across the nation this fall will have unprecedented freedom to open up all - girls ' or all - boys ' schools and classes under sweeping new regulations announced on Tuesday by U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings .
The shift is the biggest in 31 years and for the first time allows schools to separate students by gender if they believe it helps — a standard that is under debate in the existing research .
Participation in such programs would be voluntary , but schools choosing to separate a class for one sex would n't have to provide an equivalent class for the other sex .
They 'd simply have to offer a " substantially equal " coed class in the same subject .
The rules , which take effect Nov. 24 , also clarify rules on creating entire single - sex public schools .
Since the current rules went into effect in 1975 , single - sex classes have been allowed only on a limited basis , such as in charter schools , sex education courses or gym classes involving contact sports .
The Bush administration , supported by both Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Democratic New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , has favored loosening the rules .
About 240 public schools offer same - sex coursework , up from just three in 1995 , says Leonard Sax of the National Association for Single Sex Public Education .
He thinks about 1 in 10 of the nation 's 90,000 public schools could decide to become single - sex .
Critics , such as the American Association of University Women and the American Civil Liberties Union , call the changes troublesome .
Emily Martin of the ACLU Women 's Rights Project said the new regulations " represent a through - the - looking - glass interpretation " of the federal Title IX law , which prohibits excluding students from school programs on the basis of sex .
She noted that schools could now " separate girls and boys for virtually any reason they can dream up — including outdated and dangerous gender stereotypes . "
Spellings said research shows that " some students may learn better " in single - sex environments , but other administration officials on Tuesday admitted that the best research offers only tepid support .
A 2005 analysis of current research , cited on the department 's website , noted that " any positive effects " of single - sex schooling on long - term academic achievement " are not readily apparent . "
The analysis found no differences on college test scores , graduation rates or graduate school attendance and bemoaned " the lack of high - quality research on these important criteria . "
And it found no research on how single - sex schooling affects critical factors such as teen pregnancy rates , differential treatment by teachers , parental satisfaction and school bullying .
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday , Stephanie Monroe , who heads the department 's civil rights office , minimized the research , saying that as a parent she 'd want all options available to her child .
" The department believes that this is an option that should be made available , " she said .

MORPHINE and its related family , the opiates , interact strongly with molecular receptors in specific areas of the brain .
Presumably the brain did n’t design a complex system such as this simply for the convenience of the products of poppy seeds .
So why does the interaction happen ?
It now appears that the opiates are mimicking the action of a chemical normally produced in the brain – an endogenous opiate .
This substance – which has been called enkephalin because of its origin in the brain – …
Jack Herrington emailed me , in reference to the issue of Ruby on Rails performance , to write :
I agree with you about unicode .
And I agree that Rails needs some time to evolve .
But I use a bunch of web technologies and they all have issues .
I do disagree with the scalability statements .
I do n’t think Rails has scaling issues that ca n’t be gotten around , and which do n’t have cousins in other technologies .
What I would ask is that you at least put some framing around your scalability comments .
Tell us about the scalability problems .
Even if we do n’t fix it for you , the entire community can gain from your experience .
David Heinemeier Hansson wrote :
Rails is for the vast majority of web applications Fast Enough .
We got sites doing millions of dynamic page views per day .
If you end up being with the Yahoo or Amazon front page , it ’s unlikely that an off - the - shelve framework in ANY language will do you much good .
You ’ll probably have to roll your own .
But sure , I ’d like free CPU cycles too .
I just happen to care much more about free developer cycles and am willing to trade the former for the latter .
By way of clarification , I ’m not concerned with Rails performance , I ’m concerned with Ruby performance , and here ’s why .
I ’ve seen lots of comparisons of Ruby ’s performance with bytecode languages like Java which I would consider slow , and I see a lot of reports of performance claiming Ruby is 10 x slower , 50 x slower , etc .
Besides the random blogobuzz , Ruby comes pretty darn close to dead last in the Computer Language Shootout Benchmarks .
Without knowing much about the implementation of Ruby , I would guess that the biggest issue is around late binding and especially duck typing , which prevents type inference or strong typing , which means that function calls will always be slow because you can never get something compiled down to the point where a function call is just a single CALL instruction ( on x86 ) … you always have to be exploring the object , possibly even scanning a hash table to find the function you want to call .
Calling methods on objects is really , really , really , really common , especially in pure OO languages , and that bit of the code needs to get down to at least a CALL indirect on the CPU for Ruby to offer the same performance as languages where the type of the object can be determined at compile time and therefore the instruction where you ’re jumping to can be gotten either at compile time ( like in C ) or with a single indirection through a single vtable ( like in C ++ ) .
I understand the philosophy that developer cycles are more important than cpu cycles , but frankly that ’s just a bumper - sticker slogan and not fair to the people who are complaining about performance .
Even though our product , FogBugz , seems like something that should be perfect for Ruby on Rails , we have several parts of code where performance is extremely important .
In FogBugz 6 there ’s one place where we need to do literally millions of calculations to display a single chart on a single web page .
We have gotten it down to 3 seconds or so in our current development environment with a lot of optimization , but frankly with a duck - typed function call I really do n’t think we could do it before the web browser gave up and timed out and the sun cooled down a couple of degrees .
We also have to scan incoming email messages for spam using Bayesian filtering .
This is compute - intensive can take 1 sec. per message .
Receiving one email per second is not unreasonable for many of our customers so we are very close to being CPU pegged .
That is using a language which we know to be orders of magnitude faster than Ruby at this type of code .
We would be absolutely dead on Ruby .
Even classic , simple CRUD applications — the kind of application that basically just shows you a table from a database and gives you operations to add , delete , and edit records — often discover somewhere down the line that there ’s something enormously computationally intensive that they want to do , for example , blog software might want to add Bayesian filtering to eliminate spam from comments .
This is where you suddenly realize that if your language of choice is 10 x slower than the competition , you may be simply unable to add that feature , or you may have to call out to another language ( with all the marshalling overhead that implies ) .
This does n’t apply to everyone , but when people say they have performance problems with Ruby or that they just need to be able to run code faster than the core Ruby language engine can run it , it does n’t help to have Ruby advocates singing hymns about developer cycles vs. CPU cycles .
Even if you are n’t doing compute - intensive things , if you find yourself needing to buy 100 servers instead of 10 servers , you may suddenly revisit the whole developer cycle vs. CPU cycle equation .
I understand that there are plans for Ruby to address performance with some kind of bytecode compiler and that will be nice .
When these things happen and when Ruby starts getting competitive benchmarks it will be a lot more appropriate for a lot more types of applications .
In the meantime I stand by my claim that it ’s not appropriate for every situation .

The rap : ,
by MC Hart
Did I hear you right , did I hear you sayin ’
That you ’re gonna make a copy of a game without payin’ ?
Come on , guys , I thought you knew better do n’t copy that floppy !
[ Do n’t do n’t do n’t do n’t … ]
( Wait a minute .
Who are you , anyway ?
Yeah .
And what are you doing on my computer ? )
I ’m your MC Double Def DP
That ’s the Disk Protector for you and the posse
That ’s your artists , writers , designers and pro-grammers
They pump up the images for games and gramma ’s that lets you learn , but also play
The games you came here for today
Now I know you love the game and that ’s alright to do
Because the posse who make them , they love them too
But if you start stealing , there ’s no more they can do
( But I just wanted to make one copy ! )
You say ‘ I ’ll just make a copy , for me and a friend ’
Then he ’ll make one and she ’ll make one and where will it end ?
One leads to another then ten , then more ,
And no one buys anything from the store
So no one gets paid and they ca n’t make more
The posse breaks up and they close the door
Do n’t copy !
Do n’t copy that floppy !
So let me break this down for you
D-D - Do-Do-Don’t
No Carmen Sandiego , no more Oregon Trail
Tetris and the others , they ’re all gonna fail
Not because we want it but because you ’re just takin’ it
Dis - res - pec - tin ’ all the folks who are ma - kin’ it
The more you take , the less there will be
The disks become fewer , the games fall away
The screen starts to tweak , and then it will fade
Programs fall through a black hole in space
The computer world becomes bleak and stark
Loses its life and the screen goes dark
[ Welcome to the end of the computer age … mwahahahaha .. ]
But I ’m much too strong and you ’re much too smart
To let that happen to your chances to explore
Parts of the new age just behind the door of your minds
You ’re the posse of the future and you hold in your brains what ’s never thought before
And in time , you ’ll see just so much more
That ’s why I ’m here and that ’s what I ’m fighting for
Do n’t copy !
Do n’t copy that floppy !
Now let me introduce you , to some of the teams
That will explain a little more about what I mean !
[ D - D - Do - Do - Do n ’t … Do n’t copy that floppy ! ]
You see , on these disks we have frozen in time
The creativity of someone ’s mind
Do you think , that because , with a flick of a key
You can copy that game , that the work is free
This creativity , we protect it by law
We value so highly , what the mind ’s eye saw
Do n’t copy !
Do n’t copy that floppy !
[ D - D - Do - Do - Do n ’t … Do n’t copy ..
Do n’t copy that floppy ! ]
To do the right thing , it ’s really simple for you
The copyright law , it will tell you what to do
Buy one , for every computer you use
Anything else is like going to the store
Taking the disk , and walking out the door
It ’s called thiefin ’ , stealin’ , taking what ’s not yours
Is that really where you want your life to go ?
Think about it , I do n’t think so .
Do n’t copy !
Do n’t copy that floppy !
Now you see a game you like and you really want to try it
Do n’t copy that floppy , just go to the store and buy it
Think of it this way , okay ?
When you ’re buy a disk , you ’re sayin ’ to the team
You respect what you do and what you ’re workin ’ for
We ’ll keep up our support so you can make up some more
We ’ll do the right thing and the future will be clear
There will be new programs here at the end
Do n’t copy !
Do n’t copy that floppy !
Now you know how the games and the programs are made
And what you do to make sure that they ’re not gonna fade
The bottom line is it ’s all up to you
There ’s nothing more that I can do
The goals in your court , dribble , shoot , or pass
I ’m sure you ’ll make your decision with class
[ Do n’t copy that floppy ]
See ya , I ’m outta here .
Iraq 's biggest province has suffered a total breakdown in law and order in which al - Qaida has emerged as the dominant political force , according to descriptions of a classified US military intelligence review reported today .
The report , by the US marine corps colonel Peter Devlin , focuses on the vast , arid region of Anbar in the west , which contains the insurgent - held towns of Fallujah , Ramadi and Haditha .
The Washington Post quoted military officers who had seen the report as saying the area was " beyond repair " .
" We have n't been defeated militarily , but we have been defeated politically - and that 's where wars are won and lost , " was one army officer 's summary of the review quoted by the newspaper .
The same officer concluded that there were no functioning Iraqi institutions in the province , and that al - Qaida in Iraq , the insurgent group founded by Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , was Anbar 's most powerful political force .
The report is believed to be the most negative one sent from the field in Iraq .
Mr Devlin has been stationed in Anbar since February and is regarded as one of the military 's most respected and level - headed intelligence officers , adding to concern in Washington about his comments .
" In the analytical world , there is a real pall of gloom descending , " the newspaper quoted the former defence analyst Jeffrey White as saying .
Four marines were killed in July in Anbar province , and nearly 22,000 marines are currently based in the region .
Democrats took control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate for the first time in a dozen years in the 2006 midterm elections , and President Bush and top Democrats quickly promised to get along despite a rancorous campaign . •
I - Report : What Democrats should do first
A ban on confectionery , crisps and fizzy drinks being provided in schools looks certain to begin in September following the publication of advice to ministers by the new School Food Trust yesterday .
The food industry has been lobbying to water down tough proposals on school food put out for consultation by the Department for Education and Skills last autumn .
But the trust , which was set up by the education secretary , Ruth Kelly , in the wake of chef Jamie Oliver 's acclaimed TV series on the subject , has ruled that new standards must apply to all food provided in schools including vending machines , tuck shops and cafeterias .
Dame Suzi Leather , the trust 's chairwoman , said : " New food standards from September will improve school meals , but they cannot succeed if pupils are surrounded with chocolate , crisps , and drinks that fill them up with sugar and fat during the school day .
" One in eight of our children is now obese .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that , when these products are removed , behaviour also improves . "
The trust received evidence from representatives of the food industry and vending machine companies which argued that " healthier " snacks and fizzy drinks should be allowed .
The trust decided that would cause confusion , would not contribute to education about good food and would increase dental erosion .
The new standards are expected to be agreed by Ms Kelly and will recommend :
· No confectionery should be sold in schools
· No bagged savoury snacks other than nuts and seeds - and these must be without added sugar or salt
· A variety of fresh fruit and vegetables should be available
· All children should have access to fresh free chilled water at all times , and this should not be in the toilet block
· The only other drinks available should be bottled water , low fat milk , pure fruit juices , yoghurt and milk drinks with less than 5 % sugar , or drinks made from these such as smoothies , tea or coffee .
Artificial sweeteners will be allowed but only in these types of drinks
The advice does not apply to lunchboxes or fundraising events .
The advice will have a major impact on the vending industry .
A recent survey carried out in Oxfordshire by the department of public health at Oxford University found that 95 % of all vending machine products considered " less healthy " would no longer be allowed under the trust 's rules .
School vending machines have an estimated annual turnover of £ 45 m .
Joe Harvey , head of the Health Education Trust and a member of the School Food Trust , said he was relieved that tough standards were in the final advice .
" We still want artificial sweeteners removed , but it 's a brilliant result . "
The Jamie Oliver effect
Jamie Oliver 's Feed Me Better campaign focused concern on school meals and put on unprecedented pressure to improve standards .
Channel 4's TV show , Jamie 's School Dinners , in February 2005 , featured Kidbrooke school in the London borough of Greenwich , and tackled children 's understanding of what they eat - most memorably when Oliver showed a class the fat , gristle and skin in chicken nuggets by whizzing them in a food processor to produce a repulsive runny pink paste .
His menus exposed the dinner ladies ' lack of training and understanding of nutrition .
Soon after , a 271,677 signature petition was presented to No 10 , and the government agreed a £ 220 m budget rise .
Greenwich rolled out Oliver 's menu to all its 56 schools .

VIEWPOINT
Matt Prescott
In February , Dr Matt Prescott used the Green Room to call for the traditional light bulb to be banned .
This week , he responds to some of the comments and questions raised by readers .
The environmental costs of lighting should be shared by all light bulbs , if well - intentioned laws are not to hinder efforts to save energy

Today , nobody misses CFC - based aerosol technology or even notices that other technologies have taken their place .
When applied to incandescent light bulbs , I had no idea what the response would be to the idea of taxing , phasing out and banning another cheap and familiar technology .
Especially when this technology was more indirectly responsible for altering the composition of the Earth 's atmosphere , and there was more complexity and uncertainty associated with understanding , and tackling , climate change .
According to the feedback I have received , some people have changed all the bulbs in their houses and said they will never look back .
Others have said that their light bulbs do n't waste energy , but help to heat their houses , or that an energy - saving light bulb cannot be used with a dimmer switch .
Here , I will attempt to address these and other points .
Energy - saving light bulbs have been available for 30 years , and although they are quick and simple to use , require five times less electricity to do much the same job , cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60 - 70 % and save users approximately £ 7 per bulb each year , they have not caught on .
In the UK alone , it has been estimated that the use of energy - saving light bulbs , in suitable applications , would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by 2.3 million tonnes per year ( 2.3 Mt CO2 ) .
Such an annual saving would be equivalent to 8 - 21 % of the emissions reduction the UK government has stated that it wants achieved by 2010 .
Similarly , across Europe , new domestic , business and street lighting technologies could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 24 Mt CO2 .
False economy
Part of the problem is that incandescent light bulbs have undergone 100 years of mass production and refinement , and now enjoy a large purchase price advantage over their energy saving equivalents .
The traditional focus on purchase price is very misleading ; however , as the total cost of using such a wasteful technology is much higher than any initial saving .
Some of the energy - saving bulb 's higher upfront cost is unavoidable .
This is because it is more complicated and energy - intensive to manufacture a compact fluorescent lamp ( CFL ) , which requires 4 kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) of electricity to be made , than to manufacture an incandescent bulb , which requires only 1 kWh .
Cheaper prices hide the true cost of traditional bulbs , says Matt Prescott
Unfortunately , the higher purchase price of CFLs has consistently distracted purchasers from the huge running costs associated with using incandescent light bulbs .
This is despite the fact that energy - saving light bulbs need to be replaced less often , consume far less electricity and easily pay back their initial investment , usually within a fraction of their lifetime .
In fact , the German Federal Environment Agency has calculated that , over its 15,000 hour lifetime , a single 20 W compact fluorescent light bulb would save 188 euros ( £ 131 ) worth of electricity .
By comparison , they say that approximately 15 short - lived 100W incandescent light bulbs would be needed to provide equivalent light levels over the same period .
It would clearly make a lot of sense if tightly - regulated labels , highlighted these differences in lifetime and running costs , and enabled consumers to make more informed choices .
It would also make sense if more governments automatically gave their poorest citizens free CFLs , and other energy - saving assistance .
After all , guaranteeing significantly reduced energy use , while maintaining levels of light and comfort , would do more than almost anything else to lift people out of fuel poverty .
Beyond the issue of cost , one common consumer concern is that fluorescent lamps contain trace quantities of mercury , whilst incandescent bulbs do not contain any .
This would appear to suggest that incandescent bulbs release less mercury into the environment .
On the contrary , the Lighting Industry Federation ( LIF ) has reported that the extra quantity of mercury emissions from burning fossil fuels in power stations to power incandescent lamps is three times the amount contained in equivalent energy efficient lamps .

Significantly , a CFL has the distinct advantage that its mercury can be collected and recycled , unlike atmospheric pollution .
Power stations also produce sulphur and nitrogen oxides which contribute to ' acid rain ' .
Specially - designed , but difficult to obtain , energy - saving bulbs can also be used with dimmer switches , and it is my experience that the light quality and warming up times of standard CFLs have improved dramatically in recent years .
Clearly , it would help if manufacturers made more designs of bulb available and retailers ensured that all the energy - saving bulbs they sold worked to a minimum standard and could be disposed of safely .
Sharing the burden
Perversely , the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive will soon force CFLs to become more expensive , so that their mercury content can be collected and disposed of safely .
Although responsible CFL collection and disposal are essential , incandescent bulbs will continue to incur no added costs as a result of their atmospheric pollution , and the incentive to buy wasteful technology will be strengthened even further .
In my view , the environmental costs of lighting should be shared by all light bulbs , if well - intentioned laws are not to hinder efforts to save energy .
But what other tax incentives could be used ?
In the UK , the rate of VAT ( sales tax ) on condoms has recently been reduced from 17.5 % to 5 % , in a bid to promote better sexual health .
Why not introduce similar low or zero VAT rates in order to promote energy efficiency ?
Every country in Europe now faces a serious problem when it comes to securing new supplies of energy .
Would n't it be sensible for all EU nations to use their tax and regulatory systems to promote reduced energy demand ?
It would also make a lot of sense to stop power stations pumping their surplus heat into the atmosphere via cooling towers
There is a certain amount of logic to this point of view .
Especially , as the world 's best building regulations result in well - insulated and ventilated homes , which are capable of being kept warm using body heat alone .
However , the UK Market Transformation Programme has shown that using gas heating to replace the heat generated by incandescent light bulbs would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 % , and cut the cost of this share of household heating by 84 % .
This is partly because electricity is relatively expensive , but also because over 60 % of the energy contained in coal and gas is lost simply generating and distributing electricity .
As most UK houses are very poorly insulated , it would be far more cost - effective to insulate houses and to use modern heating systems to provide warmth .
It would also make a lot of sense to stop power stations pumping their surplus heat into the atmosphere via cooling towers .
This could be done by using the hot water , left by their steam turbines , to heat local houses and to provide hot water for washing .
Even before this could be done , it would save a lot of money , energy and carbon emissions if we all used light bulbs to provide light , and nothing else .

" We 're a government of laws , not men , " Senate minority leader Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , said in a statement .
" It is not for George W. Bush to disregard the Constitution and decide that he is above the law . "
Rather than veto laws passed by Congress , Bush is using his signing statements to effectively nullify them as they relate to the executive branch .
These statements , for him , function as directives to executive branch departments and agencies as to how they are to implement the relevant law .
The federal government is instructed to follow the statements when it enforces the laws .
Here are ... examples and the dates Bush signed them :
March 9 : Justice Department officials must give reports to Congress by certain dates on how the FBI is using the USA Patriot Act to search homes and secretly seize papers .
Bush 's signing statement :
The president can order Justice Department officials to withhold any information from Congress if he decides it could impair national security or executive branch operations .
Dec. 30 , 2005 : US interrogators cannot torture prisoners or otherwise subject them to cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment .
Bush 's signing statement :
The president , as commander in chief , can waive the torture ban if he decides that harsh interrogation techniques will assist in preventing terrorist attacks .
Dec. 30 : When requested , scientific information '' prepared by government researchers and scientists shall be transmitted [ to Congress ] uncensored and without delay . "
Bush 's signing statement :
The president can tell researchers to withhold any information from Congress if he decides its disclosure could impair foreign relations , national security , or the workings of the executive branch .
Dec. 23 , 2004 : Forbids US troops in Colombia from participating in any combat against rebels , except in cases of self - defense .
Caps the number of US troops allowed in Colombia at 800 .
Bush 's signing statement :
Only the president , as commander in chief , can place restrictions on the use of US armed forces , so the executive branch will construe the law ''as advisory in nature . "
Aug .
5 : The military cannot add to its files any illegally gathered intelligence , including information obtained about Americans in violation of the Fourth Amendment 's protection against unreasonable searches .
Bush 's signing statement :
Only the president , as commander in chief , can tell the military whether or not it can use any specific piece of intelligence .
Nov. 5 , 2002 : Creates an Institute of Education Sciences whose director may conduct and publish research '' without the approval of the secretary [ of education ] or any other office of the department . "
Bush 's signing statement :
The president has the power to control the actions of all executive branch officials , so '' the director of the Institute of Education Sciences shall [ be ] subject to the supervision and direction of the secretary of education . "

Reid was a bit more reserved :
A few months ago , I wrote that it had come to light that Sam Alito - - our recently confirmed Supreme Court justice -- during the 1980s " wrote in support of Presidential signing statements as a way to expand the power of the executive branch . "
John Dean wrote a worthwhile analysis of the signing statement earlier this year ; suffice it to say that the President uses them to identify the light in which he believes the law written by Congress is to be enforced by the Executive Branch .
Alito wrote in 1986 " Since the President 's approval is just as important as that of the House or Senate , it seems to follow that the President 's understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress . "
This is a profound statement -- while our Constitution designates that laws are to be written by the Legislative and enforced by the Executive , Dean points out that This is a serious fundamental shift in power , advocated only by the President and not yet challenged .
In January , presidential scholar Christopher Kelley at Miami University in Oxford observed that " Reagan adopted the strategy and used signing statements to challenge 71 legislative provisions ... President George H.W. Bush challenged 146 laws ; President Clinton challenged 105 .
The current president has lodged more than 500 challenges so far .
" Kelley may have underestimated Bush .
On Sunday , the Boston Globe reported that Bush has used these legal gymnastics a whopping 750 times since he took office .
Bush , guided by Cheney and perhaps by Alito , relies on " unitary executive " theory - -" power he believes the Constitution assigns to him alone as the head of the executive branch or the commander in chief of the military . "
He 's using it as a line item veto ; this should explain to just about everyone why Bush has yet to veto any bills .
He just does n't need to The Globe published a list of 10 selected examples of signing statements , several of which are listed here :
We've already heard the " war on terrrra " referred to as the " Long War , " which means the President will be commander - in - chief during wartime for a number of years .
Applying this far - reaching view of the Executive branch during a time of war means that this power grab is breathtaking in its scope .
In April of this year , a columnist in the Washington Times questioned the signing statement , and more specifically questioned whether Congress would stand up and challenge it .
Democrats including Harry Reid have taken note of the Boston Globe article and issued their opposition to the tactic .
Ted Kennedy 's questioning of Sam Alito 's thoughts on signing statements during the confirmation hearings went somewhat unnoticed , at least once Alito 's wife began to cry .
I sincerely suggest it 's time we start paying more attention to what 's happening here .
The good news is Angie .
The bad news is her government .
Unfortunately , the bad is likely to subvert the good .
Even if this lady chancellor is made of iron , a messy , unstable coalition will ensure that her feet are stuck in clay .
All Europe will keep limping as a result .
But first , the good news .
It 's a very good thing that the Federal Republic of Germany will have a chancellor who is a woman and comes from east Germany .
Both seemed unthinkable 20 years ago .
Both are major steps towards a modern normality for Germany , no longer divided between east and west , nor between ruling men and serving women .
Outgoing chancellor Gerhard Schröder always said that he wanted Germany to become a more normal country .
His departure is his last and perhaps biggest contribution to that goal .
Moreover , Angela Merkel is herself a rather good thing .
She is practical , direct and full of common sense .
She cares about freedom .
She seems to understand what the German economy needs a lot better than her towering Christian Democratic predecessor , Helmut Kohl , ever did .
At the same time , she is no Margaret Thatcher .
You cannot imagine her saying that society does not exist .
A fluent Russian speaker , she will have none of Schröder 's embarrassing personal weakness for Vladimir Putin 's semi-dictatorial government .
With a track record of Atlanticism , and having passable English , she is well placed to repair Germany 's frayed relationship with the United States .
She grew up in a landscape and a milieu I knew well , the spartan , intense world of the east German Protestant clergy in the cobbled small towns and hard - brick villages of the Uckermark , north - east of Berlin .
A Protestant work ethic , high seriousness , and a preference for Lutheran plain - speaking were the hallmarks of that world .
Her east German biography was certainly not that of a dissident .
Unlike most children of the Protestant clergy , she joined the communist youth organisation , which bore the classic Orwellian misnomer , Free German Youth .
She was even one of that ghastly movement 's local organisers , while doing postgraduate study at the east German academy of sciences .
Yet somehow she emerged with many of the values more characteristic of former dissidents in central Europe .
In a European Union which is now a mixture of former west and former east , it 's good to have a major leader who is herself a personal union of the two .
The question is : what can she do ?
The German constitution gives the federal chancellor considerable powers to set the main lines of policy , and the practice , from the founding postwar chancellor Konrad Adenauer through to Gerhard Schröder , has been for chancellors to make full use of those powers .
This has been called a Kanzlerdemokratie , a chancellor - democracy .
But the constitution , and the federal political system as it has evolved , also places considerable checks on the chancellor - far more than on any British prime minister .
Ironically , a political system designed , with its elaborate checks and balances , to prevent the emergence of another Adolf Hitler , is now helping to prevent the emergence of necessary reforms .
The upper house , or Bundesrat , composed of representatives of the federal states , can restrain and even block government initiatives far more than the House of Lords .
Since there are elections in several federal states every year , there 's effectively no such thing as a " mid- term " period when a government can make unpopular but necessary reforms without the fear of being immediately punished at the polls .
With proportional representation , the country always has coalition governments , which means more compromises .
Never more so than when you have a so - called grand coalition between the two main opposing parties , with the Social Democrats actually having more cabinet seats than the Christian Democrats .
Just imagine a Labour - Conservative coalition government , with foreign secretary Hilary Benn and chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown serving alongside home secretary David Davis under prime minister David Cameron .
Fifteen years ago , as Germany was uniting and Angela Merkel was starting her political career , a perceptive observer wrote that the great test for the federal republic was whether its tradition of " change through consensus " could produce enough change .
Looking at the outcome of this election , I fear the question is being answered : more consensus , less change .
And many observers have a sneaking feeling that this is the answer much of the German electorate still feels most comfortable with , even though no one actually voted for it .
Over the next few weeks we shall see what detailed understandings Christian and Social Democrats can reach , as they try to reconcile their starkly contrasting positions on taxes , healthcare and labour market reform .
Do n't hold your breath .
Those who are more optimistic than I am about Germany 's capacity for change point to what is happening already among the young and in business .
Now it 's true that one meets a lot of impressive , highly educated young Germans , able to tell you , in fluent English or French , what their country needs to do .
The trouble is that you are most likely to meet them in Oxford ( which has lots of outstanding German students ) , Harvard , Paris or Tokyo rather than in Heidelberg , Munich or Berlin .
Today 's genuinely free German youth have seized the chances offered by an integrated Europe , and a globalised world , to vote with their feet .
Many of the brightest seem likely to make their professional careers largely outside Germany .
Unless something changes back home , that is .
As for German business , the country 's larger companies have certainly made big changes over the past decade .
They have internationalised aggressively .
Several hold their board meetings in English .
They are leaner , meaner , fitter .
They have export performances that most British or US companies would die for .
But they have done this , on the whole , by cutting jobs in Germany and creating new jobs in the Czech Republic , Poland , India or China .
This has not done much to help Germany 's more than 5 million unemployed .
Watching one of the endless TV discussion shows ( Germans may not like change , but they love talking about it ) I saw a former minister in Helmut Kohl 's government , Norbert Blüm , throw up his hands in incomprehending horror at the notion that the stock market rewarded German companies for getting rid of 10,000 employees .
Well , exactly .
The market alone wo n't do it .
It does need the German state to create the conditions in which German companies will create the jobs - at home and not abroad .
This means changing labour laws , taxes , welfare contributions and the like .
These are the things that an alliance with the free - marketeering Free Democrats would have encouraged , and that with the Social Democrats will slow down .
This at a time when Germany faces a fierce double competition : regionally , from the low - wage , low - tax economies of central and eastern Europe , and globally , from Asia .
Now more than ever , I suspect that what Germany does will be too little , too late .
In German , there 's a nice phrase for giving something a mixed greeting : " with one laughing and one weeping eye " .
I greet the prospect of chancellor Angie with a laughing eye .
But as for the prospect of her walking stalemate of a government : it makes me weep .

There were precepts , tales , admonitions , exercises and even homework for 750 - odd students as President A P J Abdul Kalam donned a multiplicity of roles when he interacted with them in the Children Science Congress , as part of 93rd Indian Science Congress in Hyderabad on Thursday .
Narrating inspiring events in the lives of Father of Green Revolution Norman E Borlog and Mathematics genius Ramanujam , Kalam told a spell - bound audience of children to inculcate " scientific magnanimity " - the ability to recognise the best of knowledge without any reservations .
" You children should learn that great minds and great hearts will be together , " he said .
At the same time , the academician in the President wanted the teachers to spot the talent lay hidden in a student .
" Ramanujam had failed in all subjects except mathematics .
It was his headmaster who , defying opposition gave him admission in high school , " he said .
Kalam entrusted the task of reforming children to parents , when Sushanti , a seventh standard girl , asked him about the means to tackle corruption among elected political representatives .
" Righteousness is the virtue to be inculcated right from childhood .
Government cannot create honesty .
Only parents and elementary level teacher can weed out corruption in the long run , " Kalam said citing a childhood experience when he was taken to task by his father for accepting a gift .
On the relationship between science and values , student Anand Sinha was told that a mature civilisation like that of India can impart values while science only teaches reason .
" They both should be practised together though , " Kalam observed .
For success in life , the President has a formula for children .
" You develop courage to think differently , to discover , to confront the problems and succeed , " he said .
There was also a homework for the students .
" I want you all to finish this homework in 2006 .
You should read five books -- Empires of the Minds by Denis Waitly , Journey into Light by G Venkataraman , A Brief History of Time by S Hawking , Parallel Worlds by Michao Kaku and The Best of Indian Physics by Dr Siddharth , " Kalam said .
Finally , there was a promise for kids .
" All of you should prepare a mission statement for yourself .
You write to me one paragraph on what you are going to become in life and for what you will be remembered for .
I will give a special gift for the best statement , " the President promised the beaming children .
Veils of their day ?
Protestant ministers in elaborate , controversial robes
These may seem like unfamiliar and uncharted waters that British society is moving into - controversy over religious clothing , and fearful tensions between a religious minority and the mainstream .
In fact , we 've been here before , 400 years ago - or somewhere uncannily like it .
In the days of Elizabeth I and James I / VI , the English church was riven by the Puritan controversy .
The main issue - at least on the surface - was what ministers should wear : traditional robes or ordinary clothes .
The difference is that then it was the establishment that demanded distinctive clothing and the radicals - the Puritans - who insisted on everyday wear .
The government came down fairly strongly on the dissidents .
Religious ministers who refused to back down and button up were sacked .
Shakespeare 's Malvolio , played here by Alec McCowen , was mocked as a " Puritan "
Others hated and feared Puritans as dangerous fanatics dividing English society .
Puritans talked about freedom of conscience , it was said , but if they got into power would n't they just impose their own narrow - minded scruples on everyone else ?
One such critic was Shakespeare .
In a Daily Star moment in Twelfth Night , he has Malvolio described as " a kind of Puritan " , to which Sir Andrew Aguecheek replies , " O , if I thought that , I 'd beat him like a dog . "
You can just imagine the response that line would have got - especially as Puritans wanted to close the theatres .
Then again , others thought the whole issue of religious clothing was completely trivial , and ought to blow over quickly .
" It is scarcely credible how much this controversy about things of no importance has disturbed our churches , " said the Bishop of London .
The issue of religious clothing seemed superficial , it was in fact just the surface of much deeper disagreements
Debate about veils is ' healthy '
The problem was that though the issue of religious clothing seemed superficial , it was in fact just the surface of much deeper disagreements , religious and political .
Religiously , Puritans saw the robes as a revival of Roman Catholicism by the back door - a religion they violently opposed as anti-Christian blasphemy .
For the establishment , the robes represented a moderate religion that combined the best of old and new .
This provides a valuable perspective on today 's debate .
Seemingly trivial disputes about religious togs can mask a conflict between whole world views .
To one side , it was obvious that good religion is moderate , middle of the road and orderly .
To the other , it was equally apparent that true religion demands radical purity and commitment , and so - called " moderation " meant compromise with the powers of darkness .
Puritans advocated plain , unadorned , clothes
It is worth noting the results of the government 's refusal to meet the Puritans halfway - or anywhere at all .
The Puritan movement was split , more moderate Puritans accepting the status quo , while the most radical quit the Church of England and started their own churches .
This is where the non-conformist denominations , such as the Baptists , first began .
Separatist leaders were executed in 1593 .
Surviving followers fled the country to Amsterdam , and eventually to north America on the Mayflower .
Why did the government react so violently against people whose only crime was not going to church ?
The answer has further resonances with today 's situation .
Twenty - five years before Elizabeth became Queen , a group of radical Protestants seized the German city of Munster , a move which ended in the deaths of thousands .
This horror traumatised Europe , and from then on all radical Protestants were suspected of plotting such acts of terror .
The English separatists were in fact totally peaceable , but were damned by association .
Additionally , the more they were shunned by mainstream society , and the longer they separated from it , the more extreme and implacable their condemnation of it became .
On a more optimistic note , however unsympathetic the radical Puritan movement may seem today , it brought forth from one of its leaders , Robert Browne , the first defence of universal religious freedom in British history .
A reminder , perhaps , that even those who seem to take indefensible positions on controversial issues can have something valuable to say .

The bottom picture in this article also shows that at the time it was considered unseemly for a woman to be in public without a cap covering her hair , or for a man not to wear a hat in public .
Fortunately , our society and religion has moved on from the premise that it is what wear that makes you a decent person , to making the determination on what you do .

Freedoms - religious or otherwise are part of the preveliges of this country .
For example ,
If we , the citizens , dont like the politics then it is enshrined that we have the choice to change it .
Now one of the things that does exist is the freedom of choice .
If the veil is chosen to be worn then the choice is to dispence with the service .
Its choice - live with it .
We all would if we went somewhere else to live .
Mike , Aberdeen
What complete nonsense - not remotely an analogy !
Anon ,
The veil problem for me is not a religious question but its extreme aspect when the face is covered frightens me by its radicality and its dangerosity for so many reasons .
One of them is the question of the security when you can only see a ghost .
I understand what it means to be protected against wind and sand and sun when the veil is traditionnally used in a geographic area with an extreme climate , but it must be necessary to change a tradition in another country where the climate is mild and does not need a so extreme protection .
It could be also more polite for the new social environment .
Scarfs and other small veils women wear for religious ideas can be very lovely and have to be respected .

Just wonderful !
This story just proves again that you can't know where you 're going unless you know where you 've come from , historically , and emphsises the huge importance of learning from our past !
Rebecca , London
As a history student , it 's nice to see the study of that discipline lead to important messages for modern society .
Obviously , it 's impossible to make a direct comparison between English puritans in the sixteenth century and modern Islamic fundamentalists , but it can't be denied there are some important similarities .
Overall , an intelligent and thought - provoking article .

I would just like to say it does n't say in the Koran that weman should wear vails .
It 's how they interpret whot it says .

The way Muslim women dress is personal choice as is what religion one believes in and how seriously they observe it .
Thus any restrictions would be an impingement on individual liberty and hence violation of an individual 's human rights .
Shoukat , London
Surely there is a very important difference ?
The conflicts in 16th century Europe were between various branches of Christianity .
The current situation is caused by the demands of a religious minority at odds with a largely secular majority .
While the religious minority are organised the secular majority have no unifying body .
Is it not now time to re-open the debate on the dis-establishment of the Church of England ?
Are there not lessons to be learnt from countries such as France ( and to some extent the USA ) where an openly secular state reflects reality and relegates religion to a matter of individual conscience ?
Paul , Clermont l'Herault , France
I think that everyone should have freedom of religion but if that religion spills over into terrorism , then the persons who are involved in instigating violence should be prosecuted , not the followers of any religion .
The veil issue is complicated because I would n't want my family members to wear one , but at the same it would be bigotry to stop someone from wearing it .
They are not saying everyone should wear one , they are just saying they want to wear it .
And as was mentioned above they are guilty through association .
James , Luton
Mr Tomkins misses a key point .
The issue in the 16th century was almost wholly religous .
With the veil there is large element of cultural difference as well ; the differing groups today come from substantially different cultural and ethnic backgrounds , this was not true 400 years ago .
Today we have differing groups that are converging and overlapping rather than divurging from a common starting point .
Herin lies the problem .
This veil issue as a symptom of lack of intergration .
This is what needs to resolved - if you join a club ( ie the UK ) then you largely are obliged to honuor its rules and traditions not change them without democratic ( majority ) agreement to the changes .

This article is drifting away from the central point of contention , viz the veil .
No veil because we all need to be identified by our face , for PASSPORT , CAR LICENCE or simply to know who is talking .
I saw the interview on the news television , but do not know who was speaking , there was no identity !
james gorman , guildford
How can Steve Tomkins claim this has any similarity ?
This is just someone at the BBC short of a story or trying to promote his book ?
The problem most of us have with a veil is that it covers the face ; it causes segregation , lack of communication and is not wanted by the majority of our society .
The fact that it is tied to a religion is not the point .
Most of us would campaign equally against hoodies or any face hiding fashion , especially if employed in public service .
Steve Shelton , Derby
If muslims want to live in the Uk they should respect our laws and customers and remove the veils .
STEPHEN BARTHOLOMEW , peterlee
This story , while being very interesting , has nothing to do with the current controversy - I understood the issue to be one of covering the face and not what a person should wear .
In the interest of security as well as manners it should be against the law for anyone , irrespective of race or religion , to walk around with the face covered .
If certain cases are allowed anyone who does n't want to be recognised ( eg criminals and terrorists ) would take advantage to carry out their criminal pursuits .
roger toon , leicester
Steve makes a very good point .
Here in Scotland similar attitudes persist .
Some years ago , our minister began to wear somewhat colorful vestments , including a large wooden cross around his neck .
Congregational mutterings arose , and a perfectly good minister moved on .
M Macmillan
This is not just about religeous identity , it 's a matter of security .
Who knows who is behind that veil and what their intentions are !
As has been said many times , you cannot go into a bank wearing a motorcycle helmet that covers most of your face so why should anyone be allowed to wear a veil that covers all but their eyes .
You may interview someone for a job but have no idea that they are actually the person who turns up .
If other Muslim countries can ban the veil then so should we .
We bend too much for other people who elect to live here but do n't want to integrate and follow our rules .
This is NOT a Muslim country but Muslims are welcome to live here providing they make the effort as we have to do in their countries .
Give and take .

If I have the same right as these Muslim Women , what would society think if I went about the streets wearing a ski mask ?
Phil , Bournemouth
Surly the point is , the Puritans were Christian were they not , but the wearers of the veil follow a different Faith .
This is a Christian country , and the situation will never be resolved while they , and their alien faith , remain in this Christian land .
J. Chapman , Ferndown , Dorset
Is n't the moral of this story that such things will never end !?

Can You Trust Your Computer ?
by Richard Stallman
Who should your computer take its orders from ?
Most people think their computers should obey them , not obey someone else .
With a plan they call “ trusted computing ” , large media corporations ( including the movie companies and record companies ) , together with computer companies such as Microsoft and Intel , are planning to make your computer obey them instead of you .
( Microsoft 's version of this scheme is called Palladium . )
Proprietary programs have included malicious features before , but this plan would make it universal .
Proprietary software means , fundamentally , that you do n't control what it does ; you can't study the source code , or change it .
It 's not surprising that clever businessmen find ways to use their control to put you at a disadvantage .
Microsoft has done this several times : one version of Windows was designed to report to Microsoft all the software on your hard disk ; a recent “ security ” upgrade in Windows Media Player required users to agree to new restrictions .
But Microsoft is not alone : the KaZaa music - sharing software is designed so that KaZaa 's business partner can rent out the use of your computer to its clients .
These malicious features are often secret , but even once you know about them it is hard to remove them , since you do n't have the source code .
In the past , these were isolated incidents .
“ Trusted computing ” would make the practice pervasive .
“ Treacherous computing ” is a more appropriate name , because the plan is designed to make sure your computer will systematically disobey you .
In fact , it is designed to stop your computer from functioning as a general - purpose computer .
Every operation may require explicit permission .
The technical idea underlying treacherous computing is that the computer includes a digital encryption and signature device , and the keys are kept secret from you .
Proprietary programs will use this device to control which other programs you can run , which documents or data you can access , and what programs you can pass them to .
These programs will continually download new authorization rules through the Internet , and impose those rules automatically on your work .
If you do n't allow your computer to obtain the new rules periodically from the Internet , some capabilities will automatically cease to function .
Of course , Hollywood and the record companies plan to use treacherous computing for Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) , so that downloaded videos and music can be played only on one specified computer .
Sharing will be entirely impossible , at least using the authorized files that you would get from those companies .
You , the public , ought to have both the freedom and the ability to share these things .
( I expect that someone will find a way to produce unencrypted versions , and to upload and share them , so DRM will not entirely succeed , but that is no excuse for the system . )
Making sharing impossible is bad enough , but it gets worse .
There are plans to use the same facility for email and documents — resulting in email that disappears in two weeks , or documents that can only be read on the computers in one company .
Imagine if you get an email from your boss telling you to do something that you think is risky ; a month later , when it backfires , you can't use the email to show that the decision was not yours .
“ Getting it in writing ” does n't protect you when the order is written in disappearing ink .
Imagine if you get an email from your boss stating a policy that is illegal or morally outrageous , such as to shred your company 's audit documents , or to allow a dangerous threat to your country to move forward unchecked .
Today you can send this to a reporter and expose the activity .
With treacherous computing , the reporter wo n't be able to read the document ; her computer will refuse to obey her .
Treacherous computing becomes a paradise for corruption .
Word processors such as Microsoft Word could use treacherous computing when they save your documents , to make sure no competing word processors can read them .
Today we must figure out the secrets of Word format by laborious experiments in order to make free word processors read Word documents .
If Word encrypts documents using treacherous computing when saving them , the free software community wo n't have a chance of developing software to read them — and if we could , such programs might even be forbidden by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Programs that use treacherous computing will continually download new authorization rules through the Internet , and impose those rules automatically on your work .
If Microsoft , or the US government , does not like what you said in a document you wrote , they could post new instructions telling all computers to refuse to let anyone read that document .
Each computer would obey when it downloads the new instructions .
Your writing would be subject to 1984 - style retroactive erasure .
You might be unable to read it yourself .
You might think you can find out what nasty things a treacherous - computing application does , study how painful they are , and decide whether to accept them .
Even if you can find this out , it would be foolish to accept the deal , but you can't even expect the deal to stand still .
Once you come to depend on using the program , you are hooked and they know it ; then they can change the deal .
Some applications will automatically download upgrades that will do something different — and they wo n't give you a choice about whether to upgrade .
Today you can avoid being restricted by proprietary software by not using it .
If you run GNU / Linux or another free operating system , and if you avoid installing proprietary applications on it , then you are in charge of what your computer does .
If a free program has a malicious feature , other developers in the community will take it out , and you can use the corrected version .
You can also run free application programs and tools on nonfree operating systems ; this falls short of fully giving you freedom , but many users do it .
Treacherous computing puts the existence of free operating systems and free applications at risk , because you may not be able to run them at all .
Some versions of treacherous computing would require the operating system to be specifically authorized by a particular company .
Free operating systems could not be installed .
Some versions of treacherous computing would require every program to be specifically authorized by the operating system developer .
You could not run free applications on such a system .
If you did figure out how , and told someone , that could be a crime .
There are proposals already for US laws that would require all computers to support treacherous computing , and to prohibit connecting old computers to the Internet .
The CBDTPA ( we call it the Consume But Don't Try Programming Act ) is one of them .
But even if they do n't legally force you to switch to treacherous computing , the pressure to accept it may be enormous .
Today people often use Word format for communication , although this causes several sorts of problems ( see “ We Can Put an End to Word Attachments ” ) .
If only a treacherous - computing machine can read the latest Word documents , many people will switch to it , if they view the situation only in terms of individual action ( take it or leave it ) .
To oppose treacherous computing , we must join together and confront the situation as a collective choice .
For further information about treacherous computing , see http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/tcpa-faq.html.
To block treacherous computing will require large numbers of citizens to organize .

Postscripts
The computer security field uses the term “ trusted computing ” in a different way — beware of confusion between the two meanings .
The GNU Project distributes the GNU Privacy Guard , a program that implements public - key encryption and digital signatures , which you can use to send secure and private email .
It is useful to explore how GPG differs from treacherous computing , and see what makes one helpful and the other so dangerous .
When someone uses GPG to send you an encrypted document , and you use GPG to decode it , the result is an unencrypted document that you can read , forward , copy , and even reencrypt to send it securely to someone else .
A treacherous - computing application would let you read the words on the screen , but would not let you produce an unencrypted document that you could use in other ways .
GPG , a free software package , makes security features available to the users ; they use it .
Treacherous computing is designed to impose restrictions on the users ; it uses them .
The supporters of treacherous computing focus their discourse on its beneficial uses .
What they say is often correct , just not important .
Like most hardware , treacherous - computing hardware can be used for purposes which are not harmful .
But these features can be implemented in other ways , without treacherous - computing hardware .
The principal difference that treacherous computing makes for users is the nasty consequence : rigging your computer to work against you .
What they say is true , and what I say is true .
Put them together and what do you get ?
Treacherous computing is a plan to take away our freedom , while offering minor benefits to distract us from what we would lose .
Microsoft presents Palladium as a security measure , and claims that it will protect against viruses , but this claim is evidently false .
A presentation by Microsoft Research in October 2002 stated that one of the specifications of Palladium is that existing operating systems and applications will continue to run ; therefore , viruses will continue to be able to do all the things that they can do today .
When Microsoft employees speak of “ security ” in connection with Palladium , they do not mean what we normally mean by that word : protecting your machine from things you do not want .
They mean protecting your copies of data on your machine from access by you in ways others do not want .
A slide in the presentation listed several types of secrets Palladium could be used to keep , including “ third party secrets ” and “ user secrets ” — but it put “ user secrets ” in quotation marks , recognizing that this is somewhat of an absurdity in the context of Palladium .
The presentation made frequent use of other terms that we frequently associate with the context of security , such as “ attack ” , “ malicious code ” , “ spoofing ” , as well as “ trusted ” .
None of them means what it normally means .
“ Attack ” does n't mean someone trying to hurt you , it means you trying to copy music .
“ Malicious code ” means code installed by you to do what someone else does n't want your machine to do .
“ Spoofing ” does n't mean someone 's fooling you , it means you 're fooling Palladium .
And so on .
A previous statement by the Palladium developers stated the basic premise that whoever developed or collected information should have total control of how you use it .
This would represent a revolutionary overturn of past ideas of ethics and of the legal system , and create an unprecedented system of control .
The specific problems of these systems are no accident ; they result from the basic goal .
It is the goal we must reject .
As of 2015 , treacherous computing has been implemented for PCs in the form of the “ Trusted Platform Module ” ; however , for practical reasons , the TPM has proved a total failure for the goal of providing a platform for remote attestation to verify Digital Restrictions Management .
Thus , companies implement DRM using other methods .
At present , “ Trusted Platform Modules ” are not being used for DRM at all , and there are reasons to think that it will not be feasible to use them for DRM .
Ironically , this means that the only current uses of the “ Trusted Platform Modules ” are the innocent secondary uses — for instance , to verify that no one has surreptitiously changed the system in a computer .
Therefore , we conclude that the “ Trusted Platform Modules ” available for PCs are not dangerous , and there is no reason not to include one in a computer or support it in system software .
This does not mean that everything is rosy .
Other hardware systems for blocking the owner of a computer from changing the software in it are in use in some ARM PCs as well as processors in portable phones , cars , TVs and other devices , and these are fully as bad as we expected .
This also does not mean that remote attestation is harmless .
If ever a device succeeds in implementing that , it will be a grave threat to users ' freedom .
The current “ Trusted Platform Module ” is harmless only because it failed in the attempt to make remote attestation feasible .
We must not presume that all future attempts will fail too .

English and Hindi mesh in Mumbai Hinglish - a hybrid of English and south Asian languages , used both in Asia and the UK - now has its own dictionary .
Is it really a pukka way to speak ?
Are you a " badmash " ?
And if you had to get somewhere in a hurry , would you make an " airdash " ?
Maybe you should be at your desk working , instead you 're reading this as a " timepass " .
These are examples of Hinglish , in which English and the languages of south Asia overlap , with phrases and words borrowed and re-invented .
It 's used on the Indian sub - continent , with English words blending with Punjabi , Urdu and Hindi , and also within British Asian families to enliven standard English .
A dictionary of the hybrid language has been gathered by Baljinder Mahal , a Derby - based teacher and published this week as The Queen 's Hinglish .
Goodness Gracious
Me used Hinglish
" Much of it comes from banter - the exchanges between the British white population and the Asians , " she says .
" It 's also sometimes a secret language , which is being used by lots of British Asians , but it 's never been picked up on . "
And in multi-cultural playgrounds , she now hears white pupils using Asian words , such as " kati " , meaning " I 'm not your friend any more " .
For the young are linguistic magpies , borrowing from any language , accent or dialect that seems fashionable .
And the dictionary identifies how the ubiquitous " innit " was absorbed into British Asian speech via " haina " - a Hindi tag phrase , stuck on the sentences and meaning " is no ? " .
Birmingham balti
It 's also the language of globalisation .
There are more English - speakers in India than anywhere else in the world - and satellite television , movies and the internet mean that more and more people in the sub - continent are exposed to both standard English and Hinglish .
Balti - bucket or curry ?
This collision of languages has generated some flavoursome phrases .
If you 're feeling " glassy " it means you need a drink .
And a " timepass " is a way of distracting yourself .
A hooligan is a " badmash " and if you need to bring a meeting forward , you do the opposite of postponing - in Hinglish you can " prepone " .
There are also some evocatively archaic phrases - such as " stepney " , which in south Asia is used to mean a spare , as in spare wheel , spare mobile or even , " insultingly , it must be said , a mistress , " says Ms Mahal .
Its origins are n't in Stepney , east London , but Stepney Street in Llanelli , Wales , where a popular brand of spare tyre was once manufactured
But do n't assume that familiar Asian words used in the UK will necessarily translate back .
" Balti " will probably be taken to mean bucket in India rather than a type of cooking , as this cuisine owes more to the west Midlands than south Asia .
Ad land
In south Asia , Hinglish has been given a modern , fashionable spin by its use on music channels and in advertising .
And it 's appeared in the UK on programmes such as Goodness Gracious Me and the Kumars at Number 42 , with a catchphrase about " chuddies " ( underpants ) .
IMPORTED FROM INDIA
Pyjamas , caravan , bungalow Doolally , cushy , dinghy Pundit , thug The exporting of words into English has also caught the attention of the south Asian media , with the Times of India reporting : " Brand India has shaken , stirred and otherwise Bangalored the world 's consciousness . "
Yes , " to Bangalore " is another Hinglishism , meaning to send overseas , as in call centres .
The arrival of Hinglish and the influence of Indian words on English are also a reflection of the rise of the Indian sub - continent as an economic power - house .
Language expert David Crystal has described India as having a " unique position in the English - speaking world " .
" [ It 's a ] linguistic bridge between the major first - language dialects of the world , such as British and American English , and the major foreign - language varieties , such as those emerging in China and Japan . "
But there are much older crossovers between English and the languages of the Indian sub - continent , with many words imported from the soldiers and administrators of the British Raj .
These borrowed words include " pundit " , originally meaning a learned man ; " shampoo " , derived from a word for massage ; " pyjamas " , meaning a leg garment and " dungarees " , originating from the Dungri district of Mumbai .
Even the suburban - sounding " caravan " and " bungalow " - and the funky " bandana " and " bangles " - were all taken from Hindi words .
Pick and mix
It 's not only the south Asian languages that have fused with English to take on a new identity .
Turning out the vote in Spanish and English There is Spanglish , used in parts of the United States where people shift seamlessly between Spanish and English , and where hybrid words are created - such as a sign " No hangear " meaning " No hanging around . "
Advertisers in the Far East use a form of fractured English too , as much for its visual impact as its meaning .
But this pick and mix approach should be embraced not resisted , says Ms Mahal .
It 's natural and inevitable that languages will adapt and change to whatever is around .
" There might be puritans in any culture who say you can only be the master of one language , and that you should n't try to cross two languages .
But do we only have one fixed identity ?
I do n't think so , I think we can step in and out of different identities - and we can do the same with languages .
" People might say this is my language , this is way it has always been .
Well , it has n't .
Shakespeare 's English was different from Chaucer's .
The evolution of language is never going to stop . "

As George Orwell wrote in 1984 , the fewer words we have , the more restricted our thinking becomes .
With this in mind , I embrace the evolution and expansion of any language ( especially the one I use ) .
Adding words to your language , allows for more freedom of thought and expression .
However , it does also mean you need a better spellchecker .
DS , Bromley , England
We have always used a mix of English , Gujarati and Swahili in our everyday language .
It is so embedded that we do not realise it .
So all this is natural and continues to evolve as more mixtures of languages occur .
It 's great listening to people in Kenya and those here as well those from India .
We just mix more as we expand use of the internet as well .
Kiran Chauhan , Leicester I love the integration of foreign languages into the English language .
It 's one of the reasons I studied it , and one of the reasons etymology was my favourite subject .
Let 's face it , English is a mish - mash of foreign languages with added dodgy pronunciation and spelling !
Martje Ross , Lancaster , UK
This is gruntling news - a most appointing story for anyone who enjoys flirting with language .
And let 's not overlook the claims of Honklish and Singlish too , lah !
All those dynamic Chuppies ( Chinese - speaking upwardly - mobile people ) can't be wrong . . . !
Tom , Lewes
The latest fashionable version of Thai also contains a lot of English words .
To the with - it crowd , " chill chill " now means relaxing and " hiso " ( from high society ) posh .
For example , a commonly said phrase " pai nang chill chill kan " translates to " let 's go and lounge around . "
Nophol T. , Bangkok , Thailand I would query the origin of " innit " as from " haina " .
My father told me off for saying innit in the sixties , it is from " is n't it " , especially around Bristol .
Check Dirk Robson 's books , Krek waiters peak brissle , and Eurekal .
Dave Gibbs , Weston super Mare , England As a British Asian , I grew up in West London in the late Sixties / early Seventies , whilst my cousins grew up in the West Midlands .
The origin of the word , " init " is pure Brummie - and we ( in the South ) adopted it after listening to our cousins .
Gurmit Flora , London I agree with Dave Gibbs about the origin of " innit " .
In rural Gloucestershire I was being corrected by my parents well before 1950 for using innit istead of is n't it .
Les Giles , Great Missenden , Bucks
The previous comments about " innit " being from " is n't it " are indeed correct , but your respondents have missed the point being made .
English has many forms of these so - called " tag questions " depending on the sentence : " is n't it " , " are n't we " , " were n't they " , " do n't you " .
Hindi has just one ( " na " or " hai na " ) , just as French ( " n'est - ce pas " ) and German ( " nicht wahr " ) do .
The usage being described is that these English speakers now use " is n't it " ( reduced to " innit " ) in ALL cases , and not just where you would expect it grammatically .
The suggestion is that it 's the way it 's being used that has been influenced by other languages , not the etymology of the word itself .
David E Newton , London To Dave Gibbs and Les Giles :
The article does n't claim " innit " comes from " haina " .
It only states " innit " was introduced into Hinglish as an invariant tag ( in the same way " haina " is used in Hindi ) , i.e. a tag that can substitute any other kind of English tag ( English : " We 've seen this movie before , have n't we " , Hinglish : " We 've seen this movie before , innit " ) .
Wim Vandenberghe , Hässelby , Stockholm Very good article .
You can also add other Indian words like cash ( From kasu - Tamil ) , catamaran ( Kattu maram - Tamil ) , mango ( mangai - Tamil ) , juggernaut ( jegannath - Sanskrit ) .
Arun , Stratford , London Another example of the erosion of Britishness .
Why is n't there an article on how Asians that come to Britain are becoming more British , instead of the locals becoming more foreign ?
Why is the BBC so terrified of Britishness ?
John Alexander , Portsmouth I had always wonderd why there is a pub in Southall called " Glassy Junction " .
Now I know .
Thank you for enlightening me !
Steve Burns , Reading Hinglish ?
Sounds good to me .
Language should be alive .
And to Mr Alexander of Portsmouth - I might live in Quebec but I still consider myself a Brit .
Its just that my concept of " Britishness " includes using local French argot terms in my everyday speech .
Learn to live with it .
Chris , Verdun , Quebec
It is the greatest strength of the English language that it adopts anything it can use to enrich itself .
This is one of the reasons why English is such dominant language internationally and why it is supremely well suited to the production of poetry and literature of so many varieties .
Hinglish is a wonderful example of a living language in action , evolving to meet the needs of its speakers .
I can't wait to call somebody at work and " prepone " a future meeting !
Amanda , Bradford , UK A very good article indeed .
Indians have no doubt got their language embedded into English but in doing so they have also made their language ( at least spoken one ) ' corrupt ' .
You would see more and more of younger generation speaking English rather than their mother tongue ( which could be one of the hundreds of languages India has ) .
Let us take the case of Kashmir ( where I am from ) .
Kids are actually discouraged to speak Kashmiri ( their native language ) by their parents / elders which I feel is disgusting .
No doubt English is a must in today 's world but not at the expense of one 's mother tongue .
This has reached to the point in Kashmir where over 95 % of people cannot write Kashmiri and a slighlty smaller percentage cannot read their language .
By the way , I can read Kashmiri to some extent but cannot write it , which I really feel sad about .
Saqib , England Well , I am originally from Wales , and can certainly vouch for the strong existence for a ' Wenglish ' ( mixture of Welsh and English ) .
Great fun to use and just another way of expressing oneself .
Ruth , London
It is all well and good enriching languages , but I think the Indians have gone one step too far to try and destroy thier own language .
If you listen to an Indian news broadcast one in Hindi and the other one in English you will find that the news in Hindi uses a lot of English words and the news in English is pure English .
This applies to all programmes whether it is in Engand or India .
Ram Maharaj , London English is so rich because it has never been crystallised like German or French .
As long as it keeps growing and developing it will remain predominant as the most democratic language of all .
However , people in Britain must accept that it is no longer our language and that we will one day be simply speaking a dialect of a much wider common tongue .
Andy Crick , Oxfordshire , UK Fascinating !
I was checking out the BBC take on our election and found a new source of interesting news stories .
We do not say " Innit " here in the US , but the use of the word " like " cannot be , like , described , like , you know ?
Whitney Wetherill , Clinton Town , Hunterdon County , New Jersey , USA
On the derivation of ' caravan ' .
Does this have Indian roots or Arabic .
There is a city in Tunisia named ' Kairouan / Qairouan ' .
Arabs may have borrowed it from he Indians like the numerals though ...
Khan , London
This is a truly delightful piece .
English , whilst basically a Germanic language , is already a glorious concoction of French , Nordic , Latin , Greek with trace elements of Celtic and much else besides .
I see no reason to be other than grateful that we have such a wonderful language and additional Hindi elements will only add to its richness .
English is a prime example of Saussure 's principle of diachronic change .
Long may it be so .
Dr Ian Sedwell , Weymouth Don't forget Franglais , Chinglish , Konglish , Janglish , Singlish and Texmex .
These dialects will always appear where main languages meet .

Another general joins ranks opposing Rumsfeld
Defense secretary ' carries too much baggage , ' Swannack says
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The commander who led the elite 82nd Airborne Division during its mission in Iraq has joined the chorus of retired generals calling on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to leave the Pentagon .
" I really believe that we need a new secretary of defense because Secretary Rumsfeld carries way too much baggage with him , " retired Maj .
Gen. Charles Swannack told CNN's Barbara Starr on Thursday .
Swannack is the second general who served in Iraq under Rumsfeld to call for him to resign .
( Watch as more retired generals join chorus against Rumsfeld -- 1:29 )
Retired Maj. Gen. John Batiste -- who led the 1st Infantry Division in northern Iraq in 2004 - 2005 -- called for Rumsfeld 's resignation during an interview Wednesday on CNN .
He also suggested other changes among the top brass at the Pentagon .
" I think we need senior military leaders who understand the principles of war and apply them ruthlessly , and when the time comes , they need to call it like it is , " he told CNN .
Former U.S. Central Command chief Anthony Zinni , former Army Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton , and retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold also have called for Rumsfeld to step down .
Swannack is critical of Rumsfeld 's management style .
" Specifically , I feel he has micromanaged the generals who are leading our forces there , " Swannack said in the telephone interview .
" And I believe he has culpability associated with the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and , so , rather than admitting these mistakes , he continually justifies them to the press ... and that really disallows him from moving our strategy forward . "
Swannack , who served more than 30 years in the Army , said part of the problem at the Pentagon is Rumsfeld 's system of promoting senior leaders .
" If you understand what Secretary Rumsfeld has done in his time in the Pentagon , he personally is the one who selects the three - star generals to go forward to the president for the Senate to confirm . "
Swannack also criticized the way the war was being run before he retired .
In May 2004 , while still on active duty , Swannack told the Washington Post that he thought the United States was losing strategically in Iraq .
General defends secretary
The White House has defended Rumsfeld , saying he is " doing a very fine job . "
A former top aide to Gen. Tommy Franks , a former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East , also stepped forward Thursday to defend Rumsfeld .
" Dealing with Secretary Rumsfeld is like dealing with a CEO , " retired Marine Gen .
Mike DeLong told CNN's " American Morning " on Thursday .
" When you walk in to him , you 've got to be prepared , you 've got to know what you 're talking about .
If you do n't , you 're summarily dismissed .
But that 's the way it is , and he 's effective . "
DeLong was the deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command from 2000 to 2003 under Franks .
Calls for a fresh start
Batiste said this week that the United States needs " a fresh start " at the Pentagon .
" When decisions are made without taking into account sound military recommendations , sound military decision - making , sound planning , then we 're bound to make mistakes , " Batiste told " American Morning " on Wednesday .
" When we violate the principles of war with mass and unity of command and unity of effort , we do that at our own peril . "
( Watch as the Iraq veteran criticizes the Pentagon 's decision - making -- 1:30 )
In addition to commanding the 1st Infantry in Iraq , Batiste also was a senior adviser to former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , one of the chief architects of the U.S. - led invasion .
" You know , it speaks volumes that guys like me are speaking out from retirement about the leadership climate in the Department of Defense , " Batiste said .
Zinni , who also appeared Thursday on CNN , blamed Rumsfeld for " throwing away 10 years worth of planning . "
Those plans " had taken into account what we would face in an occupation of Iraq , " Zinni said .
" We grow up in a culture where accountability , learning to accept responsibility , admitting mistakes and learning from them was critical to us , " Zinni said .
" When we do n't see that happening it worries us .
Poor military judgment has been used throughout this mission . "
White House stands by Rumsfeld
Rumsfeld said earlier this week that he was n't stunned by the criticism from former military leaders .
He said there have been " hundreds and hundreds and hundreds " of generals during his latest tenure as defense secretary , and it was n't unusual for " several " to have unflattering opinions .
" And there 's nothing wrong with people having opinions , " he said Tuesday at a Pentagon briefing .
" And I think one ought to expect that .
When you 're involved in something that 's controversial , as certainly this war is , one ought to expect that .
It 's historic , it 's always been the case , and I see nothing really very new or surprising about it . "
( Watch Rumsfeld take on his critics -- 2:39 )
In February 2005 , Rumsfeld told CNN that he had twice offered President Bush his resignation during the height of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal , but the president refused to accept it .
In the White House briefing Thursday , spokesman Scott McClellan said Rumsfeld has the full support of the president .
" The president believes Secretary Rumsfeld is doing a very fine job during a challenging period in our nation 's history , " McClellan said .
Gen . Peter Pace , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , also defended Rumsfeld this week , telling reporters that " nobody works harder than he does . "
" People can question my judgment or his judgment , but they should never question the dedication , the patriotism and the work ethic of Secretary Rumsfeld , " Pace said Tuesday .

As Business Looks for Creative Thinkers — Look Out !
In this age of innovation , Business Schools look to fill theirs eats with more right brain creative people .
Folks are beginning to take notice of the value and power of the off the wall idea .
Business Week.com devotes an entire section to innovation and creativity and companies have titles such as Idea Czar on their organizational chart .
Tom_Peters asks “ Where are the freaks in your company ? ” and goes on to say that they ’re the ones who have the ideas .
Yeah , but how do you deal with someone who is one way one minute and the opposite the next ?
How do you tell a creative person from someone who just irritates you ?
What are the traits that creative folks have in common ?
Are we all creative ?
Is there anyone who ’s not ?
Can I boost my creativity ?
Am I a creative freak ?
Questions follow creativity — what is it , how does it work , and how do we access our Creativity at Work to make our brand and business stronger ?.
One Creativity Study
Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , the man who wrote Flow — also wrote the pivotal book on creativity — Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention .
The book covers a 5 - year study of 91 individuals over 60 years old , who had a creative impact on the world .
The first information that Professor Mihaly offered was this extended definition of creativity :
. . .
I distinguish at least three different phenomena that can legitmately be called by that name .
The first usage : wide spread in ordinary conversation , refers to persons who express unusual thoughts , who are interesting and stimulating — in short , to people who appear to be unusually bright , a brilliant converstionalist , a person with varied interests and a quick mind , may be called creative in this sense .
. . .
The second way the term can be used is to refer to people who experience the world in novel and original ways .
These are individuals whose perceptions are fresh , whose judgments are insightful , who may make important discoveries that only they know about .
I refer to these people as personally creative .
. . .
The final use of the term designates individuals who , like Leonardo , Edison , Picasso , or Einstein , have changed our culture in some important respect .
They are the creative ones without qualifications .
Because their achievements are by definition public , it is easier to write about them , and the persons included in my study belong in this group .
Do any of those definitions describe you ?
10 Reasons Creative Folks Make Us Crazy
I ’ve read this book several times , but each time that I show it to a friend , the first place that I turn to , the place where the book falls open , is to the 10 Dimensions of Complexity of the Highly Creative Personality .
That ’s what Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls them .
I call them the 10 Reasons that Creative People Drive Us Crazy .
Each item is a paradox , a complexity , a contradiction that ’s frustrating to others when they exist together at odds in one human being .
Take a look and then I ’ll tell you how knowing them has helped me keep my sanity , or at least relieve some stress .
1. Creative individuals have great physical energy , but they become extremely quiet when they are at rest .
This restful period can lead others to think that they are not feeling well or that they are unhappy , when the truth is they are fine .
2 . Creative folks tend to be both highly intelligent and naive at the same time .
3 . Creative people are disciplined and playful simultaneously .
In some creative people , this can mean that they are responsible and irresponsible at the same time as well .
4 . Creative minds move between a spectrum of fantasy and imagination and a firm grounding in reality .
They understand the present and need to keep in touch with the past .
5 . Creative individuals seem to be both introverted and extroverted , expressing both traits at once .
An image to explain this might be that they are shy showoffs , if you can picture that .
6 . Creative people are sincerely humble and extremely proud in a childlike way .
It requires ego to have a risky , fresh idea .
It takes self - doubt to hammer it out to a workable form .
7 . Creative folks do n’t feel as tied to gender roles .
They feel distinctly individual .
They do n’t feel the barriers of authority or the rules of what they are “ supposed to do . ”
8 . Creative individuals are thought to be rebellious .
Yet , in order to be creative one has to understand and have internalized the traditional culture .
Therefore creativity comes from deep roots in tradition .
Creative people are traditional and cutting edge .
9 . Creative people are deeply passionate about their work , yet can be extremely detached and objective when discussing it .
10 .
Creative people are highly open and sensitive , which exposes them to pain and suffering , but also allows them to feel higher values of joy and happiness .
I find that these 10 paradoxes explain a lot the creative folks I work with .
I also use them to understand what ’s going on when things are n’t going well , particularly when we have a creative project going full speed under tight deadlines .
That ’s when I review this list to look for pairs that are out of balance .
When I find and adjust the imbalances , the stressful moments fade away .
Why Know This ?
Beyond the obvious fact that knowing how we think helps us understand each other and that makes relationships work .
Knowing about creativity can actually enhance our own creativity and problem solving skills .
Even talking about creativity can make a person more creative .
Did you know that ?
Allowing our brains the room to stretch , to become flexible to take in new views and new ways of thinking is a critical skill and brand enhancing .
To argue for our abilities allows us to get closer to reaching them in the same ways that arguing for our limits makes them happen .
Some people think they ’re not creative , and offer quite creative reasons for why they ’re not .
What ’s your argument about creativity ?
Do you have any ?
Can you make what you have into a bigger creativity asset ?
Of course , we ’d find a creative way to be creative without driving people crazy .
Right ?
Be irresistible .

Does " Web 2.0 " mean anything ?
Till recently I thought it did n't , but the truth turns out to be more complicated .
Originally , yes , it was meaningless .
Now it seems to have acquired a meaning .
And yet those who dislike the term are probably right , because if it means what I think it does , we do n't need it .
I first heard the phrase " Web 2.0 " in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004 .
At the time it was supposed to mean using " the web as a platform , " which I took to refer to web - based applications . [ 1 ]
So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly led a session intended to figure out a definition of " Web 2.0 . "
Did n't it already mean using the web as a platform ?
And if it did n't already mean something , why did we need the phrase at all ?
Origins
Tim says the phrase " Web 2.0 " first arose in " a brainstorming session between O'Reilly and Medialive International . "
What is Medialive International ?
" Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences , " according to their site .
So presumably that 's what this brainstorming session was about .
O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web , and they were wondering what to call it .
I do n't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a new version of the web .
They just wanted to make the point that the web mattered again .
It was a kind of semantic deficit spending : they knew new things were coming , and the " 2.0 " referred to whatever those might turn out to be .
And they were right .
New things were coming .
But the new version number led to some awkwardness in the short term .
In the process of developing the pitch for the first conference , someone must have decided they 'd better take a stab at explaining what that " 2.0 " referred to .
Whatever it meant , " the web as a platform " was at least not too constricting .
The story about " Web 2.0 " meaning the web as a platform did n't live much past the first conference .
By the second conference , what " Web 2.0 " seemed to mean was something about democracy .
At least , it did when people wrote about it online .
The conference itself did n't seem very grassroots .
It cost $ 2800 , so the only people who could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies .
And yet , oddly enough , Ryan Singel 's article about the conference in Wired News spoke of " throngs of geeks . "
When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this , it was news to him .
He said he 'd originally written something like " throngs of VCs and biz dev guys " but had later shortened it just to " throngs , " and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into " throngs of geeks . "
After all , a Web 2.0 conference would presumably be full of geeks , right ?
Well , no .
There were about 7 .
Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a suit , a sight so alien I could n't parse it at first .
I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people " that guy looks just like Tim . "
" Oh , that 's Tim .
He bought a suit . "
I ran after him , and sure enough , it was .
He explained that he'd just bought it in Thailand .
The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble , full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup .
There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large number of people determined not to miss out .
Miss out on what ?
They did n't know .
Whatever was going to happen — whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be .
I would n't quite call it " Bubble 2.0 " just because VCs are eager to invest again .
The Internet is a genuinely big deal .
The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom .
It 's to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust , there would be a lot of growth in this area , just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression .
The reason this wo n't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone .
Venture investors are driven by exit strategies .
The reason they were funding all those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors ; they hoped to be laughing all the way to the bank .
Now that route is closed .
Now the default exit strategy is to get bought , and acquirers are less prone to irrational exuberance than IPO investors .
The closest you 'll get to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $ 580 million for Myspace .
That 's only off by a factor of 10 or so .
1. Ajax
Does " Web 2.0 " mean anything more than the name of a conference yet ?
I do n't like to admit it , but it 's starting to .
When people say " Web 2.0 " now , I have some idea what they mean .
And the fact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to mean something .
One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax , which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes .
Basically , what " Ajax " means is " Javascript now works . "
And that in turn means that web - based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones .
As you read this , a whole new generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax .
There has n't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared .
Even Microsoft sees it , but it 's too late for them to do anything more than leak " internal " documents designed to give the impression they 're on top of this new trend .
In fact the new generation of software is being written way too fast for Microsoft even to channel it , let alone write their own in house .
Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups before Google does .
And even that 's going to be hard , because Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago .
After all , Google Maps , the canonical Ajax application , was the result of a startup they bought .
So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference turned out to be partially right : web - based applications are a big component of Web 2.0 .
But I 'm convinced they got this right by accident .
The Ajax boom did n't start till early 2005 , when Google Maps appeared and the term " Ajax " was coined .
2. Democracy
The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy .
We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can surpass professionals , when they have the right kind of system to channel their efforts .
Wikipedia may be the most famous .
Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews , but they miss the critical point : it 's good enough .
And it 's free , which means people actually read it .
On the web , articles you have to pay for might as well not exist .
Even if you were willing to pay to read them yourself , you can't link to them .
They 're not part of the conversation .
Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as news .
I never look at any news site now except Reddit . [ 2 ]
I know if something major happens , or someone writes a particularly interesting article , it will show up there .
Why bother checking the front page of any specific paper or magazine ?
Reddit 's like an RSS feed for the whole web , with a filter for quality .
Similar sites include Digg , a technology news site that 's rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity , and del.icio.us , the collaborative bookmarking network that set off the " tagging " movement .
And whereas Wikipedia 's main appeal is that it 's good enough and free , these sites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human editors .
The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection of ideas , but their production .
I 've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people 's sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers and magazines .
And now I have independent evidence : the top links on Reddit are generally links to individual people 's sites rather than to magazine articles or news stories .
My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation .
Editors .
They control the topics you can write about , and they can generally rewrite whatever you produce .
The result is to damp extremes .
Editing yields 95th percentile writing — 95 % of articles are improved by it , but 5 % are dragged down .
5 % of the time you get " throngs of geeks . "
On the web , people can publish whatever they want .
Nearly all of it falls short of the editor - damped writing in print publications .
But the pool of writers is very , very large .
If it 's large enough , the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass the best in print . [ 3 ]
And now that the web has evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff , the web wins net .
Selection beats damping , for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones .
Even the startups are different this time around .
They are to the startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media .
During the Bubble , a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was blowing through several million dollars of VC money to " get big fast " in the most literal sense .
Now it means a smaller , younger , more technical group that just decided to make something great .
They 'll decide later if they want to raise VC - scale funding , and if they take it , they 'll take it on their terms .
3. Do n't Maltreat Users
I think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements of " Web 2.0 . "
I also see a third : not to maltreat users .
During the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high - handed with users .
And not just in obvious ways , like making them register , or subjecting them to annoying ads .
The very design of the average site in the late 90s was an abuse .
Many of the most popular sites were loaded with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the user the message : this is our site , not yours .
( There 's a physical analog in the Intel and Microsoft stickers that come on some laptops . )
I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving something away for free , and till recently a company giving anything away for free could be pretty high - handed about it .
Sometimes it reached the point of economic sadism : site owners assumed that the more pain they caused the user , the more benefit it must be to them .
The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com , where you can read the beginning of a story , but to get the rest you have sit through a movie .
At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord it over users .
Never make users register , unless you need to in order to store something for them .
If you do make users register , never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email ; in fact , do n't even ask for their email address unless you need it for some reason .
Do n't ask them any unnecessary questions .
Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it .
Never frame pages you link to , or open them in new windows .
If you have a free version and a pay version , do n't make the free version too restricted .
And if you find yourself asking " should we allow users to do x ? " just answer " yes " whenever you 're unsure .
Err on the side of generosity .
In How to Start a Startup I advised startups never to let anyone fly under them , meaning never to let any other company offer a cheaper , easier solution .
Another way to fly low is to give users more power .
Let users do what they want .
If you do n't and a competitor does , you 're in trouble .
iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense .
Finally you can buy individual songs instead of having to buy whole albums .
The recording industry hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible .
But it was obvious what users wanted , so Apple flew under the labels . [ 4 ]
Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5 .
Web 2.0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands giving away DRMless songs for free .
The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for free that competitors charge for .
During the 90s a lot of people probably thought we'd have some working system for micropayments by now .
In fact things have gone in the other direction .
The most successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff away for free .
Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad sites of the 90s , and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the previous generation of dating sites .
Serving web pages is very , very cheap .
If you can make even a fraction of a cent per page view , you can make a profit .
And technology for targeting ads continues to improve .
I would n't be surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an ad- supported freeBay ( or , more likely , gBay ) .
Odd as it might sound , we tell startups that they should try to make as little money as possible .
If you can figure out a way to turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry , so much the better , if all fifty million go to you .
Though indeed , making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the end , just as automating things often turns out to generate more jobs .
The ultimate target is Microsoft .
What a bang that balloon is going to make when someone pops it by offering a free web - based alternative to MS Office . [ 5 ]
Who will ?
Google ?
They seem to be taking their time .
I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea .
( How hard can it be ? )
The Common Thread
Ajax , democracy , and not dissing users .
What do they all have in common ?
I did n't realize they had anything in common till recently , which is one of the reasons I disliked the term " Web 2.0 " so much .
It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened to be new — that it did n't predict anything .
But there is a common thread .
Web 2.0 means using the web the way it 's meant to be used .
The " trends " we 're seeing now are simply the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models that got imposed on it during the Bubble .
I realized this when I read an interview with Joe Kraus , the co-founder of Excite . [ 6 ]
Excite really never got the business model right at all .
We fell into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it adopts the practices , the content , the business models of the old medium — which fails , and then the more appropriate models get figured out .
It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years after the Bubble burst .
But in retrospect , something was happening : the web was finding its natural angle of repose .
The democracy component , for example — that 's not an innovation , in the sense of something someone made happen .
That 's what the web naturally tends to produce .
Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop - like applications over the web .
That idea is almost as old as the web .
But the first time around it was co-opted by Sun , and we got Java applets .
Java has since been remade into a generic replacement for C++ , but in 1996 the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software .
Instead of desktop applications , you 'd run Java " applets " delivered from a server .
This plan collapsed under its own weight .
Microsoft helped kill it , but it would have died anyway .
There was no uptake among hackers .
When you find PR firms promoting something as the next development platform , you can be sure it 's not .
If it were , you would n't need PR firms to tell you , because hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it , the way sites like Busmonster used Google Maps as a platform before Google even meant it to be one .
The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of hackers have spontaneously started building things on top of it .
Mikey likes it .
There 's another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common .
Here 's a clue .
Suppose you approached investors with the following idea for a Web 2.0 startup : Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to " tag " content with descriptive tokens .
But there is also huge source of implicit tags that they ignore : the text within web links .
Moreover , these links represent a social network connecting the individuals and organizations who created the pages , and by using graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the reputation of each member .
We plan to mine the web for these implicit tags , and use them together with the reputation hierarchy they embody to enhance web searches .
How long do you think it would take them on average to realize that it was a description of Google ?
Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.0 : their core business sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.0 terms , " Do n't maltreat users " is a subset of " Do n't be evil , " and of course Google set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps .
Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used , and Google does .
That 's their secret .
They 're sailing with the wind , instead of sitting becalmed praying for a business model , like the print media , or trying to tack upwind by suing their customers , like Microsoft and the record labels . [ 7 ]
Google does n't try to force things to happen their way .
They try to figure out what 's going to happen , and arrange to be standing there when it does .
That 's the way to approach technology — and as business includes an ever larger technological component , the right way to do business .
The fact that Google is a " Web 2.0 " company shows that , while meaningful , the term is also rather bogus .
It 's like the word " allopathic . "
It just means doing things right , and it's a bad sign when you have a special word for that .
Notes
[ 1 ] From the conference site , June 2004 : " While the first wave of the Web was closely tied to the browser , the second wave extends applications across the web and enables a new generation of services and business opportunities . "
To the extent this means anything , it seems to be about web - based applications .

Or it may be to write it all yourself .

I guess I ’d better give up now .
Guido announced at SciPy that Django is the “ standard ” web framework for Python .
How ’s that for a first two sentences of a blog post ?
Of course , only one of those two sentences is accurate .
According to the blog post I linked to above , Guido “ hopes that Django and TurboGears will converge ” .
Sigh .
Someone please tell me that Guido has n’t fallen for the “ Python is losing to Ruby because Ruby only has one web framework ” argument .
I ’m pretty sure he has n’t fallen for that argument , but just generally thinks it would be a good thing .
Django and TurboGears converging would be very much akin to Python and Ruby converging ( Tim O’Reilly would probably advocate that , since book sales indicate that Python is waning ) .
They address similar problem spaces and even have some similar approaches in spots , but that ’s really a superficial view of the whole .
Guido ’s attraction to Django started with Django ’s template engine .
He compared it with Cheetah and said , toward the bottom :
I did n’t find too many other templating solutions .
TurboGears uses Kid which XML - based , like Nevow , TAL etc. IMO these are no contenders because they are XML - based .
As the Django folks mention , they use templates to generate non-HTML text files as well .
And even if they could be used for this , the verbosity of the XML syntax and the inability to do a proper if - then - else in XML make template writing using XML a non-starter .
For generating HTML , I find Kid to be a natural fit .
I think it ’s more natural than TAL and Nevow because the programmer just puts standard Python expressions in the right places in their templates ( rather than some other kind of expression ) .
Being able to write good , clean XHTML and produce fine HTML for the browser is a great feature and a great way to work .
In practice , because I do n’t go overboard writing code in templates , so if - then - else has not been a real problem .
And , Markup shows a fairly clean way to do it anyhow .
And , certainly , generating non-HTML text files with Kid is suboptimal .
First of all , I ’d say again that this is not actually a big problem in practice .
Seriously .
It ’s just not something that comes up much on the mailing list .
Besides , TurboGears makes it trivial to use one of many other template languages ( including Django ’s ) for generating non-HTML formats .
In fact , you can even do it in one method :
@expose ( " myproj.templates.showstuff " ) @expose ( " cheetah:myproj.templates.textstuff " , accept_format= " text / plain " ) def index ( self ) : return dict ( foo = " 5 " )
When you hit that controller method , by default you ’ll get that dictionary plugged into the Kid template to produce HTML .
If your browser sends an “ Accept : text / plain ” , TG will have Cheetah use the same code to generate a plain text view .
Nice , huh ?
TurboGears has a collection of APIs and idioms that I think make it great fun to work with , and I know others agree with me .
Django has its own collection of features that others like working with .
That ’s fine by me , and it ’s not likely to change any time soon .
With TurboGears , I definitely do not suffer from Not Invented Here .
In Django ’s defense , at the time they started they simply did n’t have the options available that I did when I started TurboGears .
But , the Python community continues to evolve , innovate and produce incredible products .
TG will benefit greatly from these projects , but it ’s unclear that Django would follow suit .
Mike Bayer ’s SQLAlchemy , simply put , kicks the butt of Django ’s ORM ( and that of Rails , as well ) .
SQLAlchemy is already a solid second - class citizen in TurboGears , and will be a first - class citizen soon enough .
Christopher Lenz saw the good in Kid and thought he could build a better Kid with Markup .
Though it ’s a young project , it looks great and has impressive results .
Julian Krause liked CherryPy ’s quick - and - easy URL traversal , but wanted to break it down to a WSGI core so he created RhubarbTart .
Meanwhile , Robert Brewer has completely retooled CherryPy ’s easy “ filters ” feature for CherryPy 3.0 .
And , for those who like their URL traversal in separate files with regexes , there ’s always Ben Bangert ’s Routes .
All of the things that I mentioned in that paragraph are not vaporware .
With the exception of RhubarbTart , these are things that you can use with TurboGears now and that will likely be included directly with a future TG release .
TG has had code contributions from quite a few people , but these things are all steps forward that have occurred completely outside of TurboGears but remain a natural fit for TG .
At EuroPython , during the Web Framework Shootout , we ( Simon Willison , Phillip von Weitershausen and I ) were taking questions from the audience and someone asked if we thought that TurboGears and Django would merge .
My response now is the same as it was then : not very likely .
Both projects have their own ideas and approaches and trying to force fit them just would n’t work .

These celebrated Bay Area writers feel expansive in their compact , self - decorated work spaces 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
I asked Marin writer Anne Lamott and three other Bay Area authors why they and so many other writers work in rooms that are literally closets , and none of them work in , say , ballrooms .
" Small spaces are more like cribs , " Lamott said .
" You feel much safer .
To write in a ballroom would be like trying to sleep under a circus tent .
Anyone in his or her right mind would have a nervous breakdown . "
Lamott has written six novels and four works of nonfiction , including " Operating Instructions , " an account of the year after she gave birth to her now - teenage son , Sam ; " Bird by Bird , " on writing ; and two books on faith , " Traveling Mercies " and " Plan B : Further Thoughts on Faith . "
She and Sam live in a house on the side of an oak - studded Marin County hill .
Her office is a tiny room under the living room .
Lamott says she loves her office because it 's the first one she ever had and it reflects who she is .
" It looks just like me -- fabulous , disorganized , slightly goofy , intense , with lots of poems and religious stuff , " she said .
There 's a huge table next to her desk with several stacks of paper that include notes for writing projects .
There are framed photos of her on the small bookshelves next to the desk as well as shots of her boyfriend , Rory .
Lamott 's windows are filled with crazily out - of - control plants -- flowering potato plants , Japanese maples , a loquat tree .
" Or a kumquat tree , I can never remember the difference , " she said .
Hummingbirds stop by all day .
She planted everything so she could have a beautiful living screen between her office and the house next door .
Her desk is nearly a hundred years old .
Her grandfather , Willis Lamott , bought it in Tokyo in 1919 , when he and his wife ( parents of Lamott 's father and Aunt Eleanor ) were Presbyterian missionaries .
It is huge and ungainly , and has always been in the family -- her father , Ken Lamott , inherited it when her grandfather died , when she was 6 , and wrote most of his books on it .
She inherited it when her father died 26 years ago .
She 's written all of her books on it , too , except for " Hard Laughter . "
" I used to use an Adler portable that my parents got me for my 18th birthday , but for the last 10 years , I have had a series of Macs .
The one I am using now looks like an iMac , but is white , and is for people like me who have extremely -- almost aggressively -- limited computer skills , " she said .
On one side of the wall beside her computer she has a print of a beautiful painting of Jesus -- although there is some controversy as to whether it is Jesus in a slightly femme robe , or Mary with 5 o'clock shadow .
She does n't actually care who it is because " the face and eyes are so exquisitely kind and beautiful , " she said .
" The face is very Jewish ; I look at it all day , every day , " Lamott said .
On the other side of the computer , she has a poster of the Cellist of Sarajevo , Vedran Smailovic , in a tuxedo , sitting with his cello in the bombed - out ruins of Sarajevo , where he showed up during the war to play his beautiful music almost every day .
There are huge sheets of graph paper taped to every wall , with ideas scribbled on them , stories she wants to get to , ideas for endings , openings and structure , lines she loves and hopes to use somewhere .
She draws big circles in a line , to represent lily pads , so she can plot a story 's trajectory .
The first circle is what belongs near the beginning , the last circle is where she thinks the story might come to some sort of organic end , and the lily pads in between are places where she wants to spend time .
Inside each circle , she scribbles down some of that section 's details , moments and content .
Lamott used to have a clothesline strung from one side of the wall above her computer to the other , on which she would clip bits of manuscripts that she was working on , but she took it down when she painted the office ( a soft , buttery Buddhist yellow ) five years ago , and she keeps forgetting to put it back up .
" Menopause has not increased my focus and memory as much as I had been hoping , " Lamott said .
" The clothesline used to help me a lot because it was like hanging out clothing to dry , only it was my word fabric , like squares for a patchwork quilt .
I could look up all day and see what stages various sections of the book were at .
I stole the idea from ( Marin novelist ) Martin Cruz Smith about 15 years ago . "
Amy Tan
" Joy Luck Club " author Tan used to write in a spacious room with three bay windows that overlook the Golden Gate Bridge and the sailboats on the bay , but she hung shades to block that view and finally retreated to a study off the stairs so small that she can entertain only one visitor at a time .
The room is kept dim --
Tan finds even the light from a small south - facing window distracting .
Tan and her husband of 31 years , attorney Lou DeMattei , have lived since 1990 in one of six units in a brick building in Presidio Heights .
" My writing space needs are mirrored in this quote from Matisse , " Tan said : " ' We have acquired a notion of limitless space , but we also find solace in the limited space of a room in our home full of the knickknacks that have accumulated in it through the years . ' "
The aforementioned knickknacks are everywhere on Tan 's gleaming built - in shelves -- ebony figures , some trinkets blessed by the Dalai Lama , a Zen saying , a Chinese doctor 's hat .
Tan is small and shining in purple silk .
In her cradle - like Stokke chair , flown in from Norway to pamper a sore back , she can tip forward to type her prizewinning novels about Chinese mothers and their American daughters , backward to think -- perhaps about the libretto she is helping to write for an opera to be made of her novel " The Bonesetter 's Daughter . "
Behind the computer is a frame containing several black - and - white photos of her mother in Shanghai .
" I would grab that if someone yelled fire , " she said .
Her mother , Daisy , escaped on the last boat out of Shanghai before the Communist takeover in 1949 , leaving behind three daughters before coming here to start another family .
On the desk is a copy of Gus Lee 's " China Boy , " a memoir set in the Panhandle : " I call him my brother because his father once lived with my mother . "
Born in Oakland in 1952 , Tan got started on her career when a story that got her into the Squaw Valley Community of Writers became the 1989 best - seller " The Joy Luck Club . "
Her latest novel , " Saving Fish From Drowning , " was released last month .
Although the office is amazingly neat for having so many objects in it , Tan apologizes for the mess and later e-mails to say that she has reorganized her shelves since the visit , " so that when you first glance at them you will be impressed at my complete collection of books by J.M. Coetzee and other erudite literary tomes , whereas the books on things like ' Keep Your Brain Alive ' are discreetly out of view . "
Lemony Snicket
If we cross the Panhandle and ascend to the upper Haight , we find 35 - year - old Daniel Handler , who shows up at book events to speak for the perennially ill Lemony Snicket .
He is squeezed into a room of his otherwise large , light - filled house that would have been called " the fainting room " by its Edwardian original inhabitants .
Snicket , by the way , is a pen name he adopted when researching right - wing organizations whose receptionists asked him for his name .
Handler is eleven - thirteenths of the way through a planned 13 - volume gothic marathon called " A Series of Unfortunate Events , " on the woes of three orphaned children , Violet , Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire .
He delivered the first manuscript to his editor with a note that said , " You 'll love this ... the parents die on the first page . "
" There 's often the assumption that I must be cackling as I write , but actually it takes a lot out of me , " he said .
" I 'll meet friends for drinks and they 'll have to remind me that these are fictional orphans . "
Handler 's desk is a gynecologist 's table ( minus the stirrups ) , an effect that recalls Flaubert 's advice : " Be regular and ordinary in your habits , like a petit bourgeois , so you may be violent and original in your work . "
Handler does n't understand the notion that some writers have trouble with the stay - at - home - all - day - and - write notion .
" If you did n't like sitting around writing , why would you be a writer ? "
In back of his chair is a low row of the volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary , which he was given after he agreed to appear in an ad for the company and say what his favorite word was .
" I chose ' defenestration , ' " he recalled .
" I was embarrassed when Doris Lessing chose ' justice . ' "
Why not just look words up online ?
" If you 're a word geek this is better , " he said .
To demonstrate , Handler picked up Vol. 10 and read at random from Page 840 that " the first appearance of the open - toed sandal " was in a book by Raymond Chandler .
A black file cabinet is stuffed with the tiny notebooks Handler uses to jot down ideas .
It belonged to his wife 's grandfather and still has his labels on it : " Sewing , Sun cream , Bulbs , Shaver , Soap . "
Handler , often seen about town in his trademark baggy linen suit , is as local as it gets :
He was born in San Francisco in 1970 and raised on Balboa Terrace , and his parents met at the San Francisco Opera when his mother was singing " Aida . "
Under his real name he has published two books for adults , including " The Basic Eight , " which takes place in a school that resembles Handler 's alma mater , Lowell High School .
Lisa Brown
His wife , Lisa Brown , has her own office several streets away in the basement of a house the couple owns and rents out .
They have been married seven years and have known each other since college , when Handler had a seizure and passed out in Lisa 's lap in a Chaucer class at Wesleyan University in Connecticut .
Brown 's office is bright and airy , as befits a writer who is also an illustrator .
There 's a dress form in the corner .
She 's working on a primer that tells babies how to mix drinks , an idea that began when their 21 - month - old son , Otto , was born and Dad showed up at the hospital with bottles of vodka and vermouth and two martini glasses .
Brown has three books coming out for the holiday season , two for toddlers or , actually , for the parents of toddlers : " Baby Mix Me a Drink " and " Baby Make Me Breakfast . "
They are about putting one 's infants to some use .
The other is a book that she did with Handler called " How to Dress for Every Occasion by the Pope . "
Brown illustrated and designed it under the name Sarah " Pinkie " Bennett , and Handler wrote the text under the name the Pope .
It 's a book of fashion tips .
A draft study commissioned by the Australian Attorney General 's office finds that the music and software industries attributes sales losses to piracy without any evidence to back their claims , The Australian reports .
According to a draft report by the Australian Institute of Criminology , the music industry can't explain how it arrives at its statistics for staggering losses through piracy .
The Business Software Association 's claim of $ 361 m per year in lost sales is " unverified and epistemologically unreliable " , the report says .
" Of greatest concern is the potentially unqualified use of these statistics in courts of law , " the authors observe .
According to The Australian , the study is due to be revised after the institute 's senior members disagreed with its conclusions .
" We have an extensive quality control system in the institute , so that drafts are read by most senior staff , " principal criminologist Russell Smith told the paper .
It will be interesting to compare the final revision with the current draft to learn if the language is merely softened or if the aforementioned " quality control system " should involve reaching conclusions that the report 's purchasers would prefer . ®
Yet a small but growing number of such parents are abandoning even some of the top- performing public schools in the region .
In school districts like Scarsdale , N.Y. , and Montclair , N.J. , where high test scores and college admission rates have built national reputations and propelled real estate prices upward , these demanding families say they were disappointed by classes that were too crowded , bare - bones arts and sports programs , and an emphasis on standardized testing rather than creative teaching .
Some are private school graduates themselves who , try as they might , feel guilty giving their offspring anything less .
Others were spoiled by their children ’s experiences in private school in preschool or the early grades before leaving the city .
Still others simply found that public school programs in suburbia did not live up to their promise .
So they forsake city living to wind up shouldering the double burden of high taxes and tuition bills .
Or they end up moving back to Manhattan or commuting with children in tow to the city ’s private schools .
“ It was not part of our plan at all , and I ’m not sure how sustainable it is , ” said Tracy Fauver , of Bedford , N.Y. , whose three children attend the Rippowam Cisqua School in the town ; tuition there runs from $ 17,500 to more than $ 26,000 per student .
She said her husband ’s Ford Focus had become something of a joke parked alongside his co-workers ’
Mercedes - Benzes and BMWs , as the family has forgone fancy cars and vacations to afford the tuition .
Headmasters and admissions officers at more than a dozen prestigious private schools in the region — including Rye Country Day in Westchester , the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and the Westminster School in Simsbury , Conn . — say they have seen steady increases in applications in recent years .
Private - school placement consultants in New York City and Westchester track similar trends : one such company , Manhattan Private School Advisors , now counts 325 suburban families among its clients , more than three times as many as three years ago , while another , Abacus Guide Educational Consulting , gets five calls a week from Westchester families , compared to one a week two years ago .

Is Iran Driving the Conflict ?
People outraged by the hundreds of Lebanese killed in Israeli bombing raids over the past week may be tempted to see in the U.S. rush to ship Israel extra supplies of bombs and missiles to rain down on Lebanon , and in its diplomatic effort to prolong rather than end the conflict in the hope that Israel can achieve its battlefield objectives , evidence that the offensive is part of another club - footed U.S. effort to remake the region .
But it ’s not that simple .
In fact , it may be no more true than the idea that because Iran funds , trains and arms Hizballah , it was Tehran that took the decision to escalate the conflict on Israel ’s northern border .
Client states and proxy forces tend to act autonomously of their backers , even if they share many of the same objectives — if they did n’t have their own separate interests they would n’t be proxies or clients , they would simply be satellites .
It ’s well established that Israel acts independently of the U.S. , and what distinguishes the current U.S. administration from its predecessors is the extent to which it simply follows Israel ’s lead .
Smart and well - informed Iran - watchers such as Trita Parsi challenge the the conventional wisdom in much of the media that Iran took the decision to seize the two Israeli soldiers , and suggest the focus on Iran comes from those who would like to see the U.S. take on Iran .
I spoke to Parsi last week , and he suggested that the escalation in Lebanon actually undermined Iran ’s interests , and that Hizballah acts autonomously from its backer , particularly on a tactical level .
“ On grander strategic actions , Hizballah would probably seek consent or approval from Tehran , but not necessarily on tactical operations .
And its not clear that they saw the capture of those soldiers as having strategic consequences , or whether they just saw it as a tactical opportunity to press for the release of prisoners . ”
This argument is echoed by Mark Perry , a U.S. analyst involved in ongoing talks with Hizballah .
Hezbollah and Israel stand along this border every day observing each other through binoculars and waiting for an opportunity to kill each other .
They are at war .
They have been for 25 years , no one ever declared a cease - fire between them . …
They stand on the border every day and just wait for an opportunity .
And on Tuesday morning there were two Humvees full of Israeli soldiers , not under observation from the Israeli side , not under covering fire , sitting out there all alone .
The Hezbollah militia commander just could n’t believe it — so he went and got them .
The Israeli captain in charge of that unit knew he had really screwed up , so he sent an armored personnel carrier to go get them in hot pursuit , and Hezbollah led them right through a minefield .
Now if you ’re sitting in Tehran or Damascus or Beirut , and you are part of the terrorist Politburo so to speak , you have a choice .
With your head sunk in your hands , thinking “ Oh my God , ” you can either give [ the kidnapped soldiers ] back and say “ Oops , sorry , wrong time ” or you can say , “ Hey , this is war . ”
It is absolutely ridiculous to believe that the Hezbollah commander on the ground said Tuesday morning , “ Go get two Israeli soldiers , would you please ? ”
Parsi picks up the argument : “ If Iran had encouraged Hizballah to do this , it ’s not clear why Iran not doing more to help Hizballah — specifically , the fact that some of the stronger missiles that they have in Lebanon , such as the Fajr and the Zelzal , are not being used .
And there ’s also the fact that Iran made a stern warning that if Syria is attacked , Iran would come to its defense .
But why did it not issue the same warning for an attack on Lebanon ?
Part of the reason may be that Iran did n’t actually order this operation .
Because if they had ordered Hizballah to do this , and then left it to face Israel ’s wrath alone , it would send a devastating message to other allied groups in the Arab world that if you do Iran ’s bidding , it will abandon you to face the consequences . ”
Whatever the truth about how Hizballah made its decision , what remains clear is that the U.S. policy for dealing with the crisis , which largely involves trying to secure on the diplomatic front what Israel is trying to achieve on the battlefield , is based on a series of linked fallacies .
The result will be that the crisis is prolonged , at a cost of hundreds or thousands more lives , and that its resolution will leave the U.S. position in the Middle East even weaker than it is today .
Flawed Assumption # 1 : Hizballah Can Be Militarily Eliminated
We ’ve dealt with this one in a previous post , so do n’t need to dwell .
Already , it ’s clear that Israel has failed to achieve that objective from the air , and must now send in ground troops — in the process turning more than half a million Lebanese into refugees .
Of course , this is how Hizballah cut its teeth , fighting Israeli troops in southern Lebanon .
Once in , Israel may struggle to get its troops out without it appearing to be another victory for Hizballah .
Even if it pushes Hizballah back , the chances of it destroying the movement as a fighting force in this way are slim .
And the prevailing sentiment among Lebanese will ensure it has a steady stream of recruits ready to fight the invader .
The U.S. has learned in Iraq that the insurgency cannot be militarily defeated .
Israel has learned the same thing in the West Bank and Gaza .
Yet , it is still willing to risk inflaming the mass of the Lebanese population against it by trying to do the same in Lebanon .
It ’s unlikely to succeed militarily , meaning it will have to settle for some form of truce that will look like a defeat for Israel and the U.S. because Hizballah will have survived .
Flawed Assumption # 2 : If Lebanon is Made to Pay a Heavy Price , It Will Turn on Hizballah
When you hear the Lebanese Defense Minister warn that the Lebanese Army will fight on the side of Hizballah against any Israeli invasion , you get the sense that things may not be working according to Israel ’s plan .
And why would it ?
It ’s Bin Laden logic , after all , echoing the idea that if al - Qaeda blows up enough stuff on the American mainland , it can force the U.S. to withdraw from the Middle East and stop backing Israel .
Obviously , Americans are not going to allow people blowing up their cities to dictate to them how they should conduct their affairs ; why does anyone think the Lebanese are any different ?
People do n’t like being bombed , and they do n’t like being told what to do by the bombers .
The statements of the Lebanese government brought into being in part by U.S. backing reflect an acute sense of having been betrayed by Washington , which is doing its best to prolong the punishment of Lebanon by running diplomatic interference for Israel .
I suspect the scale of what the Israelis have wrought in Lebanon may actually help ensure Hizballah ’s survival .
The message to moderate , pro-Western Arab politicians is simple : The U.S. will back you when you ’re fighting Syria or the Islamists , but if you ’re unfortunate enough to fall afoul of Israel , you ’re on your own .
The political consensus that this escalation will leave behind in the rubble of Lebanon will be far more antagonistic to Israel and wary of — even hostile to — the U.S. than the one that preceded it .
Flawed Assumption # 3 ( My personal favorite ! ) : The Crisis Offers an Opportunity for the U.S. to Rally Arab Support Against Hizballah and Iran
Condi Rice , we are told , is heading to the Middle East to “ build an umbrella of Arab allies against Hizballah ” .
Just listen to a White House official explaining her mission to the Telegraph : “ She ’s not going to come home with a ceasefire but stronger ties to the Arab world .
It ’s going to allow us to say that America is n’t going to put up with this and we have Arab friends that are against you terrorists .
What we want is our Arab allies standing against Hezbollah and against Iran , since there is no one who does n’t think Iran is behind this .
We ’re going to say to Hezbollah and the terrorist groups , ‘ This will not stand . ’ ”
Can someone please get me some of what these people are smoking ?
I , too , would love to escape , as they seem to do so frequently , from the squalor of reality …
Israeli bombs are killing innocent Arabs by the hundred , while the U.S. supplies the bombs and demands that the Israelis be given more time , and the Arab leaders are going to stand by Israel against Hizballah .
My , oh my …
No lack of chutzpah in the Bush administration , I ’ll grant you that .
But the Arab regimes learned long ago to stop taking them seriously , as they did on Iraq , and then on Hamas .
But this will be fun to watch , because the Arab citizenry is so outraged at what the Israelis are doing , and at the feeble posture of the pro-U.S. Arab regimes like Jordan , Saudi Arabia and Egypt when it comes to doing anything to help fellow Arabs under attack by Israel , that I suspect they will feel compelled to publicly rebuke Condi over the U.S. failure to press for a ceasefire , if only as a symbolic gesture for the benefit of their own public .
The U.S. is going in saying Hizballah is the problem , not Israel .
The Arabs will tell her that Hizballah is a problem , but not the problem ; and that the Hizballah problem can only really be fixed if the Israel problem is fixed .
Until Israel is ready to accept the Arab League proposals to settle all differences with the Arab world on the basis of the 1967 borders , these crises will continue to erupt .
Of course , Condi may be prevented from embarrassing herself if she heeds the Saudis , who initiated Sunday talks at the White House to discuss the crisis .
Safe bet is that the Saudis are going insist that the fighting be stopped , and that a grand bargain be pursued .
Flawed Assumption # 4 : Syrian Cooperation Can Be Acquired Cost - Free
A spinoff of flawed assumption # 3 is the idea that Syria can be persuaded to break from Iran and Hizballah by a combination of threats from Washington and persuasion by other Arab leaders .
Uh , guys , what ’s in it for Syria ?
And that ’s a really important question , since Syria has been largely unmoved through two or three years of threats and harangues from Washington over its behavior on the Iraqi border , and over its murder of Rafik Hariri in Lebanon .
That may be because Syria know that the U.S. and Israel know that there ’s a limit on how far the regime in Damascus can be pushed , for the simple reason that the U.S. and Israel do n’t want the regime in Damascus to fall — and the Israelis are explicit about this — because if it did , it would be replaced by the Muslim Brotherhood .
So Bashar Assad will stiffen his jaw and wait .
And what he may wait for will be to hear a phrase that has n’t been uttered in Washington for at least six years now — “ Golan Heights . ”
Syria relationship with Hizballah was premised on the fact that it had no military capacity to put pressure on Israel directly , and it saw in the Lebanese militia a form of proxy leverage to press Israel for the return of Syrian territory captured in 1967 .
It was assumed in the talks that went on through the 90s between Israel and Syria on this question that Hizballah ’s capacity to attack Israel would be spiked once there was a deal .
And I suspect that until the Syrians see some of their concerns addressed , particularly the fate of the Golan Heights , they wo n’t see any incentive to help out .
Flawed Assumption # 5 : The Middle East ’s Crises Can be Addressed in Piecemeal Fashion
By now , you ’d think the Bush Administration would have learned that everything in the Middle East is connected .
It could just as easily pay a price in the lives of its soldiers on the streets of East Baghdad as it could in its diplomatic standing in Beirut for the stance it has taken on the Israeli action .
Indeed , the crises in Gaza and Lebanon are both products of the Bush administration eschewing the traditional Pax Americana policies of its predecessors , and instead imagining it could remake the region on its own ( and Israel ’s ) terms .
Intead , in Iraq it created a vacuum filled by Iran ; in the Palestinian territories it created a vacuum filled by Hamas ; its handling of the Syria - Lebanon issue left the field open to Hizballah ; and its refusal to engage the “ grand bargain ” discussion initiated by Iran ’s leadership in 2003 has limited its ability to manage the crises created by Iran ’s growing regional assertiveness .
The idea that the region is going to fall in line behind a U.S. - Israeli campaign against Hizballah is ludicrous .
Sure , the Arab regimes have plenty of problems with Hizballah , but they ca n’t get behind the U.S. until a peace process that will get Israel back to some version of its 67 borders is under way , and other vital interests are addressed and engaged .
Flawed Assumption # 6 : Israeli Interests are U.S. Interests
The U.S. has a principle alliance with Israel , but it also has an interest in stability in the Middle East , for reasons of oil and security , on the basis of a Pax Americana .
That has long been the lodestar of U.S. policy , balancing Israeli interests with those of its Arab clients .
But the Bush administration abandoned that policy , tilting wholesale behind Israel on most tactical questions and abadoning its peacemaking role .
But Israel does n’t necessarily need stability , democracy and prosperity in the Arab world .
The “ iron wall ” doctrine of state building of Vladimir Jabotinsky , ideological icon of Ariel Sharon , is that Israel ’s survival depends on crushing and humiliating its Arab neighbors .
The idea was implied in Ariel Sharon ’s mission - statement interview with Haaretz in April , 2001 :
Haaretz :
If an agreement on ending the conflict with the Palestinians is not possible and if a peace agreement with the Syrians is dangerous , what alternative are you proposing ?
What hope ?
“ From the strategic point of view , I think that it ’s possible that in another 10 or 15 years the Arab world will have less ability to strike at Israel than it has today .
That is because Israel will be a country with a flourishing economy , whereas the Arab world may be on the decline .
True , there is no guarantee of this , but it is definitely possible that because of technological and environmental developments , the price of oil will fall and the Arab states will find themselves in a crisis situation , while Israel will be strengthened .
The conclusion is that time is not working against us and therefore it is important to achieve solutions that will take place across a lengthy period .
Israel ’s leaders — at least those of the right , who took power in 2000 with the express objective of putting an end to the peace process — have long seen Arab decline as to their advantage .
Misguided as it is , the strategic doctrine that has guided Israel ’s current leaders is very comfortable if there ’s a civil war in Lebanon or in Gaza , or if the Arab leadership remains in its present enfeebled state .
Indeed , Israel takes an indulgently amused view of the U.S. obsession with promoting Arab democracy .
The actions that Israel has taken in Lebanon will have consequences for that country , and perhaps the wider Arab world , that Israel is content to accept , but that spell disaster for a Pax Americana .
Josh Petersen on Ben Franklin and the Web today Jason 2 comments Latest by Tony Eric
Josh Petersen , typist at the Robot Co-op , goes for it and I think does a pretty good job of making some creative connections between Ben Franklin , the age of the amateur , and what ’s going on with the web today .
Listen to the MP3 ( 17.5 MB MP3 ) of his talk at Idea Day in Seattle .
An especially great insight was tearing apart the word “ company ” and finding that it really means “ who you want to break bread with . ” I find that to be true .
He also spends some time talking about why they built 43 things , People , and Places .
It ’s always a pleasure listening to someone who knows why they ’re doing what they ’re doing , but also acknowledges that sometimes they have no clue what they ’re doing .
Josh is a smart , down - to - earth , humble guy worth learning from .
So News Corp. has cancelled O.J. Simpson 's " If I Did It " and the companion television specials .
While I respect the Brown and Goldman families ' desire not to see the tragedies they suffered trotted out as entertainment , there is a part of me that wishes we had gotten to experience Mr. Simpson 's confession at first hand .
I , for one , would have felt a certain sense of closure .
Click Image to Enlarge Vince Bucci / AP O.J. Simpson holds up his hands before the jury after putting on a new pair of gloves similar to the bloody gloves  during his double - murder trial in Los Angeles in the summer of 1995 .
" The response to his case among many black people was my first encounter with a tacit orthodoxy , " writes John McWhorter , " that if there is a conflict between facts and reminding America of racism , then the facts must be treated as beside the point . "
It was O.J. , after all , who made me un -P.C .
Before O.J. , I was not a particularly political person .
The response to his case among many black people was my first encounter with a tacit orthodoxy : that if there is a conflict between facts and reminding America of racism , then the facts must be treated as beside the point .
Throughout 1995 , we all watched the prosecution present a blindingly clear case for murder .
Footprints in blood from a rare pair of shoes Mr. Simpson denied wearing only to have people dig up photos of him in them .
A mysterious gash on his left hand , a mysterious trail of blood to the left of the footprints .
Blood in the Bronco .
When told that his wife had been murdered , Mr. Simpson never asked about his children .
And on and on .
And yet I gradually realized that the black people refusing to admit that Mr. Simpson could have been guilty were not just scattered cranks , but were legions of perfectly sane people , often with advanced degrees .
These were people I knew .
I will never forget the shock of seeing so many people I would never have suspected of being able to think in this way constructing elaborate scenarios as to how blood could have been planted here or there , or insisting that Mark Fuhrman 's comfort with the N - word justified assuming that the Los Angeles Police Department had been out to " get " Mr. Simpson despite having coddled him for years .
In other words , pretending that Mr. Simpson was innocent was normal .
The attorney for Ronald Goldman in the civil trial , Daniel Petrocelli , has recalled that black and white people on a mock jury similarly considered Mr. Simpson guilty when they viewed a film of Mr. Simpson 's obviously coached plea of innocence 
" I Want to Tell You "  but then blacks exonerated him when listening to white lawyers arguing for his guilt .
Black people could n't pretend to believe Mr. Simpson when the man himself , as an individual , denied his guilt .
For too many black people , the Simpson case was n't about the truth .
It was about settling old scores  or it was idle catharsis , otherwise known as a cheap thrill .
I know  the Los Angeles Police Department had given the black community ample reason to resent them in decades past , and I mean in countless episodes much less subject to alternate interpretation than the Rodney King incident .
Those interested might look up , say , the Ronald Stokes killing of 1962 .
But there was no graceful room for vigilante justice when it came to a case as plain as Mr. Simpson's .
Frankly , the fashion for treating him as a victim made black America look dumb .
Okay , there was the shrunken glove and another hair or two slightly out of place .
But no cute rhymes about fitting and acquitting would have held any sway over black juries if Joe Namath had been married to a black woman and had killed her .
Suddenly all would have understood the simple fact that , as Vincent Bugliosi pointed out in his masterful book about the case , " Outrage , " an argument is not like a chain in which one weak link renders it useless , but it is like a rope , in which a few loose fibers leave it intact .
Of course , as the pile of evidence reached a certain empyrean height , there were those who could not help starting to feel a little queasy mouthing the established lines .
Enter , then , a new line that became common , " I 'm tired of the whole thing . "
Interesting , though , how the same kinds of people never said that about Tawana Brawley , and are unlikely to say it now about George Allen or , most recently , about Michael " Kramer " Richards 's stand - up routine .
The O.J. show was , in the end , all about the idea that for black people , there is something we must " get " : that the tragedies of our past mean that standards for us are different in the present .
This , then , is why we exempt ourselves from serious competition ( bravo to Michigan voters , by the way ) .
This was why black linguists , just as the civil trial was winding down , as it happens , were telling interviewers that Black English is an African language .
This is why black rappers ' murder - happy , misogynistic lyrics are celebrated as progressive discourse .
Hence Howard University students cheering at the exoneration of a murderer despite his avowed position on his dating preferences being " I do n't shovel coal . "
We are to " get " that for black people , judgment must always be an in - group affair , filtered through the maternal .
We are not to be subjected to public standards of evaluation .
We are poster children .
That is , eternally children .
Well , I did n't " get " it then and I do n't now .
It makes me , as they say , wanna holler .
It 's the kind of thing that makes you wake up one day with a second career .
Readable s-expressions and sweet - expressions : Getting the infix fix and fewer parentheses in Lisp - like languages
This page is obsolete ; see http://readable.sourceforge.net instead .
Many people find Lisp s-expressions hard to read as a programming notation .
This paper discusses various ways to extend / modify s-expressions so they can be more readable without losing their power ( such as quasiquoting , macros , and easily - manipulated program fragments ) .
The goal is a notation that can be trivially translated to and from traditional s-expression notation ( both by computer and in people ’s heads ) , and is n't dependent on a particular underlying semantic .
The paper identifies and discusses three approaches that seem particularly promising : indentation , name - prefixing ( so func( x y ) is the same as ( func x y ) ) , and infix support .
It then defines a particular way of combining these approaches , called “ sweet - expressions ” , that can be viewed as an essentially backward - compatible extension of s-expressions .
A sweet - expression reader can accept typical cleanly - formatted s-expressions without change , but it also supports various extensions ( optional syntactic sugar ) that make much clearer code possible .
This is purely a matter of screen presentation ; underlying systems can continue to use s-expressions , unchanged .
For example , here ’s a trivial Common Lisp program that takes advantage of sweet - expression ’s formatting extensions ( the Scheme version is similar ) :
defun factorial ( n ) ; Parameters can be indented , but need not be if ( n <= 1 ) ; Supports infix , prefix , & function < =(n 1 ) 1 ; This has no parameters , so it 's an atom .
n * factorial(n - 1 ) ; Function ( ... ) notation supported
Sweet - expressions add the following abilities :
Indentation .
Indentation may be used instead of parentheses to start and end expressions : any indented line is a parameter of its parent , later terms on a line are parameters of the first term , lists of lists are marked with GROUP , and a function call with 0 parameters is surrounded or followed by a pair of parentheses .
A “ ( ” disables indentation until its matching “ ) ” .
Blank lines at the beginning of a new expression are ignored .
A term that begins at the left edge and is immediately followed by newline is immediately executed , to make interactive use pleasant .
Name - prefixing .
Terms of the form ‘ NAME ( x y... ) ’ , with no whitespace before ‘(’ , are interpreted as ‘( NAME x y ... ) ’ ; .
If its content is an infix expression , it 's considered one parameter .
Infix .
Optionally , expressions are automatically interpreted as infix if their second parameter is an infix operator ( by matching an “ infix operator ” pattern of symbols ) , the first parameter is not an infix operator , and it has at least three parameters .
Otherwise , expressions are interpreted as normal “ function first ” prefix notation .
Infix expressions must have an odd number of parameters with the even ones being binary infix operators .
You must separate each infix operator with whitespace on both sides .
You can chain the same infix operator , so ( 2 + 3 + 4 ) is fine ; to mix infix operators , use parentheses .
Thus " 2 + (y * -( x ) " is a valid expression , equivalent to (+ 2 (* y (- x ) ) ) .
Infix operators must match this pattern ( and in Scheme cannot be => ) : [+-\*/<>=&\|\p{Sm}]{1-4}|\:|\|\|

This paper describes the rationale behind the older sweet - expressions version 0.1 ; see Sweet - expressions : Version 0.2 for information on the changes made to sweet - expressions since this paper .
Introduction
S -expression notation is a very simple notation for programs , and programs in variants of the Lisp programming language have traditionally been written using s-expressions .
In this notation , an operation and its parameters is surrounded by parentheses ; the operation to be performed is identified first , and each parameter afterwards is separated by whitespace .
So “ 2+3 ” is written as “ (+ 2 3 ) ” .
As noted in the May 2006 Wikipedia , this syntax “ is extremely regular , which facilitates manipulation by computer .
The reliance on [ s -] expressions gives the language great flexibility .
Because Lisp functions are themselves written as lists , they can be processed exactly like data : allowing easy writing of programs which manipulate other programs ( metaprogramming ) . ”
In short , s- expressions are a powerful and regular way to represent programs and other data .
I ’ve written a lot of Lisp code , so I ’ve learned to read s-expressions fairly well .
( I wrote a lot of Lisp code in the late 1980s on a $ 120,000 system . )
But I am never the only one who reads my programs -- I need to make sure others can read my programs too .
Here ’s the problem : for most software developers , programs written solely using s-expressions are hard to read , and they will only voluntarily use programming languages that allow , at least optionally , a more common notation .
This is particularly true for the usual infix operations (+ , < , and so on ) .
People who use Lisp - based languages all the time eventually learn , but not everyone wants to use them all the time , and even developers who are comfortable with programs in s-expression notation need to share their work with others .
Wikipedia notes that “ the heavy use of parentheses in S - expressions has been criticized -- some joke acronyms for Lisp are ‘ Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses ’ , ‘ Let ’s Insert Some Parentheses ’ , or ‘ Long Irritating Series of Parentheses ’ “ .
Yes , I know the arguments .
“ S - expressions are powerful and regular ” !
Of course they are .
They are a wonderful intermediate representation for lots of things , in fact .
But they are a terrible user interface , especially if you are trying to share your results with others .
People today -- even most programmers -- want systems that are “ easy to use ” , and one of the best ways to make something easy to use is to make it familiar .
Most software developers have been trained for many years to use traditional infix mathematical notation , and S - expression notation fails to use it .
Programming is often not a solo effort ; development today is practically always a group effort , and readability for a large diverse group matters .
All the loud statements about the power of S - expressions cannot compete with time looking at real programs .
Most software developers laugh at languages that are “ obviously weak ” ( to them ) because their default parser cannot handle < , * , and - in conventional ways .
Below is a trivial Common Lisp program to compute a factorial - now ask , “ is this really the most readable format possible for other readers ? ”
( defun factorial ( n ) ( if ( <= n 1 ) 1 (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) ) )
Maybe you think so now , but I use this trivial program as an example to show some alternatives that I think many people would prefer .
For example , here ’s the same program , but exploiting the abilities of sweet - expressions ; a reader for sweet - expressions could read both the previous expression and this one :
defun factorial ( n ) if ( n <= 1 ) 1 n * factorial(n - 1 )
The 1993 paper “ The Evolution of Lisp ” by Guy L. Steele , Jr. and Richard P. Gabriel section 3.5.1 discusses “ Algol - style Syntax ” , give a history , and slyly makes fun of efforts to try to use anything other than S - expressions : “ Algol - style syntax makes programs look less like the data structures used to represent them .
In a culture where the ability to manipulate representations of programs is a central paradigm , a notation that distances the appearance of a program from the appearance of its representation as data is not likely to be warmly received ... it is always easy for the novice to experiment with alternative notations .
Therefore we expect future generations of Lisp programmers to continue to reinvent Algol - style for Lisp , over and over and over again , and we are equally confident that they will continue , after an initial period of infatuation , to reject it .
( Perhaps this process should be regarded as a rite of passage for Lisp hackers . ) ”
Paul Graham posts a longer version of this quote .
Perhaps .
But it ’s worth noting that thousands of languages have been invented over the years , but almost none decide to use S - expressions as their surface expressions .
Smalltalk and Python took many ideas from Lisp ( see Norvig ’s “ Python for Lisp programmers ” for more ) ... but not its surface syntax .
Languages like ML and Haskell have strong academic communities ... and do not use S - expressions for their surface syntax either .
Logo was devised to have Lisp ’s power , but intentionally chose to not use its syntax .
Dylan actually switched from S - expressions to a more traditional syntax , when they wanted “ normal ” people to use it .
Yacas is intentionally Lisp - like underneath , but completely abandoned Lisp 's surface syntax for normal user interaction ( as have essentially all computer algebra systems , even though many have a Lisp underneath ) .
The fact that so many people are compelled to find a “ fix ” to Lisp syntax indicates to me that there is a problem ... the fact that so many efforts fail suggests that it is a hard problem .
Norvig ’s Lisp retrospective found that even in 2002 , when comparing Lisp to Python and Java , Lisp was far faster and more extensible , and had many powerful properties ... but it was gaining few users ( it was mostly stagnant ) .
I argue that one key reason is the syntax ; Lisp 's syntax looks genuinely hostile to most “ normal programmers ” .
Instead of Lisp - like languages gaining converts who adjust to prefix syntax , many people are ignoring or abandoning Lisp - like languages to use languages designed to be readable by humans .
John Foderaro correctly said , “ Lisp is a programmable programming language ” , but people expect standard notation to be already available .
Obviously it ’s easy to create a some kinds of front - end syntax for Lisp - like systems , but they generally do n’t catch on -- in part because they usually do n’t provide the full power of the system underneath ( e.g. , you often ca n’t do backquoting with comma-lifting , or insert new parameters in a control structure , or handle macros well ) .
I prefer to use the best tool for the job ; when it 's not Lisp , do n't use Lisp .
But some jobs are naturals for Lisp - based langauges , yet their poor readability seriously interferes with that .
I think there are ways to retain the power of Lisp - based languages , while improving their readability and retaining their flexibility .
Oh , and let ’s debunk one claim here .
Steele and Gabriel claim one problem with Algol - like syntax is that there are “ not enough symbols ” .
Yet even if that were true , by combining characters lots of symbols can be created without resorting to fancy characters .
Indeed , <= is a common combined character for “ less than or equal to ” ; nobody has trouble understanding that .
So below , I discuss a lot of past and current work to improve the syntax of Lisp - like languages .
I then focus on a few especially promising areas that can make Lisp more readable while still accepting normal s-expression notation and having only minimal changes to it .
These include :
Indentation for meaning ( like Python and Haskell ) ; there is already work on this , particularly with I - Expressions .
Name - prefixing approach , so f(x ) and ( f x ) mean the same thing .
Norvig earlier experimented with this .
Infix approaches - how in the world can we rationally add infix support ?
There are lots of options , which I explore .
Goals
My goals were originally for the BitC project , but now I think there might be ways to work more widely for any language that uses Lisp - like notations .
Here were my goals for a programming notation for Lisp - like systems :
Readable .
It should be more “ readable ” to the uninitiated , in particular , it should look like more traditional notation .
For example , ideal format would support infix notation for operations that normally use infix (+ , - , < = , etc. ) , support having function names before parentheses , and not require as many parentheses .
Mappable .
There needs to be an obvious mapping to and from current s-expression notation , which must work for both data and code .
The key advantage of Lisp - like languages is that you can easily manipulate programs as data and vice - versa ; that must remain for any modified syntax .
Otherwise , there ’s no point ; there are lots of other very good programming languages that support infix and other nice notations .
General / Standardizable .
It should be very general and standardizable across all systems that accept s-expressions ( Lisp 's original syntax ) ; nobody wants to relearn syntax everywhere .
It should be useful in Common Lisp , Scheme , Emacs Lisp , BitC , ACL2 , DSSSL , AutoLISP ( built into AutoCAD ) , ISLISP ( standardized by ISO ) BRL , and so on .
A thread about guile noted this very need .
Easily implemented ( relatively speaking ) .
It must not require tens of thousands of lines of code to do .
However , if it takes a little extra code to produce nice results , that is fine ; better to do things well once .
It need not be easily implementable via a few tweaks of an existing reader , though that ’d be nice .
Yes , rewriting a reader is a pain , but those only have to be written once per implementation .
Note that even among implementation of a particular language there is often much variance , so the format needs to be simple enough to support many implementations .
Quote well .
In particular , for both forward quote ( ’) and backquote / quasiquote ( ‘ ) , it must be easy to find the end of the quote , and for backquote / quasiquote , it would be very desirable to support initial comma ( , ) and friends to locally reverse the quoting ( the whole point of quasiquoting ) .
Backward - compatible .
Ideally , it should be able to read regular s-expressions ( at least normally - seen formats of them ) as well as the extensions .
I ’m willing to give a little on this one where necessary .
Note : Version 0.2 of sweet - expressions is not perfectly backward - compatible , but most typical s-expressions as people actually use them are also valid sweet - expressions .
Work with macros .
There will probably be some tweaks for indenting and infix notation ( especially since infix reorders things ! ) , but macro processing should continue to work in most cases .
My notion is that the underlying s-expression system would not change ... instead , the system would support a reader that takes an extended notation and converts it into s-expressions .
A printer could then redisplay s-expressions later in the traditional notation , or same kind of notation used to input it .
It would also be nice if the notation was not confusing or led to likely errors .
I ’ve written this document to put at least a few ideas down in writing .
In the long term , I suspect what needs to happen is for there to be some sort of “ neutral ” forum where ideas can be discussed , and code shared .
For any syntax to be widely used , there must be trustworthy , widely - usable implementations .
I think at least one FLOSS implementation with a generous license that permits use by proprietary programs and Free - libre / open source software ( FLOSS ) programs .
Note that the LGPL does n’t work as intended with most Lisp implementations ; Franz has created the Lisp LGPL ( LLGPL ) which is a specific clarification of the LGPL for use with Lisp .
Lisp code is typically licensed under the LLGPL instead of the LGPL , since the LLGPL clarifies some otherwise sticky issues and ambiguities in the LGPL .
Note that any FLOSS software should be GPL - compatible , since there is so much GPL ’ed code .
The implementations would need to be widely portable and modular , so that they can be widely depended on .
Scheme and Common Lisp are n’t really compatible at all .
Translators like scm2cl ( Scheme to Common Lisp translator ) could help initially , certainly to get started ( suggesting that it'd be best to start with Scheme , and then transition at least an initial version to Common Lisp ) .
But in the end , specialized implementations well - tuned to different environment will be necessary for an improved syntax to really work .
There are lots of Lisp code repositories and other Lisp - related sites , including Common - Lisp.net , Lisp.org / Association of Lisp users ( ALU ) , CLiki ( Common Lisp Wiki ) , and schemers.org .
Past Work
Special syntax for various constructs
Most readability efforts focus on creating special syntax for every language constructs ; these often end up unused ( because they cannot keep modifying the grammar to match the underlying system ) , or end up creating a completely new language less suitable for self - analysis of program fragments .
“ The Evolution of Lisp ” lists many efforts to create " Algol - like notations for Lisp " , which generally included infix notations and attempts to be more “ readable ” .
Originally Lisp was supposed to be written in M- expressions , which were more traditional in format .
Function calls were written as F[x ;y ...] instead of ( F x y... ) , for example .
One problem is that they kept adding new syntax , and never found a good “ final ” M-expression format , so it was never implemented ... and it just receded into the never - finished future .
Many other notations were developed , including those of LISP 2 .
These generally had if ... then ... else and other more traditional naming conventions .
For example , RLisp ( used by Reduce , among others ) is a Lisp with an infix notation .
A yacc grammar for RLisp by A. C. Norman ( 2002 ) is available .
Norman notes that the grammar is “ ambiguous or delicate in several areas ” :
It has the standard “ dangling else ” problem .
If R is a word tagged as RLIS , then R takes as its operands a whole bunch of things linked by commas .
At present I have this grammar ambiguous on R1 a , b , c , R2 d , e , f ; where R2 could ( as far as the grammar is concerned ) be being given one , two or three arguments .
This problem arises if the operands of R may themselves end in an R .
This is harded to avoid than I at first thought - one might well want conditionals in the are list of an R , but then R1 a , IF x THEN R2 b , c ; comes and bites .
I guess this is a “ dangling comma ” problem .
The above two problems are resolved by the parser genarator favouring shift over reduce in the ambiguous cases .
“ IN ” , “ ON ” are both keywords , as used in for each x in y do ... and words with the RLISTAT property .
This is sordid !
Similarly “ END ” has a dual use .
This is coped with by making special provision in the grammar for these cases .
One trouble of many of these notations is that it becomes difficult to see where the end of an expression is ( e.g. , there might be no way to indicate the “ end ” of the if statement ) ; this can creates ambiguities and makes it harder to easily match the infix notation and s-expression if you need to .
And , if you want to describe arbitrary Lisp s-expressions , not having an end - marker means that you may not able to access some of the capabilities of the underlying s-expressions ( though that may not be an issue for all uses ) .
Using a hierarchy of Domain Specific Languages in complex software systems design by V. S. Lugovsky discusses using Lisp to create domain - specific languages , including syntactic transformations .
The ACL2 language is Common Lisp - based , but it has a separate front - end for a more traditional interface including an infix processor ; it is named IACL2 .
This is not often used , for several reasons :
ACL2 is only defined in s-expression form , so you cannot read any of the documentation or examples without knowing s-expression form anyway .
IACL2 is not as portable as ACL2 , nor as supported .
IACL2 does not support all the capabilities as ACL2 -- and who wants to use a tool that is known to not work when you most need it ?
Logo is basically Lisp with an infix and more readable syntax .
Instead of “ ( ” ... ” ) ” , Logo uses “ [ ” ... ” ] ” .
Normally , all commands begin with the name of the function , just like Lisp , and Logo even has text names for math functions : sum , product , difference , and quotient .
More interestingly , infix is also available ... by using symbols , Logo automatically uses the infix forms instead .
Logo knows the number of parameters for each function , so once the number of parameters is provided you can just provide another function call on the same line without any marking of the end of the call ( see the “ rt ” call below ) .
This is not as flexible as s-expressions , where you can always add another parameter .
Here ’s a sample Logo program :
to spiral : size if : size > 30 [ stop ] ; a condition stop fd : size rt 15 ; many lines of action spiral : size * 1.02 ; the tailend recursive call end
Dylan is another Lisp with more conventional notation , including an infix format .
Here ’s a Lisp - to - Dylan translator , exploiting the Common Lisp pretty - printer .
D- Expressions : Lisp Power , Dylan
Style even shows it is possible to combine infix forms with Lisp ’s abilities to manipulate programs .
Dylan is a little wordy , in part because of namespace problems ( types are in the same namespace , which is often not what you want ) , but it ’s easy to read .
It ends blocks with “ end blockname ” , e.g. , “ if ( a ) b else c end if ” ; a little long but clear .
Here ’s a simple example from the page Procedural Dylan :
define method distance ( x1 :: < real > , y1 :: < real > , x2 :: < real > , y2 :: < real > ) => distance :: < real > ; sqrt(( x2 - x1 ) * ( x2 - x1 ) + ( y2 - y1 ) * ( y2 - y1 ) ) end method distance ;
There is also CGOL ( an Algol - like language that compiles into Common Lisp ) ; this was developed originally by Vaughn Pratt , and written by a UC Berkeley graduate student , Tom Phelps .
This program is a Common Lisp implementation of CGOL that is translated into Lisp before execution .
I do not know what its license is .
You can look more generally at the CMU archive , though beware of licensing problems .
Clike ( see also Clike on Sourceforge ) is a compiler which converts code written in a simple C - like language to Scheme .
Pico is an educational Scheme with C-ish syntax .
TwinLisp is a " new way of programming in Common Lisp " ; it creates a new reader with a more conventional syntax , which it then translates to Common Lisp and executes .
It predefines precedence - which unfortunately means that it is tied to a particular interpretation of all operations .
It also defines special control structures ; thus , like most past efforts to create " readable Lisp " , it ends up sacrificing generality of the resulting format ( the reader is rigged to a specific set of operators with special syntax - so creating new operators is not simply a matter of defining the meaning of the operator ) .
Lisp resources gives pointers for where to go for more information .
For extensions specifically focused on indentation , see the text below on indentation ; for extensions specifically focused on infix notation , see the section on infix .
Skill
Skill from Cadence is a proprietary Lisp - based extension language .
By examining that paper , this text , and this document , a hint of its syntax can be inferred .
Skill supports name - prefixing , where FUNC( x y ) is treated as meaning ( FUNC x y ) .
Skill also supports infix processing , automatically translating infix operators into an internal prefix format .
In Skill , it appears that all of the prefix functions have alphabetic names , e.g. , " ( plus 3 4 ) " adds 3 to 4 .
This means that infix operators can be unambiguously detected and used without surrounding whitespace ; thus " 3+4 " is automatically translated to " ( plus 3 4 ) " .
Skill does not consider indentation significant .
I point out Skill specially because it does shows that it 's possible to have a very general syntax that is easier to use .

Arc and its influence : Syntax as Abbreviation
Paul Graham began devising a Lisp variant named Arc , and promulgated the term Syntax as abbreviation for his approach .
Here ’s what he said :
Common Lisp and Scheme only directly support s-expressions ; “ disadvantage : long - winded ” .
Dylan and Python have s-expressions hidden underneath , “ disadvantage : macros unnatural ” .
Arc has inspired many people to re-evaluate Lisp syntax , and see if there are ways it can be made more readable .
Some comments on Arc made some interesting points :
Peter Norvig said , “ For the Scheme I wrote for Junglee ’s next - generation wrapper language , I allowed three abbreviations : ( 1 ) If a non-alphanumeric symbol appeared in the first or second element of a list to be evaled , then the list is in infix form .
So ( x = 3 + 4 ) is ( = x (+ 3 4 ) ) , and (- x * y ) is ( * (- x ) y ) .
And ( 2 ) , if a symbol is delimited by a “ ( ” , then it moves inside the list .
So f( a b ) is ( f a b ) , while f ( a b ) is two s-exps .
And ( 3 ) , commas are removed from the list after infix parsing is done , but serve as barriers to infix beforehand , so f( a , b ) is ( f a b ) , while in f( - a , b + c ) , each of - a and b + c gets infix - parsed separatly , and then they get put together as ( f (- a ) (+ b c ) ) .
This seemed to satisfy the infix advocates ( and annoy some of the Scheme purists ) .
You might consider something like this . ”
Here are some of my thoughts about this : Rule 1 ( the check on the first and second elements of the list ) is a little hackish , and by having a check on the first element too , you ca n’t use usual Lisp notation at all for infix operators .
Rule 3 ( removing commas ) is simple .
Amazingly enough , this does n’t interfere with quasiquoting as long as commas are always required as function parameter separators ; since you cannot have a null - length parameter , any parameter beginning with a comma has a comma for lifting !
But that does n’t mean that the resulting code is easy to read ; all those extra commas can make it hard to find the comma that is doing the lifting , and unless prefix operators are allowed , they are n’t needed for parameter separation ... they just create more syntactic noise .
So I have n’t gone further with this , though others could .
Rule 2 is a neat idea ; there ’s the minor risk of bad spacing causing problems , but it is a trivial way to get more traditional functional notation without harming the syntax ( functions cannot have “ ( ” in their name anyway ) .
Indeed , I think there ’s a good idea here , as I discuss below in “ Name - prefixing ” .
Sudhir Shenoy ’s “ ideas from Perl ” said : “ Please do n’t use parentheses for s-expressions ( ’ [ ’ and ‘ ] ’ or even ‘ {’ and ‘ } ’ would be preferable .
The biggest complaint I have about parentheses is that it makes infix mathematics ( which you are planning to introduce in Arc ) really hard to read .
e.g. ( def interest ( x y ) ( expt ( - r * ( t2 - t1 ) / ( days - in - year ) ) ) ) reads really badly when compared to [ def interest ( x y ) [ expt ( - r * ( t2 - t1 ) / [ days - in - year ] ) ] ] .
The overloading of meanings of parentheses ( grouping + s- expression ) which is n’t a problem in Lisp may cause a loss of readability in Arc . ”
Kragen Sitaker ’s email “ two - dimensional syntax for Lisp ” summarizes some ideas from Paul Graham and Arc , but the author seems to add his own points too .
He says :
” Paul Graham notes that you can infer some parens in Common Lisp from indentation and newlines .
In particular , if a line contains more than one s-expression , it must be a prefix of a list of those s-expressions .
If a sequence of lines is indented from the previous text line , it must be a continuation of that line ’s s-expression ...
All of this leads to needing extra parens around invocations of parameterless methods .
Oh well . ”
He explicitly assumes that adding parentheses will not disable indentation processing .
disable indentation processing .
” In general , infix - to - prefix transformation should be relatively simple , reversible , and allow mixing of infix and prefix expressions ; infix operators ca n’t be infix if they ’re the first element of a list anyway .
However , infix expressions could be valid prefix expressions ; how about ( reduce + mylist ) , for example ?
OCaml solves this problem by adopting the infix interpretation where there is ambiguity , requiring parens around infix operators used as values .
This probably is n’t the best solution for a Lisp , but you could probably require ( function +) instead of (+ ) and get away with it .
I ’d like to be able to use at least (+ - * ** / mod ) infix , with their usual precedence ; and a left - associative : for cons would shorten a heck of a lot of Lisp programs . ”
“ On multiline string syntax : it ’s ridiculous to include the leading spaces on successive lines .
Spaces to get subsequent lines of the string in to where the first line of the string started should not be included in the string ; their absence should simply be a syntax error . ”
“ These syntax rules still do n’t help cond much , either the Arc variant of cond or the traditional one . ”
He suggests borrowing McCarthy ’s syntax from the 1960s : “ condition => consequent ” .
I ( Wheeler ) think that using “ = > ” this way would be a bad idea , at least in Scheme ; Scheme already uses “ = > ” for a completely different meaning inside “ cond ” constructs .
Another operator could work , though finding a clear one may be more difficult .
Often “ -> ” means “ implies ” , and having to similar - looking operators with different semantics is a bad idea anyway .
Actually , I think that when you add indentation ( see below ) , constructs like “ cond ” actually look pretty reasonable , so this is may be best solved a different way .
A conversation about Arc and related ideas is posted on reddit .
BitC version 0.9 uses this “ syntax as abbrevation ” approach .
You can indicate that “ Value ” has type “ Type ” using the quasi- function “ the ” , e.g. , as ( the Type Value ) , but the preferred form is “ value : type ” .
It does not go far right now , though ; + is still prefix ( not infix ) .
Infpre is a Common Lisp infix utility ( LGPL license ) .
Quack is yet another Lisp derivative .
This adds two syntactic items .
First , " postfix colon syntax " - colon with indentation as a shortcut for parentheses .
Second , " infix colon syntax " - a colon without spaces around it are a shortcut for function / macro call , right - associative , so cdr :cdr : obj is ( cdr ( cdr obj ) ) ) .
He does n't know if they 're workable , and I do n't find the examples convincing .
Indentation has promise , but the colon ends up in a bad place and it 's completely unnecessary .
And while an infix operator like the infix colon is useful , making that the only infix operator is rather weak ; where 's 3 + 4 ?
Lisp sans parentheses hell discusses some similar ideas :
1. We use ( ) to indicate grouping . ( ( ( ( a ) ) ) ) will mean the same thing as ( a ) .
2 . We use right associative infix operator notation - a * b + c translates to (* a (+ b c ) ) in lisp .
3 . We use indentation ( tab - size = 4 ) to convey grouping - say hello becomes ( say hello ( to lisp ) ) to lisp 4 .
We use square brackets notation to encode lists - for instance - [ a , b , c ] means ( a b c )
The items in a list can also be separated by line breaks .
So [ one two means ( one two three ) three ]
Since indentation is significant , [ one two means ( ( one two ) three ) three ]
There are a few special operators that help reduce the need for parentheses and aid readability - 1 . a : b translates to ( a . b ) and due to right associativity , a : b : c translates to ( a b . c ) 2 . a :: b translates to ( a b ) 3 . a := b translates to ( define a b )
Here are the cases where you wo n’t need parentheses - 1 . Your expression starts on its own line .
In this case , the first term is the head term and the rest of the terms on the same line are tail terms .
2 . Your expression is the second argument to an infix operator .
For example - mid :: quotient ( low + high ) 2 is equivalent to mid :: ( quotient ( low + high )
2 ) Exceptions - 1 . Use func ( ) notation to indicate that you mean ( func ) ( a function call ) and not just the value of func .
Limitations of current implementation - 1 . Back - quoting not supported .
2 . The use of comma separator outside of list expressions is not defined and handled well enough .
Enjoy ! ... and , for the record , I ’ll stick to the parentheses , thank you :)
So now , let ’s turn to three areas that have great promise , and then see if we can combine them together .
Lisp programs are normally presentated using indentation ; the Common Lisp standard even includes a pretty printer !
Experienced Lisp programmers eventually stop seeing the parentheses , and see the structure of a program instead as suggested by indentation .
So why not use indentation to identify structure , since people do anyway , and eliminate many unnecessary parentheses ?
Other languages , including Python , Haskell , Occam , Icon , use indentation to indicate structure , so this is a proven idea .
Other recently - developed languages like Cobra ( a variant of Python with strong compile - time typechecking ) have decided to use indentation too , so clearly indentation - sensitive languages are considered useful by many .
In praise of mandatory indentation notes that it can be helpful to have mandatory indentation .
Past work on indenting to represent s- expressions
Paul Graham ( developer of Arc ) is known to be an advocate of indentation for this purpose .
As I noted above , Kragen Sitaker ’s notes on Graham and Arc discusses how indentation can really help ( in this notation , functions with no parameters need to be surrounded by parentheses , to distinguish them from atoms - “ oh well ” ) .
Graham 's RTML is implemented using Lisp , but uses indentation instead of parentheses to define structure .
RTML is a proprietary programming language used by Yahoo ! ’s Yahoo !
Store and Yahoo !
Site hosting products , though Yahoo are transitioning away from it .
Paul Graham ’s comments about the RTML language design and this introduction to RTML by Yahoo .
Darius Bacon's ” indent ” file , includes his own implementation of a Python / Haskell - like syntax for Scheme using indentation in place of parentheses , and in that file he also includes Paul D. Fernhout 's implementation of an indentation approach .
Bacon 's syntax for indenting uses colons in a way that is limiting ( it interferes with other uses of the colon in various Lisp - like languages ) .
I have not had a chance to examine Paul D. Fernhout 's yet .
( It also includes an I - expression implementation . )
All of the files are released under the MIT /X license .
( Darius Bacon also created mlish , an infix syntax front end listed earlier ) .
Lispin discusses a way to get S - expressions with indentation .
I - expressions
I - expressions are an alternative method for presenting s-expressions ( either program or data ) , using indentation .
They are defined in SRFI ( " surfie " ) 49 ; this has final status , making I - expressions a quasi - official part of Scheme .
I - expressions have no special cases for semantic constructs of the language .
SRFI 49 includes a sample implementation with an MIT - style license ( based on the Sugar project ) .
Here ’s an example , quoted from the Scheme Requests for Implementation ( SFRI ) number 49 ( this example uses Scheme ’s “ define ” function , not Common Lisp ’s “ defun ” function ) :
define fac x if = x 0 1 * x fac - x 1
I - expressions can include traditional s-expression representation too ; here 's an example ( using Scheme ) :
define ( fac x ) if ( = x 0 ) 1 * x fac (- x 1 )
( define ( fac x ) ( if ( = x 0 ) 1 (* x ( fac (- x 1 ) ) ) ) )
The keyword “ group ” is used to begin a list of lists .
( One minor drawback : it 's more difficult to use a function named " group " , so it 's best to simply not create such a function . )
You can drop back several indentation levels without dropping them all :
let group foo + 1 2 bar + 3 4 + foo bar
The SFRI permits both tabs and space characters .
I - expressions can also be quoted ( including being quasi- quoted ) ; see the proposal for information .
Note this means that ’ followed by whitespace is now the beginning of a quote , because the initial whitespace is significant , and newlines become important .
In any indentation system for s-expressions , you need to be able to express s-expressions such as ( f a ) , ( g ( h 1 ) ) , and ( j ( k ) ) .
In the first case , the first parameter is simple symbol , in the second case , the first parameter is a call with at least one parameter , and in the third case , the call to k has no parameters at all .
I - expressions represent 0 - parameter function calls by having the parameter surrounded with ( ... ) ( or having ( ) as a name - ender ) .
Let ’s see what the indentation rules by themselves look like :
; Here is ( f a ) : f a ; or f a ; Here is ( g ( h 1 ) ) : g h 1 ; or g h 1 ; or g ( h 1 ) ; Here is ( j ( k ) ) , note the treatment of 0 - parameter calls : j ( k ) ; or j ( k )
The idea is simple , but it can be hard to reason about how it works -- so here is one way to think about it ( if you 're using this to write a program ) .
On any line , the first term is the function to be called ; the rest of the items on the line , and each indented line below , are its parameters .
If a line has no other parameters ( on the rest of the line or indented ) , then it 's an atom ; otherwise , it 's treated as one expression and parentheses surround that line and its indents ( if any ) .
The “ group ” term creates an extra surrounding (... ) in the resulting s-expression , so you can create lists of lists .
So how do you present computing a function and then calling it ?
Personally , I ’d just switch to traditional s-expression notation in this case .
But the I - expression representation actually is n’t bad ; just use a “ group ” followed by how to compute the function to be called :
; ( ( getfunction x ) a b ) can be represented as : group getfunction x a b ; or : group ( getfunction x ) a b
The SFRI supplies Guile code ( not fully portable Scheme code ) to implement I - expressions ( e.g. , it uses define - public and not define ) .
However , it should be easy to port .
In the I - expression sample implementation a “ ( ” disables I - expression processing until its matching “ ) ” , and this is an intended part of the definition of I - expressions .
This has all sorts of wonderful side - effects :
I - expressions parsing becomes very safe to use with existing code - pre-existing oddly - indented code will almost certainly start each expression with an opening parenthesis , disabling indentation processing .
It supports dealing with text that is very close to running off the right - hand side ; just use parentheses to disable indentation processing .
Python does the same thing .
There are a few special cases where the reader with I - expressions enabled parsed a file differently .
When two top - level s-expressions follow each other , either ( 1 ) on the same line or ( 2 ) on consecutive lines with the second expression indented , the lines will be combined by an I - expression reader .
The first seems unlikely to me ; the second is a little unfortunate .
What 's worse , though , is that in a read - eval - print loop , users have to enter return twice to see their results , and it 's easy to end up trying to evalute an empty list .
We 'll discuss those below in possible extensions to I -expressions .
The mailing list discussion of I - expressions includes a posting of an I - expression pretty - printer ; the author says " I just could n't get to sleep , so I wrote one " .
Be warned : I believe this pretty - printer has a bug , because it does not handle ( f ( g ) ) correctly .
The first pretty - printer I wrote for I - expressions in Common Lisp had the same error , too , so this is a common mistake when doing this task - be warned .
The expression ( f ( g ) ) should print like this :
f ( g )
I believe that users who use indenting expressions should only use space characters , and never tabs , to indent .
The R5RS Scheme specification does n't even officially permit tab characters ( though implementations generally do ) .
The real problem is that tabs produce a varying number of spaces on real systems ; experience with Python suggests that using tabs can cause a lot of problems .
Most of today ’s text editors can be configured to turn tabs into spaces automatically .
Possible extensions to I -expressions
I -expressions and similar indentation approaches are a very nice approach .
But there are several ways it could be extended or modified , now that I 've had a chance to experiment with them .
Immediate execution if begin on left - hand - edge
If you use indented I - expressions interactively ( in a read - eval - print loop ) , you have to enter an extra a blank line ( an extra " enter " ) before the expression is evaluated .
That 's because the system needs to know when an expression has ended ; the system believes you might indent the next line and add more expressions .
This is fine for multi-line expressions , but it 's very annoying for simple single - line expressions .
If you do a lot of simple one - line commands this becomes very annoying .
And this is likely ; few people type in long , multi-line definitions into a read - eval loop , because they would stick those into a file instead !
So how can we make indenting easy to use at a command line ?
We could create a special command for use at the beginning of a line , such as " ! " , that means " at the end of the line , you 're done " .
Or we could create a special indicator that means " execute now " .
But these do n't seem any easier than entering a blank line , and they are yet something else to remember .
One simple modification could be to add a special case , based on whether or not text was entered in column 1 .
There are several obvious variants :
If leftmost edge has a " ( " , and the entire expression is immediately followed by a newline , then the expression is complete .
This has lots of problems ; this does n't handle evaluating atoms , such as running " x " to see what x contains .
So I 'll reject that .
If text begins at the leftmost edge ( no leading horizontal space ) , and the following term is completely read , followed immediately by a newline , then the expression is complete and the read function returns .
Thus , if these are entered at the leftmost edge , they will immediately return : x ( load " file " ) load ( " file " ) ( 3 + 4 ) However , the following will not ( they will wait for a blank line ) if entered on the leftmost edge : load " file " define x 3 + 4
The system will wait for a blank line in these cases , because the first term is followed by a space , not a newline ... so it is waiting to see if you 'll add more parameters by indenting them .
The ' define x ' is an example of good news ( probably ) , and the ' load ' command is an example of the bad news .
Another problem is that the rule is a little complicated to explain .
The good news is that ' define x ' on the left edge will not trigger an immediate return .
With these semantics , if you want to enter an indented expression , you 'll need to indent the first line or include at least one parameter ( expression ) on the same line .
If you indent at all on the command line , or enter one or more terms on one line , you must type an extra blank line to execute the sequence ; this seems reasonable .
If text begins at the leftmost edge ( no leading horizontal space ) , and there are no unmatched parentheses , it is immediately completed at newline .
In this approach , you must indent the first line to have an indented expression .
This means that if these were entered on the left edge , they would be executed immediately : load " file " 3 + 4 define x
The good news with this approach is that ' load " file " ' on the left edge works as a user might expect - it will trigger an immediate return .
The same is true for 3 + 4 ... suddenly an interactive Lisp interpreter makes a plausible calculator !
The bad news is that ' define x ' on the left edge followed by return will also trigger an immediate return of the read expression , which is almost certainly not what was intended .
That is not such a big deal in an interactive command loop , since the user could try again .
But more seriously , this would be a likely thing to do in a file , and it could cause very hard - to - detect bugs .
How can we counter the risks of not noting the change in semantics for text on the left edge ?
It might be possible to have a special loop for file - reading that detected the case of " unindented expression followed immediately by indented expression " , and trigger a warning or error .
Another variant would be to have two slightly different modes for read ( or two different starting functions ) : one intended for interactive use , where unindented lines are ended on newline where possible , and one intended for file reading ( where there is no such distinction ) .
This does complicate reasoning and implementation , and it 's quite normal to cut - and - paste into an interactive session .
One promising approach to countering the problem is to configure other tools to help detect such problems .
Text editors , for example , could be colorize such constructs .
Thus , if a left edge that would run immediately is followed by an indented line , it would be labelled with red lines .
And special tools could be designed to detect this as well .
One good point is that the rule is simple : " if you want to indent , you must start by indenting the first line " .
When you indent , you enter a blank line or another expression at the same indentation level .
Frankly , that 's much simpler than the rules above .
If text begins at the leftmost edge ( no leading horizontal space ) , and there is exactly one term on the line or it is a legal infix expression , then the expression is complete and the read function returns .
Thus , if these are entered at the leftmost edge , they will immediately return : x ( load " file " ) load ( " file " ) ( 3 + 4 ) 3 + 4 3 + ( 4 * 2 ) And these will not : define x load " file " 3 + 4 * 2 3 + 4 +
For sweet - expressions , for a long time I keep going back and forth between option 2 and option 3 .
Option 3 presents the risk of subtle bugs , and that is of great concern .
However option 3 is a joy to work with interactively .
I then said , " This is a hard choice to make , so I plan to experiment .
Expressions like load ( " filename " ) and ( 3 + 4 ) seem particularly easy to explain , and do not have the drawbacks of this alternative , so they suggest using alternative 2 . "
It was only in November 2007 that I finally realized that what I wanted was option 4 .
Note that when activated these also partly eliminate one of the minor incompatibilities of I - expressions with traditional s-expressions .
If there are two separate outermost s-expressions on consecutive lines , with the second expression indented from the first , as long as the first expression was not indented ( a likely case ) the lines will no longer be combined by the I -expression reader .
Of course , this could be misleading , because the second line might appear to be combined with the first ; this is a trade - off with no perfect answer .
Ignoring excess blank lines
Excess blank lines get interpreted oddly , as '( ) , which the underlying system may then try to run ( Scheme in particular complains about them ) .
It can also cause confusion if interpretation gets " out of sync " .
A plausible modification would be to ignore any additional blank lines before a ( next ) expression .
In short , a blank line should n't really return '( ) to the system ; if they want that , users should need to enter that directly .
If there blank lines at the end of the file , the system should probably return the end - of - file marker ( if it supports that ) once it has consumed the final blank lines trying to read the next expression .
An alternative would be to ignore any additional blank lines after an expression , but you do n't want to do that .
Then you need to treat the beginning of a file specially ( assuming that there was a beginning of file ) .
Also , should horizontal spaces followed by newline be treated the same as a blank line ?
Users cannot easily see the difference , especially on typical printouts .
That is n't clear , so I leave that as a question for now .
Indentation , a wrap - up
Lisp ’s standard notation is different from “ normal ” notation in that the parentheses precede the function name , rather than follow it .
Jorgen ‘ forcer ’
Schaefer argues that this is a more serious problem than the lack of infix notation ; on July 2000 he said “ I think most people would like Scheme a lot better if they could say lambda ( expression ) ... instead of ( lambda ( expression ) ... ”
Peter Norvig had some interesting ideas , as noted earlier .
Let ’s look at one of his rules , the rule that says “ if a function name ends with an open parentheses , move it inside the list ( when converting to an s- expression ) ” .
This means that “ ( fact x ) ” and “ fact ( x ) ” will mean the same thing .
Obviously , this is trivial to parse .
We do n’t lose any power , because this is completely optional -- we only use it when we want to , and we can switch back to the traditional s-expression notation if we want to .
It ’s trivially quoted .. if you quote a symbol followed by “ ( ” , just keep going until its matching “ ) ” -- essentially the same rule as before !
Technically , this is a change from some official Lisp s-expression notations and implementations .
For example , entering “ a( b ) ” into CLisp ( a Common Lisp implementation ) is the same as “ a ( b ) ” -- its parser tries to return the value of a , followed by running the function b.
But it ’s not clear it ’s a big change in practice ; commonly accepted style always separates parameters ( including the first function call name ) with whitespace .
So normally , what follows a function call ’s name is whitespace or “ ) ” , and this is enforced by pretty - printers .
Thus , many large existing Lisp programs could go through this kind of parsing without resulting in a change in meaning !
Does this help ?
Let ’s rewrite the CL factorial example , but not make the infix operations do this :
defun ( factorial ( n ) if ( ( <= n 1 ) 1 (* n factorial ( (- n 1 ) ) ) ) )
It looks slightly more familiar , but not that much .
Let ’s try again , but move the infix ops out too ; the result is actually not bad :
defun ( factorial ( n ) if ( <=(n 1 ) 1 *( n factorial ( - ( n 1 ) ) ) ) )
If we really wanted it to look conventional , we could use wordy names instead of symbols that are traditionally infix ; that is n’t too horrible for + ( use “ sum ” ) , but that is rather wordy for others ( I do n’t like it ) :
defun ( factorial ( n ) if( lessequal(n 1 ) 1 product ( n factorial ( subtract ( n 1 ) ) ) ) )
Note that as far as I can tell , you do not need any whitespace after the opening parentheses , because atoms ( including function names ) cannot have parentheses in their name in s-expressions .
A variant of this idea would be to require whitespace after the opening paren if name - prefixing is used , but I see no need for that .
Skill from Cadence , a proprietary Lisp - based extension language , also supports name - prefixing .
Mathematica does something similar .
As noted in How Purely Nested Notation Limits The Language 's Utility , its FullForm notation can be transformed into Lisp using simple rules , starting with transforming f[ a , b ] into ( f a b ) .
But it is n't designed to be backward - compatible with existing Lisp notations ; its use of " , " to separate arguments would cause confusion since " , " is also used in macro handling .
Name - prefixing can be combined with indentation ( e.g. , I - expressions ) .
Let ’s presume that if you indent further and begin the expression with a parentheses , or by a function name , no space , and a parenthesis , that parenthesis and its mate are silently ignored ( they do n’t add yet another subexpression in the s-expression ) .
Furthermore , let ’s presume that if you have a name - ender format ( function name followed immediately by open paren ) , it does not switch to some “ no more I - expression ” mode .
Then you could do this ( using English names for operators ) :
defun factorial ( n ) if lessequal (n 1 ) 1 product n factorial ( subtract ( n 1 ) )
defun factorial ( n ) if < = (n 1 ) 1 *( n factorial ( - (n 1 ) ) )
It turns out that name - prefixing works well with indentation .
Here are some examples :
; Here is ( g ( h 1 ) ) < => g( h ( 1 ) ) g h ( 1 ) ; or g h ( 1 ) ;
Here is ( g ( h ) ) < => g( h ( ) ) g h( ) ; or g h() ;
Here is ( g ( a ) ( b 1 ) c ) : <=> g( a( ) b ( 1 ) c ) g a ( ) b ( 1 ) c ; or g a ( ) b (1 ) c ;
Here is ( g a ( b 1 ) c ( ) ) < => g( a b ( 1 ) c( ) ) g a b ( 1 ) c( ) ; or g a b ( 1 ) c ( )
This does introduce the risk of someone inserting a space between the function name and the opening “ ( ” .
But whitespace is already significant as a parameter separator , so this is consistent with how the system works anyway ... this is not really a change at all .
I think this is slightly better for untrained eyes .
It ’s hard to argue that this is a major improvement , at least by itself , but the more I look at it the more I like it .
What ’s more , the pain is tiny , and that ’s a good thing .
This is a lower pain , lower gain approach , and it can be combined with SWP - expressions , which I ’ll describe in a moment .
The article Improving lisp syntax is harder than it looks discusses name - prefixing , but I think it makes a number of errors .
It first claims that this would be hard to integrate with macros - this actually is n't true if it 's built into the reader ( and the macros are n't doing reading themselves ) .
If the reader transforms a ( x ) into ( a x ) , then when the macro has a chance to run all it sees is ( a x ) - exactly what it was expecting to see .
He also says that " Another disadvantage to this change of syntax is that it makes functional programming much more odd looking .
Lets say you have a list containing functions and you want to call the first one .
In Scheme you write ( ( car lst ) params ) and in Common Lisp ( funcall ( car lst ) params ) .
However in our new syntax it looks like : car ( lst ) ( params ) and funcall ( car ( lst ) ( params ) ) .
Neither of these is very elegant , and it only gets worse if that call in turn returns a function , which would look like : car ( lst ) ( params ) ( params2 ) and funcall ( funcall ( car ( lst ) ( params ) ) ( params2 ) ) . "
But I find this remarkably elegant , and better than the traditional notation - to do functional programming , just cuddle up the parentheses .
It 's much easier to understand sequential parentheses compared to a deeply nested list .
Again , let ’s continue the thought that we want to support a syntax that is maximally Lisp - like , generally accepting existing expressions .
The biggest issue in making Lisp s-expressions easier to read are in whether or not to provide infix support , and if so , how .
The first question is , should you support infix at all ?
Because if we do , and we presume that the underlying s-expressions always have the operation first , this means that we are changing the external presentation of ( some ) data .
Note that we are only changing the presentation for entering programs and program - like data , and possibly changing how they are externally displayed ; the traditional s-expression would still be used internally .
Thus , if “ { 3 + 4} ” is interpreted as an infix expression , it will quietly be transformed to the s-expression “ (+ 3 4 ) ” , so the “ car ” ( head ) of “ { 3 + 4} ” would be “ + ” .
The ll1 - discuss mailing list includes discussions on the issues of infix .
The reality is that nearly everyone prefers infix notation ; people will specifically avoid Lisp - based systems solely because they lack infix support built - in .
Even Paul Graham , a well - known Lisp advocate , admits that " Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read .
This is especially true for math expressions .
I 've used Lisp my whole programming life and I still do n't find prefix math expressions natural . "
Paul Prescod remarked , “ [ Regarding ] infix versus prefix ...
I have more faith that you could convince the world to use esperanto than prefix notation . ”
Nearly all developers prefer to read infix for many operations .
I believe Lisp - based systems have often been specifically ignored even where they were generally the best tool for the job , solely because there was no built - in support for infix operations .
After all , if language creators ca n’t be bothered to support the standard notation for mathematical operations , then clearly it is n’t very powerful ( as far as they are concerned ) .
So let ’s see some ways we can support infix , yet with minimal changes to s-expression notation .
If we are willing to support infix , there are many options .
The big issues are :
How do you determine when to use infix notation ?
Is this manually specified ( if so , how , and how deep does it go ? ) - or is it automatic ( if so , how , and how do you override it ? ) .
What are the legal infix operators ?
What are the semantics ?
( Do you do something trivial , like swap the first and second parameters , allow many parameters for the same operator , or go all the way to full infix with precedence ? )
There are some code samples that might be used as a starting point for implementations ; after going over the issues , I identify some of them .
Nathan Baum ( of Bournemouth , United Kingdom ) posted on 4/14/2006 8:19:16 PM
the idea of using [...] to surround infix notation ( I ’m sure he ’s neither the first nor last ) .
He said , “ Lisp actually has a few syntactic shortcuts of its own .
Essentially anything that is n’t part of a name is a character which triggers a specialised reader function .
Strings , for example , do n’t need to be built in to the Lisp core : a reader can be associated with the double quote character , and that ’ll return a string object .
This also means you can redefine it yourself to get shell / Perl / Ruby - style interpolated strings , for example .
Even lists themselves are read using a reader function triggered by [ parentheses ] .
One simple shortcut is to have ‘ normal ’ Lisp expressions delimited by [ parentheses ] , and infix expressions delimited by brackets ...
( print (+ x (- ( / y z ) a ) ) ) ; or ( print [ x + [ [y / x ] - a ] ] ” .
How do you determine when to use infix notation ?
There are several major options :
Not automatic ( special syntax ) .
If infix is not automatic , you add characters that say “ make this infix ” , using pairs such as {...} or [...] around infix operators , or use single expressions before the first or second parameter .
The single expression might be single characters , like ?
or ! , or multiple characters , like the dispatching macro characters ( #... ) .
I do n’t recommend “ ! ” because it looks too much like “ not ” in other langauges .
Using something short is a good idea , because infix is very common .
The Lisp FAQ mentions # I being used as the “ Portable Infix Package ” marker ( I have searched and not found out more about this ; suggestions would be appreciated ) .
( This discussion mentions an author using # I ( 3+4 ) to notate infix , and remarks that [ 3+4 ] would have been simpler . )
Requiring a syntax marker is not as “ pretty ” as automatically notating infix operators , though it has the advantage of clarity if you process the resulting s-expressions often .
Kantrowitz ’s infix macro package for Common Lisp is an example of this approach .
Pairs of characters can force infix interpretation , and seem like the obvious idea , but they do have some disadvantages .
Infix operations can work across a list , so it makes sense to mark the end of such a list and use a special pair of characters like {...} instead of ( ... ) to mark an “ infix list ” .
There are two pairs available : {...} and [... ] .
Advantages of {...} is that they are more commonly used for statement blocks in other programming languages ( Logo being an exception ) , and in particular users may want [...] for other purposes ( such as identifying lists , like BitC ) .
A disadvantage of using {...} is that in many fonts these characters look extremely similar to ( ... ) , making them harder to see ; the characters [...] are more distinct .
But in either case ( {...} or [... ] ) , using a pair means you have to match the correct closing pair , so inside many parens you have to make sure you use the right ones in the right place .
This can create much extra work , and it is debatable if they help much in error detection .
Also , infix notation is really obvious when you see it ... so there really is n’t a big need for a special marker to show its end .
Combining this with name - prefixing does not seem hard ; just accept “ { ” for name - prefixing as well .
Combining the paired characters {...} or [...] with indented forms like I - expressions requires careful thinking about what you are doing .
In particular , if you want to identify something as a parameter of a function f and switch to infix notation , do you indent inside function f ?
I think you should , so the system should only add one level of s-expression ( from the indent ) if the first character after the indenting whitespace is “ { ” , instead of the two that would otherwise be implied .
In all other cases , other than the beginning of a line , a “ { ” would normally end up matching a “ ( ” in the corresponding s-expression if you want to stay similar to usual s-expression syntax ( if not , see the relaxed infix notation such as ZY - expressions , below ) .
This means that you need to think carefully about the meaning of {...} ( or [... ] ) .
Basically , do n’t think that {...} create a matching s-expression (... ) .
Instead , have the mindset that the infix operators (+ , - , etc. ) create the s-expressions , and that the surrounding characters {...} simply clarify that what ’s inside has an infix interpretation .
Also , do {...} disable I - expressions inside them ( as I ’ve proposed (... ) do ) , or should a “ { ” at the beginning of a line only switch to infix without disabling I -expressions ?
I ’m not sure what the meaning of indented sub-expressions would even be , if indentation still mattered .
Thus , for the moment , I ’ll assume that {...} disable I - expressions inside them , as I ’ve proposed (... ) do , for the simple reason of simplicity : if an infix expression is so complicated that it goes beyond one line , indentation like I - expressions are more likely to harm than help .
Note that if it ’s not automatic , there ’s a follow - on question ... how deep does infix go when it is enabled ?
Do the infix operators only work at one level ( one list ) , or do they keep going down to lists contained inside ?
This question does n’t come up if the detection is automatic , so let ’s address that next .
.
If infix is not automatic , you add characters that say “ make this infix ” , using pairs such as {...} or [...] around infix operators , or use single expressions before the first or second parameter .
The single expression might be single characters , like ?
or ! , or multiple characters , like the dispatching macro characters ( #... ) .
I do n’t recommend “ ! ” because it looks too much like “ not ” in other langauges .
Using something short is a good idea , because infix is very common .
The Lisp FAQ mentions # I being used as the “ Portable Infix Package ” marker ( I have searched and not found out more about this ; suggestions would be appreciated ) .
( This discussion mentions an author using # I ( 3+4 ) to notate infix , and remarks that [ 3+4 ] would have been simpler . ) a syntax marker is not as “ pretty ” as automatically notating infix operators , though it has the advantage of clarity if you process the resulting s-expressions often .
Kantrowitz ’s infix macro package for Common Lisp is an example of this approach .
Automatic .
To work automatically , if some parameters look infix , then an infix interpretation is used .
E.G. , if presented with “ ( 3 * 4 ) ” , it is automatically interpreted as “ (* 3 4 ) ” internally .
There are two major variants that I can see : ( 1 ) if the first or second parameter is an infix - type operator switch to infix notation ( Norvig ’s approach ) , or ( 2 ) only the second parameter can be infix to trigger infix processing ( my approach ) .
The first approach has the advantage that it can work with prefixed “ - ” traditionally , e.g. , (- x * y ) works , becoming ( * (- x ) y ) .
But there are also many problems with that approach .
For example , then it is much harder to use traditional Lisp notation ( with the infix operator in front ) at the same time , and it ’s easier to get confused when looking at traditional s-expression notation .
It is all too easy to accidentally trigger the infix notation when it was n’t intended .
And the traditional Lisp notation (- x ) is not that hard to write or read ; if you support traditional function notation , like -( x ) , it 's even easier .
Finally , if you only trigger on the second parameter , you can add a subtle safety check : the switch to infix notation can be made to only occur if there are three or more parameters .
This safety check avoids unintentionally enabling infix in some cases , and makes it very simple to implement trivial quoting mechanisms : since expressions like “ ( self + ) ” will not be interpreted as being infix , using functions as parameters is simplified .
In fact , you can go further on the safety check :
You can say that infix lists have to have an odd number of parameters , and that the first parameter ( as displayed ) cannot be an infix operator ( so a list of infix operators wo n't cause problems ) .
I think the second approach is much better .
For fully - traditional infix notation , the first is slightly better , and we ’ll discuss that later , but for our purposes I do n't think it 's as useful .
If it ’s automatic , now you need to determine the legal pattern of infix operators , since they will trigger the infix interpretation .
This is probably some sort of regular expression ; we ’ll discuss this below .
You ’ll also need a syntax to say when it is not infix at least ( to disable the automatic part ) .
Again , this can be identified using surrounding pairs such as {...} or [...] around non-infix operators , or using single expressions before the first or second parameter to declare that this is not infix .
For functions , in many real - world use cases Common Lisp ’s #’ notation or simply “ ( function + ) ” would do .
Indeed , if at least three parameters are required for infix , any function that simply returns its second parameter could do the escaping .
As noted below , I 'm currently using " as ( + ) " aka " ( as + ) " to do this escaping .
Automatic approaches , either way , are in some sense a little “ hackish ” .. the second parameter determines the order of parameters in the resulting s-expression !
Yet it produces very nice - looking results , and I suspect that over time it will become workable .
After all , in all other languages you have to look for infix operators too , so this actually not that strange a requirement .
And the results ( shown elsewhere ) are startlingly clear .
You might still have an optional “ make this infix ” syntax indicator as well , or at least a “ warning , this is infix ” , which can be used when printing .
That way , when you read a result as infix , you ’ll get warned that the expression is infix .
If this is optional , you might still want to make it very short , since you may have to read a lot of them in printouts .
For example , let ’s say that #_ means “ no infix ” and is placed before the first parameter ( mnemomic : “ base case ” ) , while ?
means “ infix notation follows ” is placed before the first ( displayed ) parameter ( #^ might make a reasonable alternative ) .
Thus , “ ( 3 + 4 ) ” , “ ( ?3 + 4 ) ” , and “ ( #_+ 3 4 ) ” could all mean the same as “ (+ 3 4 ” ) , and the “ car ” of all of them is “ + ” .
Or , if [...] are the infix warnings , [ x >= 4 ] is a way to hint that the s-expression is actually ( >= x 4 ) .
Of course , if the notation permits mixed infix and prefix notations , you can easily have a “ manual ” notation that just means “ turn on autodetection all the way down from here ” and end up having a combination of properties .
Alan Manuel K. Gloria ’s “ infix notation macro ” is a good example of a mixture - in this implementation , there must be an initial marker ( nfx ... ) , but it then descends all the way down to all subexpressions .
As a result , you could use the marker at a very high level , and have a result similar to automatic detection .
A similar result could be had by having a function like “ ( enable - infix ) ” or “ ( sugar ) ” which you could insert at the beginning of a file as a top - level command ( this could also enable indenting and the name - prefixing notation ) , which would then enable the infix operations ( even at the topmost level ) until specifically disabled .
Using such a command would mean that everything below , for the rest of the file , would use automatic infix detection ... but since there would be a specific a command to enable it first , it would be compatible with existing code ( which did n’t enable infix ) .
A command - line flag , or invoking a command with a different name ( possibly via a different file extension ) , could enable automatic detection of infix notation .
What are the legal infix operators ?
If detection of infix operators is automatic , now you need to determine the legal pattern of infix operators , since they will trigger the infix interpretation .
Even if it ’s manually triggered , if you permit arbitrary expressions , or want error - checking of the operators ( ” you said this was infix but there were none ” ) you ’ll need to detect infix operators .
There are several options :
You could support only a fixed list (+ , - , etc. ) .
That is very inflexible , though .
You could start with a fixed list , and allow the user to specify which ones to add / override .
The additions would probably include information on precedence and direction ( right or left ) , and if so , these additions would need to be made before they are used .
One big risk is that if the infix expressions are read before the commands to make the additions , the infix expressions would be misinterpreted .
You could define some sort of pattern .
The pattern needs to be simple , so humans can easily remember it .
This has the advantage of not depending on proper setup of a table of operators .
You could support default patterns and allow additions as well , if you wanted to .
Or define a pattern , but it's an error to USE the pattern before declaring it ( and maybe its precedence ) .
If we use a pattern , what is the pattern ?
Patterns are often expressed as regular expressions ( REs ) , and an obvious RE for this purpose is : [+-\*/<>= ]+.
Basically , it has to be a set of one or more special characters .
( One alternative , which might be nice , would be that it has to start with a special character , but after that , other characters are allowed ; be wary that +h1 is an infix operator but +1 is not ) .
This is enough to cover the 4 arithmetic expressions (+ , - , * , and / ) , and all the usual comparisons ( < , <= , = , >= , > ) .
It ’s also enough to cover other operations that people like to have as infix , such as “ ** ” ( exponentiate ) , “ - > ” ( implies ) , “ <-> ” ( if and only if ) , and so on .
You can probably add “ & ” , which is enough to represent common representations of “ and ” .
But there are some issues , especially with the characters not noted here :
Adding “ : ” is tempting , because “ : ” and “ : : ” are sometimes used as infix operators ( BitC uses “ : ” for declaring types ) .
On the other hand , “ : ” is sometimes used as filler , so there are pluses and minuses to including it in the pattern .
In Common Lisp , a “ : ” by itself is not a problem ( it ’s illegal normally ) , but the “ : ” separates package names from their symbols .
In addition , in Common Lisp a blank package name ( e.g. , :x ) is a keyword ... so anything with a colon at the beginning or middle is probably going to be a problem .
Similarly , a Scheme proposal ( SRFI 88 ) proposed using names ending in “ : ” as keywords , with SFRI 89 using them for optional parameters .
Thus , while a single colon ( :) appears to be a fine name for an infix operator , more complex names with colons in them appear to be more problematic for backward - compatibility with existing Lisp - like systems .
One possible concession would be to say that “ and ” and “ or ” are specially recognized as infix operators ; that ’s a kludge , though all Lisp - like languages have “ and ” and “ or ” operators , so it would make sense .
On the other hand , if infix operators automatically switch lists to infix notation , s- expressions of sentences like “ ( Jack and Jill ) ” would silently become “ ( and Jack Jill ) ” - and that seems dangerous .
It especially seems dangerous if s-expressions are sometimes displayed with automatic infix notation without any indication that the parameter order has changed .
So I think this is an unwise choice , even though at first it seems reasonable ... but that still begs the question of how to represent " and " and " or " , since these are incredibly common infix operations .

Many languages use && or & to represent " and " , and use || or | to represent " or " .
Adding “ | ” or “ || ” is tempting because it is a common notation for “ or ” , and in Scheme the character is reserved for possible future extensions anyway .
But simply adding it to the list of allowed symbols is more problematic , because in Common Lisp the “ | ” already has a meaning - it escapes symbol text until the next “ | ” .
So if “ | ” keeps its usual meaning , then “ | ” as an operator has to be written as “ \| ” in Common Lisp ( yuk ) .
But there 's a clever trick here - the syntax " || " can always be used to mean " or " , whether or not " | " has the special role of escaping symbol text .
This would mean that in Common Lisp , the function 's name would actually be an empty string (! )... but since its name would print as " || " , it would look quite clear and understandable .
This would n't be combinable with " = " , ( e.g. , " += " is a fine atom , but " ||= " would immediately simplify to " = " ) ... but that seems liveable .
It would be possible to force a literal | as the real symbol , but this would look ugly ; \| or \|\| is hideous for code reading .
In Scheme and many other LISPs this would be a non-issue ; the || would just be interpreted as a two - character name for an atom , which is fine .
The & can be confusing in some contexts , too ; it is sometimes interpreted specially in parameter lists .
But as far as I can tell , & is not normally interpreted in any special way outside of parameter lists , and even there , && is n't normally accepted .
It 's certainly possible to use " ^ " to represent " and " ( using ** for the power operator ) , but that still begs how to represent " or " ; few keyboards provide the mathematical " or " symbol ( an upside - down wedge ) .
So && and || are probably reasonable text representations for logical " and " and " or " ... which is certainly consistent with typical practice .
Note that " and " and " or " are special forms in Scheme ( and many other Lisps ) , so that they can short - circuit ; this means that redefining them is often more complicated .

An unfortunate oddity happens with Scheme : Scheme actually defines a “ =gt ; ” syntactic marker in its “ cond ” processing , and it occurs as the second parameter .
This means that if you are using the second parameter to automatically detect infix operations , you will almost certainly consider this construct to be an infix operation .
Unfortunately , you cannot solve this by creating a new simple function => that can handle this ( having only one form at this location changes the meaning of the construct ) .
There are several solutions ; two obvious ones are to require manual detection or to have a specific list of infix operations .
Another solution is to specifically state that “ = > ” is excluded from the pattern of allowable infix operators , at least for Scheme .
You can partly justify this on the additional grounds that -> and => are easily confused .
It would probably be possible to solve this with a complex Scheme - unique macro for => that essentially restored its original meaning , though this will probably cause problems if an error occurs nearby ; I think simply declaring that it 's not an infix operator when processing Scheme is safer .

How do you represent assignment and field accessors , if the underlying language has them ?
The pattern supports " = " , but if you use " = " , then you have the problem that this is easily confused with equal - to .
This is one of the big problems with C and C++ ( confusing = with == ) , and it'd be unfortunate to duplicate that mistake .
In addition , if the system maps any infix name directly to the identical prefix function names , then you may not have a choice ... in most Lisp - like systems , " = " is already an equality operator .
The term " < - " is compelling for assignment , and " -> " is compelling for field access , but the two do not go together well ; just imagine deciphering " x -> a <- b -> c " .
Parentheses help , e.g. , " ( x -> a ) <- ( b -> c ) " - but it 's still a little awkward .
One possibility is to use a different form for assignment , such as " < --" or " < == " .
The term " < == " is actually fairly easy to distinguish , so " x -> a < == b -> c " is easier to read , and " ( x -> a ) < == ( b -> c ) " is actually especially nice .
Another possibility is to use " < - " for assignment , and use [...] as a field accessor .
That looks nice : x [ a ] <- b[c ]
But if we use [... ] , we need to figure out what general function to map [...] to , and we just lost the phrase [...] for other purposes ( such as describing special lists ) .
( For sweet - expressions , I 'll presume that the language or user will define the infix macros / functions , and not add [...] simply because it 's easier and more general not to . )

Since Unicode / ISO
10646 is finally becoming widely available , and many systems can process them ( e.g. , using UTF - 8 encoding ) , additional infix symbols could be accepted that are not in ASCII .
This would certainly resolve the “ and ” and “ or ” issues , since there are standard mathematical symbols for them : ∧ ( ” logical and ” ) is character U+2227 ( decimal 8743 ) and ∨ ( ” logical or ” ) is character U+2228 ( decimal 8744 ) .
See Unicode symbols chart , especially the mathematical operators chart , for more information .
The character set from U+2200 through U+22 FF is allocated to mathematical symbols .
This will remind those of us who ’ve been around a while of APL !
Probable characters for infix operators include U+2227 ( ” and ” ) , U+2228 ( ” or ” ) , U+220A ( ” element of ” ) , U+2209 ( ” not an element of ” ) , U+220B ( ” contains as member ” ) , U+220C ( ” does not contain as member ” ) , U+2229 ( ” intersection ” ) , U+222A ( ” union ” ) , U+225D ( ” defined as ” ) , U+2260 ( ” not equal to ” ) , U+2254 ( ” colon equals ” ) , U+2282 ( ” subset of ” ) , U+2283 ( ” superset of ” ) , U+2284 ( ” not a subset of ” ) , U+2285 ( ” not a superset of ” ) , U+2286 ( ” subset of or equal to ” ) , U+2287 ( ” superset of or equal to ” ) , U+2288 ( ” neither a subset of or equal to ” ) , U+2289 ( ” neither a superset of nor equal to “ ) , U+228A ( ” subset of with not equal to ” ) , U+228B ( ” superset of with not equal to ” ) , U+22C8 ( ” bowtie ” - sometimes used for join ) , U+22 BB ( ” xor ” ) , and U+22 BC ( ” nand ” ) .
But not everyone has good support for these yet , so while include a set of Unicode infix operators in the standard set might be a good idea ( anticipating their use ) , it ’s probably premature to require their use .
If the printing routines normally convert to infix , then you need to not have a pattern that is likely to be engaged unintentionally ... which are good reasons to not have the terms “ and ” and “ or ” be infix operators , and certainly a good reason to stay away from anything other than an isolated “ : ” .
You can probably limit the regular expression length , say up to 3 - 6 characters , to help limit unintentional conversions as well .
I would not include “ and ” and “ or ” , instead add & and | to the infix operators ( and say that | has to be escaped ) , and limit it so it must be 1 through 4 characters in length .
I would accept “ : ” alone ( so it can be used for infix type declarations ) , but nothing else with colons .
These considerations suggest that “ = > ” be quietly prevented from being an infix opreator , and then use this regular expression for infix operators ;
[+-\*/<>=&\|\p{Sm}]{1-4}|\:|\|\|
As a related matter , you need to decide how to separate infix operators from non-infix operators .
In many other language families , “ x - y ” would be parsed as x minus y .
Unfortunately , in many Lisp - like languages , names often include typical infix operator characters such as “ - ” .
Both Common Lisp and Scheme would be unusable without the - symbol , because they have many functions with “ - ” in the name ( in addition , Scheme has a convention where “ - > ” embedded in the name indicates a conversion ) .
The simplest and most obvious approach is to require that any infix operator be surrounded by whitespace ; this is very easy for humans to remember , and is consistent with normal s-expression syntax anyway .
You could require escaping such characters as part of a name , e.g. | simple - string - p| or simple\ - string\-p , but this is both ugly and unnecessarily incompatible with common practice .
If you ’re devising a new language , you could simply forbid such characters in regular symbol names , and then you could automatically detect all the infix operators without requiring that they be surrounded by whitespace .
However , for general - purpose parsing , sweet - expressions will require that infix operators be surrounded by whitespace ( in cases where function names do n't have such symbols , this requirement could be relaxed ) .
What are the semantics of the infix operations ?
Once we detect that we are using infix notation , what are the semantics of the “ infix ” notation ?
Swap first two parameters .
An extremely easy - to - implement and general approach is to just swap the first two parameters .
A good idea for this case would be to require exactly 3 parameters -- that way , we wo n’t accidentally screw things up , because when limited to exactly 3 parameters , there ’s no difference between swapping and the normal interpretation of infix .
This is trivial to implement , and yet it ’s enough to implement basic infix operators in a way that looks nicer .
This means that the presented expression is very similar to the actual s-expression , which has its advantages .
If you want to add a fancier infix format later , this approach is a reasonable stepping - stone towards that .
Allow chaining ( duplication ) of identical operator .
This extends the previous option , but you can have an odd number of parameters , and the even ones much match .
Thus , ( 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 ) becomes (+ 3 4 5 6 ) . Trivial to implement ( just swap the first two parameters and ensure the rest match ) .
This approach makes it possible to fully use the capabilities of underlying functions that allow multiple parameters , and that 's a good thing .
Interestingly enough , Common Lisp ’s definition of comparison operators would make expressions like ( x <= y < z ) work as it does in mathematics !
Note that this does not support precedence , so you have to surround different operators with parenthesis or indents , e.g. , ( 3 + ( 5 * 6 ) ) .
In one view , that 's a disadvantage - you still have to indicate some information that would be automatic in other languages .
On the other hand , this makes when there are new lists explicit , and that has some pretty big advantages .
It also sidesteps the problems of defining precedence ( either fixed or a way to add them ) .
Those are pretty big advantages .
There are many options for determining when things are n't correct , and then deciding if that is an error or merely an indicator that infix was not intended .
Note that this only supports an odd number of parameters , and obviously there should n't be an infix operator presented as the first parameter in the text .
Doing otherwise could be an error , or could be an indicator that it should not be treated as infix .
For the moment , I 'll plan to consider both as an indicator that infix was not intended .
This only permits all the operators to be identical - if they 're different , but all infix operators , then the writer probably intended some sort of precedence ( and so an error should be reported ) .
Otherwise , infix was probably not intended , so again , I 'd probably interpret that as " not infix " .
Full infix of binary operations , with precedence rules .
Allow infix and add precedence rules (* before + , etc. ) .
This would mean that “ ( 3 + 4 * 5 ** 2 ) ” would quietly transform into the s-expression “ (+ 3 (* 4 (** 5 2 ) ) ) ” .
In cases where it is important that you be able to clearly see the mapping between the surface presentation and the underlying s-expression , just do n’t use precedence - instead , parenthesize ( so those who do not need to see that representation do n’t have to ) .
This is trivial to implement in Lisp ... the problem is what to do about the precedence of unknown operators .
You ’d need to either not support precedence of them , have a default for unknown operators , or have a way to set precedence values ( and make sure the settings are read before processing the code ) .
Setting precedence is easy enough , but its disadvantage is that it invites trouble - you need to make sure that the rules are set before the parameters are swapped , and mistakes could result in hard to find errors .
Left association could probably be safely assumed for more than one instance of the same unknown operator .
Alternatives are giving unknown operators a specific precedence relative to other operators ... or simply requiring that other operator ’s precedence be made clear with parentheses ( or their equivalent ) .
Predefining precedence for common functions , and requiring statements about the others , is n’t a bad thing ; people usually do n’t want to have varying precedence tables ( it ’s confusing ) , and they also do n’t want to memorize large tables .
Again , I suggest making duplicate operators ( 3 + 4 + 5 ) turn into one s-expression (+ 3 4 5 ) ; have the user override if they want something different .
Here , we do n’t allow prefix / suffix operators , such as “ - x ” , or suffix operators , like “ x ! ” .
There is a trade - off here ; prefix / suffix do n’t work well with automatic detection or trying to also read traditional s-expressions correctly - it would be all too easy to misread such expressions .
Using name - prefix notation for them , such as - ( x ) , is a very reasonable alternative .
Full infix of binary and non-binary operations , with precedence rules .
This is like the above , only now we also allow prefix operators , such as as “ - x ” , or suffix operators , like “ x ! ” .
Allowing them adds a little extra flexibility , and might make sense if the specific expression is always manually marked as being infix .
But it has many problems , as noted earlier .
Precedence rules
If you have precedence rules , what are they , and are they controllable ?
It 's not hard to add a command that sets precedence rules , but there 's always the problem that you risk not getting that called at the " right time " ( before reading ) .
Worse , if there are global precedence rules that can be changed , setting them in one environment may manipulate another ( unintended ) environment , so now we have to have a parameter for ( read ) , and that may be hard to pass down .
This is particularly a problem for Lisp - like systems , where you may have multiple levels and meta - levels that you might not want to interact .
Another big challenge is that if different developers set precedences , it 's harder to combine their code .
Different operations may have different meanings in different circumstances , so the lack of control over precedence can be a problem too .
A chain of the same operation can normally be combined into a single operation with all those parameters , e.g. , ( a + b + c ) should become (+ a b c ) .
This adds capability , without any problems or loss .
Everyone agrees that * and / should have the same precedence , both of which have greater precedence than the equal - precedence binary + and - , and that all of these are left - to - right .
So in theory that , at least , could be implemented .
Originally I thought that it may be best to just implement those universal rules , and normally use parentheses most everywhere else for controlling infix precedence ( or at least discourage lots of precedence - setting ) .
Chaining is fine , but as discussed below , precedence causes a lot of problems in many use cases , so in the end I decided against them for sweet - expressions .
Printing expressions that might be infix- able
So far , I ’ve primarily discussed how to read in expressions , but expressions need to be printed too .
A likely answer is “ just print s- expressions as usual ” by default .
That means that the output would be “ (+ 3 4 ) ” , even if the input was “ ( 3 + 4 ) ” .
For debugging code , this is probably a Good Thing .
There might be value in presenting expressions back with some infix operations “ re-inserted ” , at least as some sort of “ pretty - printing ” function or option .
It might be wise to identify which lists are being interpreted as infix in these cases ( e.g. , by surrounding them with {...} ) .
I think there is no reason to try to redo precedence when re-displaying ; showing how the lists are actually stored is very clear and eliminates questions about precedence .
Thus , if “ ( 3 + 4 * 5 ) ” is input , the resulting s-expression would be “ (+ 3 (* 4 5 ) ) ” , and the infix - printer might show this as “ { 3 + { 4 * 5}} ” .
Combining infix with Name - prefixing
There is a subtlety when combining name - prefixing with automatic infix : I think people expect an infix expression to be considered a single expression , even though at first it appears to be a multi- parameter list .
For example , most people would accept this syntax for calling function f with two parameters , x and y :
f(x y )
However , if infix is normally done automatically , they would expect this to be computed with f given one parameter , not three :
f(x + y )
Note that this is actually a very nice thing ; it means that in many cases , name - prefixing causes the number of parentheses that need writing to reduce .
So the original Lisp :
( f (+ x y ) )
f(x + y )
Infix control
There is likely to be a need to control infix processing .
These should be a standard way of saying “ disable infix ” and “ enable infix ” .
You 'd like to be able to enable or disable infix at only one level , in particular , so that you could leave infix on as the default and yet disable it in one particular expression .
It would be especially useful to have an “ enable infix for this one level of expression ” operation that must receive an expression that “ looks like an infix expression ” or it is in error .
The following text are some very early ideas on the topic ; I include them here , but it 's all very early , and at least some is likely to be very wrong .
Still , you may find useful thoughts here .
One implementation issue is that macros work from outside in , and most macros will not expect special additional macros .
In particular , it might be very useful to cuddle an infix operator with a macro that says do not use infix , like this ( where " as " means " as-is " ) :
( define as ( + ) ...)
There should be a standard way of inserting at the beginning of a file or read - eval - print loop “ please switch to and from special processing , and for setting some of its options ( e.g. , infix control ) .
For debugging , you could just print s-expressions as now .
However , a standard way to request printing these expressions that shows infix as such , but marking infix operators and non-infix , would be a good idea and each list which could be misinterpreted as an infix expression but is not has another marker .
This implies a need for a marker that says “ the following list is an infix expression and it ’s an error if it is not ” .
If adding specific new infix operations is supported ( such as “ and ” and “ or ” ) , a standard name and syntax for this add operation would be a good idea too .
Ideally , the external interfaces for these operations be pseudo - standard across all Lisp - like notations .
Bridging the gap between Common Lisp and Scheme might be challenging for a standard interface ( in some cases string parameters might be needed ; string syntax is now universal , but other syntax is not - e.g. , the keyword syntax of Common Lisp is incompatible with the proposed keyword syntax for Scheme ) .
The notation for controlling all this is to be determined .
Here ’s a start .
Originally , I looked at implementing another # character option .
If you want to do that , you might look for sharpsign options that no one one currently uses , examining sources such as the Common Lisp Hyperspec ( particularly the sharpsign section ) , the R5RS Scheme specification , the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual , as well as less - common systems like NewLisp .
Using # I for infix is tempting , but Scheme uses # i for inexact ; it ’s not clear if # I would get interpreted the same way on some systems , but it ’s not worth risking and might be confusing to developers anyway .
I especially considered using #/ to mean " infix " .
The #@ combination is used by Emacs Lisp , so we should avoid that .
However , Scheme only supports one - character lookahead ; if you want to be able to call the " ordinary " Scheme reader for other #- beginning constructs , there is n't an easy way to do that - because to read the character after # , you have to consume the # , making that more difficult to do .
So I do n't think beginning with # is a good idea .
I ’ve looked for some possible notation , under the presumption that this is a future standard format common to Common Lisp and Scheme ( so we need something unallocated by either ) .
A simple approach might this naming convention , with function - call - like macros :
nfx ( ... ) :
Everything inside is interpreted as infix if it can , recursively .
unfx ( ... ) : Everything inside is NOT infix , recursively .
nfx1 ( ... ) :
The immediately contained inside is infix , and it is an error if it is not .
unfx1 ( ... ) :
The immediately contained expression is not infix .
Each of the above could either accept a single list ( in which case it 's the list that is being referred to ) , otherwise it is the expression itself as the rest of its parameters that is being referred to .
Since any infix expression must have at least three parameters ( 2 if unary operators are used ) , this is n't ambiguous .
We could interpret unfx ( ... ) around a second parameter to quietly disable infix processing .
Alternatively , we could have a different function / macro name such as " as ( ... ) " .
This would Treat the inside ( function ) as - is , so it wo n't be considered an infix operation ( use this if an infix operator is the second parameter , but you do n't want the expression to be considered infix ) .
Here 's an example :
defun as (+) ( left right ) ...
One interesting challenge in doing this is recursion in the read function .
I decided to implement much of the processing in the reader , and to have the processing go " as I go " in the reader , rather than have the reader automatically add nfx ( ) in front of expressions and then have eval ( ) fix it up by calling a macro .
Since the reader is called on ordinary data in s-expression format , it is very inconvenient to automatically have the reader add nfx ( ) , etc. calls !
Yet if there is no outermost call to " fix up " the expression , then the outermost parameters would be defun , define , or other terms that would not handle these macro calls correctly .
And you dare not remove things piecemeal - read can be called recursively , so if you call read , remove things partly , but then later all " fix up " all the way down again , you can " unfix " things .
This is one reason to have a separate " as " function , so that these different forms can be differentiated .
Note that “ (s ( b ) ) ” is interpreted as you might expect during sweet - expression processing , but ( s ( b ) ) is interpreted as the s-expression ( ( s b ) ) , not ( s ( b ) ) .
In practice this is not a problem - nobody likes the format ( s ( b ) ) for s-expressions , and not all s-expression processors would even accept them .
More also needs to be done to describe their interaction with macros ; this is a critical area and hard to get right , but since there is relatively little that is changing , this may not be so bad .
A simple program could transform an existing program to sweet - expression format , including its comments , and with any necessary markers to control infix interpretation .
I expect that the need for controlling infix interpretation will be exceedingly rare , so the results should look very nice .
Infix implementations
Many , many people have implemented infix processors .
Here are some , not including the many larger notational systems ( like IACL2 ) that have an infix notation built into them :
A simple Lisp program that converts infix to s-expression format is available as part of Peter Norvig ’s book , “ Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach . ”
This code ’s license appears to be open source software .
Besides the usual disclaimers , it says , “ 3 .
The origin of this software must not be misrepresented , either by explicit claim or by omission ” and “ 4 .
Altered versions must be plainly marked as such , and must not be misrepresented as being the original software .
Altered versions may be distributed in packages under other licenses ( such as the GNU license ) . ”
Alan Manuel K. Gloria ’s “ infix notation macro ” is extremely promising .
His approach is to create a macro “ nfx ” , and then put spaces around everything .
From then on , everything inside transitively can use either infix or prefix notation .
It detects which lists are infix by examining the second parameter , and determining if it is in a list of infix operators .
At this time the license intends to allow arbitrary use , though not in a clear legal manner .
Mark Kantrowitz wrote an infix reader macro that is typical of many such packages ( dated Jan 18 , 1995 ) ; his runs on Common Lisp .
It is often mentioned , though its restrictive license makes it useless to many .
It “ allows the user to type arithmetic expressions in the traditional way ( e.g. , 1+2 ) when writing Lisp programs instead of using the normal Lisp syntax ( e.g. , (+ 1 2 ) ) .
It is not intended to be a full replacement for the normal Lisp syntax .
If you want a more complete alternate syntax for Lisp , get a copy Apple ’s MLisp or Pratt ’s CGOL .
Although similar in concept to the Symbolics infix reader ( # < DIAMOND > ) , no real effort has been made to ensure compatibility beyond coverage of at least the same set of basic arithmetic operators .
There are several differences in the syntax beyond just the choice of # I as the macro character .
( Our syntax is a little bit more C - like than the Symbolics macro in addition to some more subtle differences . )
It is not open source software ; deriv
Perhaps the key failing of those who despise the market in favor of government control is their misunderstanding of what wealth is and how it is produced .
In a way , the prosperity resulting from the industrial revolution has impaired our ability to appreciate the complex system that produces the myriad of products and services we consume .
Before the advent of industrial production most people lived in fairly autarkic circumstances .
They produced what they consumed and vice versa .
The ever - increasing division of labor and the widespread use of a common medium of exchange have radically increased man 's ability to create wealth , while at the same time fundamentally altering the common person 's understanding of what wealth is .
Most people I know have surprisingly childish views about wealth and money .
Government schools have no doubt had a hand in this phenomenon , but it was facilitated by the seemingly spontaneous processes of modern production that we have come to take for granted .
I 'm sure we all remember being young and wanting things our parents could n't afford .
The stores always seemed to have an endless supply of stuff just sitting around .
Why could n't we have some ?
Our friends all seemed to have as much as they wanted .
So what 's the problem ?
At one time or another we became acquainted with the cliché , " money does n't grow on trees , " or some similar derivative .
Now , for most people reading this ( except the really ancient ones ) , this statement was an outright lie .
Ok , perhaps lie is the wrong word since there was no intent to deceive on our parents ' part , but it was false nonetheless .
Money does grow on trees , and in trees , and out of trees .
It 's made of paper .
But notwithstanding this sophomoric observation , what they probably meant to say is , wealth does n't grow on trees .
It is this distinction many parents fail to make clear to their children , probably because they do n't grasp it themselves .
The function of money is exchange , although as a by - product it also makes possible the calculation necessary for complex economic activity .
It is not wealth in and of itself .
It is neither a production nor a consumption good .
Its function is merely to facilitate the exchange of goods and services in a way bartering never could .
From a logical standpoint , there is little difference between barter and money transactions .
In both cases it is the actual , physical goods that are being exchanged .
The money just serves as a helpful medium .
Money is not a store of value as some claim .
Value is subjective and can't reside in an inanimate object .
But in a figurative sense , money represents production .
Money carries with it an expectation .
We see it as the symbol of our productive effort , which can be traded for the things we desire .
That 's why we accept it .
We expect that others will do the same .
In our minds , money becomes the physical embodiment of our sweat , our hard effort , our ideas , our achievements , and our labor .
It is these things , and the material goods they produce , that do not grow on trees .
The money we currently use does .
But money did n't always grow on trees .
It used to be hidden deep underground and it took a lot of time and hard work to dig it up and make it usable .
It used to last indefinitely .
It used to be extremely difficult to counterfeit .
This was why it became money in the first place .
But now we 've done away with all those ancient superstitions and foolish notions of security .
The gods of democracy have brought us a new kind of money .
We were told that the old money was just too rigid to work in a complex economy such as ours .
This new money is much more “ flexible . ”
H.L. Mencken once wrote , “ Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard . ”
Well , apparently we want flexible money , and as Gary North has observed , “ The public is going to get flexible money , good and hard . ”
The switch from commodity to paper money is a product of the same mentality that causes children ( and adults ) to wish for a money tree .
It is the desire to be a non-producing consumer , or in other words , a parasite .
A person in possession of a money tree could consume indefinitely without giving any productive output in exchange .
The goods he consumes must be produced by other men and yet he adds nothing to the supply of goods for consumption .
He is not trading his production for that of his neighbors .
He has expropriated what would otherwise be consumed by other people and in this sense he is a thief .
That which he steals seems to be given up freely , but this is not the case .
The fact that I have money says to others , look , I have produced something valuable .
Now let me trade that production ( in the form of money ) for what you have produced .
The owner of a money tree has not produced and in that sense he is not only a thief but a liar also .
Every dollar he picks from the tree is a lie that is used to enslave other men .
Theft is a form of slavery .
Stealing the production of another man after it is produced is hardly different than enslaving him and forcing him to produce for your benefit in the first place .
In this case the theft is performed through an insidious deception that is all the more dangerous for its subtlety .
The fraud does not fall directly on the first recipients but is passed on unawares and only gradually does it make itself evident .
It was precisely the " inflexible ” nature of purely commodity money that kept it from becoming a tool of slavery and theft ( in any significant sense . )
But man 's ingenuity knows no bounds and his deviousness is often formidable .
The money tree mentality is as old as time .
The Romans fell prey to its hypnotic spell and it proved their undoing .
In the medieval ages it was known as alchemy and many wealthy men squandered their inheritance in search of the philosopher 's stone and it 's siren song of unearned gold .
But it was n't until more sophisticated markets began to emerge , and people started using paper money substitutes that we became susceptible to fraud on such a grand scale .
Fractional reserve banking was the root system from which the money tree sprang .
People began to forget what money was .
Not only did they confuse money with wealth , they also lost sight of the difference between money and money substitutes .
Exchange and consumption replaced capital accumulation and production as the perceived foundation of economic activity .
It was only a matter of time before someone came along who could convince people that trees really did produce money , and that they would all be better off because of it .
The second part was not much harder than the first .
One need only play on the ignorance of the common people and on the greed of the rest .
Before long this new money was being showered down on the world like autumn leaves in the forest .
The public thought that they had found in the state a magical money tree that would shower them with prosperity in their youth and security in their old age .
But it was those in power who had found the real cash cow in the form of a sheepish public willing to be fleeced ad libitum through use of the state 's funny money .
They are a very exclusive clique and they do n't take kindly to competition .
Counterfeiters beware !
In his new book Money , Bank Credit and Economic Cycles , Jesus Huerta De Soto does a masterful job of explaining the origins and pitfalls of fiat money .
He makes the observation that “ We could liken banks ' creation of money through credit expansion to the opening of Pandora 's box . ”
This is the dangerous box from Greek mythology that once opened , unleashed plague , sorrow and poverty on mankind .
This is a particularly fitting metaphor since most of the statist plagues that currently inflict us are only made possible by the massive amounts of wealth our rulers siphon unseen from the private sector by simply shaking the money tree .
It is wealth , or in other words production , which does not grow on trees despite all the statist attempts to make us believe otherwise .
There is no philosopher 's stone and even if there were it could not produce wealth .
Paper is not wealth .
Gold is not wealth .
Nature does not accept either .
She accepts only that which conforms to her laws .
Nowhere in the halls of power will ever be found the ability to repeal the law of scarcity or to cause the earth to yield its bounty without constant effort on our part .
Nature will not be cheated , and if it seems that we have succeeded in doing so it is only because the consequences are lying in wait , just out of sight .
In his essay entitled Compensation , Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote the following .
“ Life invests itself with inevitable conditions , which the unwise seek to dodge …
If he escapes them in one part , they attack him in another more vital part .
If he has escaped them in form , and in the appearance , it is because he has resisted his life , and fled from himself , and the retribution is so much death .
… It would seem , there is always this vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares , even into the wild poesy in which the human fancy attempted to make bold holiday , and to shake itself free of the old laws , –this back - stroke , this kick of the gun , certifying that the law is fatal ; that in nature nothing can be given , all things are sold …
If [ the ] price is not paid , not that thing but something else is obtained … it is impossible to get any thing without its price . ”
The world has been sold the idea of government - managed fiat money as a means to prosperity .
We have been sold the idea that there really is a money tree that will shade us from the effects of the business cycle and provide us with eternal affluence and greater material equality .
We have been paying for these delusions ever since , and we will keep paying .
But the final price for this transaction has yet to be reckoned .
At some point we will be forced to realize that we have not been sold the thing we had hoped for , but in the words of Emerson , " something else is obtained . "
If left unchecked , the price for that something else may well be the very civilization that generations have strived so hard to build .
The most powerful form of theft and slavery ever devised has been placed in the hands of villains and demagogues .
With it they vastly redistribute income , wage destructive wars all over the globe and wreak havoc on social relations .
They do all this from behind a shroud of Keynesian legitimacy and this is where we must strike them .
Mises taught that , " In the long run even the most despotic governments with all their brutality and cruelty are no match for ideas . "
Neither is all the paper money they are capable of printing .
If the ideas of liberty and sound money were to flourish as they once did , the state and its printing presses could be rendered impotent .
And that is something worth working towards .
