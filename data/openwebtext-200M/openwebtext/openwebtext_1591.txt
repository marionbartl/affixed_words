An attorney representing the family of a 7 - year - old Detroit , Michigan , girl killed in a police raid filed lawsuits in state and federal courts Tuesday , accusing the police of a cover-up .
" This type of activity by a police force is unacceptable in America , " said Michigan attorney Geoffrey Fieger at a news conference in his office .
" What is equally unacceptable is the cover - up that has occurred . "
Fieger said the lawsuits allege gross negligence , a violation of civil rights and a conspiracy to cover up the violation of civil rights .
Aiyana Jones died early Sunday after she was hit by gunfire during a police raid at her home .
Detroit Assistant Police Chief Ralph Godbee has said that police were executing a search warrant for a suspect in a shooting two days earlier that killed a high school student .
He said preliminary information indicated that members of the Detroit Police Special Response Team approached the house and announced themselves as police .

2 pounds of bacon , 4 pounds of sausage , 6 pounds of ground beef … and that ’s only the beginning .
This recipe may seem excessive , but by the time this massive pot of chili is done cooking , and certainly by the time you ’ve gone through the last of it , you always want just a little bit more .
It really is that good .
It ’s not like some chili which sits in your stomach like a ton of bricks .
It ’s not too beany , or too spicy , or too smoky .
It ’s complex , with a sweet savory tang , and layers of meaty flavor throughout .
For me , it ’s the sweetness that makes this chili special .
A multi-dimensional sweetness derived from a number of ingredients : carrots ( grated so that they melt into the sauce ) , ketchup , barbecue sauce , sugar , and baker ’s chocolate .
That ’s Secret # 1 .
Secret # 2 is adding a parmesan rind to the pot .
This is an old Italian trick I learned for creating rich soups , stocks , tomato sauce , or…chili !
Remember it next time you finish off an expensive wedge of parmigiano .
After you ’re done digging away at all the edible parts , pop the rind in a freezer bag and save it for a rainy ( or shall I say chili , ha ha ha ) day .
Secret # 3 : let it simmer for a long long time .
This is one of those dishes that tastes better the next day , or the day after that .
I kid you not , I let this simmer for 6 hours or more .
I will usually make it late afternoon on a weekend , let it cook all evening , and then turn off the flame and cover it right before going to bed .
The next day , the flavors will have melded together into something amazing .
There may be a few lingering doubts in your mind about why not to make this recipe .
One being the long list of ingredients , to which I say , okay , there are a lot of ingredients , and yes , you will need to make a Costco run , but after that it ’s really easy .
You basically just add everything to a big pot and leave it alone .
Fool proof .
And worth it .
The other question may concern the alarming quantity this recipe makes .
Feeds 20 +.
Yes , it does !
But really , you ’ll be surprised at how quickly this goes , and I mean , if you ’re going to make all that effort in getting the ingredients , you might as well go the whole nine yards .
If you ’re still on the fence , consider these scenarios where a massive pot of chili makes perfect sense :
Game Day with lots of men to feed .
Is n’t the Super Bowl coming up or something ?
with lots of men to feed .
Is n’t the Super Bowl coming up or something ?
Ski weekend .
This is the perfect make - ahead meal .
All you have to do is heat it up on the stove , which is the maximum effort I usually have in me after a day on the slopes , when my quads have turned to lead .
.
This is the perfect make - ahead meal .
All you have to do is heat it up on the stove , which is the maximum effort I usually have in me after a day on the slopes , when my quads have turned to lead .
Any weekend .
Especially when it is relentlessly rainy and cold outside .
( You may know what I mean ) .
Extra bonus , this recipe freezes really well .
Store away single / double servings of this and have a warm , satisfying , homemade meal ready in minutes any time .
Now that you ’re ready for chili , the next challenge is to find a pot that is sufficiently massive .
You ’re on your own for that one .
Alright , I ’ll give you a hint : I scored mine off of Craigslist from a restaurant going out of business .
For something this size , go commercial .
" Christ told his people to repent and forsake their sinful ways ( Mat 9:13 ) .
He did not command them to form a religion in his name or to build a multi-million dollar church while the poor slept on the stoop . "
WORSHIP OF THE SUN , NOT THE SON
The graven images of Christ found in Christian churches ( in violation of the second commandment ) are often seen displaying satanic hand gestures .
These often display Jesus ' head surrounded with a halo , identical to the solar disk which adorned the pagan sun gods of Rome , Greece , and Babylon .
The Jewish faction helps obscure the true name of the Son by calling him " Yeshua " in Modern Hebrew .
The " oo " sound came via Greek influence and is not found in ancient Hebrew , which had only one neutral vowel sound .
Christ 's name could not have been Jesus , as the letter " J " did not exist until about 1500 years after His resurrection .
It is YASHAYAH , Hebrew for " savior " ( Hos 2:16 , Act 26:14 , Luk 1:47 , Mat 21:9 ) .
The name YASHAYAH was translated into Greek as " Iesaias " and then to " Iesus " by the Vatican .
The name of god venerated in churches , Jesus , derives from " Zeus , " the Greek name for the god of lightning -- Satan ( Luk 10:18 ) .
Many Christian ministers ( e.g. Billy Graham ) and Catholic priests are trained in mind - control and occultism ; some intentionally summon the demonic spirit named " Jesus " to fill their churches while falsely calling it the Holy Spirit ( The Illuminati ... Mind Control Slave , Springmeier , 178 ) .
The Christian churches are guilty of suppressing the only name by which men can be saved ( Act 4:12 ) and of breaking the first commandment by worshiping Jesus ( who they claim to be ) the Son above the Father .
This instead of living like Christ in obedience to the Father 's commandments .
Church architecture is based on pagan fertility symbolism .
Steeples are obelisk - shaped ( phallic symbols ) resting on vaulted naves ( female womb ) .
The word Church derives from the goddess Circe who represents the circular moon .
The cross and the " X " symbols ( as in Xmas ) both represent the sun and the zodiac , as does the circular communion wafer .
Easter is the astrological fertility celebration of Nimrod 's wife , Ishtar .
In pre-Christian times , the cross ( " T " ) was an idol to represent the virginally - conceived sun-god Tammuz ( Eze 8:13 - 14 , Heb 2:16 - 17 ) .
The tree is a symbol of Nimrod and forbidden by God ( Jer 10:12 ) .
Santa , a scrambling of " Satan , " is a false god for children who usurps God 's power to judge sin .
( www.met.org.za , www.macquirelatory.com/Santa Is Satan )
All Christians celebrate Christmas ( Osiris / Nimrod 's birthday , the birth of the sun- god ) , the modern equivalent of Rome 's Saturnalia ( Satan- alia ) .
Witches sacrifice a child at midnight Christmas Eve and leech emotional energy from the Christians ' " holiday spirit . "
Most Protestants uphold the Catholic tradition of a Sunday Sabbath , in opposition to God 's fourth commandment to worship on the seventh day of the week ( Saturday ) .
Sun-day worship of the sun - god ( Helios / Apollo / Lucifer ) was the custom of pre-Christian Rome .
Protestant denominations are quick to condemn the widespread iniquity , idolatry , and scriptural violations of the Catholic Church yet refuse to acknowledge that they are equally guilty ( Joh 7:38 , Mat 7:4 ) .
At least Catholics and modern pagans openly admit their defiance of the bible .
" Vatican " translates to " prophetic serpent . "
The Pope wears a fish - shaped hat identical to the Babylonian Priest of Dagon , the fish - god .
Cardinals dishonor Christ by covering their heads while praying ( 1Co 11:4 ) .
The Church is indistinguishable from the pagan priesthood of Babylon .
The parallels fill books such as " The Two Babylons " and " The Papal Worship Proved to be the Worship of Nimrod and his Wife , " ( A. Hislop . )
The Catholic Church claims its authority supersedes that of the Bible , as demonstrated by the Pope 's title " Holy Father " ( Mat 23:9 ) .
Christ warned that in the time leading up to his return , the masses would be exploited with false teachings in His name ( Mat 24 ) .
The same condemnations
He made of the hypocritical Pharisees in Matthew 23 can be directed toward modern Christian churches for teachings that are contrary to the scriptures ( Mar 7:7 , 2Jn 1:9 ) .
These Jesus images do not represent Yashayah 's historical appearance .
In the early 1500s , Pope Alexander VI employed Leonardo da Vinci to paint his son , Cesare Borgia , as Christ .
Even today , when the world pictures Christ , it pictures Cesare Borgia , a man who committed murder , incest , and sodomy ( Triptych of Poisoners , Cesare Borgia His Life and Times , Bradford ) .
This image of Christ has been preserved by both Catholic and Protestant denominations ; it was used by Catholic missionaries to enslave the natives of Central / South America and by Protestants as proof to the Negro slaves ( Judah ) that god was a white man ( Wisdom of Solomon 14:8 - 21 ) .
CHRIST TAUGHT THE LAW OF MOSES NOT PAGANISM
Christ says that the greatest commandment is to love God and that this is done by keeping his commandments .
" He that ... keepeth not [ God 's ] commandments , is a liar " ( 1Jn 2:4 , 1Jn 5:3 , Mat 22:37 , Joh 14:15 , Mat 5:17 , Joh 5:30 , 46 , Ex 20:6 ) .
Despite Christ 's words , most churches teach that the Law , including the Ten Commandments , is done away with , effectively teaching that there is no sin ( 1Jn 3:4 ) .
Christ 's sacrifice did not nullify the Law , but rather marked the end of animal sacrifice and the death penalty by giving those who believed on Him the opportunity to repent and receive forgiveness of sins ( Rom ) .
Without Law , one can pursue his own selfish or perverse lusts even through murder , theft , and deceit .
Many churches preach the prosperity doctrine , that god wants us to be rich .
This god of lawlessness and excess is not the God of the bible ; it is the god of the flesh -- Satan ( Mar 10:25 ) .
By actions , not words , we are to discern good from evil ( Mat 7:20 , 15:8 ) .
Fritz Springmeier reveals that " Magic and witchcraft are ... being taught in many Christian churches ... human sacrifices are ... being done in secret in some well known Christian churches " ( Be Wise as Serpents , i4 ) .
Anton LaVey of the Church of Satan converted Christians by explaining that those in a " witchcraft group ... practice the same basic philosophy as Christianity " without the guilt ( The Satanic Bible , 27 ) .
The difference between Christian and Satanic philosophies is that Satanists admit that their actions please Satan and anger God .
DANGERS OF MODERN CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
There is no separation of Church and state ; political agendas are pushed from the pulpit .
Preachers cannot speak about the Illuminati , the NWO , human micro-chipping , or question the Jewish people as the biblical Israelites without losing their 501 ( c ) 3 non-profit tax status .
Preachers do not teach the truth for fear that they might lose members who want sermons to make them feel good even if through lies ( Isa 30:10 ) .
As a result , many Christians will peacefully march off to FEMA camps while they are waiting to be " raptured " before the tribulation ( another false teaching ) .
Christ told his people to repent and forsake their sinful ways ( Mat 9:13 ) .
He did not command them to form a religion in his name or to build a multi-million dollar church while the poor slept on the stoop .
We are to love Christ by caring for the poor and fatherless , by obeying His Law , by eschewing evil , and by worshiping His Father in spirit and in truth ( Joh 4:24 ) .

Note from Will Newman :
I have heard interviews of David Livingstone and read some of his articles and agree with him on many counts and respect his research , however I do not draw the same conclusion as him regarding Paul .
I actually reference some of Paul 's epistles in the article , which may be confusing to the reader after reading the editor 's note .
Paul 's teachings as they are written in the NT are correct and support the Law still being in effect ( the 10 commandments et al ) .
However Paul 's writings are often misinterpreted by organized Christian churches and used to nullify the Law , which effectively means that anything goes in life :
God does n't care if you are a murderer , idolater , thief , or homosexual because there is no sin if there is no law .
The occultism found in churches is the result of deviation from , perversion , and subversion of what the Bible says .
This is the result of Satanic influences .
Paul 's writings are extremely important and I do not want it to appear that my article is anti-Paul .
I believe the entire bible including books inked by Paul .
Paul 's letters are critical in the battle against feminist ideologies and place great emphasis on the man being the head of the household .
That is why some churches attack Paul as part of the feminist agenda to empower women over men , wives over husbands , women preachers over men parishioners , etc .
I think it is relevant to link to Mr. Livingstone 's research but not to suggest we have the same conclusion on the cause of Christian occultism .
I 'm not asking you to change anything in the article , but I just wanted to clarify my position based on some of the reader comments .
A sometimes overlooked part of NHL roster management is the 50 - contract maximum .
When the Islanders make a decision like the one earlier this week with 2008 pick Jyri Niemi , they 're factoring not only whether Niemi has a place on their depth chart and is worth betting the mandatory three - year entry - level commitment -- by far the two most important concerns -- they 're also deciding if they want him taking up one of those 50 slots .
( Or in reality , less than 50 : Teams typically leave slots open as they enter the season so they can , say , break the emergency glass and add a Trevor Gillies . )
Right now , including pending free agents and non-roster players ( hello Tony Romano ) , you can see at CapGeek the Islanders ' 50 potential contracts for next season .
An important distinction here is that the 50 number relates to the year a contract is valid -- and not to this transition moment .
So an expiring free agent 's contract does not preclude you from signing Kevin Poulin , whose contract kicks in for next season .
As you can see , from Sean Bergenheim to Brett Westgarth [ IOW reminds me Westgarth was traded in March , but you get the drift ] ] the Islanders have 21 20 pending free agents .
That 's a lot of openings on the 50 - man roster , even assuming several ( Schremp , Bergenheim ) will be retained .
So it 's not like Niemi was going to get in the way , and you would n't let the 50 - contract limit cost you a legit prospect .
But if you do n't feel confident your prospect is going to be an NHL player , you do n't make the mandatory three - year entry - level commitment when you can fill several holes with minor league free agents ( like Greg Mauldin and Mark Flood last year ) .
Extra Picks Mean Extra Decisions
That leads me to another variable that we do n't consider on Draft Day when we 're celebrating a bounty of picks ( 2008 ) or , alternatively , wondering if we spent too many of those surplus picks to move up ( 2009 ) :
In two years , the club has to make fish - or - cut - bait decisions on every pick who is n't in college or Russia .
Too many prospects is a great problem to have , really , but it also means decisions like the one Garth Snow and his staff made with Niemi .
And with the June 1 signing deadline fast approaching ( and Travis Hamonic already in the fold ) , the Islanders still have a few decisions to announce ( or let pass quietly ) on 2008 picks .
Namely , Jared Spurgeon and David Ullström .
Status : Islanders 2008 Draft Picks
First , let 's reset what Snow and Ryan Jankowski ( and their army of scouts ) did with that pile of picks in 2008 , and where they are now :
1 #9 Josh Bailey Windsor ( OHL ) Signed and made team in 2008 .
Passed " Go , " collected $ 200
2 #36 Corey Trivino BU ( NCAA )
As a collegiate , his rights are retained ; has work to do
2 #40 Aaron Ness Minn . ( NCAA ) Collegiate , did n't meet higher hopes going into last year but returning to the Gophers in the fall ; his rights remain 2 # 53 Travis Hamonic Moose Jaw ( WHL ) Signed this week , will be in camp in Sept. 3 # 66 David Toews North Dakota ( NCAA )
After a tough year , is said to be leaving for the WHL , but his rights will remain 3 # 72 Jyri Niemi Saskatoon ( WHL ) Traded to the Rangers for a 6th in 2010 3 # 73 Kiril Petrov Kazan ( KHL )
Will be in prospect camp ; as a KHLer ( " defector " ) , his rights remain 4 # 96 Matt Donovan DU ( NCAA )
Promising collegiate building off another great year , his rights remain 4
# 102
David Ullström
HV71 ( Swe . )
Must be signed by June or Isles lose his rights
5 #126 Kevin Poulin Victoriaville
Signed this spring , he 'll fill one of the goalie slots in 2009 - 10 5 # 148 Matt Martin Sarnia Signed last summer , learned in Bridgeport in 2009 - 10 and might win an Isles job in Sept. 6 # 156 Jared Spurgeon Spokane Completed a successful junior career ; must be signed by June or Isles lose his rights 6 # 175 Justin Dibenedetto Sarnia Overager signed last summer , completed season in Bridgeport
The more I revisit that list , the more I still feel good about that haul .
Two years later , you can still say they may have gotten a player with every - other pick .
Reason dictates it wo n't turn out that way -- 50 % would be an insane average , particularly considering how many late - rounders there are -- but to say that two years later several of these guys still have potential NHL careers is n't bad at all .
( Another hindsight view is , would you rather have Luke Schenn or Nikita Filatov , or Josh Bailey plus the extra lottery tickets those two trade - downs yielded ?
I was fine with those moves at the time and I 'm still fine now . )
Anyway , here 's a bit more about the two players the Islanders are about to lose if we do n't hear about a signing in the near future :
David Ullström , LW/C , shoots right , 6 ' 3 " , 198 lbs .
In the context of several Swedes who must sign with their NHL clubs by June ( Note : My understanding is it 's June 1 , though several Swedish papers report it as June 15 ) .
Those Swedish papers are talking about the risk of HV71 losing Ullström to the Islanders .
( That and several articles like it are in Swedish ; here 's Google Translate . )
But they never have quotes directly from the player or his agent , so it 's unclear how seriously the Islanders are pursuing it , if at all .
Ullström is big and depicted as a good playmaker who has needed to work on his defensive game .
If he were going to meet his potential , you 'd definitely want a piece like that over here .
The question is whether the Isles think he can reach that level ( and secondarily , whether he 's interested in coming over ) .
The Islanders ' luck with selecting and developing big Nordic forwards is questionable , though so is the suggestion that their Swedes and Finns from one year to the next represents a trend rather than the massive case - by - case crapshoot known as the NHL draft .
Note : When Ullström was drafted , the current transfer agreement was n't in place , so at the time they would have expected to have Ullström 's rights for beyond two years before having to make a signing decision .
Jared Spurgeon , D , shoots right , 5 ' 9 " , 180 lbs .
Spurgeon is the more interesting case to me .
As you can see from a couple prominent write - ups , the praise for him after 2008 - 09 did not drop off in 2009 - 10 .
His assistant coach in Spokane , former NHLer Jon Klemm , raves -- the way junior coaches often do -- that Spurgeon 's intelligence and patience remind him of Klemm 's old teammate Sergei Zubov .
The problem , of course , is the size .
It 's not that small defensemen can't make it in this league -- but it is harder for them , and the Islanders happen to have small D - men lining their depth chart and prospect pool .
So the question facing them , two years after signing Jack Hillen and selecting both Aaron Ness and Spurgeon to join Mark Katic is :
Do you bet a three - year commitment on Spurgeon being able to overcome the size mismatch in the NHL ?
That 's a lot of eggs in the small - D - man basket .
Whatever their decision , we 'll know for sure very soon .
Martin Coxall is being held by police over incident which took place during John Prescott 's campaign visit to east London
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A Tory council candidate wearing a John Prescott mask was arrested today , after a Labour volunteer was punched and another knocked to the ground during the former deputy prime minister 's campaign visit to east London .
Martin Coxall , a candidate for East India and Lansbury , was led away by police after a 46 - year - old woman was punched and a 61 - year - old woman was knocked to the ground at about 2 pm .
Coxall was one of two men , both dressed in Prescott masks , involved in the incident .
Police spoke to the other man but did not arrest him .
The two women were campaigning with Prescott for the Labour parliamentary candidate for Poplar and Canning Town , Jim Fitzpatrick .
Prescott said on Twitter : " Tory council candidate in Poplar Martin Coxall attacked two women in scuffle trying to get me .
Expect this from BNP not Tories . "
Footage purporting to show Coxall being led away was posted on YouTube .
Text accompanying the video said : " Coxall only failed to reach Mr Prescott after being held back by members of the public . "
Prescott continued his visit afterwards .
The Conservative party chairman , Eric Pickles , said he had called for an inquiry into the incident .
He sent a message to Prescott on Twitter saying : " Glad you are ok hope no one hurt – I have asked for a party investigation – physical force is unacceptable in politics . "
A Metropolitan police spokesman said : " Two men were spoken to by police regarding their behaviour – one of them was arrested on suspicion of assault against two women .
It is alleged the younger woman was pushed to the ground and the other punched .
The man , aged in his 30s , is now in custody at an east London police station . "
Prescott famously punched a protestor who threw an egg at him while he was campaigning in Rhyl , north Wales in 2001 .
The punch , thrown by Prescott after the egg hit him on the side of the face earned him the nickname " Two jabs " .
Craig Evans , who threw the egg , and Prescott were both questioned by police after the incident , but no further action was taken against either individual .

This article from todays Canberra Times – which so often reads like a GreenLeft news sheet – fumes at signs climate skeptic ideas are lurking within Australia ’s peak science academy .
It seems The Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering has circulated a short draft statement that is not 100 % IPCC compliant .
Pro-IPCC sources are quoted in force by the Canberra Times whining about this lapse from orthodoxy .
My spies tell me that other science bodies downunder might also be harbouring climate skeptics .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
|||Verdens ledende insulinprodusent , danske Novo Nordisk , vil ikke gå med på kravet fra greske myndigheter om at prisen på alle legemidler må reduseres med 25 prosent .
Dermed trekker de sitt nyeste insulinprodukt fra de greske markedene .
Omrking 55 000 grekere blir rammet , skriver BBC .
- Utpressing En protestgruppe har fordømt tilbaketrekkingen som « brutal , kapitalistisk utpressing » .
Den greske diabetesforeningen beskriver det som « et brudd på selskapers moralske ansvar » .
Konsernsjef Lars Rebien Sørensen i Novo Nordisk sier selskapet trekker tilbaket produktet fordi priskuttet ville tvinge deres greske avdeling til å drive med tap .
Selskapet er også bekymret for at den greske prisreduksjonen for legemidler kan ha en smitteffekt i andre markeder , fordi andre land bruker Hellas som målestokk for hvor priser bør legges .
Vil kompensere -
Vi beklager situasjonen overfor våre greske kunder , men både de og vi er tatt som gisler av den greske regjeringens feilslåtte økonomiske politikk , sier Lars Rebien Sørensen til Danmarks Radios Nyheder .
Kritikere hevder at tilbaketrekkingen kan føre til dødsfall i Hellas .
En talsmann for Novo Nordisk sier imidlertid til BBC at hensikten slettes ikke er å utsette insulinpasienter for fare .
Novo Nordisk vil som kompensasjon gjøre en annen medisin for diabetikere , kalt glucagen , tilgjengelig gratis .
Hellas forsøker å redusere sin enorme helseregning for å takle landets dype gjeld .
Det skylder multinasjonale farmasøytiske selskaper flere milliarder , blant annet skal Novo Nordisk ha et krav på 36 millioner dollar , omkring 214 millioner kroner .
There 's a lot of nattering about how the state of Arizona simply had to take things into its own hands given the abject failure of the feds to " get control " of the border with Mexico over the past decade .
Folks across the spectrum have acknowledged that the Grand Canyon State is in the grip of an immigrant - led crime wave as muy caliente as the speecy - spicy peppers that neo -wetbacks are surely carrying across the border like so much … produce from Mexico , a member in proud standing of a North American free trade zone .
So , what 's actually up with crime and illegal entries into Arizona ?
According to FBI statistics , violent crimes reported in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 reported incidents between 2005 and 2008 .
Reported property crimes also fell , from about 287,000 reported incidents to 279,000 in the same period .
These decreases are accentuated by the fact that Arizona 's population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008 … .
The number of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants made by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency [ also shows a decline ] .
Since a peak in 2000 of more than 600,000 illegal crossers apprehended , the number fell to 241,000 in 2009 , Tucson Sector Public Affairs Officer Mario Escalante told CNN .
" We 've seen a steady decline , " he said .
Now granted , Escalante is a foreign - sounding name , so anything he says should be discounted .
But he notes in the same story that drug - cartel violence in Mexico has basically stayed there .
More here .
Blaming everything rotten in the world on immigrants is a great American tradition ( and , in the case of my Irish and Italian family members who helped make the American Century a little less WASPy , I can kind of understand that ) .
But as Reason noted back in a 2006 special issue devoted to " reality - based immigration reform , " the only time immigrants really are a problem is when they stop showing up .
Agnes Urhweiller describes France 's education system as a " has been " Between the two rounds of the French local elections , BBC correspondent Emma Jane Kirby is travelling around France , testing the temperature of voters .
In Montpellier , she is told that France 's education system is completely out of sync with the world of business .
Montpellier is very much a young person 's city .
Students make up 30 % of its population , and the pavement cafes are swarming with youngsters who are furiously scribbling in note books or dashing off the final lines of essays .
But despite the nationwide passion for education , surprisingly , not a single French university makes it into the world 's top 40 .
France may be a global leader in high technology , but employers complain that today there are far too few students studying science and technology and there are far too many studying " soft subjects " which leaves them ill - prepared to join the real world of work .
At Montpellier 's Social Science faculty , I watched scores of undergraduates soak up a lecture on basic psychology .
I have studied so much , I am almost overqualified .
And now I need a job to get money and I can't find one
Aurelie
Bordeaux resists Sarkozy
There are 65,000 psychology students in France - that is a quarter of the European total for that subject .
I asked a passing student what he wanted to do when he left university .
" I want to be an eternal student , " he said .
" Just learning for learning 's sake . "
' Rigid system '
A noble sentiment perhaps , but an impractical one in 21st Century France where unemployment has been doggedly high for the past 20 years .
In France , many young people do n't study the right subjects
Agnes Urhweiller
Montpellier careers office
The national unemployment rate may have recently fallen to just under 8 % , but in Montpellier it stands at 11.3 % .
At the local careers office , counsellor Agnes Urhweiller told me she worried that the French education system was completely out of sync with the world of business .
Ms Urhweiller regularly sees hundreds of students who are well qualified but who have no real skills to offer employers .
" In France , many young people do n't study the right subjects , " she said as she marked a skills test for a young job seeker .
" I advise them they need practical qualifications to work .
I come from the private sector and I know that private businesses need young people and , of course , that is where the money is , too .
But our education system is a ' has been ' - it 's too rigid , " Ms Urhweiller said .
Baffled A recent survey showed that 75 % of graduates want to work in the public sector because civil servants and teachers enjoy a high level of social protection .
But President Nicolas Sarkozy 's plans to slash thousands of civil servant posts , and a recent economic report commissioned by the government has warned that people must accept the future is not with the state , but with private industry .
Among the youngsters I met searching for jobs at the careers office was 23 - year - old Aurelie .
She is still baffled as to what she wants to do .
" I have studied so much , I am almost overqualified .
And now I need a job to get money and I can't find one , " she said .
" Everyone tells you to get a good education but my parents studied much less than I did and yet they did n't have such problems finding work . "
' Born into uncertainty ' Marc Willinger , an economist at Montpellier University , believes young people today live in a more precarious world than their parents did .
Not only is finding permanent work more difficult , but - with the state coffers empty - their retirement will not be cushioned by the government hand outs their parents will enjoy .
This generation is having to fend for itself like never before .
" The young generation has been born into uncertainty , " Mr Willinger said .
" And they have to live with that every day - not just because of unemployment but also because they have a much higher burden than the previous generation .
They will have to care for themselves , for their children and they 'll also have to care for their parents ' generation . "
' Only a waitress ' A few streets away from the university campus I visited a local hostel which provides cheap lodgings for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds .
Kia and Anthony ( foreground ) say they do not expect any state help Anthony and Kia were playing table football outside the cafeteria .
When I asked them what they wanted the government to do to help them succeed in life , both were surprised at the notion that the state should step in to help them .
Kia , who is training to be a waitress , told me she thought young people 's expectations were too high .
She said that while some might scoff that she was " only a waitress " , she enjoyed her work and believed it was a good thing to get a job and to get on with life .
Anthony , aged 20 , is in the catering business .
He was also adamant that young people should stand on their own two feet .
" I do n't have any family , " he said .
" But you can't say the government has to help me because I do n't have parents - I can't blame them .
Young people are often lazy and think everything is owed to them but we need to work and to prove ourselves and then we can have dignity . "
Although he claimed not to be a fan of Mr Sarkozy 's , there is no doubt that the president would be a fan of Anthony's .
Sarkozy 's vision
The sentiments expressed by Anthony and Kia could almost be Mr Sarkozy 's UMP party slogans .
His election campaign last year was run on the mantra : " Work harder if you want to earn more . "
And the president still speaks wistfully of a " La France qui se leve tot " ( a France which gets up early ) - and is ready to go to work .
As I left the hostel , Anthony was preparing to spend his evening in his tiny bedroom listening to teach - yourself - English CDs and teach - yourself - Japanese .
I told him I was impressed with his drive and enthusiasm , and he replied shyly that his dream was to one day enrol at university to study psychology .
I could almost feel President 's Sarkozy 's heart sink .
France has educated many of the world 's greatest intellectuals and is justifiably proud of its erudite heritage .
But with such poor economic growth and such huge public debt , this country now needs its clever young students to leave the university campus and start ploughing their skills and enthusiasms into the profitable world of work .

Genus of dinosaur ( fossil )
Velociraptor ( ; meaning " swift seizer " in Latin ) [ 1 ] is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period .
[ 2 ]
Two species are currently recognized , although others have been assigned in the past .
The type species is V. mongoliensis ; fossils of this species have been discovered in Mongolia .
A second species , V. osmolskae , was named in 2008 for skull material from Inner Mongolia , China .
Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator , Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features .
It was a bipedal , feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle - shaped claw on each hindfoot , which is thought to have been used to tackle and disembowel prey .
Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull , with an upturned snout .
Velociraptor ( commonly shortened to " raptor " ) is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the Jurassic Park motion picture series .
In real life , however , Velociraptor was roughly the size of a turkey , considerably smaller than the approximately 2 m ( 6 1 ⁄ 2 ft ) tall and 80 kg ( 180 lb ) reptiles seen in the films ( which were based on members of the related genus Deinonychus ) .
Today , Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists , with over a dozen described fossil skeletons , the most of any dromaeosaurid .
One particularly famous specimen preserves a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops .
History of discovery
During an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Outer Mongolian Gobi Desert , on 11 August 1923 Peter Kaisen recovered the first Velociraptor fossil known to science : a crushed but complete skull , associated with one of the raptorial second toe claws ( AMNH 6515 ) .
[ 1 ]
In 1924 , museum president Henry Fairfield Osborn designated the skull and claw ( which he assumed to come from the hand ) as the type specimen of his new genus , Velociraptor .
This name is derived from the Latin words velox ( ' swift ' ) and raptor ( ' robber ' or ' plunderer ' ) and refers to the animal 's cursorial nature and carnivorous diet .
Osborn named the type species V. mongoliensis after its country of origin . [ 1 ]
Earlier that year , Osborn had mentioned the animal in a popular press article , under the name " Ovoraptor djadochtari " ( not to be confused with the similarly named Oviraptor ) . [ 3 ]
However , because the name " Ovoraptor " was not published in a scientific journal or accompanied by a formal description , it is considered a nomen nudum ( ' naked name ' ) , and the name Velociraptor retains priority .
While North American teams were shut out of communist Mongolia during the Cold War , expeditions by Soviet and Polish scientists , in collaboration with Mongolian colleagues , recovered several more specimens of Velociraptor .
The most famous is part of the famous " Fighting Dinosaurs " specimen ( GIN 100/25 ) , discovered by a Polish - Mongolian team in 1971 .
This fossil preserves a single Velociraptor in the midst of battle against a lone Protoceratops . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
This specimen is considered a national treasure of Mongolia , although in 2000 it was loaned to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City for a temporary exhibition . [ 7 ]
Specimen IGM 100/982
Between 1988 and 1990 , a joint Chinese - Canadian team discovered Velociraptor remains in northern China . [ 8 ]
American scientists returned to Mongolia in 1990 , and a joint Mongolian - American expedition to the Gobi , led by the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences , turned up several well - preserved skeletons . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
One such specimen , IGM 100/980 , was nicknamed " Ichabodcraniosaurus " by Norell 's team because the fairly complete specimen was found without its skull ( an allusion to the Washington Irving character Ichabod Crane ) . [ 11 ]
This specimen may belong to Velociraptor mongoliensis , but Norell and Makovicky concluded that it was not complete enough to say for sure , and it awaits a formal description . [ 9 ]
Maxillae and a lacrimal ( the main tooth - bearing bones of the upper jaw , and the bone that forms the anterior margin of the eye socket , respectively ) recovered in 1999 by the Sino - Belgian Dinosaur Expeditions were found to pertain to Velociraptor , but not to the type species V. mongoliensis .
Pascal Godefroit and colleagues named these bones V. osmolskae ( for Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska ) in 2008 . [ 2 ]
Description
V. mongoliensis compared in size to a compared in size to a human
Velociraptor was a mid-sized dromaeosaurid , with adults measuring up to 2.07 m ( 6 ft 9 1 ⁄ 2 in ) long , 0.5 m ( 1 ft 7 1 ⁄ 2 in ) high at the hip , and weighing up to 15 kg ( 33 lb ) , though there is a higher estimate of 19.7 kg ( 43 1 ⁄ 2 lb ) . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
The skull , which grew up to 25 cm ( 10 in ) long , was uniquely up - curved , concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower .
The jaws were lined with 26 – 28 widely spaced teeth on each side , each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front . [ 1] [ 14 ]
Velociraptor , like other dromaeosaurids , had a large manus ( ' hand ' ) with three strongly curved claws , which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern birds .
The second digit was the longest of the three digits present , while the first was shortest .
The structure of the carpal ( wrist ) bones prevented pronation of the wrist and forced the ' hands ' to be held with the palmar surface facing inwards ( medially ) , not downwards . [ 15 ]
The first digit of the foot , as in other theropods , was a small dewclaw .
However , whereas most theropods had feet with three digits contacting the ground , dromaeosaurids like Velociraptor walked on only their third and fourth digits .
The second digit , for which Velociraptor is most famous , was highly modified and held retracted off the ground .
It bore a relatively large , sickle - shaped claw , typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs .
This enlarged claw , which could grow to over 6.5 cm ( 2 1 ⁄ 2 in ) long around its outer edge , [ 9 ] was most likely a predatory device used to tear into or restrain struggling prey . [ 9 ] [ 16 ]
V. mongoliensis Skeletal restoration of
As in other dromaeosaurs , Velociraptor tails had long bony projections ( prezygapophyses ) on the upper surfaces of the vertebrae , as well as ossified tendons underneath .
The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail ( caudal ) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae , depending on position in the tail .
These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail , forcing the entire tail to act as a single rod-like unit .
However , at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S - shape , suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought . [ 9 ] [ 4 ]
In 2007 , paleontologists reported the discovery of quill knobs on a well - preserved Velociraptor mongoliensis forearm from Mongolia , confirming the presence of feathers in this species . [ 17 ]
Feathers
Fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than Velociraptor are known to have had feathers covering their bodies and fully developed feathered wings . [ 18 ]
The fact that the ancestors of Velociraptor were feathered and possibly capable of flight had long suggested to paleontologists that Velociraptor bore feathers as well , since even flightless birds today retain most of their feathers .
In September 2007 , researchers found quill knobs on the forearm of a Velociraptor found in Mongolia . [ 17 ]
These bumps on bird wing bones show where feathers anchor , and their presence on Velociraptor indicate it too had feathers .
According to paleontologist Alan Turner ,
V. mongoliensis , showing large wing feathers as evidenced by the discovery of quill knobs , showing large wing feathers as evidenced by the discovery of quill knobs
A lack of quill knobs does not necessarily mean that a dinosaur did not have feathers .
Finding quill knobs on Velociraptor , though , means that it definitely had feathers .
This is something we 'd long suspected , but no one had been able to prove . [ 19 ]
Co-author Mark Norell , Curator - in - Charge of fossil reptiles , amphibians and birds at the American Museum of Natural History , also weighed in on the discovery , saying :
The more that we learn about these animals the more we find that there is basically no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like velociraptor .
Both have wishbones , brooded their nests , possess hollow bones , and were covered in feathers .
If animals like velociraptor were alive today our first impression would be that they were just very unusual looking birds . [ 19 ]
According to Turner and co-authors Norell and Peter Makovicky , quill knobs are not found in all prehistoric birds , and their absence does not mean that an animal was not feathered – flamingos , for example , have no quill knobs .
However , their presence confirms that Velociraptor bore modern - style wing feathers , with a rachis and vane formed by barbs .
The forearm specimen on which the quill knobs were found ( specimen number IGM 100/981 ) represents an animal 1.5 meters ( 4 feet 11 inches ) in length and 15 kilograms ( 33 pounds ) in weight .
Based on the spacing of the six preserved knobs in this specimen , the authors suggested that Velociraptor bore 14 secondaries ( wing feathers stemming from the forearm ) , compared with 12 or more in Archaeopteryx , 18 in Microraptor , and 10 in Rahonavis .
This type of variation in the number of wing feathers between closely related species , the authors asserted , is to be expected , given similar variation among modern birds . [ 17 ]
Turner and colleagues interpreted the presence of feathers on Velociraptor as evidence against the idea that the larger , flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size .
Furthermore , they noted that quill knobs are almost never found in flightless bird species today , and that their presence in Velociraptor ( presumed to have been flightless due to its relatively large size and short forelimbs ) is evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly , making Velociraptor and other large members of this family secondarily flightless , though it is possible the large wing feathers inferred in the ancestors of Velociraptor had a purpose other than flight .
The feathers of the flightless Velociraptor may have been used for display , for covering their nests while brooding , or for added speed and thrust when running up inclined slopes . [ 17 ]
Classification
Velociraptor is a member of the group Eudromaeosauria , a derived sub - group of the larger family Dromaeosauridae .
It is often placed within its own subfamily , Velociraptorinae .
In phylogenetic taxonomy , Velociraptorinae is usually defined as " all dromaeosaurs more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus . "
However , dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable .
Originally , the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain Velociraptor . [ 4 ]
Other analyses have often included other genera , usually Deinonychus and Saurornitholestes , [ 20 ] and more recently Tsaagan . [ 21 ]
However , several studies published during the 2010s , including expanded versions of the analyses that found support for Velociraptorinae , have failed to resolve it as a distinct group , but rather have suggested it is a paraphyletic grade which gave rise to the Dromaeosaurinae . [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
In the past , other dromaeosaurid species , including Deinonychus antirrhopus and Saurornitholestes langstoni , have sometimes been classified in the genus Velociraptor .
Since Velociraptor was the first to be named , these species were renamed Velociraptor antirrhopus and V. langstoni . [ 12 ]
However , the only currently recognized species of Velociraptor are V. mongoliensis [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 24 ] and V. osmolskae . [ 2 ]

When first described in 1924 , Velociraptor was placed in the family Megalosauridae , as was the case with most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time ( Megalosauridae , like Megalosaurus , functioned as a sort of ' wastebin ' taxon , where many unrelated species were grouped together ) .
[ 1 ]
As dinosaur discoveries multiplied , Velociraptor was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid .
All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author ( which would , in effect , make Velociraptor a flightless bird ) . [ 15 ]
Below are the results for the Eudromaeosauria phylogeny based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Currie and Evans in 2019 .
Surprisingly enough , heavy built animals such as Achillobator and Utahraptor were recovered in the Velociraptorinae : [ 25 ]
Paleobiology
Predatory behavior
V. mongoliensis and Protoceratops andrewsi The " Fighting Dinosaurs " specimen ofand
The " Fighting Dinosaurs " specimen , found in 1971 , preserves a Velociraptor mongoliensis and Protoceratops andrewsi in combat and provides direct evidence of predatory behavior .
When originally reported , it was hypothesized that the two animals drowned .
[ 6 ]
However , as the animals were preserved in ancient sand dune deposits , it is now thought that the animals were buried in sand , either from a collapsing dune or in a sandstorm .
Burial must have been extremely fast , judging from the lifelike poses in which the animals were preserved .
Parts of the Protoceratops are missing , which has been seen as evidence of scavenging by other animals . [ 26 ]
Comparisons between the scleral rings of Velociraptor , Protoceratops , and modern birds and reptiles indicates that Velociraptor may have been nocturnal , while Protoceratops may have been cathemeral , active throughout the day during short intervals , suggesting that the fight may have occurred at twilight or during low - light conditions . [ 27 ]
The distinctive claw , on the second digit of dromaeosaurids , has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon ; its assumed use being to cut and disembowel prey . [ 28 ]
In the " Fighting Dinosaurs " specimen , the Velociraptor lies underneath , with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey , while the beak of Protoceratops is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker .
This suggests Velociraptor may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs of the throat , such as the jugular vein , carotid artery , or trachea ( windpipe ) , rather than slashing the abdomen .
The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp , which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action , although only the bony core of the claw is preserved .
The thick abdominal wall of skin and muscle of large prey species would have been difficult to slash without a specialized cutting surface . [ 26 ]
The slashing hypothesis was tested during a 2005 BBC documentary , The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs .
The producers of the program created an artificial Velociraptor leg with a sickle claw and used a pork belly to simulate the dinosaur 's prey .
Though the sickle claw did penetrate the abdominal wall , it was unable to tear it open , indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey . [ 29 ]
V. mongoliensis restraining an restraining an oviraptorosaur with its sickle claws
Remains of Deinonychus , a closely related dromaeosaurid , have commonly been found in aggregations of several individuals .
Deinonychus has also been found in association with the large ornithopod Tenontosaurus , which has been cited as evidence of cooperative ( pack ) hunting . [ 30 ] [ 31 ]
However , the only solid evidence for social behavior of any kind among dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group . [ 32 ]
Although many isolated fossils of Velociraptor have been found in Mongolia , none were closely associated with other individuals . [ 24 ]
Therefore , while Velociraptor is commonly depicted as a pack hunter , as in Jurassic Park , there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general and none specific to Velociraptor itself .
Dromeosaur footprints in China suggest that a few other raptor genera may have hunted in packs , but there have been no conclusive examples of pack behavior found . [ 33 ] [ 34 ]

In 2011 , Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which dromaeosaurs like Velociraptor and similar dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey .
This model , known as the " raptor prey restraint " ( RPR ) model of predation , proposes that dromaeosaurs killed their prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey : by leaping onto their quarry , pinning it under their body weight , and gripping it tightly with the large , sickle - shaped claws .
These researchers proposed that , like accipitrids , the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while it was still alive , and prey death would eventually result from blood loss and organ failure .
This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors .
Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks , especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion .
The short metatarsus and foot strength , however , would have been more similar to that of owls .
The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of Velociraptor 's anatomy , such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology .
The arms , which could exert a lot of force but were likely covered in long feathers , may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal , along with the stiff counterbalancing tail .
The jaws , thought by Fowler and colleagues to be comparatively weak , would have been useful for row saw motion bites like the modern day Komodo dragon , which also has a weak bite , to finish off its prey if the kicks were n't powerful enough .
These predatory adaptations working together may also have implications for the origin of flapping in paravians . [ 16 ]
Examinations of the endocranium of Velociraptor indicate that it was able to detect and hear a wide range of sound frequencies ( 2,368 –3,965 Hz ) and could track prey with ease as a result .
The endocranium examinations also further cemented the theory that the dromaeosaur was an agile , swift predator .
Fossil evidence suggesting Velociraptor scavenged also indicates that it was an opportunistic and actively predatory animal , feeding on carrion during times of drought or famine , if in poor health , or depending on the animal 's age . [ 35 ]
Scavenging behavior
In 2010 , Hone and colleagues published a paper on their 2008 discovery of shed teeth of what they believed to be a Velociraptor near a tooth - marked jaw bone of what they believed to be a Protoceratops in the Bayan Mandahu Formation . [ 36 ]
The authors concluded that the find represented " late - stage carcass consumption by Velociraptor " as the predator would have eaten other parts of a freshly killed Protoceratops before biting in the jaw area . [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
The evidence was seen as supporting the inference from the " Fighting Dinosaurs " fossil that Protoceratops was part of the diet of Velociraptor . [ 36 ]
In 2012 , Hone and colleagues published a paper that described a Velociraptor specimen with a long bone of an azhdarchid pterosaur in its gut .
This was interpreted as showing scavenging behaviour . [ 38 ]
Metabolism
Velociraptor was warm - blooded to some degree , as it required a significant amount of energy to hunt .
Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats , like Velociraptor did , tend to be warm - blooded , since these coverings function as insulation .
However , bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism , compared with most modern warm - blooded mammals and birds .
The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy , feather type , bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages ( usually a key indicator of metabolism ) .
The kiwi is a highly active , if specialized , flightless bird , with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate , making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids . [ 15 ]
Pathology
One Velociraptor mongoliensis skull bears two parallel rows of small punctures that match the spacing and size of Velociraptor teeth .
Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight .
Further , because the fossil bone shows no sign of healing near the bite wounds , the injury probably killed it . [ 39 ]
Another specimen , found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity , was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs .
From evidence on the pterosaur bones , which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion , the Velociraptor died shortly after , possibly from the earlier injury . [ 40 ]
Paleoecology
V. mongoliensis in environment in environment
All known specimens of Velociraptor mongoliensis were discovered in the Djadochta Formation ( also spelled Djadokhta ) , in the Mongolian province of Ömnögovi .
Species of Velociraptor have also been reported from the slightly younger Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia , [ 41 ] though these are indeterminate and may belong to a related genus instead . [ 42 ]
These geologic formations are estimated to date back to the Campanian stage ( between 83 and 70 million years ago [ 43 ] ) of the Late Cretaceous Epoch . [ 44 ]
V. mongoliensis has been found at many of the most famous and prolific Djadochta localities .
The type specimen was discovered at the Flaming Cliffs site ( also known as Bayn Dzak and Shabarakh Usu ) , [ 1 ] while the " Fighting Dinosaurs " were found at the Tugrig locality ( also known as Tugrugeen Shireh ) .
[ 6 ]
The well - known Barun Goyot localities of Khulsan and Khermeen Tsav have also produced remains which may belong to Velociraptor or a related genus . [ 45 ]
Teeth and partial remains attributed to juvenile V. mongoliensis have also been reported from the Bayan Mandahu Formation , a prolific site in Inner Mongolia , China that is contemporaneous with the Djadochta Formation . [ 8 ]
However , these fossils had not been prepared or studied as of 2008 .
[ 2 ]
A partial adult skull from the Bayan Mandahu Formation has been assigned to a distinct species , Velociraptor osmolskae . [ 2 ]
V. mongoliensis skull Undescribedskull
All of the fossil sites that have yielded Velociraptor remains preserve an arid environment with fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams , although the younger Barun Goyot environment seems to have been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta . [ 44 ]
The posture of some complete fossils , as well as the mode of preservation most show within structureless sandstone deposits , may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during sandstorm events common to the three environments . [ 2 ]
Many of the same genera were present across these formations , though they varied at the species level .
For example , the Djadochta was inhabited by Velociraptor mongoliensis , Protoceratops andrewsi , and Pinacosaurus grangeri , while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae , Protoceratops hellenikorhinus , and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus .
These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations , which are relatively close to each other geographically .
[ 2 ]
However , given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas , it is more likely that those differences indicate a slight time difference . [ 42 ]
Other dinosaurs known from the same locality as V. mongoliensis include the troodontid Saurornithoides mongoliensis , the oviraptorid Oviraptor philoceratops , and the dromaeosaurid Mahakala omnogovae .
V. osmolskae lived alongside the ceratopsian species Magnirostris dodsoni , as well as the oviraptorid Machairasaurus leptonychus and the dromaeosaurid Linheraptor exquisitus . [ 42 ]

Velociraptor are well known for their role as vicious and cunning killers thanks to their portrayal in the 1990 novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton and its 1993 film adaptation , directed by Steven Spielberg .
The " raptors " portrayed in Jurassic Park were actually modeled after the closely related dromaeosaurid Deinonychus .
Paleontologists in both the novel and film excavate a skeleton in Montana , far from the central Asian range of Velociraptor but characteristic of the Deinonychus range .
Crichton used the controversial taxonomy proposed by Gregory S. Paul , even though the " raptors " in the novel are at another point referred to as V. mongoliensis . [ 46 ]
Crichton met with the discoverer of Deinonychus , John Ostrom , several times at Yale University to discuss details of the animal 's possible range of behaviors and appearance .
Crichton at one point apologetically told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name Velociraptor in place of Deinonychus because the former name was " more dramatic " .
According to Ostrom , Crichton stated that the Velociraptor of the novel was based on Deinonychus in almost every detail , and that only the name had been changed . [ 47 ]
The Jurassic Park filmmakers also requested all of Ostrom 's published papers on Deinonychus during production . [ 47 ]
They portrayed the animals with the size , proportions , and snout shape of Deinonychus rather than Velociraptor . [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
Production on Jurassic Park began before the discovery of the large dromaeosaurid Utahraptor was made public in 1991 , but as Jody Duncan wrote about this discovery : " Later , after we had designed and built the Raptor , there was a discovery of a Raptor skeleton in Utah , which they labeled ' super - slasher ' .
They had uncovered the largest Velociraptor to date - and it measured five - and - a - half - feet tall , just like ours .
So we designed it , we built it , and then they discovered it .
That still boggles my mind . " [ 48 ]
Spielberg was particularly pleased with the discovery of the Utahraptor because of the boost it gave to the velociraptors in his film .
Spielberg 's name was briefly considered for naming of the new dinosaur . [ 50 ]
In reality , Velociraptor , like many other maniraptoran theropods , was covered in feathers . [ 17 ]

One of the most common assertions one encounters by Christian extremists and even some moderate Christians on the political right is that America is a Christian nation .
This claim has been thoroughly discredited in more sources than any individual could possibly compile .
In fact , it is hard to imagine an atheist blogger who has n't addressed this claim and one point or another .
I realize that this post will do little to prevent the issue from recurring here , but at least I will have a prepared response ready for next time .
And besides , the topic certainly fits with the current Blog Against Theocracy blogswarm .
Common Sources for the Christian Nation Claim
First , let 's unpack the claim itself .
Why might one argue that America is a Christian nation ?
As it turns out , there are many reasons .
Here is a quick review of some of the most common :
The majority of American citizens identify themselves as Christians on various surveys .
The American government officially endorses or sponsors Christianity .
Non-Christians have fewer rights than Christians because the law treats them differently .
America was founded by Christians .
In examining these statements , it appears that each of them is at least partially true .
Ample data support the first statement , and if all the Christian nation claim meant was that the majority of Americans identified themselves as Christians , one would have to agree .
However , this is not what most making the Christian nation claim mean .
Statement # 2 is partially true in the sense of President Bush 's faith - based initiatives and some other disturbing ways that Christianity has managed to receive preferential treatment when it comes to government funding , but most of those making the Christian nation claim refuse to admit this .
Similarly , statement # 3 is not one you will find argued by Christian extremists , even if it contains some truth .
What the Christian nation proponents virtually always use to support their claim is # 4 , so it warrants further discussion .
Was America Founded by Christians ?
A review of the writings by many prominent early Americans , commonly referred to as founding fathers , reveals some evidence of theism , some evidence of atheism , and very little evidence of Christianity .
Take Thomas Jefferson for example .
It is hard to read the following statement of Jefferson 's as evidence for any sort of theism :
To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings .
To say that the human soul , angels , god , are immaterial , is to say they are nothings , or that there is no god , no angels , no soul .
I cannot reason otherwise ... without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and phantasms .
I am satisfied , and sufficiently occupied with the things which are , without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may indeed be , but of which I have no evidence .
-- Thomas Jefferson , letter to John Adams , August 15 , 1820
And how about John Adams ?
He did n't seem content just to point out problems with theism but attacked Christianity itself :
As I understand the Christian religion , it was , and is , a revelation .
But how has it happened that millions of fables , tales , legends , have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed ?-- John Adams , letter to F.A. Van der Kamp , 1816
It does n't sound like either of these men were Christian in any way whatsoever , does it ?
Even the quotes attributed to Ben Franklin by some making the Christian nation claim do not support the suggestion that he was a Christian .
Franklin was obviously a theist , but these quotes suggest that Deism was as likely as Christianity , perhaps even more so .
Christian nation advocates love to cite the frequent mentions of a god in the Declaration of Independence while apparently forgetting that the Constitution and Treaty of Tripoli even exist .
In writing the Constitution , the framers intentionally set America up as a secular democracy .
This was not an accident - it was , as Christians are so fond of saying in other contexts , by design .
What Christian extremists are propagating with the Christian nation claim is nothing more than revisionist history , but that does n't stop it from being dangerous .
What About Slavery ?
Let 's pretend for a second that we had indisputable evidence that every last one of America 's founding fathers was a rabid Christian .
Would it even matter ?
If we want to claim that we are a Christian nation on that basis , how can we avoid calling ourselves a nation of slavery as well ?
Did not many of the founders own slaves ?
Is it not fair to say that the early economy of America was supported on the backs of slaves or that at least one of the reasons for our own Civil War involved slavery ?
If we are a Christian nation for this reason , then we are a nation of slavery , of misogyny , and all sorts of other things I suspect we 'd rather not own .
We are no more a Christian nation than a nation of slavery ; simply , we are neither .
What we should learn from our founders is their mindset concerning the relationship between church and state .
They had good reasons , based on their recent experience with Britain , for establishing a secular democracy .
Unlike modern Christian extremists , they understood history and recognized that blending religion and government would harm both .

When the exchange closed Wednesday , Apple became the world 's biggest technology company , surpassing Microsoft 's market capitalization .
For those who have observed Apple 's rise , it is an impressive milestone .
In the late '90s , the company was practically on life support .
Now , with a slick line of computers and innovative consumer electronics , Apple 's dominance seems more assured than ever .
However , a company 's market value can be misleading .
Here are five caveats to Wednesday 's screaming headline :
Do n't Look at Apple , Look at Microsoft , writes Chris Rawson at Tuaw : " Apple 's leapfrogging of Microsoft 's market cap has had less to do with Apple 's stock and more to do with Microsoft 's ; over the past 60 days or so , Apple 's market cap has grown by less than US $ 10 billion , while Microsoft 's has plummeted by almost $ 40 billion . "
We 're Comparing Apple(s ) and Oranges , writes Dan Nosowitz at Fast Company : " This is n't Pepsi overcoming Coke .
Is it simple scope defeating broad ?
Consumer over enterprise ?
A triumph of superior marketing ?
The power of a cult of personality ?
The answer is yes .
Since the introduction of the iPod , Apple has captured mindshare in ways Microsoft only dreams of .
Microsoft is an amorphous blob of a corporation , with a capital C -- they make essential products , certainly , but without brand loyalty or public goodwill .
Apple , through unbelievably astute marketing and the power of one Steve Jobs , has won all of those fights . "
Take This With a Grain of Salt , writes Daniel Kusnetzky at ZDNet : " There are many ways to look at markets and individual companies .
Each is useful to certain people at certain times and not very useful at all at other times .
It ’s wise to remember that market share of a market ’s revenue is quite different than the market share of a market ’s shipments .
It ’s also wise to remember that market capitalization or market value is related to , but different than market share ...
A company may have absolutely huge revenues , hold a dominant position in nearly every market in which it competes and still not be properly recognized by investors . "
Here 's ' One Ironic Point , ' says Ed Oswald at Technologizer .
" Microsoft itself could be credited with helping bring back Apple from the dead .
In 1997 , the company made a $ 150 million investment in the company shortly after Steve Jobs returned for his second and current stint as CEO . "
Ascendant — But at What Cost ? worries Nigel Kendall at the Times of London : " As a Mac user since the days of OS 7 myself , I find myself caught slightly in between two stools by the company 's sudden omnipotence .
Part of me is happy that the company has finally broken out of its niche to get the acclaim it deserves for its great work - not so much on products , but on interface and usability - part of me is concerned that the corporate re-invention from computer maker to consumer electronics company has taken place at the expense of the computer hardware .
I 'm currently in the market for a new lightweight laptop that does n't cost the Earth and is likely to have a tough old life on the road .
For the first time in over a decade , I find myself considering options other than Apple .
I wonder if other people feel the same way ? "

I 've always kind of admired Sex and the City .
Even though I 'm not quite the target demographic , I appreciate the world it created and how much fans loved it .
I mean , how can I criticize Sex and the City fans when , as I type this , I have a twelve - inch action figure of Boba Fett staring at me from across my desk ?
It 's a two - way street here : Just as I find it hurtful when someone dismisses me as " a Star Wars geek " — it 's a lot more complicated than that — I , in good faith , would never criticize someone for being into Sex and the City .
So , when I saw Sex and the City 2 on Tuesday night , I went in with the attitude that I was going to see it from a fan ’s perspective , through the same favorable eyes as I would watch a Star Wars film .
But even under those conditions , Sex and the City 2 is terrible .
What Sex and the City 2's awfulness did do was trigger something in me , " a presence I ’ve not felt since ... , ” if you will , a little over eight years .
Yeah , I felt like I was watching the equivalent of Star Wars , Episode II : Attack of the Clones .
Look , I never in my life thought I would have anything in common with the SATC crowd .
But , just like us Star Wars fans , you girls have yourself a turkey of a film , and a borderline racist turkey at that .
( We 've been there , too !
Remember Jar Jar Binks ? )
Let me , as a Star Wars fan , alert you to what 's about to happen :
First , amidst all the backlash , you 'll feel the need to defend your franchise against the critics .
You 'll say things like , " Oh , those people do n't know what they 're talking about , they do n't understand Carrie like I understand Carrie . "
This will last you anywhere from one week to three months .
But as time goes on , it will become impossible to ignore the facts .
Soon , you will feel shame for having ever defended this turd of a movie , and you 'll try to pretend it never existed .
Then , finally , you 'll accept that it was putrid and move on with your life .
But , as a fan of the franchise , what you do after that is of the utmost importance .
I am in no way suggesting that Sex and the City fans not go see this latest offering .
You have to ; I get it .
I hated Attack of the Clones and I saw that film three times in a movie theater .
Three !
But there 's a big difference between Star Wars fans and Sex and the City fans ( other than personal hygiene ) .
Yes , we also swarmed the theater to see an inferior product — but that does n't mean we were happy about it .
I know way too many SATC fans that say that it ’s not about quality —
" Hey , it 's Sex and the City .
Who cares ? "
Well , you should care .
There were some pretty good episodes of the HBO series and , which put this film to shame , and that should piss you off .
I 've been there .
I tried to convince myself that Attack of the Clones was a good film .
But then shortly after seeing it , I re-watched the original Star Wars and became livid .
This , ladies ( and some fellas ) , is where you need to be .
At some point George Lucas decided that all he needed to do was put some C.G.I. aliens on the screen and everyone would be happy .
Now , director Michael Patrick King is pulling the same bullshit : " Hey , let 's just dress the four girls in fancy clothes and stick them in the desert .
Who cares about a plot ? "
Thousands of military and Latino voters could be disenfranchised as court determines hastily scheduled contest fails to meet federal requirements of Voting Rights Act ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/13/2010 , 5:50 pm PT
The disputed upcoming special election in California 's Senate District 15 may be on hold , at least for a day or two , as a federal district court has ordered [ PDF ] the five counties involved in the election to withhold the distribution of absentee , overseas and military ballots , pending the results of a hearing now set for May 20th in federal district court .
Yesterday , U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy
Fogel set next week 's hearing , requiring the state " to show cause , if any they have , why they , their agents , servants , employees and those in active concert or participation with them , should not be restrained and enjoined pending trial of this action from accepting any ballots , including absentee ballots , or operating any polling place in connection with the special primary election " as currently scheduled .
The compressed schedule for the election has given rise to complaints from county registrars , concerns that the hastily set date for the contest would lead to disenfranchisement of overseas military voters , and a lawsuit filed by Hispanic voters charging the election fails to comply with federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
Rather than consolidating the special election with pre-existing general election dates , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently declared the special election --- to fill a vacancy in the state Senate following his appointment of former State Senator Abel Maldonado as Lieutenant Governor --- would take place on June 22nd .
In two previous articles , The BRAD BLOG has detailed how the issue has rankled election officials and voters alike , yet the Governor 's office has so far failed to make accommodations for those serious concerns from several different corners ...
The BRAD BLOG has previously reported that the compressed election schedule means that thousands of overseas military voters might be unable to receive their absentee ballots by mail and return them in time to be counted .
In that same report we detailed the " outrage " of local election officials who had sent a letter [ PDF ] to the Governor detailing several " barriers " they faced in complying with his recent proclamation for a June 22nd election .
That date comes on the heels of California 's previously scheduled state primary election just weeks before .
The additional election , officials charge , will cost the cash - strapped counties upwards of $ 6 million and will " definitely disenfranchise " thousands of voters .
The day following our initial report , we followed up with another when three Latino voters in Monterey County --- one of the five counties included in SD 15 ( the others are San Luis Obispo , Santa Barbara , Santa Clara , and Santa Cruz ) --- subsequently filed suit [ PDF ] seeking a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order , charging that the June 22nd date did not allow sufficient time for mandatory " pre-clearance " for the special election by the U.S. Department of Justice under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act ( VRA ) .
The lawsuit , funded by the state Democratic Party , contends that the compressed schedule will " thwart voter turnout within minorities communities " and " will disenfranchise Latino voters in Monterey County . "
The county is one of four in the state to be covered by the VRA , requiring federal pre-clearance for changes to election law in jurisdictions where minority voters have been historical disenfranchised .
Yesterday 's order from Fogel finds " the special elections cannot proceed in the absence of Section 5 preclearance " from the DoJ .
It puts a temporary hold on county election officials ' plans to try and accommodate voters , given the shortened schedule , by sending out generic write - in ballots , along with a list of official candidates when it becomes available , via email to " special absentee voters " .
Earlier in the day yesterday , prior to the judge 's order , Monterey County 's Registrar of Voters Linda Tulett had submitted a 5 - page declaration [ PDF ] to the court , detailing the extraordinary efforts her office , and those of the other counties , are preparing in order to attempt to reach the affected voters since they will be unable to comply with the statutory 45 - day minimum requirement for sending out ballots via the U.S. Postal Service .
Tulett 's declaration states that she has attempted to contact the county 's 893 " special absentee voters " ( a subset of absentee votes which includes overseas military and other overseas absentee voters ) via mail in hopes of receiving an email address so they may be sent " a generic write - in ballot and copy of the Secretary of State ’s certified list of candidates ... with instructions for filling out the write - in ballot and returning it to the Elections Department by facsimile transmission . "
Retired Army and Marine Corps officer Scott Dick , a talk - radio host in Monterey , has reported that more than 2,000 military voters could effectively be disenfranchised by Schwarzenegger 's special election date .
For its part , the state has conceded to the court that " the special primary and special run-off elections in question are changes in voting procedures within the meaning of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 " and that Monterey " is a covered jurisdiction pursuant " to that act .
Those facts now compel the U.S. 9th District Court in Northern California to determine a remedy to the problem .
What the state intends to do about it --- and why they have n't already changed the date of the election on their own accord to consolidate it with the general election and meet the concerns of election officials as well as military and minority voters --- will likely be made clear at next Thursday 's court ordered hearing in front of three federal judges .

President Outlines Exploration Goals , Promise
Steven Siceloff
NASA 's John F. Kennedy Space Center
Astronauts will soar spaceward in commercial spacecraft while NASA develops technology so humans can venture to Mars and out into the solar system , President Barack Obama told a space conference Thursday at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
Laying out his plans , President Obama committed NASA to a series of development milestones he said would lead to new spacecraft for astronauts to ride to the International Space Station , a modified Orion capsule developed as an emergency return spacecraft , and a powerful new rocket .
He also promised a host of new technologies that would protect space travelers from radiation and other unique hazards .
" Early in the next decade , a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit , " the president said .
" And by 2025 , we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first - ever crewed missions beyond the moon into deep space .
We ’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history .
By the mid-2030s , I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth .
And a landing on Mars will follow .
And I expect to be around to see it .
" The president spoke to 200 senior officials , space and industry leaders , and academic experts inside the Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy in the same area that was used to process Apollo spacecraft for the missions to the moon in the 1960s and 70s .
Standing in front of one of the space shuttle main engines that launched former U.S. Senator and astronaut John Glenn into orbit , President Obama said , " It was from here that men and women , propelled by sheer nerve and talent , set about pushing the boundaries of humanity 's reach .
"
The question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something , or the end of something .
I prefer to believe it was the beginning of something .
" The president 's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal increases NASA 's budget by $ 6 billion throughout the next five years to fund the plans .
Noting " the sense that folks in Washington -- driven less by vision than by politics -- have for years neglected NASA ’s mission and undermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it , " the president said the budget increase changes that .
The president 's address comes at a critical juncture for NASA because the space shuttle fleet is scheduled to be retired after three more missions .
The president said it will be quicker and less costly to let private companies develop new spacecraft for astronauts rather than continue with NASA 's Constellation Program , which was deemed too expensive and behind schedule .
" Pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy .
In part , this is because the old strategy -- including the Constellation Program -- was not fulfilling its promise in many ways , " the president said .
" That ’s not just my assessment ; that ’s also the assessment of a panel of respected non-partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely .
" President Obama 's plan largely mirrors the " flexible path " option offered by a blue - ribbon panel established by the president last year to help decide the best map for future space exploration .
The outline does not do away with all the research and development from Constellation .
Noting the success of the agency 's development of the Orion crew capsule , Obama called on NASA to develop a version of that spacecraft so it can be launched without a crew to the International Space Station .
It will be based there as an emergency craft for astronauts living on the orbiting laboratory .
The speech kicked off the Conference on the American Space Program for the 21st Century .
Norm Augustine , chairman of the blue - ribbon panel called the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee , that evaluated Constellation and came up with the " flexible path " option , endorsed the presidential strategy as the conference got under way .
Saying NASA is largely " trapped " in low Earth orbit , Augustine said industry , with NASA 's guidance , can do its part for the plan .
The president acknowledged the need to get the decision right .
" Now , the challenges facing our space program are different , and our imperatives for this program are different than in decades past , " the president said .
" But while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past fifty years , what we do -- or fail to do -- in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth .
"
The plan , the president said , would free NASA 's designers and engineers to develop spacecraft , large rockets and new technologies that can extend the frontier of human space exploration to asteroids and even Mars .
About $ 3.1 billion of the additional funding would go into research and development for a heavy - lift rocket .
A design for a large booster would be chosen in 2015 with the goal of launching the spacecraft a few years later .
The bigger rocket could be used to loft payloads too large for most boosters , including giant fuel depots that would be parked in distant orbits so spacecraft could refuel on their way to asteroids , the moons of Mars and eventually Mars itself .
In addition to more funding , President Obama said his initiative brings more jobs than previous schedules .
" My plan will add more than 2,500 jobs along the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previous administration , " he said .
" I ’m proposing a $ 40 million initiative led by a high - level team from the White House , NASA , and other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation .
And I expect this plan to reach my desk by Aug. 15 .
It ’s an effort that will help prepare this already skilled work force for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond .
" Taken together , the space strategy proves America is poised for a future as bright as its remarkable past , the president said .
" Fifty years after the creation of NASA , our goal is no longer just a destination to reach , " Obama said .
" Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn , and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time , ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite .
And in fulfilling this task , we will not only extend humanity ’s reach in space -- we will strengthen America ’s leadership here on Earth . "
An Arizona utility commissioner said he 's willing to pull the plug on Los Angeles if the city goes through with a boycott of his state .
In a letter to the city of LA , a member of Arizona 's power commission said he would ask Arizona utility companies to cut off the power supply to Los Angeles .
LA gets about 25 percent of its power from Arizona .
" That is one commissioner who has that idea -- whether he can do that or not is another idea , " said LA Councilman Dennis Zine .
" They are the ones who have to make the move , not us . "
The commissioner 's power grid play is in response to the city 's approval of a resolution directing city staff to consider which contracts with Arizona can be terminated .
Here 's part of Arizona Corporation Commission member Gary Pierce 's letter to the mayor :
If an economic boycott is truly what you desire , I will be happy to encourage Arizona utilities to renegotiate your power agreements so Los Angeles no longer receives any power from Arizona - based generation .
I am confident that Arizona ’s utilities would be happy to take those electrons off your hands .
If , however , you find that the City Council lacks the strength of its convictions to turn off the lights in Los Angeles and boycott Arizona power , please reconsider the wisdom of attempting to harm Arizona ’s economy .
The full text was sent to the blog Hot Air .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is in Washington D.C. , meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calderon , but his deputy chief of staff issued the following statement : " The mayor stands strongly behind the city council and he will not respond to threats from the state that has isolated itself from an America that values freedom , liberty and basic civil rights . "
Councilmember Tom LaBonge said he'd like to talk with Pierce .
LaBonge said the city needs to look into its long standing utility agreements with Arizona .
LaBonge met Wednesday morning with LA Department of Water and Power officials .
" We have right of ownership of the power plants , " LaBonge told NBCLA .
" We partially own them . "
Other California cities , including Oakland and San Francisco , have passed similar measures .
On Tuesday , Berkeley became the latest California city to boycott Arizona .
The City Council voted unanimously to restrict staff from traveling to the state on city business .
SB 1070 -- here 's the text of the law -- empowers local law enforcement to check the immigration status of suspects they have stopped for other reasons if there is a reasonable suspicion they are in the country illegally .
The law specifically bars police from racial profiling .
The Arizona Republic newspaper recently asked a panel of experts to outline how the law would work in real - world situations .
The experts ' interpretations varied when it came to what happens at the point a law encforcement officer can or should ask about a person 's status .
LADWP Backs City Council
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power general manager Austin Beutner released this statement Wednesday evening :
" I want to make clear that we support the city position regarding the recent law enacted in Arizona and the resolution adopted by the Los Angeles City Council .
" On any given day , we receive 20 to 25 percent of our power from two power plants located in Arizona : Navajo , a coal - fired plant , and Palo Verde , a nuclear plant .
" We are part owner of both power plants , which are generating assets of the department .
As such , nothing in the city 's resolution is inconsistent with our continuing to receive power from those department - owned assets .
" I might add that , as the city 's Job Czar , I certainly would welcome any conventions or meetings that were going to be held in Arizona to come to Los Angeles .
We have fantastic facilities and incomparable weather and we 'd welcome them to the City of Angels . "

( Mr. Ma , now in a federal prison in Brooklyn , declined through his lawyer , Don Buchwald , to be interviewed . )
The government does not believe that Mr. Ma was ever formally associated with a tong , but he would have known the major players — like Clifford Wong , leader of the Tung On tong , or Paul Lai , president of the Tsung Tsin Association , who once served on an advisory panel for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and even attended the wedding of the governor ’s daughter .
( Both men were eventually convicted on racketeering charges . )
Mr. Ma was instead a member of the 14 K triad , federal agents say , a Hong Kong group founded more than 60 years ago by 14 leaders of the Kuomintang nationalist party .
Based in Queens , he oversaw gambling parlors , a luxury car - theft ring , extortion rackets and an immigrant smuggling operation .
By his own admission , though , his most profitable business was always heroin — and that , of course , was why he had sent his killers to Toronto .
•
In the morning , their getaway car was gone .
Perhaps someone had stolen it .
The men , at any rate , had a backup plan .
They had stolen license plates from another car , according to court papers , and they put these on the minivan they had driven from New York .
They dropped the women at a park and drove past Seafood Alliance .
In the afternoon , when the coast was clear , Mr. Wah pulled the van into a parking spot .
Mr. Cai and Mr. Nguyen walked toward the door .
It was locked , so Mr. Nguyen fired a few shots , shattering the glass .
He stepped inside .
Mr. Cai followed .
Waiting in the van , Mr. Nagatsuka heard more shots .
Many , many more .
Years later , at the murder trial of Bing Yi Chen , he testified as to what happened next :
Mr. Wah “ started putting the minivan into reverse , started pulling away from the parking lot .
Once we were driving away , we see Paul Cai and Luyen coming out , running fast .
Along the way , Paul Cai disassembled his handgun , threw the handgun parts to an empty lot on the right side .
We were following at a slow pace along with Luyen and Paul Cai .
There was a Home Depot nearby .
We went to the back of it .
That ’s where the plan was to meet , in the back of the Home Depot .
Once we turned the corner to the Home Depot , we start hearing the siren . ”
They found Christina and Salina and hurried the 80 miles back to Niagara Falls .
The next day , they saw news coverage of the murders on TV : two bodies being carted off by the police .
They returned to New York City and to Mr. Ma ’s apartment .
There , court papers say , they apologized to Mr. Chen .
They had escaped unscathed .
But , on reading the morning papers , they realized they had killed the wrong two men .
My mother had eyes in the back of her head ; Doug Quinn must have them in the palms of his hands .
How else to explain the way he muddled mint for a mojito  and went on to make the rest of the cocktail  while glancing alternately at the door to see if anyone new was coming in , at the far end of the bar to see if anyone was telegraphing thirst , and at the guy in front of him , who was babbling anew about something or other ?
Not once did Mr. Quinn look down at the drink .
It was like bartending in Braille .
He filled beer mugs without watching what he was doing .
He could apparently tell , by the weight of them , when to stop .
He plucked bottles from their perches without pausing to check labels .
He apparently had , in his head , the whole liquor layout at P.J. Clarke ’s , on the East Side .
And he remembered what my companion and I were drinking , even though we had ordered just one round so far , and there were at least 35 people clumped around the bar on this early May night , and he was dealing  alone  with all the tickets from all the servers in the adjacent dining rooms , and he was n’t writing anything down , not that I could see .
“ Another ? ” was all he asked , and a half minute later I had a Hendrick ’s gin martini , up , with olives and jagged little floes of ice , just like the martini before it .
My companion was sipping a second Manhattan with rye , not bourbon , per his initial request .
Mr. Quinn works quickly , and he works without error .
After the Devils loss to the Flyers this postseason , the team searched for answers to explain yet another first round exit .
Jamie Langenbrunner came out to the media , criticizing former coach Jacques Lemaire for his decisions throughout the season .
Even Brian Gionta , a former Devil , weighed in with his opinion .
Now , Lemaire is firing back .
In an article by Star - Ledger beat reporter Rich Chere , Lemaire defended his decisions during the regular season and playoffs this season .
There were many things the coach addressed , but I ’d like to take a look at a few quotes relating to several posts I ’ve wrote about on the blog the past few weeks .
Issue 1 : Line Juggling
One of the criticisms leveled at Lemaire this past season was his constant line - juggling .
I addressed the coach ’s decision to break up the ZZ Pops line , but Lemaire juggled more lines than the ZZ Pops line .
Lemaire moved several players around , working for the optimal lineup against a given team .
As Lemaire said in the article
“ I look at the teams still in the playoffs right now .
They match lines .
I do n’t see why we would be so special that we do n’t have to match lines , ” Lemaire said .
“ As far as switching the players on lines , Scotty Bowman has been known as a great coach and he moved players around a lot .
There are a lot of coaches who move players around when things are n’t going well or playing against certain teams .
I ’ve done it my whole career .
I do n’t think it ’s an issue .
It could be an issue if you ’re not good enough and you need to play with certain guys to get better .
Then , for that particular guy , it would be an issue . ”
Hockey coaches have to switch lines .
In year ’s past , Brent Sutter would use the Devils ’ third line to match against the team ’s first line .
If a coach does n’t change lines and match up with the other team , they do n’t give themselves the optimal lineup out on the ice .
But I do n’t agree with the constant line - juggling this season .
The coach had a dynamite first line , one that could easily lead the team in scoring .
They also brought energy and talent to the ice .
By breaking them up , Lemaire eliminated one of better scoring lines in the entire league .
When asked about the decision to break up the ZZ Pops line , Lemaire said
“ I try to get the best out of players .
Sometimes , yes , I did put guys with certain other guys so they play better , ” Lemaire said , “ but I have to think about the team and what is good for the team .
I ’m happy with the way I ’ve done things .
No regrets .
I ’ve always done this and the success was there . ”
I understand Lemaire ’s idea here – spread the scoring , maybe allow for some other players to get going .
But when the team needed offense or a spark , the ZZ Pops line should have played together .
There was no need to continually switch those players around .
We all know they played well together , and I believe the line should have been kept together , giving the Devils their best offensive line ( and one of the better defensive lines as well ) .
For the rest of my reaction to the article , continue reading after the jump !
Issue # 2 – The Relationship With Jamie Langenbrunner
Lemaire and Langenbrunner did n’t have the best relationship this season , as we ’ve seen in several instances last season .
One of the bigger issues of the season came in Raleigh , North Carolina on April 3 , when Lemaire decided to rest the captain .
Langenbrunner did n’t agree with the decision , but it did n’t stop with him .
Lemaire then tried to give the “ C ” to Colin White for the game , who refused to wear it out of respect for Langenbrunner .
Lemaire believed the situation was overblown , and he did n’t feel it was a big deal .
“ That ’s not a big deal .
It could be a big deal for certain guys .
It was n’t big for me , ” ” Lemaire said .
“ Since I ’ve been coaching , except for the first five years here , I ’ve been switching captains every month and sometimes every two months .
The ‘ C ’ went to different guys .
“ I know that Scotty ( Stevens ) did n’t miss a lot of games , but I think I gave the ‘ C ’ to another guy when he missed some games .
It was so we had a guy to represent the team in that particular game .
I do n’t like several guys having an ‘ A . ’
Then , who is the boss ?
Who is the leader , the man you ’re going to refer to ?
“ That ’s my philosophy .
Obviously Jamie has a different philosophy and that ’s OK .
It ’s the way I do things .
Maybe you do n’t ( like ) it , but I ’m the one coaching .
This is how I do things . ”
Lemaire dropped the proverbial hammer with that last quote .
If that ’s not a direct shot at Langenbrunner , I do n’t know what else it could be .
The Devils needed someone to represent them that night , and I agree with Lemaire – the team needs a leader on the ice to speak to the officials , etc. during the game .
With a bunch of “ A ”s skating around , who takes that responsibility ?
Someone needed to step up during that time .
Lemaire did n’t disrespect Stevens when the former captain needed to sit .
As soon as he hit the ice , he got the “ C ” back .
It ’s not disrespectful , it ’s just something that needed to happen .
Issue # 3 – Ilya Kovalchuk
The Devils ’ are n’t helping themselves sign Ilya Kovalchuk with the complaints from their locker room .
Several players were upset with the way Kovalchuk played last year .
Instead of being expected to be a two - way players , Lemaire allowed Kovalchuk more free - wheeling abilities .
Lemaire had no issue with the way Kovalchuk played .
“ He played different than the other guys because of his talent .
I have no problem with that , ” Lemaire said .
“ He had 6 - 7 chances a game .
You think I ’m going to tell him to play defense ?
Come on .
We ’re looking to score goals here .
Give me a break .
“ I let him play as much as I could as long as it did n’t disturb the whole team : ‘ Play the way you want , but be responsible when it ’s time to come back and when it ’s time to do the job in your zone . ’
Which he was . ”
Kovalchuk actually played a solid defensive game last season , and his abilities far outweighed those of many of the forwards on the team ( except Zach Parise , who is one of the most talented wingers ) .
Kovalchuk was able to generate scoring chances , as his 17 assists with the Devils show .
At times , Kovalchuk ’s play seemed erratic , and he did seem to hog the puck .
But any coach can tell you that restraining an offensive force would n’t be smart .
Devils ’ general manager Lou Lamoriello brought Kovalchuk in to do one thing – score goals .
He played decently in his own zone , and he attempted to make things happen in the offensive zone .
Maybe some players did n’t like it , but Kovalchuk had to do things to make the team better .
**********
So , what do I think of the article ?
I ’m glad Chere gave Lemaire a chance to give his side of the story .
The guy has been getting kicked around the past few weeks , so getting the other side of the story was a good move .
Lemaire looked to clear his name throughout the article , which is what anybody would do in the situation .
And , while I agree with some of his arguments , I still find it hard to completely believe Lemaire .
As the head coach , he should have addressed serious issues within the team ’s locker room .
Lemaire did n’t do this well enough , and as a result , he lost the players .
I think this divide was one of several reasons why the team did n’t do well in the first round .
It ’ll be interesting to see Lamoriello ’s next choice for head coach .
Whoever comes in needs to be tuned into the climate of the locker room .
This team needs someone who knows how to relate and manage players better .
It ’ll be interesting to see if Lamoriello can hire someone who fits this profile .
One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project founder Nicholas Negroponte said that the organization is accelerating its development of the XO - 3 tablet computer and will have a working prototype by December 2010 , two years ahead of projections .
Negroponte said the final product would cost US$ 75 .
" At CES [ 2011 ] we will show a tablet that can be and will be used for children probably in the developed world , " Negroponte said Tuesday during an interview at the MIT Media Lab , the lab he founded .
" It will allow us to start testing many of the things that combine a laptop , an iPad and a Kindle . "
" You 'll see from us , God willing , an Arm tablet , " he said while crossing his fingers .
" The screen area will probably be a 9 - inch diagonal , maybe more . "
Negroponte said that the device might also include haptic feedback and " more important than anything else , a dual - mode display . "
He explained that the device will be able to be used both indoors and in direct sunlight .
Presumably that would mean that in one mode the device uses a backlight and displays information like any traditional laptop , but then in another mode it switches to a display similar to a Kindle e-reader .
" That 's one of the biggest features we need for our kids , " Negroponte said .
" Our kids are outdoors a lot and just having it backlit just does n't work for outdoors and just having it reflective does n't work for nighttime . "
E-ink displays , like those in the Amazon Kindle , Sony Reader and others , have typically been regarded as less stressful on the eyes than backlit displays .
The absence of a backlight , though , makes viewing a page in a dark room near impossible without an additional light source .
He said that the prototype will have a screen made of glass , but that an entirely plastic unit is the goal .
" We really want this to be 100 percent plastic , unbreakable and almost extruded out of a machine , " he said .
A plastic tablet would " probably " be shown at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , he said .
Negroponte agreed that Apple 's iPad helped tablet PCs gain consumer acceptance , but criticized the company 's creation as not being open .
He said that the XO - 3 tablet is " ultimately an open - source Linux laptop , " but that the first ones might run Google 's Android operating system .
He also said the XO - 3 would have standard ports .
In the past OLPC has had trouble hitting its promised price points , but Negroponte said selling the tablet for $ 75 would n't be a problem .
Some naysayers might call his goal unrealistic , but he welcomes the criticism , saying , " When someone looks at me and tells me I 'm realistic , I 'll realize that I 've kind of lost it . "

BAGHDAD
HADI AL - MAHDI , a man you might call the Rush Limbaugh of Iraq , bounded up the stairs to a radio studio in a converted villa beside the Tigris River .
“ Today , ” he said , with impish determination , “ we are going to defend the Sunnis . ”
For the next hour Mr. Mahdi , a Shiite married to a Kurd , did just that .
In a sonorous , sarcastic voice , he ridiculed the murky process that disqualified Sunni candidates in Iraq ’s recent elections as an assault on the multiethnic , multifaith democracy Iraq is supposed to be creating .
As the sun set on another dusty Baghdad evening rush , he condemned not only the man behind the disqualifications ( “ He ’s illiterate . ” ) , but also Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki ( “ Is there glue in your chair ? ” ) ; Mr. Maliki ’s main challenger in the election , Ayad Allawi ; the ministers of education and electricity ; “ this dirty Parliament ” ; and the rest of Iraqi officialdom “ living in the Green Zone , while your family is living abroad . ”
He added : “ Who is going to die ?
Your son ? ”
Mr. Mahdi’s program — “ To Whoever Listens ” on Radio Demozy , 104.1 FM — is a thrice - weekly , populist jeremiad of all that is wrong with Iraq ’s fledgling democracy , and one measure of what the overthrow of Saddam Hussein has led to .

Short story forms .
A certain weather page .
It ’s not hard to argue that USA Today has had a large part in shaping the design of newspapers since it launched in 1982 .
( SND named the founding of the paper the number one “ Influential Moment in News Design ” of the last 25 years in 2004 . )
So when Apple finally announced its iPad earlier this year it was no surprise that USA Today would be one of the first papers to adopt the platform .
The newspaper had a free application available on the day of the launch that has proved popular .
In Apple ’s App Store , it ’s stayed in or near the top 10 free apps list and holds a favorable score from iPad users .
The application is scheduled to switch to a pay model later this summer — a move that will test if users are willing to pay for news content in this new medium .
The design has everything you would expect from the newspaper : photo galleries , graphic snapshots and , of course , the weather .
But the developers also pulled in a few small touches to cement the tie to the print product : a familiar layout , the color coded sections and even graphics representing the cutoff of the newsprint .
SND spoke with William Couch , Interaction Designer at USA Today , via e-mail for some insight into the development of the application .
SND : There is an obvious link between the print edition and the iPad app .
Branding is important , but did you feel iPad readers needed more of a tie to the print edition than say the web or mobile readers ?
William Couch : A couple factors were at play here .
Just around the corner sits Mobile Safari where our website is available for browsing so to replicate that experience felt redundant .
Plus , the site is n’t built to provide the rich , interactive experience that taking advantage of the platform ’s unique features in a native app allows .
The other factor is the iPad ’s screen .
Translating the mobile experience would feel out of place considering the difference between the size of a mobile device ’s screen and the iPad’s .
You can get a sense for this by running any iPhone - based app in 2X mode on the iPad .
Even disregarding the pixel - doubling , the interface just does n’t scale .
Additionally , physical newspapers are made to be held with two hands and casually browsed , so adopting elements of the print layout and experience felt like a natural starting place .
This helps draw a parallel between the experience of the print edition , while maintaining the unique interactive elements of a web and mobile experience .
Apple advocates for referencing real world objects in their human interface guidelines , but recommends that the physical representations be subtle ; less of a literal translation and more of a gentle nudge .
This is what we were trying to achieve in our approach .
SND : USA Today already had an iPhone app to use as a starting point for developing the iPad app .
What were the differences in designing for the two platforms ?
WC : As mentioned , the interface for the iPhone app just does not scale well to this larger screen size .
So , the biggest difference was designing the user interface for a screen nearly five times as large .
One of the beautiful qualities about designing for mobile is knowing how to limit your interface design .
The screen is small enough that it should largely be focused on performing one task at a time .
With more space though , you can add greater visual context while still maintaining focus on a single task .
Aside from interface and layout differences , we worked hard to scale any visual components .
Our photo and graphics editors now have a workflow in place that provides larger versions of their content specifically optimized for a tablet display .
Photo editors will always tell you images look better larger , and when you ’re working with a screen you can hold , that rule holds even more truth .
Despite these differences in our approach to the design for each platform , we did decide not to commit to building or adding any additional features for the iPad app beyond what we had done on the iPhone .
This allowed us to focus on getting the application ’s layout and interface right and not worry about feature bloat .
A look at the USA Today iPad app architectural map
SND : How large was the development team ?
What were their disciplines ?
How long did they have to work on this ?
WC : Our core internal team work varies but there are about four of us who work with Mercury Intermedia , a development group based in Brentwood , TN , which comprises of another variable sized crew , but tends toward three or four more .
I suppose you could count the main folks then with two hands .
The team ’s disciplines are a mix of design , development , IT , business , and legal .
Discussions about the application happened almost immediately after the device ’s announcement , design a few weeks later , and development in the last five or so weeks .
SND : How much time is spent tweaking the presentation daily ?
How many times does the feed to the iPad update throughout the day ?
WC : The stories that cycle at the top of each section are hand - picked by our A1 editor , and are manually updated as needed , but usually at least once a day .
They tend toward our cover stories for the day so that as news breaks later in the day , our “ featured content ” does n’t get buried .
Otherwise , the list of stories is updated automatically several times throughout the day , largely at the whim of the day ’s events .
SND : You ’ve had a while to play with the iPad now .
What have you seen in the App Store that impressed you ?
WC : I think NPR , the New York Times , and BBC have wonderful apps .
Navigating story to story in NPR is a joy , and building a dedicated queue of stories to listen to is a breeze .
The measured focus of the Times ’ application gives the sense of smart , tight editing in the form of an app and the inline video is a nice treat .
I look forward to seeing how they expand upon the app as I doubt this is as far as they ’ll go with this platform .
BBC ’s app has a mix of the Times ’ focus and NPR ’s sense of immediacy with live broadcast streaming that also feels very solid .
Additionally , I personally enjoy The Guardian ’s Eyewitness app which showcases a new gorgeous , high - resolution photo a day that ’s generally tied to a news event , and also offers information about how the photo ’s look was achieved through some light technical tips .
I think that ’s a simple but great bonus that adds a little transparency to the news - gathering process .
SND : The USA Today app has been in the top 10 free downloads in the App Store and has three out of five stars from users .
What kind of feedback are you getting about what users like and do n’t like ?
WC : The feedback has been tremendously positive .
We ’re seeing users reading and enjoying our content who had n’t before , or would on occasion but now do so daily , and loyal readers thanking us for being on the platform from day one .
But being an early entrant to a completely new platform has meant some confusion in navigation and occasional bugs .
We ’ve been listening though , and have fixed or will be fixing these issues quickly .
SND : What can we expect from v1.1 ?
WC : Performance and memory issues will be vastly improved in 1.1 , and we ’ll have market and stock data , along with a daily interactive crossword built in .
There are a few more ideas we have planned , but you ’ll have to wait for the update to see them . 🙂
SND : The app is free now , but will be moving to a pay model after July 4th .
You tried something very different by having a sponsor for the launch that is the only advertiser in the entire app .
How was that decision reached ?
WC : Building and launching an application for a device no one has ever used is not an easy task , so gauging public reception of the device was necessary to help articulate our strategy for a pay model .
With the first three months free , we can introduce users to the application , gather feedback , continue to make the app bulletproof and then determine the best way to proceed .
That said , fairly early on , we were able to demonstrate the potential of the platform to advertisers to secure a sponsor for the launch , so that ’s how we initially approached the issue .

If I asked you to name major Java vendors , chances are EMC's VMware subsidiary would n't top the list .
To most of us , the " VM " in VMware does n't stand for the Java Virtual Machine ; it means the other kind of virtual machine , the kind that lets you run servers and desktops on virtualized OS instances .
But if that 's your assumption , it may be time to change your thinking .
VMware is reinventing itself .
Virtualization may have been the hot topic a few years ago , but its star faded once the OS vendors got into the game .
Now cloud computing is the buzzword of the day .
Observing the trends , Redmonk analyst James Governor went as far as to declare " cloud [ computing ] is the new VMware . "
Naturally , then , the new VMware is cloud computing -- and that puts Java square in its sights .
[ Subscribe today to InfoWorld 's Developer World newsletter and stay up to date on the key software development news and insights . ]
At the Google I/O conference in San Francisco this week , VMware and Google announced a partnership aimed at making it easier for Java developers to deploy applications on the Google App Engine cloud computing service .
This new deal comes hot on the heels of a similar arrangement VMware struck with Salesforce.com in late April , in which VMware provided infrastructure to allow Java apps to run on Salesforce 's Force.com platform .
With these partnerships , VMware is putting its customers on notice that it's not merely a virtualization vendor , but a full - service provider of solutions for cloud computing .
But developers should take notice , too , because if VMware continues down this path , it could potentially mean a whole new era for the Java platform .
Write once , cloud everywhere
Sun Microsystems dubbed Java the " write once , run anywhere " language , but Java developers have always taken that phrase with a grain of salt .
Early in the platform 's history , Microsoft deliberately tried to fragment the Java market by shipping its own , incompatible version -- but even Sun 's own JVM could be inconsistent from OS to OS .
Apple , once a Java backer , dropped support for the language from its Mac OS X developer platform and wo n't allow it on the iPhone or iPad .
The Java ME market is hopelessly fragmented .
Browser applets are dead .
The bright spot for Java has always been the datacenter .
But as I 've mentioned before , cloud computing has the potential to fragment the server - side Java market , by encouraging developers to code their applications to a specific cloud vendor 's services and requirements .
For example , unlike Force.com , Google App Engine supported Java before its deal with VMware , but it has been criticized for not supporting the full Java API .
If developers code to Google 's whitelist of classes rather than the Java standard , then Google has in effect created its own , de facto standard .
With VMware 's partnership with Google , however , a master plan seems to be emerging .
According to VMware 's press release , Google and VMware 's combined toolkit will allow developers to deploy their applications not just to App Engine , but to VMware platforms , Amazon EC2 , and even other ( unnamed ) cloud platforms .
Yeah ... good luck with that :
Acknowledging that Arizona has developed a serious image problem because of its tough new immigration law , Gov. Jan Brewer and tourism - industry leaders said Thursday that they will launch a new effort to stanch the flow of lost trade and convention business in the state .
The legislation and firestorm of negative publicity that followed brought calls for boycotts , moved groups to back out of local conventions and led several cities to cut business ties with Arizona companies .
The loss of business is critical in a recession - battered state vitally dependent on visitor spending .
This is not , as Brewer seems intent on believing , a public relations problem .
She claims that the backlash against the bill that she signed into law ( with , it must be noted , one eye on her own re-election in a multi- candidate GOP primary ) is based on " misconceptions " about the law .
" It 's up to us to get the truth out there .
This is impacting Arizona 's face to the nation . "
( No shit , Sherlock )
Alas , even Brewer 's own Republican Party is falling for these " misconceptions " , since the GOP spurned Phoenix this week , electing instead to hold their convention in Tampa .
Memo to Jan Brewer : this is n't a P.R. problem .
It 's a horrifically bad policy problem .

The Flyers lost to the New York Rangers back on March 14 mostly due to a pest named Sean Avery .
He baited the orange and black into dumb penalties and made them pay with timely offense .
Here 's what we wrote in our game recap that day .
Avery drew two penalties , scored two goals and was a plus two .
On each of his 19 shifts , he genuinely pissed off the Flyers .
He got under their skin .
He pulled a Sean Avery , and the orange and black gave in .
Scott Hartnell dropped his gloves and looked goofy when Avery kept his firmly on his hands .
Braydon Coburn took a penalty late in the third thanks to the impetus , Avery .
Dan Carcillo was visibly bothered by Avery as well .
He did his job and the Flyers could n't keep cool .
He was the difference , and for a Flyers team in the position that they 're currently in , that 's absolutely unacceptable .
Philadelphia went into MSG today and controlled the game from the outset , scoring an early goal on the power play .
Michael Leighton came up strong in goal and things looked to be set .
Then ,
Avery started his crap and it all snowballed from there .
It 's unacceptable .
They let one player completely change the course of this game .
One player who has no business doing something like that .
The sole reason Avery was able to take over the game was because the Flyers entered it with the wrong mentality .
If you remember , the Flyers - Rangers game prior to that match - up featured Dan Carcillo 's beat down on Marian Gaborik , and all the stories leading into the mid-March tilt were about how the Rangers were ready for revenge .
As a result , Peter Laviolette decided to sit guys like Darroll Powe and Ville Leino in favor of Riley Cote , who logically only got a handful of seconds in ice time during the game .
He had no impact on the ice , but his insertion into the lineup sends a message from Laviolette to the players that it 's going to be a physical game .
They lost focus , of course , and wound up losing the game by letting Avery run things .
You 'd think Laviolette would learn his lesson .
Fool me once , shame on you , etc. etc .
But , no .
Check this tweet from CSN's Tim Panaccio .
Leino out vs. NYR : " They need more fighters [ against NYR ] , " he told me
You 've got to imagine that ' more fighters ' means Cote is going to play on Friday night .
By play , obviously , we mean sit the bench for 58 - plus minutes .
Not only do the players recognize the absurdity here ( evident by the fact that Leino brought up ' fighters ' in the first place ) , but you get the sense from this tweet that Leino is bothered by the notion .
And he should be .
The playoffs are on the line here and the Flyers need all the quality in the lineup they can get .
Putting in ' more fighters ' does n't serve a purpose .

Gambling on football is one of America ’s favorite past times .
With the point spread system , the team you ’ve put money on does n’t even have to win the game in order for you to win the bet .
Of course , the team you ’ve bet on can win the game and yet you still lose the bet , as what matters is not who won the game to the gambler , but rather by how much the favorite won by .
If the New York Giants , for example , were favored by 7 1/2 points over the Chicago Bears , and win the game , but only by 7 , those betting on the Giants would lose the bet and those betting on the Bears would win .
The added wrinkle is that sportsbooks in Vegas typically will take 110 % of the amount wagered on losses .
So if you bet $ 100 on the Giants and lost , you would actually have lost $ 110 .
If you bet $ 100 on the Bears and won , then you would win only the $ 100 .
If one assumes that it ’s basically a 50/50 proposition over the long term on beating the point spread , each bet would have an expected value of - 10 % .
Nevertheless , despite the odds , people bet football in record numbers each year .
According to the Las Vegas Sun , gamblers wagered $ 92 million on the Super Bowl last year in Las Vegas alone .
While wordwide totals are merely estimates , generally the Las Vegas action represents about 1 % of total Super Bowl gambling .
So worldwide , the amount of money gambled on the Super Bowl could be reasonably estimated to be close e to $ 10 billion .
It is an excellent thing to put your hard earned money into this field as the Super Bowl is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity and the best gamblers are on the lookout for such a golden chance but the less than fortunate ones have to be content with Judi Slot Online .
Baseball , on the other hand , has relatively little gambling interest .
There are many different theories and explanations as to why .
For one , baseball has a 162 game regular season .
Without doubt , during the course of the season , managers and teams , while of course trying to win every game , will not try to maximize their chances of winning any given game .
Managers are concerned about burning out pitching staffs , trying new players at different positions , and even allowing hitters to work out of slumps rather than bench them , even if the odds of winning a particular game would be greater by changing things around .
This is because over the course of a long season , the managers are concerned about the long term welfare of the team , realizing that in any one game , there are bound to be bad breaks and fluke occurences .
It ’s this type of perspective that , it could be reasonably assumed , tempers the enthusiasm for gamblers to stake money on individual games .
The other big factor is that generally baseball bookmakers do not put point spreads on the games .
( There are some exceptions which I will discuss later , but generally speaking if you bet a team to win the game and that team wins , you win the bet , and , similarly , if you bet on the losing team , you lose the bet .
It does n’t matter if it was a one - run extra inning nail biter or a ten run blowout .
Ah , but there ’s a catch .
If you wager money on the favorite you have to risk more money than you win .
Conversely , if you bet the underdog , you bet less money than you ’ll win .
This is called a “ money line ” as opposed to football ’s “ point spread . ”
People are often confused by the baseball odds listed in the newspaper or on their betting website .
They will see , for example , a line that looks like this :
Boston Red Sox - 7 Baltimore Orioles +6 .
It ’s actually not that complicated .
To understand this line , all you need to do is think in terms $ 5 .
You would need to wager $ 7 to win $ 5 on the Red Sox and wager $ 5 to win $ 6 on the Orioles .
Most online sites today actually allow you to enter in how much you would like to risk , OR , how much you would like to win and then will automatically calculate the other side of the equation .
Sometimes lines are expressed differently .
You might see the Los Angeles Dodgers at - 300 .
This means you would need to wager $ 3 to win $ 1 .
But really it ’s the same thing , just a bit easier to calculate .
Now , there are exceptions .
Many bookmakers offer a money line for football as well , which means you risk more , often a great deal more , than you ’ll win if you ’re betting on the favorite .
But generally speaking people bet the line as it will often make for a more exciting experience as even if a team has an insurmountable lead in the fourth quarter , the point spread may still very much be in doubt .
Any casual perusal of late game tv ratings when one team is comfortably ahead shows the enormous impact that point spread gambling has on football .
And most bookmakers will offer a line of sorts for baseball as well .
But generally it is limited to one run or maybe two .
You could often , for example , bet the Yankees , - 1 1/2 .
So the if the Yankees win by more than just one run , you will win your bet and often will win more than you risked .
The problem with this is that over time you can expect the favorites in baseball to win by exactly one run 18 % of the time , and lose the game outright nearly 40 % of the time .
So you can see that nearly 60 % of the time you will lose that bet .
But baseball betting is actually easier to do successfully than the other sports .
For one , it is a much less efficient market .
Bookmakers are generally just trying to ‘ balance their books ’ and would ideally have an equal amount of ‘ action ’ on both sides of the wager .
They make their money by taking the difference between the 6 and the 7 listed here .
Similarly to football , where they take an additional 10 % off of the losers .
But because there are far fewer gamblers in baseball , there ’s opportunity to exploit inefficient markets .
It is truly amazing how many times a big market team like the Yankees or Red Sox attract action which puts the money line at a much higher rate than where it should be .
If the Yankees are favored by - $ 300 , then the bookmakers are saying that the Yankees are 75 % certain to win the game .
While in certain instances , such as an ace pitcher against a rookie , this could be reasonable , even the worst teams in baseball win close to 40 % of their games , and even the best teams lose 40 % of theirs .
Shrewd baseball gamblers will often look to bet on the underdog , particularly a team that is relatively unknown and playing against a team with a large national following and on a hot streak .
The amateurs , which there are far more than than the professionals , will assume that there ’s ‘ no way ’ the underdog will win that night .
When in fact , careful analysis will show very often how big time teams such as the Yankees are often a bad bet across the whole season as the odds are simply too high , even if the Yankees are their typical contending selves .
As the favorites win usually 18 % of the time by exactly one run , it can make a lot of sense to take both sides of a wager and take the underdog +1 1/2 .
In late inning baseball , a winning team with a 2 or 3 run lead may be happy to let in a run in exchange for an out .
Particularly one with a good closer .
So look for those opportunities and nearly 1 in 5 times you will win both sides of the bet .
Cycle helmets – an overview
Last revised June 2012
Introduction
It is at first surprising to many people that the wearing of helmets by cyclists is a controversial subject .
However , cycling safety is a much more complex issue than many people realise , where best evidence and real - world experience sometimes conflict with received opinion .
Key considerations about risk when cycling , what influences cycling safety and the inter- relationships between safety interventions , cycle use , behaviour and health ( both individual and public ) are often poorly understood .
In particular , opinions as to whether cycle helmets are an appropriate , proportionate or effective intervention are often dominated by emotion and expressed with exaggeration , which can make it difficult to know what to believe .
The Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation ( BHRF ) and cyclehelmets.org were established to provide a resource of best - available factual information and to challenge evidence and policies that do not stand up to scrutiny .
BHRF is pro-cycling and pro-health and seeks to judge the evidence on its merits .
This overview is an attempt to distill the most important evidence and arguments about cycle helmets .
Readers are invited to explore the cyclehelmets.org website for comprehensive information on the topics covered with in - depth technical analysis and references .
A little history
Cycle helmets have been around since 1975 .
They were originally a ' spin - off ' product from the development of expanded polystyrene foams in motorcycle helmets , intended to supersede the old ' hair net ' style of head gear then used in cycle sport .
However , the protection offered by cycle helmets is very much less than that provided by motorcycle helmets due to the compromises in weight and ventilation necessary in order to make them acceptable for an activity such as cycling that involves much physical exertion .
Indeed , because of changes to design in order to address concerns about comfort , modern helmets with soft shells are considered to offer less protection than some earlier designs with hard shells .
At first cycle helmets were promoted mainly by their manufacturers , with competing claims about their effectiveness .
Then , during the 1980s , reports began to be published suggesting that if cyclists wore helmets they would be less likely to suffer head injury .
From that time , the promotion of helmet wearing by cyclists has been a main thrust of road safety and health practitioners in many countries .
How cycle helmets work
Cycle helmets protect the head by reducing the rate at which the skull and brain are accelerated or decelerated by an impact .
The helmet acts like a shock absorber .
As it is impacted , the expanded polystyrene liner is intended to crush , dissipating the energy over a rapidly increasing area like a cone .
Helmets reduce the force of an impact only while the polystyrene liner is compressing .
Once the liner is fully compacted , a helmet offers no further protection and passes residual energy straight on to the skull and brain .
There is no evidence to suggest that helmets continue to provide a reduced level of brain protection beyond their design limits .
When helmets fail , they do so catastrophically , rather than gradually , by breaking .
The breaking of a helmet is not by itself evidence that it has provided useful protection to the wearer .
It is common for cycle helmets to fail prematurely , before the polystyrene liner has been fully crushed .
Indeed , very often helmets break without the liner compressing at all , perhaps because they have been subjected to oblique forces , not directed at the head , that they are not designed to withstand .
If a helmet breaks without its liner compressing , it is likely that no more than superficial protection would have been afforded .
In cases of high impact , such as most crashes that involve a motor vehicle , the initial forces absorbed by a cycle helmet before breaking are only a small part of the total force and the protection provided by a helmet is likely to be minimal in this context .
In cases where serious injury is likely , the impact energy potentials are commonly of a level that would overwhelm even Grand Prix motor racing helmets .
Cycle helmets provide best protection in situations involving simple , low - speed falls with no other party involved .
They are unlikely to offer adequate protection in life - threatening situations .
Standards
Cycle helmets are specified by their manufacturers as meeting one or more of the international standards for this equipment .
All of the standards test the helmet 's protection of only a decapitated headform , ( i.e. one with no body attached ) ; and all tests involve only low speed impacts .
Impact speeds are less than 6.6 m/s ( 24 km/h or 15 mph ) , and in some cases , barely 5 m/s ( 18 km/h or 11 mph ) .
Unlike seatbelt tests , helmet test standards do not realistically replicate serious crashes .
The highest standards are those of the nominally independent Snell Foundation , of which the B - 95 standard is the most rigorous ; however , the Snell standard is rarely used by manufacturers .
The European standard EN 1078 is particularly weak and some other standards have declined over time .
This is in part a reflection of the involvement in these standards committees of the helmet manufacturers , who want to minimise production costs in a fiercely competitive market .
Few helmets are designed to offer protection better than that specified by the standards .
There is no mandatory , third - party testing of helmets , and independent surveys have shown that many of the helmets on sale do not meet the standards to which they are accredited .
Very few meet the more demanding standards .
All standards prescribe tests using a flat anvil ( though with greatly differing impact energies ) but few include a test involving a hemispherical anvil , which is often closer to real - life crash conditions .
No standard specifies tests involving rotational impacts .
The Australian / New Zealand standard 2063:2008 is the first to encourage ( but not require ) the use of softer foam to provide more cushioning for the brain .
This appears to be an acknowledgement that the foam in most helmets is too rigid to crush as intended .
Cycle helmets and rotational injuries
Injuries to the head may be divided into direct , or focal , injuries and rotational , or diffuse , injuries .
Direct injuries occur as a result of linear acceleration of the skull by impact with another object , and typically lead to cuts , lacerations and concussion .
Direct injuries , though sometimes painful , usually have minimal long - term effect .
Rotational injuries , on the other hand , do not necessarily involve direct contact with the head but result in the brain moving relative to the skull as a result of angular or rotational acceleration , which leads to diffuse axonal injury ( DAI ) and subdural haematoma ( SDH ) .
These are the most common ways that road crashes cause death or chronic intellectual disablement .
Cycle helmets may produce benefit by reducing and spreading the forces that lead to direct injuries .
However , they are not designed to mitigate rotational injuries , and research has not shown them to be effective in doing so .
To the contrary , some researchers have expressed concern that cycle helmets might make some injuries worse by converting direct forces into rotational ones .
These injuries will normally form a very small proportion of the injuries suffered by cyclists , but they are likely to form a large proportion of the injuries with serious long - term consequences .
In this way cycle helmets may be harmful in a crash , but this harm may not be detected by small - scale research studies .
Attitudes to cycle helmets
The active promotion of helmet use by cyclists is a fiercely controversial and often emotional subject , with views put forward with great conviction both for helmets and sceptical of their value ( very few people argue against the voluntary use of cycle helmets per se ) .
Controversy is particularly acute with regard to mandatory helmet laws .
The arguments in favour of helmet use are invariably based upon the premise that in the event of a fall , a helmet might substantially reduce the incidence and severity of head injuries .
A relatively small number of medical research papers are cited in support of this premise , most based on case - control studies .
One 1989 paper is cited more often than any other , with its claim that helmets reduce head injuries by 85 % and brain injuries by 88 % .
However , the methodology and findings of this paper have been widely criticised and there is no real - world evidence to support its predictions .
Proponents of helmet use include people from within the medical and road safety professions and also people who believe that a helmet has already saved them , or a relative or acquaintance , from serious injury .
Helmet - sceptic arguments are more varied .
Originally based largely on issues associated with personal liberty , the balance of helmet - sceptic arguments changed during the 1990s as the health benefits of cycling became more acknowledged and as independent research started to be undertaken into the outcomes of rising helmet use and , in particular , the effects of cycle helmet laws .
Principal helmet - sceptic arguments are :
The risk of serious head injury is small and frequently overstated .
The promotion or mandation of cycle helmets is a disproportionate response to this risk .
There is no real - world evidence that helmets have reduced the likelihood or severity of head injuries among whole populations of cyclists .
Helmet promotion ( and especially compulsion ) reduces cycling and the health benefits of cycling .
Less cycling increases risk for those who continue to cycle , whether they wear helmets or not .
Much pro-helmet research and promotional material is flawed or one - sided .
Insofar as there are risks associated with cycling as a form of transport , the greatest risks of serious injury come from inappropriate motor vehicle use and poor cycling behaviour .
Institutionalising the idea that wearing a helmet is necessary for safe cycling diverts attention from more important actions to prevent crashes happening in the first place and results in victim - blaming when crashes do occur through no fault of the cyclist .
Cyclists should not be singled out for helmets when head injuries to pedestrians and motorists are much more numerous .
Helmet sceptics include cycling organisations ( especially in Europe where some have undertaken their own research ) , public health doctors and other professionals concerned with cycling safety , encouraging cycle use and helmet analysis .
Most cycle users are also not convinced of the net benefits of helmet wearing as in most places fewer than a third of people choose to wear one when use is voluntary .
In recent years many individuals and cycling organisations have swung from pro-helmet to helmet - sceptic as a result of experience with helmet laws and the growing breadth of evidence .
Case - control studies suggest that helmets are effective
Most published medical research that has studied the effectiveness of cycle helmets has been based on case - control studies , where groups of cyclists , with and without helmets , have been compared .
This research has led to predictions of very large reductions in head injury through the use of cycle helmets – Table 1 shows the predictions of some of the most frequently cited papers .
Dorsch , 1987 - 90 % fatalities Thompson , Rivara , Thompson , 1989 - 85 % head injuries , - 88 % brain injuries Wasserman , 1990 - 29 % concussions , - 82 % skull fractures McDermott , 1993 - 39 % head injuries ,
but no significant reduction for adults Thompson , Rivara , Thompson , 1996 - 69 % head injuries , - 65 % brain injuries Table 1
Injury savings predicted by case - control studies
Three meta - analyses of case - control studies have also found strongly in favour of helmet effectiveness .
Although a considerable number of papers have been published in the medical journals expressing support for helmet use , very few could be described as primary research into helmet effectiveness .
The majority are either dependent upon the results of earlier research , or are concerned with secondary matters such as the promotion of helmet use .
Other types of evidence do not generally support helmet effectiveness
As early as 1988 Rodgers studied 8 million cases of injury or death to cyclists in the USA over 15 years - the largest survey of its kind ever undertaken .
He concluded that there was no evidence that hard shell helmets had reduced head injury or fatality rates .
Indeed , he found that helmeted riders were more likely to be killed .
A decade later , Kunich analysed cyclist and pedestrian fatalities in the USA and concluded that there was no evidence that cycle helmets were effective in reducing deaths .
Spaite found that bare - headed cyclists more often had severe injuries .
However , this was true even when cyclists without major head injuries were analysed as a group .
The implication being that people who do not use helmets tend to be in higher impact collisions than helmet users , since injuries are more severe to all parts of the body .
In 2001 , the US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that although helmet use had risen over a decade from 18 % to 50 % of cyclists , head injuries had also gone up by 10 % .
There was no clear evidence that cycle use had increased .
An analysis of cyclist and pedestrian fatalities in Canada from 1985 to 2003 showed that trends for both modes were similar and the number of deaths fell in both cases .
However , although cycle helmet use had grown from virtually zero to 50 % over the period , there was no detectable impact on cyclist fatalities compared with pedestrians .
In 2009 , a wide - ranging international review of the literature for the UK Department for Transport ( when both pro-helmet and helmet - sceptic interests had the opportunity to contribute towards the evidence considered ) concluded that there was no reliable evidence that cycle helmets have resulted in a lower risk of head injury for cyclists .
The UK courts have not to date determined that wearing a helmet would have made any material difference in the cases of serious or fatal injury that they have considered .
In these circumstances , a detailed analysis of crash causation and the individual crash circumstances is carried out .
So far as can be determined , nowhere in the world has an increase in helmet use resulted in a fall in head or brain injuries relative to cycle use .
The effect of enforced helmet laws : less cycling and no effect on the proportion of head injuries
Helmet laws in Australia provided excellent data sets with which to test the effectiveness of cycle helmets because a principal effect of the laws was to increase substantially over a short period of time the proportion of cyclists wearing helmets .
This enabled a comparison of a very large number of individuals not wearing and then wearing helmets , eliminating most of the other variables present when comparing different people or dissimilar riding conditions .
At first , reports suggested that legislation had achieved its aim of reducing head injuries .
But the researchers did not take into account the very large decline in cycle use brought about by the laws .
Robinson found that although more than 75 % of cyclists wore helmets post- law , this was mainly because of the disappearance of formerly bare - headed cyclists rather than because of an increase in the absolute numbers wearing helmets .
The main effect of the law was to discourage cycling rather than to encourage cyclists to wear helmets .
Although cycle use fell on average by about 30 % , head injuries fell by only 13 % , so the risk of head injury per cyclist would appear to have increased .
Furthermore , the proportional reduction in head injuries for cyclists was very similar to that for unhelmeted pedestrians over the same period .
In 1999 , the Australian Road Accident Prevention Research Unit compared head injury rates of cyclists , pedestrians and
other road users .
All followed similar declining trends , and the data ( see graph above ) suggests that there was no enduring benefit at all for cyclists .
The report concluded that the law had not been cost - effective .
New Zealand followed Australia with a mandatory helmet law .
This law was also found not to have been cost effective and the head injury rate did not decrease more than for the population at large .
In Canada , too , in those provinces where helmet laws have been enforced , no benefit is apparent .
In British Columbia and Nova Scotia there was no change in the proportion of cyclists suffering head injuries post - law , although cycle use fell markedly .
In Alberta , the helmet law reduced cycling by children by around 56 % while the absolute number of injuries went up .
The effect of unenforced helmet laws : diminished respect for laws generally
Most helmet laws that have been enacted have not been much enforced .
This is especially true of child helmet laws in many states of the USA .
These laws have less impact on either cycle use or helmet use than enforced laws .
There is no credible evidence that they have resulted in a lower risk of head injury .
On the other hand , unenforced laws can erode public respect for the rule of law generally , and traffic laws in particular , especially amongst the young people at whom most helmet laws are targeted .
A conflict of evidence
There is a stark conflict between the predictions of widely - publicised pro-helmet research , which suggests that helmets can deliver savings in head injuries of 65 % to 90 % , and data from other sources that suggest no benefit at all at a population level from cycle helmet use .
All data sources are subject to error and data collection practices vary widely .
But simple data errors are unlikely to account for the large disparities between prediction and the real - world .
Many of the studies urging helmet use rely on gross extrapolation .
For example , Dorsch 's study predicted a 90 % reduction in deaths but did n't actually include a single fatality in its dataset and the majority of helmets in her study were the old - fashioned leather hairnet type .
In subsequent evidence to a parliamentary committee , Dr Dorsch heavily qualified how the results should be interpreted but citations of her work do not usually mention this .
Thompson et al. ( 1989 ) studied for the most part minor head injuries in cyclists treated in emergency rooms and used two different methods to estimate the benefits of helmets .
There was a 70 % reduction in the odds ratio for head injury compared with non-head injured cyclists treated in the same emergency department , and an 88 % reduction compared with cyclists in a Healhcare co-operative who simply fell off their bikes .
Helmet campaigners invariably focus on the latter estimate although the statistical base is weak .
Using the same data , a comparison of helmet wearing rates of the cyclists who fell off their bikes with a control group who did not fall leads to a totally different conclusion : that helmet wearers have the same number of head injuries as non-wearers , but are 7 times more likely to fall off their bikes .
Moreover , data presented in that paper , such as the percentages of bicycles damaged beyond repair and the involvement of motor vehicles , make it clear that the head - injured cases had been in much more severe crashes than the two control groups .
The comparisons were thus not reliable .
To reach their conclusions , helmet campaigners often assume that helmets are equally effective at preventing fatalities and very serious brain injuries as wounds and minor concussions .
The much more modest results from an Australian hospital admission study ( McDermott 1993 ) that found no significant reduction in head injuries for adult cyclists , are hardly ever mentioned .
Most of the frequently cited pro-helmet research has been criticised for fundamental methodological shortcomings , particularly with regard to case - control techniques .
Although randomised case studies are a well - regarded research tool , in cycle helmet research randomised studies have not been practical .
Non-randomised studies are much less robust and are subject to bias from socio-economic factors not under the control of the researcher .
Cyclists choosing to wear helmets are now known to be different from those who choose not to .
Voluntary helmet use is most prominent among females , those who have completed more stages of education , middle to upper income groups and people who have not been drinking ( see below ) .
Children cycling to school in uniform are much more likely to wear helmets than those not in uniform .
This is well established now , but was not known at the time that the early , case - control study research was carried out .
Those who choose to wear helmets tend in any case to cycle in ways that make them less at risk of head injury .
By contrast , large population time - series surveys derived from multiple sources are subject to fewer biases , and data based on large changes in helmet - wearing behaviour after helmet laws are especially robust .
Meta analyses have the potential to minimise bias by basing their analysis over a spread of the scientific research .
However , this has not occurred with the analyses on cycle helmets .
Two of the three meta analyses are based on the same 16 studies whilst the third analysis is based on a subset of 7 of the same studies .
The latter work , published by the normally respected Cochrane Review , is dominated by its authors ' own work and no reference is made to critical analysis of this .
All three meta analyses are based solely on case - control studies ; there is no reference to , or analysis of , studies that found no noticeable change in percentages with head injury for five jurisdictions with hospital admissions data , when helmet wearing increased from a pre-law average of 35 % of cyclists to a post - law average of 84 % .
Elvik ( 2011 ) , applying robust statistical tests , found evidence of bias in one meta analysis that resulted in the benefits of helmets being greatly overstated .
He noted that more recent research shows no net benefit from wearing a helmet .
He also finds that the authors of the Cochrane Review had a conflict of interest , which was not declared , and he criticises the narrow selection criteria used for evidence considered by the Review .
The importance of researchers keeping an open mind
One research project that aimed to justify a helmet law found that helmet use made no difference to head injury rates .
However , a strong link was discovered between head injury rates and the consumption of alcohol or drugs by people cycling .
It just so happened that many of these cyclists did not wear helmets .
This was an important finding that could easily have been overlooked .
It raises the question as to whether other research has confused the effects of alcohol ( and other differences in behaviour ) and not wearing helmets .
Epidemiological research – an area of increasing controversy
Cycle helmet research is not the only area of research where such conflicts exist , as evidenced by an increasing number of papers in epidemiological journals drawing attention to this problem .
There have been issues with studies of the effect of hormone replacement therapy on heart disease , vitamin supplements , cannabis and schizophrenia , antibiotics and the MMR triple vaccine .
Findings that had appeared robust subsequently turned out to be unreliable or simply wrong .
The parallels between these other areas and cycle helmets are considerable , as is the ' snowball effect ' that takes place whereby weak research is cross-referenced and becomes the conventional wisdom .
A particular problem with helmets is that much of the helmet sceptic data and research come from outside the medical sector and is little known inside it .
Ethics
As well as the poor methodology used in some cycle helmet research , there are also ethical issues of concern .
Medical research into helmets has assumed that cycling is comparatively risky ; there never was any significant risk assessment completed to justify helmet promotion .
This represents a serious failure of due diligence .
It is now known that previously sedentary people who start regular cycling may expect to enjoy reductions in mortality rates greater than after giving up cigarette smoking .
Since the actual risks of cycling fall in the same range as for walking and driving , helmet promotion directed only at cyclists should be recognised as a serious threat to healthy public perceptions .
In addition , it is misleading to publish only a subset of the evidence when the wider evidence might lead to a different conclusion , but this has sometimes been the case .
There is a lot of emotional association with helmet research and some researchers may be too committed to a particular outcome to allow them to be as dispassionate as good scientific research requires .
One paper that has attracted much criticism purported to show that a helmet law could be introduced without deterring cycle use .
The authors failed to mention that the law was never enforced , that there had been a considerable fall in cycling prior to the law when heavy promotion took place and that , although there was no further fall in cycling after the law , there was no increase in helmet use either .
Publication bias is a problem that affects all research , whereby papers are only offered for publication and then published if they support the ' right conclusions ' , whether this be to meet the prejudices of the authors or publishers or established societal norms .
Sometimes published helmet research has given more prominence to speculation about helmet benefits than to much stronger evidence that is less supportive of helmet use .
There are other forms of bias , too , such as failing to allow for independent trends and missing data .
Indeed , helmet research has been bedevilled with confounding influences .
Another matter of ethical concern is conflict of interest , that has damaged the reputation of the Cochrane Review .
… but , a helmet saved my life !
Powerful support for cycle helmets comes from people who believe that a helmet has already saved them – or a relative or friend – from serious injury .
This is a very common experience , very much more common than the actual number of life - threatening injuries suffered by bare - headed cyclists .
As there is no evidence that helmets save lives or serious injury at all across cyclists as a whole , most of these perceptions of helmet benefit must be exaggerated .
People often assume that a helmet has been beneficial because it has broken .
However , it is common in these circumstances for the foam liner not to have compressed , indicating that the force towards the head was small .
In many of these instances there may have been no impact at all without a helmet .
Adverse effects of cycle helmets
The apparently large proportion of helmeted cyclists who claim that a helmet has ' saved their life ' suggests that helmeted riders are disproportionately more likely to suffer head - contact crashes compared with bare - headed riders .
This is one of several hypotheses deserving of further investigation .
Risk compensation by cyclists ( whereby some cyclists take greater risks - often subconsciously - when wearing a helmet ) has been confirmed in research and the empirical evidence in its support is becoming stronger .
The phenomenon remains controversial in cycling among some safety professionals , although it is now widely accepted in other areas of life .
There is also evidence of risk compensation by other road users who sometimes overtake cyclists more closely if they are wearing helmets .
A tragic and little known outcome of helmet advocacy is the small number of young children ( 14 known cases world - wide ) who have died through strangulation when playing after leaving their bikes and while still wearing a cycle helmet .
This is significant mainly in the context that it is the only unambiguous evidence showing any relationship between fatalities and cycle helmet use , there being no reliable evidence of any lives saved .
Helmets and cycle use
It is now well established that enforced cycle helmet laws result in much less cycling .
In Australia falls in cycle use averaged more than 30 % and in Canada 28 % to 40 % .
However , much higher levels of abandoning cycling have been recorded among teenagers , with 90 % of teenage girls ceasing to cycle at one Sydney school .
These falls in cycle use have not recovered quickly and there has been a long - term change in the profile of cycling .
In Western Australia , concerted publicity , population growth and higher fuel prices returned cycling to its pre-law level in absolute numbers after ten years , but there was little recovery amongst children or for utility journeys .
Relative to population , cycling levels remain suppressed .
Cycling casualties , moreover , are higher than ever before .
It has been estimated that cycle use in Sydney would most likely more than double if the state 's helmet law was rescinded .
Helmet laws have proved a big deterrent to the use of city hire bikes , which have become very popular in non-law jurisdictions .
Schemes in Melbourne , Brisbane and Auckland have all failed to attract much use due to the need to wear a helmet and schemes in Mexico City and Tel Aviv were not allowed to go ahead until their laws had been rescinded or reduced in scope .
Other helmet law towns are campaigning for law changes before they will invest in bike hire .
Cycle helmet promotion , outside the context of helmet laws , has also been shown to be a strong disincentive to cycle use .
As well as deterring individuals , it deters institutional support for the promotion of cycling by creating concern about liability if people who are encouraged to cycle do not wear helmets .
In European countries , cycling is one of the forms of physical exercise most frequently undertaken by children out of school and any reduction in cycling can impact significantly on children 's fitness .
In all the countries with enforced helmet laws , there is a high level of childhood obesity .
On the other hand , in countries with high levels of cycling and low levels of helmet use , childhood obesity is much less of a problem .
It has been shown that the safety of cycling is closely associated with the number of people who cycle .
Any decline in cycle use leads to increased risk for those who continue to cycle .
Commercial interests
The manufacture and sale of cycle helmets is a highly profitable multi-billion dollar international business , dominated by a few large companies .
These companies have given money to campaigning organisations that seek to boost helmet use and introduce legislation .
The claims made by helmet manufacturers for their products are very modest compared with those made by lobby groups and they do not claim that a helmet will protect from death .
However , the industry has been active in promulgating the results of pro-helmet research by others , even where this predicts benefits from helmet use well in excess of what manufacturers feel able to justify .
In many countries , industry campaigns to boost helmet sales in countries where helmet use is low have been driven by purely commercial considerations .
Is head injury a problem when cycling ?
One outcome of the emphasis in recent years on cycle helmets and head injuries has been to brand cycling as an inherently hazardous activity , with a particularly high risk of head injury .
In fact , this is untrue .
Everyday cycling , like walking , is a low - risk activity , and one where the health benefits outweigh the risk of injury by 20:1 or more .
The bottom line is that people who cycle regularly live longer , on average , than people who do not , with healthier lives and less illness .
This cannot possibly mean that cyclists are especially vulnerable to life - threatening head injury .
In England the number of children each year who experience serious head injury when cycling is no more than about 500 – out of a population of 6 million children who cycle frequently .
Few of these injuries are life - threatening .
The risk of head injury is little more than the average of all childrens ' activities and comparable with travelling as a pedestrian .
Good evidence of the safety of cycling comes from city bike hire schemes worldwide .
Up to 2011 , the popular schemes in London and Dublin had generated over 8 million cycle journeys with no serious casualties of any kind .
This is a very low level of risk and few riders wear helmets .
Health and cycling
The health benefits of cycling are substantial .
Indeed , cycling regularly is the single most effective thing that a person can do to improve their health and increase longevity .
Conversely , however , cycling less – perhaps as a result of being deterred by helmet laws or the exaggerated perceptions of risk generated to promote helmet wearing – results in considerable health loss to both individuals and society .
Obesity is a major health problem in western countries , particularly those with helmet laws .
Very few people who cycle regularly become obese .
Using a model to balance the claimed safety benefits through helmet laws against the health costs of decreased cycling , the University of Sydney has suggested that there would be a net disbenefit of USD 5 billion for a USA - wide law , USD 0.4 billion for the UK and USD 1.9 billion for the Netherlands .
One of the most common forms of brain injury is as a result of strokes , the risk of which is much reduced through cycling .
It would take only a small number of people to be deterred from cycling by helmet promotion or laws for there to be a net increase in brain injuries .
The World Health Organisation has developed a Health Economic Assessment Tool to estimate the economic savings resulting from reductions in mortality as a consequence of regular cycling and / or walking .
Applying the tool to UK data suggests that a hypothetical helmet law would cost society between GBP 304 and GBP 415 annually and lead to an additional 253 premature deaths per year .
According to public health professionals in the UK , the better health from regular cycling is such a powerful benefit that arguments over risk and helmets are simply wasted time .
Safe though cycling is , the best proven way to improve the safety of cycling further is through the encouragement of more people to cycle .
Cycle helmet promotion and laws , on the other hand , discourage cycle use and thereby lead to worse health and safety .
Cutting through the controversy
Analysis by de Jong in 2012 has shifted the focus of the helmet debate away from the effectiveness or otherwise of helmets onto the arguments about the degree to which the large health benefits of cycling outweigh the far smaller risks involved .
de Jong uses mathematical modelling to show that even under the most optimistic predictions of helmet benefit , the net public health outcome of helmet promotion ( let alone laws ) is negative .
This is because the risks in cycling are so small and the health benefits so great , that no reduction in cycle use would be acceptable in public health terms .

Norge har innførte ODF som eneste obligatorisk format for utveksling og publisering av redigerbare dokumenter i offentlig sektor .
Microsofts OOXML er holdt utenfor det gode selskap , og har bare status som « under observasjon » i den såkalte referansekatalogen over tillatte formater .
I fjor kom versjon 2.0 av denne katalogen .
Det er lagt opp til årlige revisjoner av hvilke formater det skal være lov å bruke i fremtiden .
Det innebærer stadige utredninger .
I februar antydet Difi ( IT - direktoratet ) at OOXML er uegnet i Norge , på bakgrunn av en rapport fra Hypatia AS .
Forrige fredag publiserte Difi en ny rapport , som de har bestilt av Bouvet .
Rapporten har status som foreløpig ( versjon 0.9 ) .
Endelig utgave ventes i slutten av måneden .
Den oppsiktsvekkende konklusjon er likevel egnet til å heve noen øyebryn .
Rapporten , som er ført i pennen av Bouvet - konsulent Lars Marius Garshol , slakter nemlig både ODF og OOXML .
- Vi finner det ikke faglig forsvarlig å anbefale noen av disse standardene , fordi kvaliteten på begge spesifikasjonene er lav og fordi utveksling mellom verktøyene ikke fungerer , konkluderes det .
- Må begynne på nytt
Ikke uventet har Microsoft vært sterkt kritisk til at OOXML ikke er med i referansekatalogen .
Den nye utredningen ønsker de velkommen .
- Jeg er glad for at Bouvet har levert denne rapporten .
ODF har aldri vært gjenstand for kritisk evaluering i det offentlige rom - slik Garshol nå påpeker , sier Shahzad Rana , Microsofts representant i standardiseringsarbeidet med OOXML , til digi.no .
Han mener rapporten betyr at ODF og OOXML likestilles .
- I praksis betyr dette at ODF må ut av referansekatalogen , så må man starte arbeidet helt på nytt .
Microsoft- monopol
Bouvet - rapporten sier også at konsekvensen av at begge standardene ikke egner seg er at « Microsoft Office vil fortsette å ha tilnærmet monopol i norsk offentlig sektor » .
- Den delen av rapporten er jeg ikke enig i .
De må i så fall være mer presise og dokumentere hva det betyr .
Ifølge Statistisk sentralbyrå bruker 40 prosent av kommunene åpen programvare .
Det er helt opp til dem om de vil benytte open source - tekstbehandlere .
Det er ingen som tvinger dem til å bruke det ene eller andre , sier Rana .
Ber om innspill
Rana etterlyser at Difi kommer med en pressemelding , slik de gjorde med den forrige utredningen .
- Det kommer noe ut om dette på mandag .
Vi sitter nå og finpusser programmet om et åpent møte vi skal ha om rapporten i slutten av måneden , sier pressekontakt Ingvild Østraat i Difi .
Difi ber for øvrig om innspill til utredningen på sin egen Standardiseringsportal .

Kenny Florian has become the latest victim of a staph infection .
Speaking on his twitter page , Florian had previously revealed that he had been suffering from burstitis in his knee prior to his headline fight with Takanori Gomi at UFN 21 at the end of March .
Unfortunately the injury , which causes the knee to swell , turned septic while Florian was on vacation in the Caribbean – his first holiday in several years .
“ A staph infection in your knee & being in a third world country = not good , ” the fighter post ruefully on April 9th .
A couple of days later he posted , “ Last 2 days have been brutal .
Staph infection has been extremely painful .
Knee looks disgusting .
Two distinct blisters of pus are forming . ”
After returning home to Boston today Florian went to the hospital to get his knee checked out .
Just an hour ago he then left the following post :
“ Being admitted to the hospital .
Not good .
Minor surgery & IV antibiotics on the way .
Damn !! ”
The former No.1 contender in the lightweight division is certainly not the first MMA fighter to have troubles with staph infections .
Unfortunately it ’s an all - too - common complaint in MMA due to the bacteria thriving in places like gym mats , clothes and pads .
With Frankie Edgar becoming the new lightweight champion on Saturday night a new window of opportunity has opened up for Florian to potentially get his hands on the belt , and so he will no doubt be keeping his fingers crossed that his injury does not keep him out of action for long .
Along with his twitter posts in recent days , Ken-Flo also posted several pictures of his injury as it gradually became worse , and for those of you interested in that kind of thing you can see them for yourself below …

Knee Before Fight With Gomi :

Knee Today before entering hospital :
OTTAWA
Warnings that Rahim Jaffer was abusing a special passport issued to Canadians travelling on government business fuelled Stephen Harper ’s doubts about the former Conservative caucus chair and his wife , Helena Guergis .
The warnings , coupled with misuse of Guergis ’s cabinet office for backdoor lobbying , convinced the Prime Minister that Jaffer was falsely presenting himself as an insider .
Sources close to the controversy say Harper was told Jaffer used the passport on a trip to Cuba promoting green technology to the Castro regime .
That raised immediate fears that Cuban officials could have been misled that Jaffer carried Canada ’s seal of approval .
According to one source , that was seen as part of the pattern of deceit and cronyism that badly embarrassed Conservatives and sparked a Commons firestorm .
Diplomats and others representing Canada abroad are prohibited from using special passports for personal travel .
As a minister ’s spouse , Jaffer was entitled to carry the distinctive red passport when accompanying Guergis on official trips .
Details are sketchy but it ’s believed Jaffer went to Cuba independently and met high - ranking members of the administration .
Those discussions apparently focused on how the company Jaffer co-founded , Ottawa - based Green Power Generation , could help Cuba reduce its dependence on imported oil .
Both the company and Jaffer ’s travels are at the centre of the continuing scandal over the defeated Edmonton MP ’s activities and particularly his dealings with shady Toronto financier Nazim Gillani .
It was those dealings that finally convinced the Prime Minister to sack the underperforming Guergis and drive her out of the Conservative caucus .
Last year Jaffer and partner Patrick Glemaud quietly promoted three environmental projects to the federal government worth some $ 850,000 .
While those attempts to secure public funding were unsuccessful , a Toronto Star investigation ultimately exposed that Jaffer was using his Conservative connections to navigate Ottawa ’s back channels without registering as a lobbyist .
That investigation also drew attention to Jaffer ’s 2008 trip with Guergis , then a junior minister , to Belize and Guatemala .
The Star reported that private detective Derrick Snowdy tipped the Prime Minister ’s office that Gillani claimed , among many other things , to be reserving three offshore companies to hold cash for the now disgraced Conservative power couple .
Jaffer and Guergis have denied the allegations and Gillani , who faces fraud charges in another matter , is notoriously loose with facts .
Still , Snowdy ’s reports about offshore companies , influence peddling and cocaine parties with hookers were serious enough for Harper to call in the RCMP .
It ’s not clear when the Prime Minister first learned about the passport issue or if it is part of unspecified information still being withheld about the case .
More certain is that Harper was justifiably riled by the combination of the visit to a country loaded with Canada - U.S. diplomatic sensitivities , as well as the abuse of privilege .
Even so , both the warnings and the Prime Minister ’s reaction are being kept under unusually tight wraps .
That suggests there ’s more to an incident that on the surface seems little more serious than a breach of protocol .
If there is more to the story , no one here is saying much .
Officials at the Cuban embassy are scrambling to find any record of a Jaffer visit , while their Canadian counterparts at Foreign Affairs also seem genuinely in the dark .
In a prepared statement , Guergis said she and Jaffer were briefed on the rules for travelling on a diplomatic passports and that she behaved accordingly .
Jaffer did not respond to questions about the use of the document or the trip .

On Thursday , Sarah Palin 's show Real American Stories debuted on Fox .
Largely a collection of inspirational stories following individuals throughout America , the show certainly did n't spark any controversy .
In fact , the most common criticism appears to be that there simply was n't much of a point : Real American Stories , say critics , was just some overscripted fluff .
Then again , quite a few viewers loved it .
Here 's the roundup ( and New York Magazine 's show highlights below ) :
Show ' Canned , ' Palin ' Scripted ' The New York Times ' Alessandra Stanley suggests the show probably disappointed those who were looking for Palin to show " her true spontaneous and unfettered self . "
Her verdict : " The stories were inspirational .
The show was not . "
Not Palin's Fault , but Production 's argues New York Daily News ' Richard Huff .
" The studio part of the show , " he decides , " was okay . "
He suggests having Palin " do the field interviews " as well so she 's not as " disconnected " from the rest of the show .
Incoherent Optimism at Its Best The Washington Post 's Hank Stuever offers the most extensive analysis .
Remarking , as many do , on the " infotainment " feel of Real American Stories ( " A commercial ?
News ? " ) , he nevertheless finds it " sort of interesting to watch [ Palin ] do somethinn she 's really good at : doling out warm fuzzies -- emphasis on fuzzy . "
His explanation ( and critique ) of the string of dog - saves - boy , Marine - saves - comrade stories :
she is never more believable than in the land of nebulous platitude , hosting a show made up of curiously unrelated , seemingly freeze - dried profiles that all fit under the giant label of " inspiring . " ...
So for an hour she glommed on to some of her real Americans ' realness and turned it all into something that is pointless to argue : America is great .
People can do whatever they set their mind to because they are exceptional , because America is exceptional .
The search continues for a tune that Palin and Fox News seem forever convinced goes under -sung .
Uncontroversial , at Least , observes New York Magazine 's Josh Duboff , recalling the LL Cool drama leading up to the show 's debut .
He also remarks on Palin 's incessant patriotism .
Hot Air Commenters ' Mixed Reviews
At the Hot Air open thread on the subject , one self - described Palin supporter calls the show " 60 miles wide and 3 inches deep , " and " unpresidential and potentially damaging to the campaign . "
The commenter continues to say the country needs " serious and contemplative intellectuals to run and defeat the Marxist nightmare , " and this show did n't help .
" What was she trying to accomplish by doing this show ? " the commenter wonders .
Another answers : " to associate her face / name with the virtues that America has traditionally stood for .
Struggle and sacrifice ; adapt , improvise , overcome ...
Hopefully this will be a series that elevates the individual over the collective . "
A third points out that " it 's her first show , " and suggests critics " let the woman get her sea legs . "
Twitter Love On Twitter , the hashtag # RealAmericanStories is a torrent of rave reviews .
One tweeter summarizes the show as " the kind of show you want to save & re-watch if become cynical of people or need a lift .
A + " Others comment on the individual stories , one calling one of the kids " adorable . "
Here and there , a few add that the show is a " smart move . "

Car and Driver Names Heidi Montag ' Safest Passenger ' for Front - End Airbags
Publication hails her constant improvements in quality and size .
EALITY television star Heidi Montag has received Car and Driver magazine 's highest rating in its new " Safest Passenger " category for what the raters called " Montag 's high - quality frontal airbag system , which protects not only herself , but any passengers who may come in contact with her front end during a collision . "
In numerous crash tests featuring a carefully calibrated Heidi dummy , the life - sized doll was repeatedly spared any front - end damage , which , testers noted , " included protection of the entire torso , neck , and head areas because of the enormous size of the front - end airbags , as well as their advanced pre-deployed technology . "
Testers rated the Montag 's airbag system " excellent " for its ability to remain fully deployed at front - end collisions of up to 40 m.p.h. " even without seat restraints . "
However , the magazine warned that , when the Heidi dummy was thrown clear of the vehicle at higher speeds , " performance suffered from a dangerous tendency of the airbags to bounce off the ground and land the Montag unpredictably . "
Although this scenario was still safer than the usual outcome for a driver who fails to use seat belts , it was frowned upon , not just as a general practice , but because of the risk to innocent bystanders " who might be in the path of an incoming Montag . "
At lower speeds without restraints , testers praised the Montag 's ability when thrown clear of the vehicle " to float on its reliably deployed silicone cushioning system until help arrives . "
Car and Driver did give Heidi Montag lower marks for her lackluster performance in rear and side collisions , because of what the magazine called " the maker 's singular obsession with front - loaded safety features , to the exclusion of all other regions except minor rear padding , which did not afford measurable protections . "
All in all , Heidi Montag received a B + for her " superior front - end airbag technology , " as well as " her never - ending commitment to improving size and quality . "
Ms. Montag 's publicist says the reality star was " delighted " to hear the news , adding , " Heidi has never received a grade even close to a B+ before . "

home | 6th - 15th centuries GENGHIS KHAN and the GREAT MONGOL EMPIRE ( 1 of 4 )
Genghis Khan and the Great Mongol Empire
Genghis Khan | to the Gates of Vienna | from Ogedei to Mongke the Reformer | Kublai Khan in China and to Japan
Genghis Khan
The knights at their tournaments , in their finery , armor and emblems of ancestry , believed they were the foremost warriors in the world , while Mongol warriors thought otherwise .
Mongol horses were small , but their riders were lightly clad and they moved with greater speed .
These were hardy men who grew up on horses and hunting , making them better warriors than those who grew up in agricultural societies and cities .
Their main weapon was the bow and arrow .
And the Mongols of the early 1200s were highly disciplined , superbly coordinated and brilliant in tactics .
The Mongols were illiterate , religiously shamanistic and perhaps no more than 700,000 in number .
Their language today is described as Altaic , a language unrelated to Chinese , derived from inhabitants in the Altay mountain range in western Mongolia .
They were herdsmen on the grassy plains north of the Gobi Desert , south of Siberia 's forests .
Before the year 1200 , the Mongols were fragmented , moving about in small bands headed by a chief , or khan , and living in portable felt dwellings .
The Mongols endured frequent deprivations and sparse areas for grazing their animals .
They frequently fought over turf , and during hard times they occasionally raided , interested in goods rather than bloodshed .
They did not collect heads or scalps as trophies .

Mongolia Mongolia , with white " yurts " in the valley
From his late teens to age thirty - eight in the year 1200 , a Mongol named Temujin ( Temüjin ) rose as khan over various families .
He was a good manager , collecting around him people of talent .
He was vassal to Ong Khan , titular head of a confederacy , and Temujin joined Ong Khan in a military campaign against Tatars to their east .
Following the success of this campaign Ong Khan declared Temujin his adoptive son and heir .
Ong Khan 's natural son , Senggum ( Senggüm ) , had been expecting to succeed his father and plotted to assassinate Temujin .
Temujin learned of this , and those loyal to Temujin defeated those loyal to Senggum .
Temujin was now established as the head of what had been Ong Khan 's coalition . , and in 1206 , at the age of 42 , Temujin took the title Universal Ruler , which translates to Genghis Khan .
Like peoples elsewhere , Genghis Khan 's subjects saw themselves at the center of the universe , the greatest of people and favored by the gods .
They justified Temujin 's success in warfare by claiming that he was the rightful master not only over the " peoples of the felt tent " but the entire world .
As Genghis Khan , Temujin thanked his joyous supporters for their help and their loyalty , and he continued organizing .
He improved his military organization , which was also to serve as a mobile political bureaucracy , and he broke up what was left of old enemy tribes , leaving as ethnically homogeneous only those tribes that had demonstrated loyalty to him .
Genghis Khan created a body of law that he was to work on throughout his life .
This included outlawing the tradition of kidnapping women .
The kidnapping of women had caused feuds among the Mongols , and , as a teenager he had suffered from the kidnapping of his young wife , Borte , and he had devoted himself to rescuing her .
In addition , Genghis Khan declared all children legitimate , whomever the mother .
He made it law that no woman would be sold into marriage .
The stealing of animals had caused dissension among the Mongols , and Temujin made it a capital offense .
A lost animal was to be returned to its owner , and taking lost property as one 's own was to be considered thievery and a capital offense .
Temujin regulated hunting – a winter activity – improving the availability of meat for everyone .
He introduced record keeping , taking advantage of his move years before to have his native language put into writing .
He created official seals .
He created a supreme officer of the law who was to collect and preserve all judicial decisions , to oversee the trials of all those charged with wrongdoing and to have the power to issue death sentences .
He created order that strengthened his realm and improved his ability to expand its territory .
Conquests in Northern China
Genghis Khan moved to secure his borders .
To his south he made an alliance with the Uyghurs , who were closer than the Mongols were to the Silk Road and to wealth .
He married his daughter to the Uighur Khan , and the Uighur Khan brought to the wedding party a caravan laden with gold , silver , pearls , brocaded fabrics , silks and satins .
The Mongols had only leather , fur and felt – a humiliation for a master of the entire world .
Genghis Khan needed booty to pay troops securing his northern border and subduing an old enemy there , the Merkits .
He acted on his mandate as the rightful ruler of the entire world and attacked the Tangut conquerors of northwestern China from a century before , the Tangut ruling Chinese farmers and herders there .
The Tangut had much in goods like the Uighur Khan .
Against the Tangut the Mongols were outnumbered in warriors two to one , and the Mongols had to learn a new kind of warfare against fortified cities , including cutting supply lines and diverting rivers .
Genghis Khan and his army were victorious , and in 1210 Genghis Khan won from the Tangut recognition as overlord .
Also in 1210 , the Jurchen emperor , Weishaowang , who ruled a part of northern China that included Beijing , was concerned .
He sent a delegation to Genghis Khan demanding submission as a vassal .
The Jurchen emperor controlled the flow of goods along the Silk Road , and defying him meant a lack of access to those goods .
Genghis Khan discussed the matter with his fellow Mongols and chose war .
Genghis , according to the scholar Jack Weatherford , prayed alone on a mountain , bowing down and stating his case to " his supernatural guardians , " describing the grievances , the tortures and killings that generations of his people had suffered at the hands of the Jurchens .
And he pleaded that he had not sought war against the Jurchens and had not initiated the quarrel .
note36
In 1211 , Genghis Khan and his army attacked .
The Jurchens had a large and effective army but they were hard pressed by both the Mongols and the Tangut .
And the Jurchens were under attack by Chinese from south of the Yangzi River , the Southern Song emperor there wishing to take advantage of the Jurchen - Mongol conflict to liberate northern China .
The Jurchens drove the Chinese armies into retreat .
The Mongols were benefiting from China having failed during the previous century to make itself a strong military power , and the Mongols were benefitting from the Jurchens being burdened by their rule over a conquered people .
The Mongols were benevolent toward those who sided with them and used terror and violence against those who did not .
The Mongols ravaged the countryside , gathered information and booty and drove populations in front of them , clogging the roads and trapping the Jurchens within their cities , where Jurchen authority was subject to revolt by those they had conquered .
The Mongols used conscripted labor in attacking cities and in operating their newly acquired Chinese siege engines .
Against the Jurchens the Mongols had an advantage in diet , which included a lot of meat , milk and yogurt , and they could miss a day or two of eating better than Jurchen soldiers , who ate grains .
Genghis Khan and his army overran Beijing and pushed into the heartland of northern China .
Military success helped as people acquired the impression that Genghis Khan had the Mandate of Heaven and that fighting against him was fighting heaven itself .
The Jurchen emperor recognized Mongol authority and agreed to pay tribute .
A bow similar to the common weapon of the Mongol armies
After six years of fighting the Jurchens , Genghis Khan returned to Mongolia , leaving one of his best generals in charge of Mongol positions .
Returning with Genghis Khan and his Mongols were engineers who had become a permanent part of their army , and there were captive musicians , translators , doctors and scribes , camels and wagonloads of goods .
Among the goods were silk , including silken rope , cushions , blankets , robes , rugs , wall hangings , porcelain , iron kettles , armor , perfumes , jewelry , wine , honey , medicines , bronze , silver and gold , and much else .
Goods from China would now come in a steady flow .
The Mongols were happy to be back from China , their homeland higher in elevation , less humid and cooler .
As eaters of meat and sparsely populated they felt superior to people in northern China , but they liked what China had to offer , and at home there was change .
The continuing flow of goods from China had to be administered and properly distributed , and buildings had to be built to store the goods .
Success in war was changing the Mongols – as it had the Romans and the Arabs .
Into Afghanistan and Persia
Genghis Khan wanted trade and goods , including new weapons , for his nation .
A Mongol caravan of several hundred merchants approached a recently formed Khwarezmian Empire in Persia and Central Asia .
That empire 's sultan received them by having the chief of the envoys killed and the beards of the others burned , and he sent the other envoys back to Genghis Khan .
Genghis Khan retaliated .
In the coldest of months he and his Mongols rode across the desert to Transoxiana , with no baggage , slowing to the pace of merchants before appearing as warriors in front of the smaller towns of the sultan 's empire .
His strategy was to frighten townspeople into surrendering without battle , benefiting his own troops , whose lives he valued .
Those frightened into surrender were spared violence .
Those who resisted were slaughtered as an example for others , which sent many fleeing and spreading panic from the first towns to the city of Bukhara .
People in Bukhara opened the city 's gates to the Mongols and surrendered .
Genghis Khan told them that they , the common people , were not at fault , that high - ranking people among them had committed great sins that inspired God to send him and his army as punishment .
The city of Samarkand surrendered .
The sultan 's army surrendered , and the sultan fled .
Genghis Khan and his army pushed more deeply into what had been the sultan 's empire , into Persia .
It is said that the caliph in Baghdad was hostile toward the sultan and supported Genghis Khan , sending him a regiment of European crusaders who had been his prisoners .
Genghis Khan , having no need for infantry , freed them , with those making it to Europe spreading the first news of the Mongol conquests .
Genghis Khan had 100,000 to 125,000 horsemen , with Uighur and Turkic allies , engineers and Chinese doctors – a total of 150,000 to 200,000 men .
To show their submission , those his army approached offered food , and they were guaranteed protection .
Some cities surrendered without fighting .
In cities the Mongols were forced to conquer , Genghis Khan divided the civilians by profession .
He drafted the few who were literate and those he could use as translators .
Those who had been the city 's most rich and powerful he wasted no time in killing , remembering that the rulers he had left behind after conquering the Tangut and the Jurchens had betrayed him soon after his army had withdrawn .
It is said that the Genghis Khan 's military did not torture , mutilate or maim .
But his enemies are reported as having done so .
Captured Mongols were dragged through streets and killed for sport and to entertain city residents .
Gruesome displays of stretching , emasculation , belly cutting and hacking to pieces were something European rulers were using to discourage potential enemies – as was soon to happen to William Wallace on orders from England 's King Edward I .
The Mongols merely slaughtered , and preferred doing so from a distance .
The city of Nishapur revolted against Mongol rule .
The husband of Genghis Khan 's daughter was killed , and , it is said , she asked that everyone in the city be put to death , and , according to the story , they were .
Into Azerbaijan , Armenia and Eastern Europe
While Genghis Khan was consolidating his conquests in what had been the Khwarezmian Empire , a force of 40,000 Mongol horsemen pushed through Azerbaijan and Armenia .
Without Genghis Khan they defeated Georgia 's Christian crusaders , captured a Genoese trade - fortress in the Crimea and spent the winter along the coast of the Black Sea .
In 1223 , as they were headed back home , they met 80,000 warriors led by Prince Mstislav of Kiev .
The Battle of Kalka River ( map location ) commenced .
Staying out of range of the crude weapons of peasant infantry , and with better bows than opposing archers , they devastated the prince 's standing army .
Facing the prince 's cavalry , they faked a retreat and drew the prince 's armored cavalry forward , taking advantage of the over - confidence of the mounted aristocrats .
Lighter and more mobile , the Mongols strung out and tired the pursuers and then attacked , killed and routed them .
In 1225 , Genghis Khan was back in Mongolia .
He now ruled everything between the Caspian Sea and Beijing .
He looked forward to the Mongols benefitting from caravan trade and drawing tribute from within the empire .
He created an efficient pony express system .
Wanting no divisions rising from religion , he declared freedom of religion throughout his empire .
Favoring order and tax producing prosperity , he forbade abuse of people by troops and local officials .
Soon again , Genghis Khan was at war .
He believed that the Tangut were not living up to their obligations to his empire .
In 1227 , around the age of sixty - five while leading the fighting against the Tangut , Genghis Khan , it is said , fell off his horse and died .
In terms of square miles conquered , Genghis Khan had been the greatest conqueror of all time – his empire four times larger than the empire of Alexander the Great .
Mongols believed that he had been the greatest man of all time and sent from heaven .
Among them he was known as the Holy Warrior , and not unlike the Jews , who continued to see hope in a conquering king ( messiah ) like David , Mongols were to continue to believe that one day Genghis Khan would rise again and lead his people to new victories .

I just completed my second year with my Wii Fit .
I started out at 203 pounds , and by the completion of the first year I was below 180 .
For the duration of the second year , I have kept my weight strictly in a range of 180±3 .
That includes weekends , holidays , ... the works .
I accomplished this with 10 minutes a day exercise plus once a week going to the gym or doing an equivalent workout , but mostly by doing The Line Diet , in this case a horizontal line .
Along the way , I bought the Wii Fit Plus software ( a minor but worthy upgrade ) , and got a physical ( my doctor was pleased ) .
While my weight did n’t go down in absolute terms , the only measurement I track did : my waist went from 34 " in 2008 to 33 " in 2007 to 32 " now .
Rings that were once tight now are loose .
Shoes that once fit have had to be replaced .
For comparison , on Atkins , I got to a lower absolute weight , but never down to these measurements .
That , and I did n’t find Atkins sustainable for me .
As to that 3 piece suit that I wore 30 years ago , it now is wearable .
It would fit better except that I seem to have grown a bit in the upper chest .
As us programmers would say , that ’s not a bug , but a feature .

9 Simple Tricks to Save $ 1000 Per Year on Coffee
This guest post is from Raza of TheCoffeeMakerStore.com .
It ’s hard to argue against these two facts : 1 ) people love coffee and 2 ) people love money ( sometimes it ’s hard to tell which one they love more ) .
So if the first thing you look for in the morning is coffee , then listen up , because the following tidbits could save you hundreds , maybe even thousands of dollars per year .
Sound outlandish ?
Well think about this ; coffee is the second most highly traded commodity in the world , after oil .
According to some research , Americans consume about 10 pounds of coffee beans per year .
Coffee is big , big business .
And you ’re a big part of it .
Let ’s assume you buy two large specialty coffee drinks per day .
Assuming it ’s $ 4 per cup , you ’re spending over $ 150 per month on coffee .
Not to mention lunch , muffins , or other snacks .
Living it up like this might not be much of a strain on your pocket book , but most people could definitely afford to pinch some of those pennies .
So how can you get some of that money back in your pocket ?
Check out these 9 simple tricks to help you save over $ 1000 per year on coffee :
Expensive Is n’t Always Best
In a blind taste test by NYMag food critic Adam Platt , he ranked 7 cups of coffee , of which Starbucks ranked last !
Their coffee is $ 2.11 vs. $ 1.79 for Dunkin Donuts .
Choosing DD could save you almost $ 230 per year , that ’s if you just have to have coffee when you ’re out .
The savings are even more dramatic if you ’re willing to brew at home .
Buying Starbucks beans and brewing them at home can save you upwards of $ 1200 per year , and over $ 1000 if you buy beans from Dunkin Donuts .
That ’s enough for a cruise to the Bahamas .
Let that sink in for a while …
Alternate Your Energy Fix
Many people just drink coffee for the caffeine boost .
If you just drink coffee for the caffeine induced energy fix , consider this ; exercising or eating fresh fruit may give you more energy than a cup of coffee .
Some studies say that eating an apple produces much more energy than a cup of coffee .
Most people do n’t eat enough fresh fruits and vegetables anyway , s o you ca n’t go wrong with this .
Exercise has many known health benefits , including adding more pep in your step .
4 Ways To Re-Use Your Grounds
Used coffee grounds can save you a lot of money around the house .
You can use coffee grounds as a natural deodorizer in your fridge or freezer .
You can use coffee grounds as a natural fertilizer in your garden or compost heap .
The high nitrogen content is very good for the soil .
Coffee grounds are also great for keeping neighborhood cats and ants out of your garden .
Cats just do n’t like the smell , and chemicals in coffee burn ants ’ legs .
As if that were n’t enough , you can stretch the coffee you drink by simply adding 50 % new coffee grinds to your already used coffee grounds .
It ’s just enough to make it taste fresh , and also stretch the beans .
You may want to do this especially if you ’re buying expensive coffee .
Just try it out and see if you can taste a real difference .
You can always tweak the ratio to match your tastes .
Buy From Walmart ?
Some large retailers ( even ones known for not treating their employees very well ) are starting to offer Fair Trade coffee .
This is good for coffee farmers because it helps them earn a more decent living wage for their work .
But it also helps consumers because this coffee , which is typically more expensive , is more affordable now that it ’s on the shelves of major retailers .
It ’s too early to tell if this will have a lasting and meaningful impact on coffee famers , but it ’s a good start .
If you can buy fair trade coffee at a slightly cheaper price , why not ?
Mix It Yourself
If you love Starbucks Frappucino ’s for example , opt for an iced latte instead , it ’s pretty much the same thing .
The trick is to ask for extra syrup .
If you ’re still feeling creative , buy black coffee and add your own combination of milk , cream , sugar , etc .
Or you could ask for a double shot of espresso in a large cup , and then create your own latte by adding your own milk .
You may not get the taste right the first time , but it will help you save some money in the long run .
Plus , it could be fun to make your own creative combinations at the condiment station .
Look for Gift Cards
Gift cards wo n’t necessarily save you money , but here ’s a creative twist .
Look for gift cards on Craigslist and Ebay .
If you work for a big company , see if they sell discounted gift cards .
In most cases , you can probably find unwanted gift cards and discounts .
This probably is n’t worth your time if you ’re an occasional coffee drinker .
But if your coffee habit is burning a hole in your pocket , this tip could save you quite a bit .
Get Spicy !
Do you like flavored coffee ?
Why not make your own ?
Here are some cool things you can add to your coffee grounds : whole cloves , dried blueberries , grated orange peels , lemon peels , cinnamon sticks , toasted walnuts , toasted almonds , cocoa , nutmeg , etc .
You can even add the liquid extracts to ground coffee like vanilla .
Membership Has It Benefits
If you buy your own coffee beans , consider membership to a coffee club .
There are plenty of coffee clubs online .
Typically you ’ll save money by buying from them rather than buying beans here and there .
Just Google “ coffee club ” and you ’ll find tons of coffee - of - the - month clubs to cater to your taste and budget .
Buy a Coffee Maker
Now this one is near and dear to my heart .
Buy a good coffee maker !
Buying a high quality coffee maker and consistently using it is the best way to save money on coffee .
You ’re buying the beans and grinding them at home anyways ( you are , are n’t you ? )
Pod coffee makers are getting really popular , and while they ’re great because you do n’t have to make an entire pot of coffee ( especially if you live alone ) , the price of constantly buying new coffee pods might start to get a little out of control .
Still , they ’re a lot cheaper than going to your favorite mega coffee chain .
So here are 9 little tricks that will help you save lots of money on your coffee habit .
Following this simple advice could you tons of money without having to completely give up your favorite indulgence .

How do you save money on your hot drinks ?
ANTONIO GONZALEZ is , ironically enough , delighted with Arizona 's new law against illegal immigration .
He is president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project ( SVREP ) , which works to mobilise American Latinos as a political force .
Its motto is su voto es su voz , your vote is your voice .
The Latino movement usually grows by spurts in response to xenophobic overreactions by conservative America , and the Arizona law may be the biggest overreaction yet , according to Mr Gonzalez .
It has “ done more to organise our community than we could have done ” and made it “ the most vibrant social movement in America today , 100 times larger than the tea- party movement . ”
Arizona 's law , signed on April 23rd , makes illegal immigration a state misdemeanour in addition to a federal civil violation .
It also requires local police , after making a “ lawful contact ” , to check the immigration status of people who cause “ reasonable suspicion ” , and to arrest them if they lack documents .
To Mr Gonzalez the phrases “ lawful contact ” and “ reasonable suspicion ” allow cops selectively to pull over Hispanic - looking drivers like him on the pretext of a scratched windscreen or other trifle .
The deputies of Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Maricopa County , which includes Phoenix , the state capital , are already notorious for doing this sort of thing , and the law would require cops to do it statewide .
And so a backlash has begun .
Last weekend demonstrators protested in cities across the country , wearing T - shirts that said Todos somos Arizona , we are all Arizona .
Liberal places such as San Francisco have threatened to boycott the state , and private companies have cancelled conferences there .
Even Major League Baseball is considering relocating its 2011 All - Star Game , the first ever slated to be played in the state .
To Arizona 's conservative machos , this one hurts — especially since it recalls the National Football League 's decision in 1991 to move the 1993 Super Bowl to punish Arizona for not making the birthday of Martin Luther King a holiday .
( Arizonans then swiftly voted for MLK day . )
In the 1990s a similar backlash occurred in response to a Californian law , Proposition 187 , approved by ballot in 1994 but blocked by the courts before it could go into effect .
Supported by Pete Wilson , the Republican governor at the time , its objective was to keep illegal immigrants , most of whom were and are Hispanic , from using public services such as education and health care , and like the Arizona law , it required police to check up on suspects ' immigration status .
Instead , 187 galvanised Latinos , who registered to vote in record numbers and changed the politics of California permanently .
Even Republicans now fear alienating them .
Latinos in other states , notably Texas , have also become more politically assertive .
But those in Arizona appeared to be different until now .
Many have been American for several generations , barely speak Spanish and are themselves ambivalent about the illegal immigrants coming through the Sonoran desert from Mexico , many of whom smuggle drugs or commit crimes .
Just last week , there was another manhunt in the desert for illegal immigrants who had shot a sheriff 's deputy .
But it now turns out that Arizonan Latinos are not different at all , says Arturo Vargas of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials ( NALEO ) , another Hispanic lobby .
He worries that they are as reluctant as Latinos in California , Florida , Texas and New York to participate in this year 's census because many of them fear that the information will be passed to immigration officials .
This means that the population in these states could be undercounted , and the Arizona law has made that risk greater by increasing the disquiet .
Simultaneously , though , Mr Vargas is encouraged to note that the law seems to have turned nearly every Latino citizen in Arizona into a lifelong voter .
But what does such mobilisation mean for America 's politics ?
William Frey , a demographer at the Brookings Institution , a Washington , DC , think - tank , believes that Arizona may be a bellwether for the whole country in more ways than one .
Over the past two decades Arizona 's Latino population of children and young adults has grown so fast that the state now has what he calls the largest “ cultural generation gap ” in the country : 83 % of Arizona 's older people are white , but only 43 % of its children now are .
States like Nevada , California , Texas , New Mexico and Florida have gaps almost as large .
As a result , says Mr Frey , old white voters increasingly balk at paying taxes so that people they consider alien can go to school or the emergency room .
The result , he thinks , is populist anger rather akin to that now fuelling the tea - party movement , which draws much of its support from white male baby - boomers .
It is possible , says Mr Frey , that in Arizona the seeds of new racial and ethnic competition for public resources have been planted .
Polls seem to bear this out .
One , by the New York Times / CBS News , suggests that 82 % of Americans consider it either very or somewhat likely that the Arizona law would lead to people of certain racial groups being singled out .
Yet slightly more than half of Americans also think that the law is about right , and another 9 % think it “ does n't go far enough ” .
Our own You Gov poll ( see chart ) shows large majorities in favour of a range of enforcement measures .
Within Arizona , people like Sheriff Arpaio , who has been re-elected four times , have soaring approval ratings .
Mr Arpaio even thinks he could be elected governor ( although he decided this week to content himself with remaining sheriff ) .
So instead of just one mobilisation , by Latinos , there may be two or more .
And they could clash , pitting the old and white against the young and brown .
Mr Gonzalez is sanguine about this risk .
The marches of the past week have shown that many whites , blacks and Asians stand with Latinos in demanding more humane federal immigration policies .
“ Every American who does n't want to see an apartheid Jim Crow society return will come to our side , ” he predicts .
Yet the other side produced protesters too , wearing T - shirts that said “ Remember the Alamo ” .
The Milky Way from Outside
We sometimes forget the conditions under which great images get made .
A few years back , in one of the earliest posts on his systemic site , Greg Laughlin ( UC - Santa Cruz ) showed the image you see below , a famous shot made by the Hubble telescope of the ‘ Sombrero Galaxy , ’ M104 .
It ’s obvious why this image is a classic .
As Greg notes , “ The glow of its halo makes the idea of 100 billion stars seem comprehensible . ”
But look at the follow - up picture , which Greg made to demonstrate his point .
While the Hubble image is a long CCD time - exposure to light gathered by a 240 cm mirror , your own eyes would deliver something considerably different .
From 300,000 light years , M104 is noticeable only as a dim and lurking shape .
You can see the same effect for yourself if you find the Andromeda Galaxy , subtening an angle larger than the full Moon in our skies but as evanescent as smoke when viewed by the naked eye .
The dim , fuzzy object is out there if you know where to look , but it ’s not exactly impressive without a telescope .
The Intergalactic Wanderer
I used to imagine settings beyond the galaxy , where the great pinwheel of the Milky Way would dominate the sky , but you ’d have to be a lot closer than Andromeda ’s two million light years to get a true spectacle .
Suppose , though , there were a way to leave the galaxy , something like what Ray Villard talks about in a recent article .
We know that every 100,000 years or so the supermassive black hole at the galactic center ejects a star at speeds high enough to leave the galaxy .
These ‘ hyper- velocity ’ stars are an interesting study in their own right , having velocities of over 1000 kilometers per second , compared to the more sedate 100 kilometers per second of the average star .
What exactly causes a hyper - velocity star to move like this ?
I checked in with the Hyper - Velocity Star Project to learn the following :
These stars are so fast that the gravitational pull of our galaxy is overcome .
They reach the escape velocity and hurtle out of the galaxy .
There are a few theories about what makes them achieve this velocity .
They could be the result of a supernova as is believed to be the case of HVS # 3 [ see this article ] that came from the Large Magellanic Cloud .
They could be the result of a binary star system passing too close to the gravitational well of the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy .
One of the stars of the system gets caught by the huge gravity well and the other one is thrown free at very high speed achieving escape velocity .
We know of sixteen confirmed hyper-velocity stars , and the thinking is that there are about 1000 associated with the galaxy .
The Hyper - Velocity Star Project is searching for more .
Into the Deepest Night
What captured Ray Villard ’s attention was the idea that a Sun - like star in a binary system might be ejected , carrying its planetary system along with it .
What would the civilization that arose on the surface of such a planet think about the night sky ?
As Ray notes , their sky would be largely black , for the receding planetary system would be near few stars as it moved beyond the halo .
Ray talks about the center of the Milky Way looking like a ‘ fuzzy headlamp , ’ with the spiral arms , though covering a large part of sky , emerging ghostly and faint from the nucleus .
Alien sky lore would have no constellations in the absence of stars .
All mythology would be built around the nighttime wispy pinwheel with its cycloptic “ glowing eye . ”
Alien sky watchers would duly note the appearance of brilliant star - like novae and supernovae in the spiral disk .
These might as first be construed as omens or messages from the gods , or fuel other superstitions .
But fireworks in the galactic disk would be dutifully recorded .
As to technology , we can only speculate , but imagine what happens after this civilization develops telescopes and spectroscopy :
The development of telescopic astronomy would allow star clusters and nebulae to be resolved .
It would be as big a revelation as when Galileo first observed the Milky Way in 1609 .
Bright blue stars would be seen sprinkled across in the Milky Way ’s spiral arms .
Spectroscopy would show that the pinpoints are made of the same stuff the alien ’s parent star is .
But it would take a great leap of imagination to connect the tiny pinpoints to the brilliant glowing orb of their star .
Emerging Science in the Void
Over the eons , our runaway civilization , bound ever outward , might notice that the galaxy that filled its skies was dimming , but would it ever be able to relate its single star to the billions on display through its newly developed instruments ?
Ray imagines such a society remaining pre-Copernican , but I ’m not so sure .
In any case , scientists that did figure out their place in the cosmos might wonder what living beings inside a galaxy would imagine , and how they would ever sort out the shape of the star swarm within which they found themselves .
Science finds its ways and I suspect our lonely intergalactic friends would eventually relate distant galaxies to the one nearest them , always wondering how they happened to be cast adrift and learning to question whether the great sky pinwheel was once home to their star .
But ponder the idea of interstellar flight in this setting .
Would it even be imagined ?
If the distance to Alpha Centauri seems almost inconceivably far to us , how much more so would the outcasts find the hundreds of thousands of light years back to the stellar city ?
It is said that the basic two responses before danger are to run away , or to attack .
However , this list proves that , when it comes to escaping death by predators , some mammals prefer to be a little bit more original .
If you guys like this list , there may be a sequel on non-mammals !
10 Opossum
Everyone knows that “ playing possum ” means playing dead .
The American opossum ( Didelphis virginianus ) , found from Canada to Costa Rica , usually reacts to danger as many other mammals do ; by hissing , growling and baring its teeth .
It can also bite viciously if pushed too far .
However , if this all fails and the situation becomes too dangerous , plan B is to feign death ; the opossum collapses to the ground , drools as if it was very ill , and then remains motionless , with its mouth open and its teeth bared .
It even produces a putrid , corpse - like smell from its anal glands – move over beaver ass juice .
Many predators prefer to kill their own prey and most will soon lose interest on an apparently dead animal , leaving the opossum alone .
The most amazing thing about the opossum ’s defensive method , is that it is not a conscious act ; it is rather a physiological response to a highly stressful situation , and the animal does fall into a comatose state that can last for hours ; usually , the opossum regains consciousness only after the enemy has left .
Exactly how it ’s body knows this , is still a mystery .
9 Potto
Found in the jungles of Africa , Pottos may look like some kind of small , arboreal bear relative , but they are actually primates .
They are nocturnal and feed on tree sap , fruit and small animals .
Due to their slow movements , pottos are vulnerable to a number of predators , and have a very unusual defensive method ; they have enlarged neural spines on its vertebrae , which protrude from the neck and shoulders .
These spines have pointy tips and seem to be used as some kind of unlikely weapon , with the primate “ neck - butting ” its enemies and perhaps , just making itself hard to swallow .
The spines may also function as some kind of shield , protecting the potto’s neck from the killing bite delivered by some predators , often aimed at the neck or back of the head .
8 Pangolin
Pangolins are very weird mammals , whose bodies are almost completely covered on large scales , giving them an appearance somewhat reminiscent of a giant , living pine cone .
They feed mostly on insects and are found in Africa and Asia .
Although they have large , powerful claws on their forelimbs , they rarely use them as weapons ; instead , when threatened , they coil into a ball so tight that ’s almost impossible to unroll .
The sharp edges of the scales make them practically invulnerable to most predators ; they can also lash out with their powerful , heavy tail , causing serious injury with the sharp scales .
And that ’s not all ; a Sumatran pangolin was seen curling into a ball and then actually rolling down a slope at high speed to escape unwanted attention !
The pangolin ’s last defensive resource is to spray a foul smelling , gooey substance from its anus .
Needless to say , this animal does n’t have many enemies to worry about .
7 Three banded armadillo
Although we tend to think of armadillos as heavily armored creatures , protected by an almost turtle - like shell , in most species the shell offers no real protection against large predators , and the armadillos will rather bury themselves into the ground to escape danger .
The South American Three Banded Armadillo is the only one that can roll into a perfect ball ; this is accomplished thanks to its loosely jointed armor which allows for a greater range of movement , and to its armored head and tail which interlock when the animal rolls into a ball , thus making it completely invulnerable to most enemies .
This animal has also been known to shut closed at the last moment , making a snapping sound to startle its enemies as a clever additional defensive trick .
Since it ’s so well protected , the Three Banded Armadillo does n’t need to be a good digger and will use the burrows of other animals instead of digging its own .
6 Crested Porcupine
Found in Africa and southern Europe ( mainly in Italy ) , the Crested Porcupine is among the largest rodents in the world , and also among the best protected mammals .
Its quills , which have black and white banding so that predators can spot them from the distance , are actually modified hairs , covered with layers of hard keratin .
These quills are longer in the front part of the body , forming an erectile crest that gives the animal its name .
However , the most dangerous quills are the short ones in the back of the body .
When threatened by a predator , the porcupine usually shakes its tail quills , which are hollow and sound like a rattle ; if this does n’t scare the enemy away , the porcupine charges backwards , trying to stab the predator with its back quills .
These quills break off easily and once they enter the predator ’s body , tiny barbs in the tip actually pull them deeper into the wound ; many unexperienced predators die as the result of porcupine quill injuries , either due to infection , or because the quills work so deep into the flesh that they damage blood vessels or even internal organs !
There are porcupines in North America too , but these are usually smaller than their African relatives and spend much of their time in trees ; interestingly , they have very powerful natural antibiotics in their blood .
This is because they sometimes fall from the trees while foraging , and become stabbed by their own quills .
If it was n’t for the antibiotics , many porcupines would die of infection after a fall .
5 Pygmy sperm whale
Unlike its better known relative , the gigantic Sperm Whale , which can grow up to 20 meters ( 65 ′ 6 ″ ) long , the rarely seen Pygmy Sperm Whale is only 1.2 meters ( 3 ′ 9 ″ ) long .
This makes it vulnerable to predators such as large sharks and orcas .
To protect itself , the Pygmy Sperm Whale employs a very unusual method ; it expels a jet of reddish , syrup - like substance through the anus , and then uses its tail to stir it up , forming a large , dark cloud in the water .
This momentarily conceals the whale from the predator ’s sight and allows it to quickly swim to safety .
There is a closely related species of cetacean , the Dwarf Sperm Whale , which is known to use the same technique to escape predators ; however , this is a very unusual defense for a mammal .
In fact , the most similar defensive mechanism is found in cephalopods ( squid and octopus ) which are ironically the Pygmy Sperm Whale ’s favorite meal !
4 Dormouse
These small edible rodents are found in Europe , with some species scattered across Africa and Asia .
They usually escape predators by fleeing , but they have an interesting defensive trick they use as a last resource .
The skin in the dormouse ’s tail is very loose , and if a predator grabs the rodent by the tail , the skin comes off allowing the dormouse to escape .
This is a form of autotomy , that is , losing a body part as a defensive mechanism .
Autotomy is common among reptiles ( lizards losing their tails is the best known example ) , and invertebrates , but is very rare in mammals .
However , the dormouse can do this only once ; after shedding the skin of its tail and escaping , the exposed tail bones usually fall off , or are gnawed off by the dormouse itself , since the skin does not grow back and the tail cannot be regenerated as in lizards .
Some species of dormice have tufted tails which act as a decoy , driving the predator ’s attention away from the dormouse ’s head .
3 Skunk
Everyone knows skunks and their defensive method , but they deserved a place in this list anyway because their chemical weaponry is incredibly powerful .
The skunk ’s defensive fluid is produced by a pair of glands in the anal region ; although many other small carnivores have these glands ( particularly those in the Mustelidae , or weasel family ) , the skunk ’s glands are more developed and they have powerful muscles allowing them to spray the fluid as far as 3 meters ( 9 ′ 8 ″ ) !
They also have incredible aim ( most impressive if we consider that they attack with their rear end facing the enemy ) and usually spray directly at the predator ’s face ; if an animal ( humans included ) is hit in the eyes by the skunk ’s liquid , it can go blind , so it is always better to leave these animals alone .
Due to this and to the fluid ’s offensive smell , skunks have few enemies , the most important being the Great Horned Owl , which practically lacks a sense of smell and can attack silently from above , therefore avoiding the nasty spray .
However , as usual in this list , the skunk ’s chemical attack is used only as a last resource , since its fluid supply is limited and it takes up to ten days for the glands to fully “ recharge ” .
2 Platypus
The bizarre platypus , once thought to be a hoax and now famous as one of the few mammals that lays eggs , is also unusual when it comes to defensive methods .
The male platypus has a sharp , retractable spur in each hind limb , connected to a venom gland .
When grabbed by a predator ( or by a curious or ill - informed human ) , the platypus kicks with these spurs injecting the venom , which is usually enough for the enemy to let it go .
Although the venom can kill animals up to dog-size , it is not lethal to humans .
However , people who have been “ stung ” by these animals claim that it is among the most excruciatingly painful things that can be experienced , and the effects of the envenomation can last for days and temporarily impair the victim .
Some claim that the pain is strong enough to cause the victim to faint .
Interestingly , only the male platypus has a functional venom spur ; the female poses no threat to other animals ( except for the small invertebrates that make up its food , of course ) .
This suggests that the venom spur is primarily an intraspecific weapon , used by male platypus against each other during mating season duels .
1 Slow loris
This small , nocturnal primate is found in the rainforests of South Eastern Asia .
It measures around 35 cms ( 13 ″ ) long and feeds on whatever small animal it can capture ( sometimes it feasts on tree sap as well ) .
Being small and slow would make it vulnerable to many predators , if it was n’t for its extremely unusual defensive mechanism .
The Slow Loris has poison glands on its elbows ( that ’s right , we ’re talking about a poisonous primate ) .
But that ’s not all .
The Slow Loris makes itself an unappetizing entry by licking the poison and spreading it all over its fur .
Female Lorises also lick their poison onto their babies before leaving them to hunt .
And the best part ; since it licks and sucks the poison into its mouth , it ends up having a venomous bite as well , and if pushed too far , it bites the venom into its enemy causing intense pain and swelling .
Some people have died as the result of anaphylactic shock after being bitten by Slow Lorises , even though the venom itself is usully not lethal to human - sized animals .
Being a poisonous primate that gives itself a venomous bite is weird enough to grant the Slow Loris its # 1 status in this list .
But in case you missed it , the coolest thing about this guy is that it can actually lick its elbows !
i myself installed RemoveWAT so i can't run most of your commands ( i can't find the registry entries , nor the wat folder in system 32 ) .
i neither have seen KB971033 in my updates ( option to install nor already installed ) .
however after the latest microsoft security essentials client update of march 10 , it appears to have made my windows not genuine .
i wonder if it 's something unrelated to KB971033 ?

Amid the strangest atmosphere Anfield has known for many years , Chelsea took a tentative step into the future today .
As the match ended with the London club on the brink of a third title in the Abramovich era , finally it became possible for the club to look beyond the achievements and aura of José Mourinho .
Most of the players in the line - up were part of Mourinho 's side , and some of them go back as far as Claudio Ranieri 's tenure , but what happens next at Stamford Bridge appears likely to become firmly identified with Carlo Ancelotti .
During the summer , certain changes and additions to the squad may cement that association .
Joe Cole , unable to agree a new deal , looks likely to depart , along with Juliano Belletti and possibly Deco .
Gossip suggests that if Mourinho takes over at Real Madrid in the summer , he will come calling for Frank Lampard and perhaps Ricardo Carvalho .
But the presence of Frank Arnesen , the club's somewhat shadowy director of football , in the directors ' box provided a reminder that finally Chelsea are ready to see some tangible reward from their expensive academy programme .
At the bottom of their lengthy first ‑team squad list are the unfamiliar names of 10 young players , including the Italian forward Fabio Borini , the Dutch defender Jeffrey Bruma , the French midfielder Gael Kakuta and the extremely gifted 17 - year - old Joshua McEachran , an English playmaker , who are considered ready for gradual assimiliation into the senior line - up .
Their presence will reduce the average age of a group currently heavily weighted towards players in their late 20s and early 30s – although the club 's medical and physiotherapy team have successfully prolonged the youth of so many of them .
If Ancelotti is clever , he will not find himself having to explain to his employer that next season is a necessary period of transition .
From what we have seen , Abramovich is not much interested in such a phenomenon .
He wants results .
He is likely to fund at least one major purchase in the close season , possibly Sergio Agüero , Atlético Madrid 's Argentinian striker , but he would like the team to reflect his investment in Arnesen 's project .
This will be a new challenge for Ancelotti , whose successful seven - year spell with Milan was marked by a strong preference for extending the careers of older players ( such as Filippo Inzaghi and David Beckham ) rather than introducing promising youngsters .
It was the old faithfuls who were entrusted with an important job yesterday , although you would never have known that the match taking place on the sacred turf of Anfield was a potential title - decider .
How could it have been otherwise , given the ambivalent attitude of Liverpool 's fans to the notion that a victory for their side would improve the prospects of a 19th title for Manchester United ?
In a national newspaper yesterday morning one of their number wrote that anyone who wanted Liverpool to win today had no right to call himself a fan of the club .
What strange times these are .
Would the blessed Shankly have been willing to forfeit a home success in order to prevent the deadly rivals from overtaking his club 's total of championships ?
The heart says that he would have gone for the victory , regardless of the cost ; the head , however , has the odd doubt .
For the first half - hour the mood inside Anfield , on the pitch and in the grandstands , was that of a pre‑season friendly .
The match was riddled with careless errors from players normally noted for their efficiency , in front of a near - silent crowd .
Nor were the mistakes all coming from Liverpool players .
Michael Ballack , playing in the holding midfield position , took 20 minutes to get his eye in and spent that time playing the sort of inaccurate short passes that would have given Claude Makelele nightmares .
The crowd was so quiet that even the biggest Liverpool mistake provoked nothing more than a sigh .
It came , of course , from Steven Gerrard , that living embodiment of Liverpool 's values and Shankly 's legacy .
Didier Drogba took full advantage , and Gerrard 's blushes were only slightly spared when Lampard doubled Chelsea 's lead early in the second half , this time with no obvious assistance from the home side .
And so Chelsea completed their record of success this season over their fellow members of the quartet that can no longer be called the big four : victories by 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 over Manchester United , by 3 - 0 and 2 - 0 over Arsenal , and by 2 - 0 twice over Liverpool .
Twelve goals scored , one conceded : a remarkable achievement in this informal mini-league , although its membership will be modified next season through the relegation of a club who , as today 's performance indicated , have badly lost their way .
For Chelsea , by contrast , the way ahead looks like a sunlit boulevard .
Whether or not you ’re a fan of T - Mobile ’s secret “ projects ” ( with the most recent being the long - speculated Project Dark that brought some interesting plan options to the carrier ) they probably interest you just as much as the biggest magenta fanboys themselves .
A new project name is being thrown around – Project Emerald – and this time it looks like it focuses on a specific device .
A source of TmoNews ’ states that the project will bring T - Mobile a “ new Nexus One - like device ” that ’s going to be sold and marketed by the carrier both online and in stores .
There is one phone that immediately comes to mind that fits the bill of a Nexus - like device : the Samsung Galaxy S. It ’s been rumored for a while to come to T - Mobile , now , and this could be a small grain of hope that the rumors turn out to be true .
Of course , more Nexus - like would be an HTC Desire which a couple of smaller regional carriers in America are already getting .
Or it could be something totally different .
No one knows , but we ’re going to keep our eyes glued to the scene , in the mean time , as we hope to lay any information we can find out onto the table ( hopefully this month as a TmoNews commenter reminds us that Emerald is one of the birth stones for May ) .
A $ 149 e-reader device was announced Wednesday by Kobo of Toronto during the CTIA show , although the company 's chief executive said he recognizes how crowded the e-reader device market has already become .
" When I came to CES in 2009 , there were two e-reader companies , and when I returned to CES earlier this year , the number of e-reader companies had grown to 160 , " said Michael Serbinis , CEO of Kobo , in an interview .
Kobo is an anagram of " book , " he explained .
Clearly , not all of those e-readers will pass muster .
Already , some makers of e-readers that use black - and - white e-ink are talking about adding color to their displays to keep up with color tablet computers that will support e-books , including the iPad .
At $ 149 , the Kobo e-reader is one of the cheaper reader devices to come to market .
Serbinis said part of the reason Kobo will be able to compete in a crowded market is because of its low price and because the e-book market will grow faster than some forecasters have predicted .
Amazon 's Kindle 2 , for example , sells for $ 259 , which is $ 110 more than the Kobo .
While many forecasts show that e-books will take up only 3 % of the total market for books in five years , Serbinis said he has talked to several major book publishers who think that number will be closer to 25 % in five years .
" The demand for e-books has recently accelerated tremendously , " he said .
Another reason Kobo expects to do well is because it just announced a standard e-reading application called " Powered by Kobo " that will be used in an array of e-readers to be launched this year .
Kobo already has provided e-reading applications for the iPhone , BlackBerry , Palm Pre and Android smartphones and will have one for the upcoming iPad .
" Consumers want choice and the freedom to read on any device , " Serbinis said .
The Kobo eReader will sell for $ 149 through Borders bookstores in the U.S. this summer and will come preloaded with 100 classic books .
Barnes & Noble , a larger competitor to Borders , began offering its
Nook device late in the fall and is planning to offer an application to support the iPad , as will Amazon.com 's Kindle e-reader .
Unlike some e-readers that connect to a wide - area wireless network to download books , the Kobo device can connect to select smartphones through Bluetooth or will update via a USB cord connected to a desktop or laptop computer .
While its size is similar that of some other e-readers , it has an unusual D - pad navigation button for moving a cursor and making selections , similar to D - pads used on some cell phones .
In addition , side buttons are provided for home , menu , back and display .
It weighs 200 grams and is 184 by 120 by 10 mm in size ( 7.2 by 4.7 by .4 in . ) .
It also has 1GB of memory that can hold about 1,000 books .

George W. Bush , whose US presidency was marked by the September 11 attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , will release a memoir on November 9 , his publisher said on Monday .
The book , " Decision Points , " will centre on 14 decisions Mr Bush made in his eight years as president , including " his flaws and mistakes , as well as his historic achievements , " The Crown Publishing Group said in a statement .
Mr Bush will do a national tour to promote the book , which will sell for $ US35 ( $ 37.70 ) , said Crown .
The former Texas governor left the White House in January 2009 with one of the lowest presidential approval ratings in history , with the unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the financial crisis weighing on his legacy .
" President Bush brings readers inside the Texas Governor 's Mansion on the night of the hotly contested 2000 election ; aboard Air Force One on 9/11 in the gripping hours after America 's most devastating attack since Pearl Harbor ; inside the Situation Room in the moments before launching the war in Iraq , " said the publisher .
Mr Bush also writes about " his historic and controversial decisions on the financial crisis , Hurricane Katrina , Afghanistan , Iran , and other issues that have shaped the first decade of the 21st century . "
The book will also discuss Mr Bush 's decision to quit drinking , his discovery of faith and family relationships .

In answer to a question from an audience member at a " tea party " rally in Ramona , Calif. , Saturday , Republican U.S. Rep.
Duncan Hunter said he would support deporting the children of illegal immigrants , the Los Angeles Times reports .
Here is a link to the video on You Tube .
An audience member asked Hunter , " Would you support deportation of natural - born American citizens that are the children of illegal aliens ? "
Hunter responded , " I would have to , yes . "
The congressman continued , " It 's a complex issue and ... you could look and say , ' You 're a mean guy .
That 's a mean thing to do .
That 's not a humanitarian thing to do . ' "
Hunter added , " We simply cannot afford what we 're doing right now .
We just can't afford it .
California 's going under . "
The congressman confirmed the comments to the North County Times and told the newspaper that he also supports House Resolution 1868 , introduced last year but stalled in a House committee .
The measure calls for the elimination of automatic citizenship of children born in the United States to illegal immigrants .
At the Saturday gathering , Hunter said , " It takes more than just walking across the border to become an American citizen - it's what 's in our souls . "

It was silent but deadly .
A British sniper set a world sharpshooting record by taking out two Taliban soldiers in Afghanistan from more than a mile and a half away — a distance so great , experts say the terrorists would n’t have even heard the shots .
Craig Harrison killed the two insurgents from an astounding distance of 8,120 feet — or 1.54 miles — in Helmand Province last November firing an Accuracy International L11583 long - range rifle .
“ The first round hit a machine - gunner in the stomach and killed him outright , ” said Harrison , a corporal of horse in the British Army ’s Household Cavalry , the equivalent of a sergeant in the American military .
“ The second insurgent grabbed the weapon and turned as my second shot hit him in the side .
He went down , too , ” Harrison told the Sunday Times of London .
The shots — measured via GPS — surpassed the previous record held by Canadian Army Cpl. Rob Furlong , who killed an al Qaeda gunman from 7,972 feet in 2002 .
Harrison ’s shots were roughly equal to the distance between the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park .
Experts called Harrison ’s sharp shooting as perfect as it gets .
“ When you are shooting that far , if you miss by a hair , you miss by a mile , ” said John Plaster , a retired US Army sharp - shooting instructor and author of “ The Ultimate Sniper . ”
“ That is about as precise as any marksmen on the planet could shoot . ”
He said Harrison ’s targets likely never knew what was coming .
“ At a distance like that they cannot even see anyone and they would not even hear the muzzle report , ” Plaster said .
Harrison , who fired the bullets while his colleagues were under fire , said perfect weather helped him nail the perfect shot .
“ [ There was ] no wind , mild weather , clear visibility , ” he said .
Harrison learned of his record nine days ago , when he returned to England .
In the weeks after his record shot , he suffered a minor gunshot wound and broke his arms when his vehicle hit a roadside bomb .

“ He owned some drugstores , a lot of drugstores , ” Daisy Buchanan said .
“ He built them up himself . ”
To Daisy , this was a perfectly reasonable explanation of the wealth of her new neighbor , Jay Gatsby .
To her husband , more knowing about the world beyond the boundaries of East Egg , it was evidence that Gatsby had made his money as a bootlegger .
Modern readers in the grip of F. Scott Fitzgerald ’s prose may not recognize the meaning of Tom Buchanan ’s insight , but Fitzgerald knew his contemporaries would understand .
In 1925 , when “ The Great Gatsby ” was published , the meaning of “ drugstores ” was as clear as gin :
Those were the places you went to get medically prescribed alcohol , a legally acceptable source of liquor during all 13 years of Prohibition .
Sound familiar ?
To any modern Californian , of course it does .
For most of the 1920s , a patient could get a prescription for one pint every 10 days about as easily as California patients can now get “ recommendations ” for medical marijuana .
All it took to acquire a liquor prescription was cash — generally about $ 3 , the equivalent of about $ 40 today — placed in the hand of an agreeable doctor .
It cost $ 3 to $ 4 more to have it filled by the local pharmacist .
Dentists were similarly licensed , as were veterinarians who believed their patients too could use a belt of Four Roses bourbon .

Then as now , the adaptability of the medical profession was impressive .
In 1917 , as the 18th Amendment establishing Prohibition was working its way through the ratification process , the American Medical Assn. ousted alcohol from its approved pharmacopoeia , adopting a unanimous resolution asserting that its “ use in therapeutics … has no scientific value . ”
But the Volstead Act , which spelled out the enforcement and regulation of Prohibition , nonetheless made an exception for medicinal use , and in 1922 , just two years into the dry era , the AMA demonstrated how open minds can be changed — or , perhaps , how capitalism abhors a missed opportunity .
The results of a national survey of its members — a “ Referendum on the Use of Alcohol in the Medical Profession ” — revealed an extraordinary coincidence :
The booming prescription trade had been accompanied by the dawning realization among America ’s doctors that alcoholic beverages were in fact useful in treating 27 separate conditions , including diabetes , cancer , asthma , dyspepsia , snake bite , lactation problems and old age .
In a word , the assertion that medicinal alcohol had “ no scientific value , ” from the AMA ’s 1917 resolution , no longer had any scientific value .
One especially agreeable Detroit physician provided these instructions on his prescriptions : “ Take three ounces every hour for stimulant until stimulated . ”
Pharmacists who wanted a piece of this highly profitable new business devised practices appropriate to their clientele .
Those with high - end customers , mindful of the power ( and profit ) in brand names , dispensed the prescribed “ medicine ” in the distillers ’ own bottles , which looked exactly as they had before 1920 except for the addition of a sober qualifying phrase on their newly printed labels : A 100 - proof pint of Old Grand - Dad , for instance , still announced that it was “ Bottled in Bond , ” but just beneath that familiar legend appeared the improbable phrase , “ Unexcelled for Medicinal Purposes . ”
At the bottom end of the retail ladder were operations like Markin ’s , a drugstore on the north side of Chicago .
After police officers apprehended a drunk emerging from the store with bottle in hand , an assistant city attorney informed Mayor William E. Dever in 1923 , “ The officers testified that [ the liquor ] burned their tongues and that when they touched their matches to it , immediately there was a flame . ”
Some establishments that assumed the name “ drugstore ” never bothered with drugs and by no stretch of the imagination could be considered stores .
At the corner of Sixth Avenue and West Fourth Street in Manhattan , the Golden Swan had been operating as a saloon for years and , as its unofficial name — the Hell Hole — indicated , none too glamorously .
The site of some of Eugene O’Neill ’s most prodigious drinking bouts , the Hell Hole was one of the models for Harry Hope ’s hopeless bar in “ The Iceman Cometh ” ( “ It ’s the No Chance Saloon … the End of the Line Cafe , ” one character says .
“ No one here has to worry about where they ’re going next , because there is no farther they can go . ” )
When Prohibition arrived , the Hell Hole ’s proprietor closed up briefly , then claimed upon reopening that the bar was now a drugstore .
Having bought off the local cops , he continued to operate just as he had before .

In Chicago , druggist Charles Walgreen saw his chain expand from 20 stores in 1920 to a staggering 525 a decade later .
Along the way , Walgreen ’s introduced the milkshake , which family historians have credited with the chain ’s rocketing expansion .
But it ’s doubtful that milkshakes alone were responsible .
Something Charles Walgreen Jr. told an interviewer many years later suggests another possibility .
The elder Walgreen worried about fire breaking out in his stores , his son recalled , but this apprehension extended beyond an understandable concern for the safety of his employees :
He “ wanted the fire department to get in as fast as possible and get out as fast as possible , ” Charles Jr. remembered , “ because whenever they came in , we ’d always lose a case of liquor from the back . ”
All that “ medicinal ” whiskey ( and rum and gin and brandy and every other imaginable liquid intoxicant ) was perfectly legal .
But it also made a mockery of the law , debased the dignity of the medical profession and encouraged rampant criminality , as mobsters eventually and inevitably took over much of the medicinal market .
What finally straightened out the liquor business was the legalization that came with repeal in 1933 — legalization that was accompanied by a coherent and effective set of enforcement laws , a healthy boost in tax revenues ( in the first post - repeal year , the federal government was enriched by the 2010 equivalent of $ 4 billion in alcohol tax revenue ) , and an honest recognition that , all too often , “ medicinal ” had been a cynical euphemism for “ available . ”

Australian Gold Coins Showcase Australian Culture , Heritage And Wild Life
As an abundant producer and exporter of gold , Australia is an ideal location for the production of Australian gold coins .
The most prolific producers of gold Australian coins have been the different Australian mints .
Originally sanctioned by the British Royal Mint to produce gold sovereigns , Australian mints were strategically chosen to produce gold sovereigns for the British colonies .
These mints were established throughout various Australian states .
In Western Australia , the Perth Mint was the commissioned branch .
Since the Perth Mints inception its activities have evolved beyond sovereign production to include a range of coin and bullion based programs .
Gold from mines such as the Olympic Dam mine find its way to the refinery where it is transformed into investment and proof grade Australian coins and bars .
Today , it is a prolific producer of Australian gold coins and coin programs that showcase Australian culture and heritage .
The ‘ land down under ’ is a vast continent with an abundant supply of natural minerals .
It also has a rich heritage , famous for its aboriginal root origin .
According to Wikipedia , the Australian aborigines have been specifically identified as a group of people who share common ancestry back to the original occupants of the continent .
The aborigines had a strong spiritual connection to nature and the environment .
Australian native animals feature heavily in Aboriginal history and folklore .
Australian gold coins include a range of coins that are inspired by aboriginal artwork ; feature an abstract indigenous interpretation and can also incorporate minerals such as diamonds , opals and gold granules as part of the design .
What sets Australian gold coins apart are the different animals that comprise the coins designs .
As a popular tourist destination , people from the world over travel to Australia to see these unique native animals .
Creatures such as the platypus , crocodile , wombat , frilled neck lizard and koala feature heavily in Australian gold coin designs .
The Platypus
This semi aquatic animal inhabits small streams and rivers throughout eastern Australia .
It is one of five species that lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young .
It is a bizarre looking animal that has a duck bill , beaver tail and venomous spur on the hind foot .
It has been used as a mascot at national events and features on the reverse of the Australian 20 cent coin .
This animal is now a protected species due to the fact that it was originally hunted for its fur .
The Australian gold coin such as the Discover Australia series incorporate an abstract interpretation of this creature .
The Crocodile
These predators are aquatic reptiles that feed on fish , reptiles and mammals and reside in the tropics of Australia in rivers , lakes and wetlands .
They are believed to be over 200 years old , having survived great extinction events .
They have a prehistoric look , a streamlined body and web feet which help to propel them through the water .
This animal has also proven to be a popular choice for contemporary Australia gold coin designs .
The Wombat
This Australian marsupial is a short legged stumpy animal that looks like a small bear .
They have a short tail and are found in the mountains , forests and heathland areas of south eastern Australia and Tasmania .
The wombat digs extensive burrow systems with its powerful claws and its diet consists of bark , roots , herbs and grasses .
The origin of the word wombat is from the Eora Aboriginal community .
This animal is a popular choice for gold coins from Australia that incorporate native Australian animals .
The Frilled Neck Lizard
Deriving its name from the frill around its neck the frill neck lizard is found in parts of northern Australia in the tropical savannah woodlands .
This animal spends most of its time in the trees and its diet consists mainly of insects and small vertebrates .
They employ an ambush style of attack to their prey .
Prior to the Australian 2 cent coin being discontinued in 1991 , this animal featured on the reverse of the coin .
This animal now features on Australian gold coins such as those produced by prominent Australian mints .
The Koala
Found in the coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia in the woodlands this marsupial is native to Australia .
The koala ’s appearance is that of a small bear similar in appearance to the wombat but with a thicker coat , longer ears and longer limbs .
It also has sharp claws to assist with climbing trees .
Its diet consists primarily of eucalypt leaves and due to the fact that it has a very low metabolic rate it rests motionless for 16 to 18 hours a day .
The koala is a popular animal that has been used extensively on Australian gold coin designs and as part of ongoing Australian gold coin programs .
Australian gold coins are popular coins among local and international coin enthusiasts .
Australian gold coins from mint programs are often subject to limited release making them valuable collectors items with the potential for appreciation .
Many of the coins are considered to be commemorative issues and come with numbered certificates of authenticity and recognized mint marks making them easy for coin dealers around the world to recognize .

Rep. Ron Paul , the Texas Republican who struggled to crack 10 % in presidential primary polls in 2008 , runs dead even with President Obama in a new Rasmussen survey out today .
The survey of 1,000 likely voters in a hypothetical Obama - Paul race gave the Democratic president 42 % and the veteran congressman 41 % .
Paul was particularly strong -- as you would expect -- among independents .
He out - polled Obama 47 % to 28 % among voters who are not affiliated with either major party .
Rasmussen says :
Paul , a anti-big government libertarian who engenders unusually strong feelings among his supporters , was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 .
But he continues to have a solid following , especially in the growing Tea Party movement .
This raises the obvious question : will the Pauls be the next political dynasty , like the Kennedys and Bushes ?
Paul 's son , Rand , is a strong contender in Kentucky 's open Senate race .
A Rasmussen survey earlier this month shows Rand Paul beating all potential Democratic rivals -- although first he needs to win the GOP primary .
Change is definitely in the air .

In between obsessing over hats , we 've been trying to keep up with all the neat things the community is doing .

PARIS —
The menacing cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland moved eastward across Northern Europe on Friday , expanding an already massive transportation gridlock and throwing weary travelers into an anxious limbo .
Scientists were uncertain when the cloud would dissipate , as its repercussions rippled far beyond the flight boards at shuttered airports in Europe .
Opera singers and musicians were stranded while trying to make their performances , and perishable foods were stuck in warehouses .
Thousands of people unable to travel by air jammed train stations or hired long - haul taxis in a desperate search for alternative ways to reach their destinations .
Recreational runners in Europe grew worried they would not be able to reach Boston early Monday in time for the start of the Boston Marathon .
From business meetings to long - planned high school trips to world diplomacy , the ash cloud affected many facets of life .
The state funeral of the Polish president , Lech Kaczynski , and his wife was likely to take place as scheduled on Sunday , according to Polish authorities , but it was unclear which international dignitaries would be able to get there .
Traffic fumes risk to IVF couples as living by road could cut chances of conceiving by 25 %
Living near a busy road cuts the chances of fertility treatment being successful by almost a quarter , researchers have warned .
A study of thousands of IVF patients found those who regularly breathed in traffic fumes were up to 24 per cent less likely to conceive than those who lived in less polluted areas .
Nitrogen dioxide - a toxin pumped out by car and lorry exhaust pipes , power stations and gas cookers - has as big an impact on a woman 's chances of having a baby as ageing , the experts said .
Living by a busy road could reduce the chances of fertility treatment being successful by almost a quarter , new research has shown
Although air pollution has previously been linked to premature delivery , low birthweight and birth defects , the latest study is the first to show it could affect a woman 's chances of conceiving in the first place .
The researchers compared the success rates of almost 7,500 IVF patients with the levels of pollution near their homes and the clinics where they were being treated .
Levels of IVF success were higher than the average reading of 0.019 parts per million ( ppm ) near a woman 's home or her IVF clinic
And they found consistent evidence to show higher levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air was linked to lower odds of IVF success .
When levels were higher than the average reading of 0.019 parts per million ( ppm ) near a woman 's home or her IVF clinic , the chances of having a baby dipped .
Every 0.01 ppm rise cut the odds by between 13 and 24 per cent , according to the study results , published in the journal Human Reproduction .
Some 37,000 women undergo IVF in the UK each year , leading to 13,700 babies .
The University of Pennsylvania researchers said it appeared that air pollution , like smoking , could damage a woman 's chances of becoming a mother .
Scientists have yet to discover exactly how nitrogen dioxide causes harm , but it may be that fumes damage the eggs themselves or cut blood flow to the womb and placenta .
Study author Dr Richard Legro said he had found ' significant links between air pollution and inflammation and increased blood clotting .
These factors are also associated with reproductive health ' .
But he urged women who are about to start IVF treatment not to panic .
' We still need to do further studies and confirm these findings .
It 's too soon to say what the ultimate effects ( of air pollution ) on reproduction are , ' he said .
Dr Legro said test - tube babies would be especially vulnerable to any damage and natural conceptions would not necessarily be affected in the same way .
But , he added , as IVF treatment becomes more common , the impact of pollution will become greater .
Canonical is burying Ubuntu 's traditional brown theme and is adopting a new visual style for version 10.04 , which is scheduled for release in April .
The new theme was revealed last week as part of Canonical 's broader effort to overhaul Ubuntu 's branding and visual identity .
The new theme includes a richer color palette and a number of stylistic enhancements .
The change that has generated the most controversy is the placement of the window management buttons in the left - hand side of the titlebar .
In response to some of the concerns that have been raised by users , Canonical designer Ivanka Majic has written a blog entry that describes the reasons behind the change .
Majic is also seeking additional feedback from the Ubuntu community .
The designers looked closely at the placement and configuration of the window management buttons on other platforms and considered a number of factors , such as the use cases for maximization , the potential advantages of moving the window management buttons into closer proximity with the menu elements , and the challenges of diverging from the configuration that is currently familiar to users .
When I first started testing the theme , I did n't really have an opinion because I generally do n't use the titlebar for window management .
I have keyboard shortcuts configured for all the standard window management operations .
To move the window , I typically use alt + click dragging , because it lets me click anywhere inside of the window .
That 's more efficient than having to aim for the titlebar , which is a much smaller target .
For similar reasons , I configured Compiz to let me close a window by using alt + right - click anywhere inside the window 's boundaries .
( When I use other operating systems that do n't have alt + click dragging , I 'm always amazed by how profoundly the absence of that feature detrimentally impacts my productivity . )
Although I rarely ever touch the titlebar , the new layout consistently confuses me on the rare occasions when I attempt to do so .
The resulting disorientation has started to bother me and I 'm beginning to sympathize a bit with the critics .
It 's possible , however , that users who rely more heavily on the titlebar for window management will adapt more quickly .
Our readers have already broadly discussed their preferred titlebar button positioning in the threads of our previous articles about the new theme .
Unfortunately , I think that the hyper - focus on the minutiae of widget placement has detracted from the opportunity to take a look at the bigger picture .
I 've become really curious about what strategies other users have devised to manage windows .
Are there ways that window manager can be modified to accommodate more productive interaction ?
Do you use features like minimize and maximize ?
If you favor alternate window management paradigms like tiling , what do you view as its principal advantages ?
Do conventional window management concepts translate well to emerging form factors like touchscreen devices and netbooks ?

Chief Government troubleshooter , Dame Margaret Bazley right , and outgoing ECan chairman , Alec Neil speak to the media outside the council offices today .
Environment Canterbury 's councillors have been sacked by the Government and there will be no fresh elections until as late as 2013 .
Government troubleshooter Dame Margaret Bazley has been appointed chairwoman of the commissioners , and the search is on for the remaining six commission members .
ECan staff are being briefed on the sacking of the 14 elected councillors now , at the same time as Environment Minister Nick Smith and Local Government Minister Rodney Hide officially released their announcement .
Sacked deputy ECan chairwoman Jo Kane talks to media a short time ago .
The Environment Canterbury Temporary Commissioners and Improved Water Management Bill will be introduced and passed under urgency in Parliament this week .
The bill makes temporary amendments to the Local Government and Resource Management Acts to empower the commission , with those powers expiring in October 2013 .
The outgoing councillors met at their Kilmore Street offices at 10.30 am today for a telephone conference with Smith and Hide .
Deputy ECan chairwoman Jo Kane said she was " contemptuous ' ' of the Government 's move and the way it had turned its back on the people of Canterbury .
The decision comes after a report former National deputy prime minister Wyatt Creech 's investigated failings at ECan .
The report recommended sacking the elected councillors and replacing them with appointed commissioners .
It also proposed a regional water authority .
It also proposed a regional water authority .
Prime Minister John Key had sounded a note of caution over dismissing the entire council , however , but said he wants swift action to rectify faults uncovered by the Creech report .
ELECTIONS POSTPONED
The Government says it will defer local government elections for the Canterbury Regional Council till as late as 2013 after sacking its councillors .
Environment Minister Nick Smith and Local Government Minister Rodney
Hide said commissioners would be given additional powers under proposed special legislation to address " urgent problems with water management in Canterbury " .
Hide said it was the government 's view that the problems identified by the review team were complex and could not be resolved through the normal electoral cycle .
" Commissioners will need a reasonable time frame to resolve these difficult issues .
For this reason the Government proposes to defer the local government elections this year for the Canterbury Regional Council .
" The proposed legislation provides for new elections when commissioners have completed their tax but no later than the 2013 local government elections . "
Smith said efficient water management was crucial to New Zeasland 's competitive advantage and " our clean green brand " .
" Canterbury is strategically important with it holding more than half of the country 's irrigation water and hydro storage .
Governmetn leadership is needed to address Canterbury 's lack of a proper allocation plan , increasing problems with water quality and the failure to progress opportunities for water storage . "
Lobby group Environmental Defence Society said today it was ``generally supportive '' of the action taken by the Government .
Chairman Gary Taylor said the special powers provided to commissioners needed to be temporary , however , and that the other commissioners would need to be carefully selected ``to ensure vested interests in water use do not dominate ' ' .
DIFFICULT DECISION
Hide said the decision to install commissioners was ``without doubt , far and away the toughest decision I 've made in my time as Minister of Local Government ' ' .
There was a very high threshold to appoint commissioners and it was ``a very difficult decision '' that the council needed to be replaced .
All ten of the councils within the ECan region agreed that commissioners were needed , Hide said .
Smith said temporary legislation will be tabled in parliament this afternoon to enforce the changes .
ECan councillors were expected to finish their work and be formally replaced by May 1 .
Smith said fresh water was to New Zealand what oil was to Saudi Arabia .
" It 's at the core of our competitive advantage and also our clean , green brand , '' Smith said .
" And with Canterbury having over half of the irrigated water in New Zealand and over half of the water that is stored for our renewable electricity , it is critical that we manage it in a far more competent way . ''
There were huge , long - standing problems with water management in the region with the resource being managed in an ``inconsistent and ad hoc way ' ' .
Have your say :
The 2012 Games provide a useful opportunity to get people thinking about how accessible / inaccessible London is going to be in time for the games .
So the release of TfL Data around the accessibility of stations is extremely timely .
Collected by London Underground and represented in 17 different spreadsheets ( currently being worked on for upload by Gareth Baker ) they should contain just about everything you need to know about the current state of play ( and no doubt if they do n’t we will have lots of people helping us to round out the picture )
Here is a list of the individual datasets with brief description of what they contain .
1. Station Access using alternative entrances
2. Detailed information on barriers
3. Detailed information on car parking accessibility
4. Detailed information on London Underground entrances
5. Detailed information on escalators in stations
6. Detailed information on helppoints
7. Detailed information on lifts
8. Comments on issues by station by object ( ramps , gates , display boards etc. )
9 . Information on multi-stair within stations
10 . Information on step free stations by step gap
11 . Detailed information on stairs
12 . Text information on all sub objects
13 . Questions asked of On Duty Supervisors re range of services and customer service approaches ( hearing impaired , wheelchair access , alternative journey planning information etc. )
14 . Detailed information on Ticket Machines
15 . Detailed information on toilets
16 . Detailed information on ticket offices
17 . Information on accessible platforms
We hope to have all of the datasets loaded under one category London Underground Stations Accessibility by the end of this week , so check back then and have a look around .
Emer Coleman
Our universe might have originated from a black hole that lies within another universe .
The idea centers on how matter and energy falling into a blackhole could in theory come out a " white hole " in another universe .
In such a situation , both the black hole and the white hole are mouths of anEinstein - Rosen bridge , popularly known as a wormhole .
With that in mind , theoretical physicist Nikodem Poplawski at Indiana University conjectured that when a black hole forms upon the collapse of a dying star , a universe is born at the same time from the white hole on the other side of the wormhole .
" Our universe could have itself formed from inside a black hole existing inside another universe , " he said .
This idea has been suggested before , and now Poplawski has expanded on the thinking .
Nested universes
Although a black hole forming from a star the size of our sun would only be about 2 miles wide , it does not mean that a universe which might originate from a black hole would stay that small .
" Our universe was small a long time ago and expanded , " Poplawski said . " From the other side , one would not see our expansion . "
Essentially , a black hole could seem bigger on the " inside " than how it looked to someone outside .
If anyone survived a trip into a black hole and emerged in another universe , " it would be a one - way trip , " Poplawski noted .
The event horizon of a black hole is ? boundary at which nothing inside can escape .
In theory , black holes do lose mass , however , as Hawking radiation — particles that emerge from the vacuum right next to their event horizons .
Black holes that lose more mass than they gain are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish .
This does not mean any universe at the other end of the black hole would cease to exist , Poplawski explained .
" We would just be disconnected from the other universe , " he said .
Evidence for a black hole birth ?
If our universe was born from a black hole in another universe , it would be impossible to cross its event boundary and see the other side , meaning one cannot prove or disprove this idea that way .
So how might one test this conjecture ?
One implication of Poplawski's concept is that our universe is " closed . "
" In cosmology , there are three models for our universe , " Poplawski explained .
" The first is that it 's closed , the second is that it's ' open , ' and the third is that it 's ' flat . ' "
If it is closed , and one tries to venture to the edge of our universe , one would eventually loop back to where one started .
" It would be like walking on the surface of the Earth — if you walk to the east , at some point you come back across the west , " Poplawski said .
If our universe is flat , and one tries to venture to its edge , one would never reach it , as it continued on infinitely .
The same would hold true if the universe is open , " only it would be ' curved , ' " Poplawski said .
This means that if two beams of light were shot into space parallel to each other , in a flat universe they would stay parallel , while in an open universe they would actually get farther from each other .
If our universe lies " within " another universe , " the prediction would be that our universe is closed , " Poplawski said .
" That could maybe tested at some point .
If the universe is closed , if one watches the stars , their light would be visible on the opposite side of the sky .
If the universe is really big , the light from those stars might not have had time to do that yet , but maybe at some point we could see this . "
Also , black holes rotate , evidence suggests , and if our universe 's parent black hole was spinning , " then one direction might be preferred in our universe , evidence we could see at large scales , " Poplawski said .
Solving mysteries ?
If our universe was born from a black hole , it could help solve the mystery of what came before the BigBang and whether our universe was closed , flat or open .
It could also help scientists avoid problems associated with singularities , or infinitely small points with infinite density .
In theory , the universe was born from a singularity , and every black hole encloses a singularity .
However , singularities are big headaches for theoretical physicists , since the laws of physics break down around them .
" In my model , when the universe is born , there is no problem of having a singularity initially — instead of being infinitely small , it had the radius of its parent black hole , " Poplawski said .
" Also , instead of black holes ending up with singularities , this model suggests they would end up with universes . "
An idea full of holes ?
One hole in this idea is one that turns up whenever wormholes are discussed — exotic matter .
In principle , all wormholes are unstable , closing the instant they open .
The only way to keep them open is with an exotic form of matter with so - called " negative energy density . "
Such exotic matter has bizarre properties , including moving in the opposite direction of normal matter when pushed .
No one knows if such matter actually exists .
" It is possible that when black holes form , matter can undergo a phase transition to become exotic matter , to allow this initial expansion of a universe inside the black hole , " Poplawski suggested .
Also , while this might explain how our universe was born from a black hole , it does not explain how the universe that black hole is from came to be .
" So was that universe born from a black hole in another universe , and so on ? " Poplawski noted .
" It 's a problem of an infinite number of universes .
That 's a very reasonable criticism . "
Poplawski will detail his research April 12 in the journal edition of Physics LettersB .
My project
This week I followed an advice of my mentor , Simon Marlow , and started to play with the code including print statements in interesting places in order to understand it ’s flow .
It ’s indeed much better than just reading the source code and the documentation on the wiki .
As usual , I had a lot of doubts about some parts of the code , and noted them down .
But now , I ’m seeing that I ’m resolving most of them just by playing more with the code , without need to ask in the mailing list .
There are still some left , and I ’m planning to send them to the list in a next oportunity .
The first thing I noticed was the high number of objects , from my perspective , that are created and collected in :
main = return ()

In Agora , Alejandro Amenábar ’s film about the clash of religions in ancient Egypt , Rachel Weisz plays the accomplished philosophy teacher Hypatia of Alexandria , whose resistance to conversion eventually led to her death .
Weisz spent four months on the island of Malta , filming with her two co-stars ( whose characters vie for Hypatia ’s attention ) , Oscar Issac and Max Minghella ( son of the late Anthony Minghella ) .
We spoke to Weisz about making her first period film , throwing a handkerchief as Hypatia marked with a different kind of period , and her upcoming movie playing Jackie O .
Was this a movie you sought out ?
It was sent to me by Amenábar , and I ’d never heard of Hypatia , or really anything about this period in history , and so it was all a revelation to me .
I thought it was really unusual — it was a sword - and - sandal movie , there were central fight scenes , and it was sort of like those big movies they used to make in Technicolor .
But with the difference being that instead of revolving around a gladiator or king , it ’s about a female philosopher .
It seemed kind of radical and cool .
Hypatia is a clear - cut heroine .
She ’s smarter than everyone , and her motives seem pure .
Were you worried about playing someone one - dimensional ?
Yeah , she comes down on the right side of history .
But , no , I think that scene with the handkerchief with her period blood on it [ which Hypatia throws at a student who ’s trying to marry her ] — that ’s a true story .
She wanted to make sure that no one would make a pass at her ever again .
I just thought that was a very punk - rock thing to do ; a radical chick in the fourth century .
What other kind of research did you do for the part ?
The script told me a lot ; there are some chronicles about her that exist , but they ’re pretty dry , and I ’m not academic , so there was n’t much to be inspired by .
There were letters written to her by her students , really impassioned ones , so those were great to read .
I ’m not good at math or science , so I could n’t relate to that part of her , but I ’m really passionate about my job , so I used that as inspiration .
It ’s really the first deep period film I ’ve ever done , and as an actor you just want to be naturalistic .
Hypatia could be quite formal , but for me , an English person , that comes quite naturally .
I was impressed by Max Minghella , who played Hypatia ’s slave who ’s also in love with her .
Max is from England and grew up around the corner from me in London .
He ’s gorgeous , is n’t he ?
He ’s very magnetic .
We had a really great connection .
It ’s rare to see an epic with a strong female lead .
Totally rare .
Right now , drama is a pretty dirty word in Hollywood .
You ca n’t get dramas made .
And female dramas , forget about it ; it ’s almost impossible .
This movie is a real anomaly right now , and I hope people embrace it for how cool it is .
But I always find the idea of a strong woman funny .
What does that mean , I lift dumbbells and drink power shakes ?
No one ever says to a man , ‘ you play strong male roles . ’
I just want to play interesting women .
Like Jackie O , whom you ’re going to play in your partner Darren Aronofsky ’s film about her ?
That ’s the idea , yeah .
We ’ve just found a home and studio , so it ’s just kind of being set up .
It ’s not a biopic , it ’s just from the assassination to the funeral , so it ’s a tiny amount of time .
Tonally , it ’s a bit like the movie The Queen .
It ’s a delicate and daunting project , though , because her family is still around ; she has a young daughter .
The legendary agent whose presence looms over Alpha Protocol 's Michael Thornton is n't Bauer , Bourne or Bond - although the game is eager to invite all these comparisons .
It 's Shepard .
Obsidian has borrowed a lot from BioWare , a developer it 's always had a close working relationship with , and at times Alpha Protocol can feel a little like a Mass Effect mod as much as an original game in its own right .
A contemporary super - spy mod of Mass Effect would hardly be something to complain about , though , and while Thornton 's earthbound adventure is n't as gripping - and is hardly as polished - as either of Shepard 's galaxy - spanning suicide missions , it 's a still decent action RPG .
The narrative , unfolding in a kind of French plait of chatting and blasting people in the face that will be instantly familiar to veterans of any Normandy away missions , is a pleasingly sinister muddle .
While agent Thornton hops around the globe , having flirty conversations with enigmatic ladies on planes and making deals - or , like , totally not making deals - with sheiks , Russian crime bosses and Triads , Alpha Protocol slowly starts to pull together a story of international intrigue , as a weapons manufacturer tries to trigger a new cold war arms race so it can cash in on the ensuing panic .
( It 's worth noting that this firm definitely is n't in any way at all based on former Vice President Dick Cheney 's delightful paymasters Halliburton . )
You can customise Thornton 's beard , headgear and glasses , but can't mess with the face .
You might want to cover up the eyes , because they 're creepy and dead - looking .
While there are plenty of serious things to think about while you 're reloading - commercial jet liners get shot out of the sky , private military contractors storm embassies and the corruption might go all the way to the top on this baby - the game never forgets to revel in all the cheesy aspects of being a member of the air - miles - heavy , neck - breaking elite too .
This is espionage depicted as a delightful confection of plush safe - houses , video walls , one - liners and gadgets , a game built from show homes and weather - beaten military installations .
A handy indicator , if any was needed , of its reckless handballing of reality comes in the first five minutes , when a slick military industrial complex type conducts a debriefing in an office suite with a lit cigarette in his hand .
You can get a license to waterboard at Boots the Chemists these days , buddy , but not even Tier One special forces are allowed to do that anymore .
Reading a character 's dossier may give you perks and advantages when you inevitably have to blow their head off - or talk them out of trying to shoot you first .
While the plot spools around your feet one hotel lobby or snowy train yard at a time , the game 's missions themselves take their cue from the first Mass Effect rather than the second .
It 's a blend - and often a slightly wonky one - of RPG and shooter , meaning that it 's happy to give you a shotgun to pose with , but if you want it to actually behave like , well , a shotgun , you 're going to have to pour money and upgrade points into it .
Although that 's frustrating in the early levels , as you feel like you 're bursting from cover to pop super - soldiers in the face with tangy bursts of Glade , once the game actually gets cooking you 'll start to feel enjoyably super - powered yourself , whichever munitions you 're choosing to specialise in .
Each trip to the character sheet or the weapons clearing - house becomes a treat , and while certain classes of gun never have that much character however good you get with them - I struggled to love either pistols or SMGs , as they both seemed ineffectual - if you like stock - shopping and comparing the buffs offered by a handful of recoil dampeners , you 'll be pretty happy about things .
While I 'm fixing supper I turn on the little TV in the kitchen to watch the commentariat dissect the day 's news .
It 's their job to view everything through a political lens , which seems sometimes to leave them fairly blinkered about the motivations of the actors on the stage .
I was amused at Rove 's comments on the Powell / Cheney flap .
" Neither one of them are candidates , " he said , dismissing the entire matter .
He 's only interested in winning elections .
Anything else is the " false debate that Washington loves . "
The talking heads on MSNBC continue to be baffled .
They 're trying to figure out the strategy .
If Cheney & Limbaugh continue to be polarizing figures , then how is that going to help the Republican party make a comeback in the next election cycle ?
They shake their heads in puzzlement and disbelief .
Except that there 's nothing to indicate that either Cheney or Limbaugh are particularly interested in helping the Republican party win elections .
Limbaugh , for all his bluff and bluster , is consistent in one thing -- he's an entertainer whose interest is self - interest and driving his ratings up .
If the Republican party falls apart and the ensuing controversies raise his profile and get more people to tune into his show , that 's a good thing .
Zev Chafets 's profile of Limbaugh in the Times Magazine last July makes it pretty clear what drives him .
You will consistently misunderstand Rush if you think that he 's trying to build , preserve or further the interests of the Republican party .
Cheney is similar in that way .
But much scarier .
If you take him at face value -- and I see no reason not to -- he believes deeply that the actions that he took , the agenda that he drove until even W. could n't stomach it anymore , kept the country safe .
And that what the Obama administration is doing now is terribly wrong and is opening the door for another attack .
His mission now is to do as much as he can to hammer home that message in hopes that public and congressional opinion can be turned enough to put roadblocks in Obama 's way .
Whether or not that serves the interests of the Republican party is irrelevant .
Once you quit trying to view their actions through a political lens , they 're both remarkably consistent .
I was never outraged at Limbaugh 's comments about wanting Obama to fail .
How could he not want that ?
Obama 's vision for the United States is fundamentally antithetical to the view of the U.S. that Rush holds .
If Obama were to succeed , he would be moving the country in a direction that would make it much more difficult for Rush to sustain his riches and his notoreity .
I imagine that during the days between the election and the inaugural , Cheney must have wondered if there was n't a way to stop the succession from happening .
He must have considered the implications of declaring a state of emergency , of some sort of martial law .
His actions over the past eight years have made it very clear that he believes that the President has unlimited authority to do whatever is necessary in advancing the war on terror .
It must have been deeply disappointing to him to realize , finally , that he'd made a president who just was n't as tough as he was .
Staring at the same computer screen at work day after day can drive a person batty .

US : Forty years since the national postal strike
By Hector Cordon
24 April 2010
Forty years ago in March postal workers defied their unions , federal anti-strike laws , the military and the Nixon government to carry out the first national strike by federal employees against the United States government in history .
Thousands of postal workers voted Saturday , March 21 , 1970 , at a meeting in the New York City armory , to defy the back - to - work order of the federal government and continue the strike begun days earlier by the wildcat strike of Branch 36 of the NALC .
At its height , the 1970 Postal Strike encompassed over 200,000 workers in over 30 cities — including the major metropolitan centers of New York City , Chicago and Los Angeles — bringing the postal system to its knees and provoking a direct confrontation with the Nixon government .
The struggle was notable for the pronounced contrast between the militancy of the rank - and - file and the cowardice of their unions ’ leadership .
At every point the union bureaucracy sought to prevent a strike , and once it did occur , to force a return to work .
According to one history , “ When the strike did break out the national leaders wrung their hands and protested to [ Postmaster General Winton ]
Blount that they had not called the strike , and immediately urged the strikers to return to work . ” [ 1 ]
Decades of sub - standard pay and poor working conditions , along with congressional neglect of demands for satisfactory pay increases , had created the conditions for the rebellion .
Postal workers were also encouraged by the struggles of other sections of the working class .
By the end of the 1960s these subsistence - wage clerks and carriers had seen many other public employees obtain wage increases through so - called “ illegal strikes . ”
Additionally , a decade of mass anti-war demonstrations , the civil rights movement , rebellions in the inner-city ghettoes as well as a rising tide of labor militancy inspired them to test their strength .
The immediate trigger for the walkout , which began in New York City , was an announcement on March 12 that the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee had revealed the contents of a Nixon - supported bill which would transform the Post Office Department into an independent “ Postal Authority , ” while retaining civil service status for postal workers , and thus the ban on strikes imposed on federal employees .
It would also extend collective bargaining and grant a 5.4 percent wage increase retroactive to January .
The previous year had seen thousands of New York City postal workers participate in angry demonstrations to protest a miserly 4.1 percent increase approved by Congress , easily consumed by high inflation , which was well above 5 percent in both 1969 and 1970 .
In response , frustrated carriers and clerks staged spontaneous walkouts , protests and sick - outs to express their opposition .
At the beginning of 1970 a craft employee of the Post Office with 21 years of service earned a top - of - scale average of $ 8,440 , practically poverty level in numerous urban centers , requiring many to work second jobs .
Wages were so low that “ in New York City alone , [ these wages ] left 7 percent of the carriers on welfare of one sort or another . ” [ 2 ]
Further enraging postal workers , Congress had recently voted itself a whopping 41 percent pay increase while President Richard Nixon — who in February 1969 had pledged to postal workers that “ better days are coming ” — proposed a six month delay in a comparability raise for all federal workers “ because of the need to control and contain the inflationary spiral . ”
Postal workers ’ long - simmering anger erupted when a meeting of the 6,700 member Manhattan / Bronx Local 36 of the National Association of Letter Carriers ( NALC ) , held the same day as the announcement of March 12 , learned of a proposed 5.4 percent pay increase .
The rank - and - file immediately started chanting “ Not enough , not enough , not enough ” which transformed into “ Strike , strike , strike ” and then became “ Strike when , strike when , strike when . ” [ 3 ]
The membership had by this time rushed the podium demanding a strike vote .
So distant was the postal hierarchy from its membership that NALC President James Rademacher , a Nixon supporter , had worked with the administration to develop a bill which , when it was presented to his largest union local , instantly sparked a revolt .
Local 36 President , Gustav Johnson was able , despite the tumult , to rule workers ’ demand for an immediate strike vote as unconstitutional and postpone it to March 17 .

The placard at the left says " RAT - emacher Must Go , " referring to NALC president James Rademacher , who supported Nixon and opposed strike action .
Both Rademacher and Johnson spent the next five days waging an all - out effort to undermine a “ yes - strike ” vote .
Johnson , adopting Nixon ’s notorious phrase , appealed to the “ silent majority ” to vote no .
Postal officials were described as feeling confident of a “ no ” vote since “ Gus Johnson and his officers were in control . ” [ 4 ]
Gathering at the old Manhattan Center on March 17 , members of Local 36 voted until 11 PM .
Shortly after that the vote totals were announced with 1,555 voting yes to strike and 1,055 no against a strike .
The next day — soon after midnight by one account — picketing had begun , and by late morning 14,000 letter carriers in the Bronx , Manhattan , and Brooklyn were manning picket lines .
The 25,000 member clerks union , whose strike vote was scheduled three days later , refused to cross the lines .
After the vote to strike , the union bureaucracy abruptly reversed course , with Johnson telling postal workers , “ I will lead you . ”
Johnson and the postal bureaucrats recognized that if they stood in the way of the strike they could be cast aside , with unpredictable results .
Indeed ,
Time magazine quoted one NALC official as declaring “ We were no longer in control . ” [ 5 ]
The government responded quickly and ruthlessly to the strike .
Temporary restraining orders were issued by federal judges in Manhattan and Brooklyn and injunctions were served on Local 36 officials the same day the strike began .
However , not only did strikers defy court orders , the strike spread across the US .

Other cities , major and minor , quickly followed New York City workers out : Boston , Cleveland , Pittsburg , Denver , San Francisco and Los Angeles .
In Chicago , 3,000 carriers shouted down the union leadership ’s pleas to remain on the job and in overwhelming numbers voted to go out .
Many others called in sick .
Back in New York City the strike was 97 percent effective with letter carriers voting on March 21 to remain out and the clerks local voting to join the strike .
By March 21 Nixon ended his silence and , calling the stoppage an “ illegal strike ” threatened strikers , saying “ we have the means to deliver the mail and we will use those means . ”
This was widely interpreted to imply the use of the military against the strike .
The Post Office and the administration rejected any negotiations with the unions while an “ illegal strike ” continued .
Workers responded to Nixon ’s threats by expanding the strike , with Rhode Island becoming the 14th state to join the walkout .
Two days later , in an early morning vote , carriers in Chicago reaffirmed their decision to strike .
An indication of the combativeness of the working class was the response of other government workers to Nixon ’s warning that he would involve the US military in the struggle .
There was broad and growing support among the ranks of all federal workers to join the walkout .
This possibility the union apparatus sought to stave off at all costs .
An effort to resolve the strike on March 21 failed when the rank - and - file ignored Rademacher ’s entreaty to return to work for five days in order to allow for negotiators to arrive at a settlement .
“ Public wrath shall replace support , ” he admonished his membership .
The Nixon administration ’s anxiety was expressed in White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman ’s diary entry for that day .
“ Had to spend quite a little time on postal problem .
The settlement did n’t work , because rank and file wo n’t go back , have rejected leaders , and now SDS types involved , at least in New York . ”
On March 23 , Nixon spoke on national television and radio to declare a national emergency .
He ordered a military mobilization to “ begin in New York City the restoration of essential mail services . ”
He also made it clear that a similar mobilization could be extended to other major cities .
Letter carriers from Brooklyn attend the rally with signs supporting Branch 36 and expanding strike action .
Nixon ’s order to deploy the military in America ’s largest city brought the union bureaucracy to heel .
In response , “ NALC President Rademacher had instructed strikers to call off their picketing wherever picket lines still exist and he told them to cross picket lines if they had to in order to get back to work , ” NBC newsman Chet Huntley reported .
The mood was different among workers .
Strikers in Chicago jeered Nixon ’s speech , and 31,000 postal workers remained out in that city alone .
With the Vietnam War still raging , Nixon ’s order sent 18,500 troops into New York City in what was dubbed Operation Graphic Hand .
Although the primary purpose of the mobilization was to intimidate workers , raising the specter of military dictatorship , a total of 16,836 men were assigned to mail sorting work .
According to Graphic
Hand documents , the military made preparations for the use of up to 115,468 men in 35 cities if the strike continued .
However , contrary to the traditional use of military units in strikes or demonstrations — as law enforcement shock troops — the troops were strictly instructed to avoid any confrontation , and that “ the use of helmets , weapons , gas masks , and other equipment which might imply a civil disturbance role was ruled out . ” [ 6 ]
In contrast , in the Kent State tragedy only a little more than a month later , on May 4 , the Ohio National Guard fired 67 rounds at unarmed students , killing four .
Fearing that use of the military in a police action , with the attendant use of violence , could spark a much wider confrontation , drawing in large sections of the working class — a similar action had provoked the May - June general strike in France two years earlier —
Nixon chose to lean on the union heads to deliver a “ voluntary ” return to work .
The postal union hierarchy proved able — under the combined blows of the military , the courts and their own open sabotage of the walkout — to force a return to work .
After enough carriers and clerks returned to allow the postmaster general to resume negotiations with a degree of credibility , the unions declared victory and increased pressure on obstinate locals to return to work .
In New York City it took a bogus announcement by Branch 36 president Johnson that an agreement had been reached before striking postal workers there finally relinquished their picket lines on March 25 .
Formal negotiations between the Post Office Department and seven recognized unions began the same day .
" We will not give back the P.O. until we get Congress and Mr. Nixon to sign a decent pay raise . "
The militancy and solidarity of postal strikers resulted in major concessions .
Amnesty was conceded to all strikers .
Congress approved special legislation for a 6 percent increase with the end of the strike and another eight percent in August .
The contract negotiated in 1971 had a new starting wage of $ 8,440 , exceeding the old top - of - scale wage , while the 21 years needed to reach top level was now reduced to eight .
Yet the agreement worked out between the union heads and the federal government was a betrayal .
While certain gains related to wages and conditions were realized , the unions accepted the continuation of the strike ban on federal employees and binding arbitration under a so - called “ neutral ” arbitrator .
Significantly , the unions dropped all opposition to “ postal reform , ” thus allowing the reorganization of the post office as an independent self - supported government corporation — a significant step toward privatization that was begun soon after the strike with the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 .
In return for instituting collective bargaining as a principle of the Postal Service , the Post Office was abolished as a cabinet department and reorganized along the lines of a business corporation , in which public financing would be phased out in favor of self - sufficiency .
In the long run , this could only be achieved through postage rate increases , reductions to “ inefficiencies , ” and by driving down labor costs .
This sellout agreement , in other words , created the adverse conditions that postal workers confront still today .
It handcuffed postal workers by effectively denying them the right to strike and institutionalized a parasitic union apparatus bitterly opposed to any challenge to the federal government .
Within one year of the strike six unions combined to form the United Postal Workers Union .
Despite the strikers ’ audacity and militancy , the determination that allowed the strike to ride roughshod over the opposition of an entrenched union apparatus was ultimately unable to overcome the treachery of that same apparatus .
What was lacking was a political perspective .
More than most workers ’ struggles , the national postal strike of 1970 laid bare the lineup of political forces .
Workers were , after all , engaged in a direct confrontation with the American state represented by a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and the judiciary .
This posed the necessity for an independent political mobilization .
Moreover , inflation , which was impoverishing the postal workers and the working class as a whole , was owed in large measure to the American state ’s decade old war against the Vietnamese people .
Under these conditions , the postal workers ’ struggle — as well as their critical control over the delivery of mail — had the potential to attract other sections of the working class , both public and private , and take on an openly political character .
But to do so workers had first to break with their treacherous union leadership , which was acutely aware of the dangers posed by the strike .
The 40 years since the walkout have witnessed a persistent deterioration in the jobs and conditions of postal workers .
The postal unions have made unending concessions in the privatization of various job categories .
The original eight years needed to reach top scale has expanded , with ever more lower steps added and correspondingly lower wages paid to the new hires .
Postal workers are currently working harder for less money than at any time since 1972 , two years after the strike .
According to one study , real earnings among postal workers in 2000 were actually 7.7 percent less than they were in 1972 , and 13 percent less than they were in 1978 , in real terms .
Today , the US Postal Service is seeking to implement a long - standing agenda of job cuts carried through the elimination of Saturday delivery and the ongoing closure of thousands of mail processing and other facilities and attacks on retirement and other benefits .
The sole response of the union bureaucracy has been to turn to the same agency that has studiously ignored the rampant unemployment and impoverishment of millions of workers , while handing trillions of dollars to the banks — Congress .
The unions ’ support of the Democratic Party and the Obama administrations , whose policies are formulated by and defend the interests of the financial aristocracy , show that they proceed on every question in opposition to the most basic interests of the rank - and - file .
A new rebellion will find the postal unions as the most determined defenders of management .
Independent rank - and - file organizations , linking up the struggles of private and public workers , must be built to undertake a defense of jobs , wages and working conditions on the basis of an independent political struggle for a socialist program .
Such a program will repudiate the demand for “ self - sufficiency ” or outright privatization , and recognize the postal service , a major pillar of the economy , as an essential public service .

Early Draft Of ‘ Empire Strikes Back ’ Reveals Alternate ‘ Star Wars ’ Universe
An early draft of the screenplay for Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back , written by late science fiction author Leigh Brackett , has been leaked online .
Brackett wrote the script based on a story outline by Star Wars creator George Lucas , and submitted the draft to Lucas just before she died of cancer in March of 1978 .
Apparently , Lucas did n’t like the direction of Brackett ’s script , but she did receive screenwriting credit , along with director Lawrence Kasdan , for the 1980 sequel to Star Wars .
The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie of all time , and while I think it ’s perfect as is , I could n’t help but wonder what if ?.
So , I read the script and let me tell you , not only would Empire have been so much different if Brackett ’s script was used , but so too would the history of the entire Star Wars universe !
Reading this script was like getting a peek at an alternate Empire universe .
I ’m a big fan of the Star Wars expanded universe , so I would have loved to see some of the elements of Bracket ’s version make it into some of those books .
Check out some of the details from Brackett ’s script here below .
– On the Rebel base , Leia talks to Han about his stepfather , an extremely powerful man named Ovan Marekal .
– After Luke escapes the Wampa cave , Obi-Wan does n’t appear to him with the message to go to Yoda on Dagobah .
– There ’s no banter about going out to rescue Luke ; instead , Han and Leia lead a search party to find Luke and they do so quickly .
– While Luke is in sick bay , he describes the snow creatures that attacked him ( what becomes the Wampas ) ; Commander Willard asks him if he thinks these snow creatures pose a threat to the Rebel base , and as it turns out , they are attacking it at that very moment !
There ’s no sexual - tension exchange between Han and Leia .
And Leia does n’t plant that incestuous kiss on Luke … just then , but when she returns to visit him later on , the script says that we see them “ in the midst of a tentative , and very tender love scene . ”
Ooh !
– There ’s an Imperial city - planet known as Ton Muund , which is the center of the Empire .
The first time Vader appears in the film , he ’s in his quarters there finding out the location of the Rebel Base .
– As Darth Vader and his troops prepare to invade the Rebel base , Vader mentioned Luke Skywalker by name , saying how Luke used the Force to help him target to destroy the Death Star .
– Later , the snow - creatures return and attack the base with a plan to rid the Rebels from their planet for good .
This is what prompts the discussion of the Rebels ’ evacuation , which leads to Luke sensing a dark disturbance in the Force ( which is Vader and his men about to invade ) .
– Dagobah is referred to as the Bog planet and Luke is comatose as he approaches it , thanks to Vader Force - choking him from afar .
There he meets a “ frog - like ” creature named Minch ( Yoda ) .
Bog was a training center for young Jedi , and that ’s where Obi-Wan trained .
Later on , Minch demonstrates a Jedi duel , calling upon Obi-Wan ( “ By the Force , I call you ! ” Minch says , summoning Obi-Wan ) to be his opponent .
– While the Millennium Falcon is in the asteroid field , Han kisses Leia ; she kisses him back at first then goes to smack him ( something she did too on the Rebel base ) .
Han then demands to know if she loves Luke .
– Darth Vader has pet gargoyles .
– Lando Calrissian is known here as Lando Kadar and his family were refugees of the Clone Wars .
He was an “ honest smuggler , ” according to Han , who had “ gone respectable on a world called Hoth . ”
As they approach the place , it is a world “ shrouded in clouds . ”
Han tells Leia that Hoth means “ cloud . ”
When they arrive , a group of white - haired , white - skinned “ tall , noble - looking warriors ” with pneumatic dart weapons comes at them .
We find out later that these are the native White Bird clan of the Cloud People .
– Princess Leia ’s alias on the Hoth / Lando planet is Ethania Eredith , the daughter of a smuggler who Han found stranded on an unpleasant world .
– Luke is finally able to summon Obi-Wan , who brings along Luke ’s father !
His father asks if him if he knows about his sister ( the draft has the name Nellith , but it ’s crossed out a few times and replaced with “ sister ” ) .
His father says he can’t reveal her name for fear that Darth Vader would read Luke ’s mind and find out about her .
Luke then takes the oath of the Jedi Knight ; afterward , Minch says Luke ’s real test [ of resisting the Dark side of the Force ] will come from Vader .
– Leia suspects that Lando is a clone ; he later confirms that he is a clone of the Ashardi family , that his great - greatfather wanted many sons , so he had clones of himself made .
Lando says after the Clone Wars , there are n’t many of them left .
Before the wars , he ’d see his own face on many people in the street and that it gave them a “ sense of oneness , of belonging . ”
Later , when he betrays Han and Leia , he ’s not remorseful at first .
– Vader knows that Luke is in love with Leia , so he is going to use her to get to Luke .
– When Luke arrives at the Hoth cloud city , the White Clan warriors nearly attack them , but then help him with his encounter with Vader and then try to fight off the Imperial troops .
– When Luke and Vader have their lightsaber duel , Luke inadvertently uses the Dark side of the Force .
Later , there ’s no reveals or surprises , and Luke is n’t injured .
Vader just wants
Luke to join him to rule the galaxy .
Luke escapes the fight the same way , but when he lands , he sees the Falcon and jumps on it ; Chewbacca lets him into the ship .
No Leia Force - like ability at play .
Everyone escapes in the end , including Han .
– The story ends on the planet Besspin Kaalieda , with the group saying their farewells .
Leia is with Han , telling him “ come back to me ” because she loves him ;
Han is leaving with Chewbacca to meet with Ovan Marekal like he was supposed to at the beginning of the film .
Luke still loves Leia , but now in a different way since he has matured .
Luke , Leia , Lando , C3PO , and R2 - D2 watch as the Falcon takes off ; Luke ignites his lightsaber in salute .
THE END .
New Jersey medical marijuana patient John Wilson walked out of Southern State Prison Thursday , freed on bond while he appeals his five - year prison sentence for growing his own medicine .
Wilson was convicted in December of manufacturing marijuana for growing 17 plants and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms .
The following month , New Jersey became the 14th state to approve medical marijuana .
That law will go into effect August 1 .
CMMNJ Wilson pardon campaign poster
Wilson , a 37 - year - old with multiple sclerosis , had served five weeks of his prison sentence in a succession of local and state jails and prison when a court ruled Monday he could be freed on bond pending appeal .
It took until Thursday for his family to come up with the $ 15,000 cash bail .
During his trial , Wilson was blocked from entering evidence about his medical condition or telling jurors he was growing marijuana to treat it .
That is the issue that will be heard on appeal .
Wilson 's case garnered media attention , thanks in part to its curious juxtaposition with the Garden State 's move toward medical marijuana and thanks in part to supporters organized by the Coalition for Medical Marijuana - New Jersey , which organized demonstrations at the Somerset County Courthouse .
" People with MS who seek cannabis therapy should not be in prison , " said the group 's Chris Goldstein .
Medical marijuana supporters Sens. Raymond Lesniak and Nicholas Scutaria have called for Gov. Chris Christie to pardon Wilson .
Until then , Wilson finds himself in something of a medical predicament .
He told the Associated Press upon his release that he was not going to use medical marijuana until it becomes legal this summer .
" Whenever they open the program , I would register and abide by the law , " Wilson said .
" You know what I mean . "
But in the meantime , he can't afford his $ 3,000 a month MS medicine .
There 's no I in pad .
Only we , of course .
Yeah , we 've been wanting to make that joke for awhile -- but in all seriousness , Neofonie , makers of the 11.6 - inch WePad , held a press conference in Berlin today to reveal a bit more about its Linux - based slate .
According to our German counterparts there will be two versions of the Intel Atom N450 - powered tablet , which has two USB ports and an onboard webcam -- the 16GB / WiFi version will go for €450 and the 64GB / HD capable model for €569 .
We 're a bit intrigued by the promised " full HD " support of the larger version , but Neofonie was quick to say that there is no NVIDIA inside .
Hmm ... Broadcom 's Crystal HD , perhaps ?
The company was n't willing to let reporters play with the early build of the multitouch device , but they did show off some videos of the Linux interface .
You can watch a few after the break , but the live widget - based GUI looks extremely attractive and amongst other things , the browser supports Flash .
It sort of hurts that we wo n't be able to get our hands on one until August , but we 're happy to hear that the company , unlike some others , is taking the time to get things right . :
We can't help but laugh at the fact that many sites are reporting that the WePad on display at yesterday 's press conference was actually running Windows 7 underneath the Linux - looking UI .
Apparently the company has more work to do than we originally thought .
Yesterday we brought you the story of a Labour PPC brought down by inappropriate " tweets " .
But if this was the first scalp claimed by Twitter in this election , it 's certainly not the first time social media have tripped up a prospective parliamentary candidate in recent weeks .
Ukip 's Paul Wiffen , who is campaigning to be MP for Ilford South , last week felt the urge to respond to a post critical of his party .
The CommunityCare blog had condemned an anti-asylum leaflet emanating from Ukip , something my colleague George Eaton wrote about .
Wiffen 's subsequent user comment included the following paragraph :
You left - wing scum are all the same , wanting to hand our birthright to Romanian gypsies who beat their wives and children into begging and stealing money they can gamble with , Muslim nutters who want to kill us and put us all under mediaeval Sharia law , the same Africans who sold their Afro- Caribbean brothers into a slavery that Britain was the first to abolish ( but you still want to apologize for ! )
Wiffen was duly suspended from his party .
But it seems
Ukip high command ( aka Lord Pearson , one supposes ) is more forgiving than Labour .
Following an apology from Wiffen , it has now reinstated its candidate .
Stuart MacLennan , who referred to " old boots " , " chavs " and " coffin dodgers " while Wiffen was attacking the Africans , wife - beating " Romanian gypsies " and " Muslim nutters " , must be a little bemused today .

Writing about Android can sometimes feel like writing science fiction .
So forgive me for saying the following :
The Android invasion is about to shift phases .
Android , you see , has just broken through a few new barriers in its path to widespread adoption .
The one getting all the attention today comes from a report published by the research gurus at Gartner , who found U.S. Android sales grew a whopping 707 percent over the past year .
Yes , 707 percent -- or , to use the more technical term , " a really freakin ' ginormous amount . "
Specifically , 5.2 million Android handsets were sold in the first quarter of 2010 , up from 575,000 just one year ago .
' Twas a strong season for smartphones in general -- overall sales were up by almost 50 percent from year - to - year -- but the biggest headline clearly belongs to Android .
Google 's mobile phone platform now possesses 9.6 percent of the global smartphone market , compared to only 1.6 percent at the same time in '09 .
That means it 's nudged Windows Mobile -- er , sorry , Windows - Mobile - but - soon - to - be - Windows - Phone - 7 - Series - or - maybe - just - Windows - Phone - 7 -- out of the fourth place spot .
If the predictions prove true , the iPhone and BlackBerry will be the next to be overtaken .
Android Sales , Interest , and the Inevitable Shift
The trends certainly seem to support the notion of continued Android growth , and it is n't just Gartner providing the data .
The latest report by the analysts at Quantcast also shows steady gains by Android .
According to those number - crunching cats , while Android still " has a way to go , " the " trend is becoming apparent . "
And , at the risk of overloading your brain with data ( mine shorted out about four minutes ago ) , the crew from Compete came out with its own study this week , too .
Those stat - loving sons - of - guns measured consumer interest by looking at what smartphones people were researching most frequently at carriers ' sites .
Their analysis , entitled " Android Finally Begins to Erode iPhone 's Interest Share , " reaches an interesting conclusion .
" The reason Apple should be concerned about Android 's newfound strength is because it has been in a similar situation before , in its competition against Microsoft for home computing , " Compete 's Nathan Ingraham explains .
" Apple , of course , is the only manufacturer and vendor of phones running the iPhone operating system , while any manufacturer is able to run Android if it wishes .
This mirrors Apple 's history pitting its Macintosh operating system against Microsoft Windows . "
Oh , dear -- I detect an all - out fanboy battle a - brewin ' .
Ingraham makes a valid point , though :
An open product utilized by numerous manufacturers is obviously going to have broader reach than a closed platform limited to only one company .
The shift in share is inevitable .
Android's Next Phase
So , back to our sci - fi speak and those ominous sounding Android invasion phases :
In my mind , phase 1 was Android 's entry into the world with the T - Mobile G1 .
The second big phase began after the release of the Motorola Droid , when the platform suddenly started getting widespread attention and interest .
Phase 3 unfolded with the debut of the Nexus One and -- despite the recent shuttering of its online phone store -- Google 's serious focus on expanding the brand and making Android a household name .
( There was also the Steve Jobs christening of Android as the " platform for porn , " of course -- a momentous occasion for all Android supporters -- but we wo n't factor that into our current count . )
That brings us to now .
As high - power handsets like the HTC Droid Incredible and EVO 4G hit the market , Android is increasingly veering toward the mainstream .
From a nonscientific perspective , I can tell you that it 's only been in the last few months where I can mention Android and have people immediately know what I 'm talking about .
Six months ago , asking someone if they wanted to see your Android would get you little more than a blank stare ( and , depending on their interpretation , an occasional slap to the face ) .
Nowadays , I can whip out my Google - powered phone and regularly have someone comment on it , ask about it , or even tell me they have the same model .
It 's a noticeable shift , and it 's not only observable in numbers .
Our little club is n't so little anymore .
As Quantcast articulated for us , Android does have a long way to go ; the platform has its problems , and the bulk of its growth in market share is still ahead .
But with each phase comes better hardware , stronger software , and more powerful innovation .
" Android has a long way to go " is really just another way of saying " you ai n't seen nothin ' yet . "
Welcome to phase 4 .
It 's going to be exciting to see what the next several months will bring .

Black shoes are part of uniform in most schools in India
Indian children could soon be wearing canvas shoes to school rather than the heavy leather brogues , widely viewed as relics from the British colonial era .
Indian politician Maneka Gandhi is campaigning to ban the shoes as they are " unhealthy and uncomfortable " and " destroying " the feet of school - goers .
Reports say the drive is supported by two major school boards .
Education policy - makers have not yet commented .
Black leather shoes are mandatory for students in most schools in India .
" Leather shoes are really bad for our children , " news agency AFP quoted Ms Gandhi as saying .
These shoes , originally from Ireland and Scotland , were suitable for cold climates and not for the heat of India , she added .
Last year , Ms Gandhi wrote to the human resource development ministry protesting against the use of leather shoes .
The ministry then asked school boards for their opinion .
According to reports , the two main boards - Central Board of School Education ( CBSE ) and Indian Council for Secondary Education ( ICSE ) - have responded favourably to the suggestion .
Ms Gandhi says several schools in the southern city of Madras ( Chennai ) have already swapped leather shoes for canvas ones .
A similar move is underway in the northern city of Chandigarh too , she says .
Maneka Gandhi is the daughter - in - law of former Indian premier Indira Gandhi and the widow of her younger son , Sanjay Gandhi .

BREAKING : American Family Association viciously slurs ' sick queers '
by Jeremy Hooper
To highlight a new article where Focus on the Family 's Carrie Gordon Earrll teams up with outrageously over - the - top homo - hostile Matt Barber to condemn President Obama 's memo to the Department of Health and Human Services directing that America 's hospitals secure visitation rights and medical decision - making powers to same - sex partners , the American Family Association 's One News Now site decided to attach an accompanying audio piece .
They also decidedly labeled said piece with an outright slur :

* The print piece : ONN
Yes that 's right : " Charlie - Sick - Qrs- Voicer . " " Charlie " being the name of the reporter , Charlie Butts .
" Voicer " being the kind of report that he filed .
We think you can figure out what " Sick - QRS " stands for .
The mask is falling away , folks .
You just have to know how to cut through the carefully orchestrated spin .

The Red Cross in Afghanistan has been teaching the Taliban basic first aid and giving insurgents medical equipment so that fighters wounded during battles with Nato and Afghan government forces can be treated in the field , it was revealed today .
More than 70 members of the " armed opposition " received training in April , the Red Cross said – a move likely to anger the government of Hamid Karzai , which is losing large numbers of police and soldiers in insurgent attacks .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said it had introduced the classes because pitched battles , landmines and roadblocks stopped people in the most volatile areas from getting to hospital .
The Red Cross , which aims to remain neutral in the conflict , has trained more than 100 Afghan soldiers and policemen , as well as a network of taxi drivers who operate an unofficial ambulance service in Helmand and Kandahar provinces .
Today , a leading figure in Kandahar 's local government , who wanted to remain anonymous , said the Taliban did " not deserve to be treated like humans " .
He said : " They are like animals , and they treat the people they capture worse than animals .
They kidnapped and killed an American lady and then would n't even return her body .
These people do n't deserve this help . "
The Afghan ministries of defence and the interior said they were unable to comment on what they described as a highly controversial issue .
A Nato spokesman in Kabul said : " Nato has tremendous respect for the humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC and we recognise the need for this work to be carried out impartially .
" Isaf [ Nato ] forces also provide treatment to any case caught up in this conflict , including our opponents , in line with our own obligation to respect the rules of armed conflict . "
One of the ICRC - trained drivers , who transports sick and wounded people from Sangin district in Helmand , where some of the most fierce fighting is taking place , to Mirwais hospital in Kandahar city , told the ICRC that roadblocks and insecurity had lengthened the journey to six or seven hours , rather than the normal two .
The extraordinary measure highlights how badly security has declined in southern Afghanistan , undermining this summer 's effort by US - led forces to protect the population from violence .
The ICRC said its volunteers in Kandahar and staff at Mirwais hospital had seen a " substantial increase " in the number of patients injured by improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) and other weapons .
Critics of the Nato push in southern Afghanistan , which is aimed at seizing full control of Kandahar city and central Helmand from the Taliban by the end of the year , said that coalition commanders had made the situation worse by publicising where they were going to launch assaults .
By discussing publicly their plans in February for clearing the largely rural area of Marja in Helmand and then their desire to " clear " districts surrounding Kandahar city , Nato hoped many insurgents would simply choose not to fight .
But in many cases , the move gave the Taliban time to dig in and plant IEDS in the areas .
For years the beds at Mirwais hospital have been regularly filled with men with gunshot wounds , many of whom are insurgents .
But ICRC staff , who support the work of the hospital , have learned not to ask questions about how they sustained their injuries .
In general the government has been happy to allow fighters to come to the hospital , receive treatment and leave again .
But in Helmand in April , the tacit approval for such humanitarian medical support appeared to break down when Afghan security services raided a hospital in Lashkar Gah , the provincial capital , run by an Italian NGO called Emergency , which also has a strict policy of providing surgical help to anyone who needs it .
Nine staff were arrested and accused of plotting to murder the provincial governor after weapons and suicide bomb vests were found in the compound .
The International Committee of the Red Cross runs hospitals in Afghanistan , visits prisoners on both sides of the conflict and co-operates on various projects with the Afghan Red Crescent Society , a separate organisation , on various projects .

In this era of fiber to the home , it ’s easy to dismiss copper - based DSL , the broadband connectivity technology commonly sold by phone companies worldwide .
Looks like it ’s too soon to completely write off this technology , however .
Alcatel - Lucent , a company whose lineage is as old as the phone itself , says its research arm , Bell Labs , has been able to achieve downstream speeds of about 300 Mbps ( over a distance of 400 meters ) or 100 Mbps over a distance of one kilometer .
This is possible using a technology called DSL Phantom Mode .
According to the company :
At its core , DSL Phantom Mode involves the creation of a virtual or “ phantom ” channel that supplements the two physical wires that are the standard configuration for copper transmission lines .
Bell Labs ’ innovation and the source of DSL Phantom Mode ’s dramatic increase in transmission capacity lies in its application of analogue phantom mode technology in combination with industry - standard techniques : vectoring that eliminates interference or “ crosstalk ” between copper wires , and bonding that makes it possible to take individual lines and aggregate them .
The idea behind DSL Phantom Mode is that incumbent phone companies such as AT&T ( s T ) , which are heavily invested into the aging copper infrastructure , can keep using those pipes for a lot longer .
However , phone companies such as Qwest ( s Q ) will need to install new gear in the central office and in consumer homes .
Alcatel - Lucent ’s efforts are n’t the only attempts to extend copper ’s life and make DSL go faster and faster .
Stanford University professor John Cioffi is working on a gigabit DSL solution and has started a company to give DSL a lift .
Mr Clegg accused opponents of using " tired " arguments
Labour and the Tories have targeted Lib Dem policies as opinion polls suggest Nick Clegg is still enjoying a rise in support after the TV debate .
Tory leader David Cameron said plans for a selective amnesty for illegal immigrants were a " huge mistake " .
Labour 's Gordon Brown said voters would " think twice " about Lib Dem plans for child tax credits and Trident .
But Mr Clegg dismissed suggestions a Lib Dem vote would result in a Labour government as a " tired old claim " .
In other political news on Monday :
A YouGov poll for the Sun , carried out on Saturday and Sunday , suggests the Lib Dems are one point ahead of the Tories on 33 % with Labour in third place on 26 % .
Another poll , carried out by ICM for the Guardian , suggests Mr Clegg 's party has gained 10 points since last week , giving it 30 % - three points behind the Tories but two ahead of Labour .
A ComRes survey for ITV News and the Independent , released on Monday evening , suggests Labour and the Lib Dems are both on 28 % , with the Conservatives leading on 32 % .
A total of 1,003 adults were interviewed by phone for the poll on Saturday and Sunday .
Professor John Curtice , of Strathclyde University , told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that of the previous five opinion polls conducted since the prime ministerial TV debate , on average they put the Conservatives on 32 % , the Lib Dems on 31 % and Labour on 28 % .
But because the Lib Dem vote was more " geographically evenly spread " , under the first - past - the - post voting system , that percentage of the vote would not translate into a third of seats for the party - but pointed to a hung parliament .
In response , the Conservatives have dropped a planned political broadcast attacking Labour in favour of a personal plea from Mr Cameron to voters to avoid such a scenario .
The Tory leader said on Monday that would lead to " uncertainty , fudge and division " and could mean people end up being " stuck with Gordon Brown in Downing Street " .
He acknowledged that after the TV debate the election " started to get a bit lively " , and people wanted " something different " but said only an outright Conservative victory would bring " real change " .
Mr Cameron said a Lib Dem policy giving illegal immigrants the right to earn British citizenship was a " huge mistake " and evidence from other countries suggested it would encourage more illegal immigration .
' Short honeymoon '
But he said he would not turn to negative campaigning and would instead " redouble the positive " .
However former party chairman Lord Tebbit told BBC Radio 4's The World At One : " There is a Clegg bubble - the important thing is to puncture the bubble before 6th May - the 7th would be too late . "
Shadow defence secretary Liam
Fox told the programme they need to " ask questions " of Lib Dem policies on issues like immigration , crime and the euro .
The spirit of Dunkirk has gripped the nation .
The country has found a politician it likes even more than Winston Churchill , according to one poll
Read Nick Robinson 's blog
" The Liberals are very good at trying to be all things to all people and when you start to scratch below the surface , there are a lot of gaps , " he said .
At a Labour press conference Gordon Brown suggested the Lib Dems ' new popularity was a " political honeymoon " .
But he said while there was " common ground " between Labour and the Lib Dems on issues like political reform - there were differences on economic policy .
He said when people looked more closely at their policies they would " think twice " .
He said : " We believe we have a manifesto for a Parliament , we believe we are the people to take this country through the recession and into recovery ...
We are fighting for victory and for a majority at this election . "
Mr Brown said the TV debate had " energised " the election campaign but predicted that the focus would switch from " style and presentation " to " substance " .
' Tired old claim '
Mr Clegg said both Labour and the Conservatives were obviously going to " lash out " and both had used the " tired old claim " that a vote for the Lib Dems would benefit the other party .
" A vote for the Liberal Democrats is exactly what it says on the tin - it is a vote for the Liberal Democrats , " he said .
He defended his immigration policy , denying that he advocated an " unconditional " amnesty for illegal immigrants .
Rather , the Lib Dems ' plan for earned citizenship for illegal immigrants who have been resident for 10 years was " smart , tough and realistic " , he added .
On Trident , Mr Clegg said he had discussed the policy with senior defence figures including former chief of the defence staff Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank .
The Lib Dem leader said there were potentially cheaper options than spending £ 100bn on a like - for - like replacement for the submarine - based nuclear missile system and that the decision need not be taken immediately .
On his party 's election prospects , Mr Clegg said there was a " fluidity in this election which we have n't seen for perhaps a generation " and at only two other elections in the last 30 years had there been " the sense that people might move in a big way " - in 1983 and 1997 .

( CNN ) -- Rich Franklin cornered the man who challenged him and launched a looping kick that caught him on his jaw .
The man 's face flushed red , and his knees wobbled .
Franklin moved in , pounding his opponent with haymakers until he collapsed , grimacing .
Franklin , an Ultimate Fighting Championship middleweight , had just scored another victory .
The chiseled fighter took the ringside microphone and faced the roaring crowd .
" I want to say thanks to God , all praise to him , " he said .
Then he bowed and folded his hands in prayer as his groggy opponent was led outside the ring .
Was it Franklin 's right hand or was it the hand of God that helped him smite his opponent ?
Ringside viewers may disagree , but God seems to be standing in the corner of a lot of victorious athletes these days .
To read more stories with faith angles , go to the CNN Belief Blog
Baseball players point to the heavens after hitting home runs ; NFL players pray in the end zone after scoring .
Competitors routinely thank Jesus , along with their sponsors , in post - game interviews .
Thanking
God from the winner 's circle has become so common that one British newspaper published a letter to the editor entitled : " Leave me out of your petty games -- Love , God . "
The British letter raised a question : Does God care who wins on game day ?
And , if so , do losers somehow have less faith ?
Praising God or selling one 's goodness ?
Franklin , the UFC fighter , says he does n't know if God cared if he knocked out Travis " The Serial Killer " Lutter in Montreal , Canada .
But " it does n't hurt to ask . "
" Win or lose , I always thank God for what he 's given me , " says Franklin , an evangelical Christian .
Franklin says he thanks God after victories because he has felt God 's presence in the midst of mixed martial arts battle .
" There are times when I 've been in fights and I felt like I was about to lose and all of a sudden things turned around on me , " he says .
" My opponent lost his position .
I wiggled my way out of a submission .
I felt like there was a hand in it . "
Yet some sports commentators say assuming God is a sports fan trivializes faith .
Athletes who publicly thank God for victory are often calling more attention to themselves than their faith , says William J. Baker , author of " Playing with God . "
They are selling their goodness , and their brand of faith , to a captive audience , says Baker , who describes himself as a Christian .
" I do n't think it 's the right place and it's not the right gesture , " says Baker , a former high school quarterback .
" It 's an athlete using a moment to sell a product , like soap . "
What many of these pious athletes are also selling is an evangelical , winner - take - all gospel , Baker says .
" There are many similarities between the athletic and the evangelical take on life , " Baker says .
" Both are competitive , capitalistic .
It 's good guys versus bad guys .
You have winners -- people who are saved -- and losers -- people who are going to hell . "
Tom Krattenmaker , author of " Onward Christian Athletes , " says many evangelical athletes who publicly thank Jesus for victory have nothing to say about other issues such as the pervasive use of steroids in sports or racial discrimination against aspiring minority coaches .
" It 's an incomplete Christianity that 's brought to bear on sports , " Krattenmaker says .
" They are blind and silent on the larger moral issues that vex the sports sector . "
When did God become a sports fan ?
It 's hard to pinpoint when athletes started invoking God on game day .
The late NFL Hall of Famer Reggie White , the " Minister of Defense , " was one of the first professional athletes to routinely thank Jesus after victories during his career in the 1990s .
Baker , the author , says that as far back as 1943 , Gil " The Flying Parson " Dodds , an American distance runner , would give Jesus credit for his victories .
Dodds signed autographs with a scriptural reference to Philippians 4:13 ( " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me " ) .
One of the first professional athletes to attract criticism for invoking God after victory was Michael Chang , an American professional tennis player .
Chang won the French Open in 1989 as a 17 - year - old underdog .
He was booed by a Parisian crowd when he thanked Jesus for his victory at the tournament 's trophy presentation .
Chang , who now helps runs a Christian Sports League in California , says he thanked Jesus not to gloat , but to show gratitude .
" When I go out there and share my faith , I 'm not saying God is on my side and he's not on your side , " Chang says .
" The Lord loves everybody , and the Lord is on everyone 's side . "
He says he felt that there were moments during his French Open run when Jesus spurred him on to victory .
Chang , who is Chinese - American , says his victory encouraged Chinese people who were demonstrating in Tiananmen Square during his French Open run .
" I felt like there was a much greater purpose for the Lord getting me through those matches , " he says .
" A lot of people do n't remember that Tiananmen Square was going on . "
' Jesus was n't a metrosexual '
Athletes who publicly thank God for their victories also cite another purpose for the practice : evangelism .
Franklin , the UFC fighter , says his success shows young men that being a Christian does n't mean being a pushover .
" Jesus was fearless , not someone you provoked , " Franklin says .
" He 's a man 's man .
He was a carpenter who worked with his hands .
He was n't a metrosexual who did his nails . "
Jesus also said , according to the New Testament , that the " last shall be first . "
So what about the losers who are trudging off the field as the winners thank God for victory :
Is God punishing them for having less faith ?
Mike Sweeney , a devout Roman Catholic who plays baseball for the Seattle , Washington , Mariners , does n't accept that view of faith .
" If I 'm facing Andy Pettitte on the Yankees and I 'm praying for a home run , and he 's praying for a strikeout , I do n't think the result is going to show who has greater faith , " Sweeney says .
Sweeney says athletes can sometimes reveal more about their faith when they fail .
" It 's easy being a Christian when you 're hitting .345 , but you let me know who you really are when you 're hitting .245 and going through the valley , " Sweeney says .
Sweeney does n't pray for victory or point to the heavens when he gets a big hit .
God is n't as interested in what he says as what he does , Sweeney says .
" Saint Francis of of Assisi says preach the gospel at all times and , when necessary , use words , " Sweeney says .
" That 's something I 've tried to live my whole life . "
The PCLinuxOS distribution is the popular brain child of a man best known as Texstar .

If we stopped there , it would probably give the impression PCLinuxOS is aimed at newcomers to the Linux community , but that does not appear to be the case .
Police were alerted to investigate Brian Hogan 's possession of the prototype iPhone after his roommate called Apple Security out of fear she might be considered an accomplice in the theft .
A new report by Kim Zetter published by Wired identified the roommate named in the affidavit , and reported that she contacted contacted Apple after Hogan connected the prototype iPhone to her computer .
The investigating detective wrote in the affidavit that " [ The roommate ] contacted Apple in order to absolve herself of criminal responsibility .â 
The tip resulted in police preparing a search warrant for Hogan 's apartment .
Zetter reported that the roommate contacted police again two days later , before the search warrant had been served , as Hogan and his other roommate , Thomas Warner , were preparing to remove evidence from their home , including a desktop computer , serial number stickers from the iPhone , a thumb drive and a memory card .
That tip sent police on a chase following both Hogan and Warner in different directions .
The police found Hogan at his parents house , and Hogan then called Warner .
Both men eventually cooperated in divulging the location of the items , which were scattered in various locations : the PC had been left at a church , while the stickers were dropped at a gas station and the other items had been thrown in a bush .
The roommate had also reported to Apple " that Hogan had found the phone and had been offering it to news outlets in exchange for a payment , despite having identified Powell as the rightful owner from a Facebook page visible on the phoneâs display when he found it . "
In contrast with Wired 's original report which suggested Hogan was diligently working to find a news organization that could help him return the phone , the affidavit says Hogan reportedly told his roommate , " Sucks for him [ the Apple engineer ] .
He lost his phone .
Should n't have lost his phone . "
The roommate also revealed that Hogan had told her he had obtained a total of $ 8,500 from the stolen phone , and that he was expecting another bonus from Gizmodo once Apple officially announced the product .
Wired 's earlier report described Hogan 's transaction as " sharing . "
After selling the prototype to Gizmodo , the affidavit revealed that Steve Jobs contacted the site 's editor , Brian Lam , to ask for its return .
Lam " responded via the e-mail address ... that he would return the iPhone on the condition that Apple provided him with a letter stating the iPhone belonged to Apple . "
The affidavit also notes that Apple reported that the iPhone prototype was " invaluable " and that " the publication of Gizmodoâs story was ' immensely damaging ' to the company , because consumers would stop buying current generation iPhones in anticipation of the upcoming product , " according to Zetter 's report .
Apple also complains in the affidavit that Gizmodo 's disassembly of the prototype left it damaged .
The affidavit also says that the photos Gizmodo took and published were an act of copying trade secrets , and that Gizmodo 's Jason Chen was under investigation for receipt of stolen property .
That indicates that the affidavit used for the search warrant was not merely an attempt to discern
Chen 's sources as a journalist , but rather the investigation of criminal conduct , which shield laws can not absolve journalists from .
Zetter noted that the affidavit " supports the story , offered by Gizmodo and Hoganâs attorney , that the phone was found , and not stolen from the Apple employee , " noting that the engineer said it was " possible , but unlikely , that it was stolen from the bag " he had placed it in .

BBC News , Russia
Since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 , opium production in Afghanistan has risen dramatically .
Russia 's geographic proximity to the region has made it a huge consumer - sending thousands of Russians to an early grave every year .
Igor is just one of 30,000 Russians who will die from heroin this year A couple of weeks ago , and three time zones east of Moscow , I sat and watched another mother as she cried over the lifeless body of her 20 - year - old son .
It felt like an affront being there , intruding on her inconsolable grief .
The reason I was there , the reason she'd let me be there , is that her son , Igor , had been killed by heroin .
It is a sad fact in Russia that men , in particular , go to an early grave .
On average a Russian man is lucky to make it to 60 .
In the frozen heart of Siberia they die even younger - around 57 .
Alcohol is by far the biggest killer .
More than half a million Russians drink themselves to death every year .
But since the early 2000s , another killer has been spreading at frightening speed across Russia .
Actually there are two of them , one closely stalking the other .
The first is heroin .
The second is HIV .
Straddling Afghanistan
In the US , there are around 800,000 heroin addicts .
In the UK , between 200,000 and 300,000 .
In Russia , there are now two and a half million .
Why ?
What makes Russia so different ?
Perhaps it has something to do with the climate .
In a country that spends half the year in gloom , depression is a big problem .
But by far the biggest reason is geography .
Take a look at a map of the world and draw a line north from Afghanistan .
I had buried every single one of my family .
I had no more reason to live , I just lay down on a bed and injected and injected
Sergei
The vast bulk of Russia straddles the Eurasian continent from end to end .
We hear a lot about the effects of Afghan heroin on the streets of Europe .
But the countries that are really suffering are the ones on Afghanistan 's doorstep , places we know little about , and care even less - Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , and the biggest of all - Russia .
Continue along that line north and you will eventually arrive at the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk .
New life
It was there that I met a remarkable group of young men .
Vlad has the shoulders and bull neck of a nightclub bouncer .
But today he is training to become a Protestant priest .
He is also a virtual father to 25 young men .
Vlad is a former heroin addict , as are all his staff and all the young men in his care .
Among them is an intense young man called Sergei - his face cast in a seemingly permanent frown .
Sergei was one of Novokuznetsk 's 30,000 heroin addicts Sergei gave up heroin about nine months ago .
That he was able to - as well as choose a new life - speaks volumes of the work that Vlad and his staff are doing .
Sergei 's father was an alcoholic who beat his mother , stole and ended up in prison .
He died there from liver failure .
His mother killed herself when Sergei was a teenager .
He found her body hanging from a light fitting in the hallway of their flat .
By the age of 15 , Sergei and his brother were alone , and dealing drugs .
By the age of 20 he was a major heroin dealer .
Then in 2007 his brother was killed , beaten to death in a fight with other drug dealers .
What was left of Sergei 's world collapsed .
" I had buried every single one of my family , " he tells me .
" I had no more reason to live , I just lay down on a bed and injected and injected . "
That is were Vlad found him a year ago , unwashed , surrounded by filth and close to death .
Building coffins
In the last year , his transformation has been extraordinary .
Today Sergei is healthy , strong , and even talks of perhaps contacting his long - lost girlfriend .
But he is one of the few .
In the basement of the rehabilitation centre Vlad shows me the drying - out cell .
A terribly ill looking young man is slumped on a bed .
We have to make money somehow , and round here there 's never any shortage of business for an undertaker
Vlad " He came in last night - new arrivals stay here for the first two weeks . "
I immediately knew what he was talking about - cold turkey .
Heroin withdrawal is an extremely traumatic experience .
But it is staying off for the long term that is really difficult .
" Half the young men wo n't make it , " Vlad says .
" They 'll go back to the streets . "
It is perhaps not surprising that Vlad and his band of ex-addicts have a rather bleak sense of humour .
They have turned one room in to a workshop , where I found three young men building what I could swear were coffins .
" Why are you building coffins ? " I ask , rather surprised .
" We run an undertakers business , " Vlad replies , very matter - of - fact .
" An undertakers ?
Is n't that a bit morbid given what you 've all been through ? "
" We have to make money somehow , and round here there 's never any shortage of business for an undertaker . "

A Korean man has threatened to blow up the Australian embassy in Seoul following a controversial disqualification in the Winter Olympics .
In the final of the women 's 3,000 - metre relay speed skating event in Vancouver , Australian judge James Hewish disqualified the South Korean team , which finished first .
As a result they were denied the gold medal , which went to arch - rivals China .
Korean outrage at the decision led a man to threaten to blow up the Australian embassy in Seoul .
The man , known only as Mr Kim , was arrested after South Korean police traced his telephone .
Major Korean internet news website Joins.com reported the embassy was searched for 40 minutes and five staff were evacuated .
Australian officials described the threat as a hoax but said " Korean authorities responded very quickly and it was resolved " .
A similar decision by Hewish to disqualify a Korean skater in 2002 prompted thousands of angry emails to the International Olympic Committee .
But Hewish said it was " business as usual " and he would be back at the Pacific Coliseum to officiate on Friday .
" As far as we 're concerned there was no controversy , " Hewish said , not wanting to be drawn any further on the specifics of the incident .
" The Koreans are a bit upset but , you know , that 's understandable I guess . "
Hewish said he had no concerns for his safety but had not read website reports and blogs , with some in South Korea calling for him to stand down and others even suggesting a ban on importing Australian goods .
Joins.com reported that Kim came from Gunpo , the same town as Korean Kim Min Jung , the skater who crossed the line first to seemingly win her country gold .
No stranger to controversy
At the Salt Lake City Games in 2002 , Hewish created an even bigger firestorm when he disqualified Kim Dong - sung in the men 's 1500 m event .
That decision , which saw American Apolo Anton Ohno snatch the gold , sparked a diplomatic row , the Koreans threatening to take legal action and boycott the Salt Lake City closing ceremony .
Hewish received a lashing in South Korea and his address and personal details were placed on the internet .
While South Korean officials were initially more restrained this time around , the situation appeared to escalate on Thursday with skater Kim Min-Jung demanding a re-run of the women 's relay final .
" I want a rematch .
We all went and watched the race again and again last night and I still could n't accept the result , " the skater said .
" I could n't sleep last night .
" I do n't think I made any mistakes in the race . "
The Korean team , who have lost the relay to China for two consecutive world championships , were aiming for a record fifth straight women 's title in any Winter Olympic sport .
Despite the rising tension , Hewish said he did not expect the International Skating Union ( ISU ) to be knocking on his door for a please explain .
" The ISU have n't been in contact with me and as far as we can work out there is no reason for the ISU to contact me because it's a straight - forward decision , " he said .

FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski does n't see why net neutrality needs to be contentious .
His new " third way " approach to the issue , announced yesterday , was meant to be a big tent that could bring in both ISPs and Internet companies like Google , think tanks , and consumer groups .
It would be " light touch , " merely returning us to the " consensus " that has existed for years about regulating Internet access .
" I call on all stakeholders to work with us productively , " he said again today in a YouTube video released by the Commission .
Genachowski makes his pitch
Do n't break out the unicorns , rainbows , and ice cream cones just yet , though .
" This proposal is disappointing and deeply concerns us , " said the two Republicans on the Commission yesterday .
" It is neither a light - touch approach nor a third way . "
That " big tent " is already swaying dangerously in the breeze .
While groups like Free Press and New America predictably supported the plan , the real test was always going to be with the ISPs .
And they do n't like it .
At all .
Comcast and Time Warner Cable were the most conciliatory , pledging to work with the Commission even if they did n't approve of the plan .
Other ISPs decided that implicit threats of legal action were a better route .
And the wireless industry still insists that it 's so different , the rules should n't apply .
Time Warner Cable : " We remain concerned about the view that there is something unique about last - mile broadband access providers that requires different regulation from other Internet participants . "
CTIA - The Wireless Association : " While we are disappointed with the Title II net neutrality announcement today , CTIA will continue to work to educate policymakers , including the FCC , on why net neutrality rules should not apply to wireless . "
Verizon : " We believe that the chairman ’s stated approach is legally unsupported . "
Comcast : " While we are disappointed with the inclination not to lean in favor of Title I regulation , we are prepared to work constructively with the Commission to determine whether there is a ' third way ' approach that allows the Commission to take limited but effective measures to preserve an open Internet and implement critical features of the National Broadband Plan , but does not cast the kind of regulatory cloud that would chill investment and innovation by ISPs . "
AT&T : " We believe this is without legal basis .
Make no mistake — when it regulates the networks that comprise the Internet , the FCC is in fact , and for the first time , regulating the Internet itself ...
We feel confident that if the FCC proceeds down this path , the federal courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion . "
NCTA ( the biggest cable lobby ) : “ Nothing has occurred either in the marketplace or in broadband technology to change the fact that our broadband services are ‘ information services , ’ and not ‘ telecommunications services ’ that are regulated under a model designed for a previous era and for very different services . "
Some of this may be bluster , an attempt to secure a more favorable deal when the rules are finalized .
But the AT&T and Verizon comments about legality strongly suggest that someone will file suit over the issue , tying the Open Internet proceeding up in court for a couple of years .
This teeny little robot is the size of a toy truck – just 50 square inches .
It 'd be cute , almost , if it was n't armed with " dozens " of eight - inch rockets .
The world 's militaries have been gun-shy about letting armed robots roam around the battlefield ; they 're always a danger the machines will malfunction and ruin some pesky human 's day .
But Rafael , Israel 's state - owned arms - maker , is betting that its miniature Pincher robot might be allowed into warzones as a tool for neutralizing roadside bombs .
According to * Defense News ' * Barbara Opall - Rome each of the Pincher 's micro-munitions is " a self - contained micro rocket with safety ignition , motor , warhead and safety fuse . "
The " pyrophoric warhead combusts once ignited to burn upon target penetration , " which supposedly " eliminat[es ] collateral damage often caused by traditional explosive systems . "
" Instead of detona­tion , where the speed of the shockwave is ul­trasonic , we developed a special material that causes deflagration , where the speed of the shockwave is subsonic and does not cause sig­nificant damage , " Rafael 's Ram Fabian tells Opall - Rome .
The Pincher has a range of 100 feet , maybe .
An onboard camera looks for bombs , and helps remote operators aim the pencil - missiles .
It 's not Israel 's first attempt at a tiny killer robot .
In 2007 , the Elbit corporation unveiled its 18 - inch VIPeR ( " Versatile , Intelligent , Portable Robot " ) , equipped with a " 9 mm mini - Uzi . "
The machine never made much of a splash .
But rafael has high hopes for the Pincher .
The Israel - focused military site Defense Update even suggests the ' bot could be " used indoors to seek targets , locate and deactivate IEDs . "
Just make sure some kid does n't pick it up and put it in his toybox afterward .

Just when the Tea Party movement appeared to be spreading across the US , a radically different vision of America has emerged , courtesy of Facebook .
Its title might not be imaginative , but the Coffee Party USA is making waves .
In just a month its Facebook page has acquired more than 50,000 fans ; and supporters of this left - of - centre alternative were logging their interest at a rate of a thousand an hour today .
On the face of it , the rivals share features beyond their beverage titles : offspring of social networking websites ; self - consciously harnessing energy unleashed by populist frustrations with the political establishment ; and strong views on the nature and role of government .
There the similarity ends .
The Coffee Party crowd believe government is not an enemy of the people but the voice of the people .
Annabel Park , a documentary filmmaker who started up the Facebook page from Silver Spring , Maryland , said : " We want to see people representing us moving towards solutions to problems rather than strategically obstructing any form of progress . "
In a video on www.coffeepartyusa.org ( motto : wake up and stand up ) she says she decided to act after " listening to news coverage that made it seem the Tea Party was representative of America .
I completely disagree with this ." movement , it is clearly adopting a pro-Obama stance in contrast to relentless and often virulent opposition extended to the president
Though she wants the phenomenon to be seen as a bottom - up movement , it is clearly adopting a pro-Obama stance in contrast to relentless and often virulent opposition extended to the president by the opposition . .
Park herself has campaigned with Asians for Obama and on behalf of the Democratic senator Jim Webb .
The Coffee Party is yet another example of the democratising potential of the internet .
Over the past two years it has allowed the political energy to swing wildly between opposite ends of the spectrum to a degree and at a speed unthinkable in pre-digital times .
At first Barack Obama appeared to have a dominant grip over theweb , using social networking to attract enormous financial and organisational support .
Barely had he been sworn into office , however , but the Tea Party activists grabbed the initiative and applied it to their own purposes .
Now the Coffee Party is attempting to seize it back .
Like the Tea Party groups , it is using Facebook and Twitter to spread the word and to encourage individuals to form local outposts .
Already some 45 Coffee Party chapters in at least 30 states have been set up , and meetings are being staged in several cities from Martinsville in Virginia , to Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and Los Angeles .
The coffee metaphor helps : " It 's unfortunate that Tea is no longer soothing , " posts one supporter on Twitter .
" It now makes me tense . "
Julian Faulhaber ’s bold , bright images of newly built interiors and exteriors , suspended in the period of time after construction has been completed but before the spaces have been used , straddle the line between abstraction and documentation with their surreal sheen , haunting sterility , and perplexing toylike quality .

Highlights include the ominous gas station in Tankstelle ; the dark and brilliant Supermarkt , complete with shopping carts ; and the stark , futuristic photograph of the Frosilos building in Copenhagen .
On view at Hasted Hunt Kraeutler through June 26 .
On the 5th of March in 1946 , in Fulton Missouri , at Westminster College , Winston Churchill delivered an address ( since christened the " Sinews of Peace " ) lamenting the burgeoning power and influence being slowly but surely gathered up by the Soviet Union .
Perhaps the address will be familiar to some of you owing to its most famous passage :
From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic , an iron curtain has descended across the Continent .
Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe .
Warsaw , Berlin , Prague , Vienna , Budapest , Belgrade , Bucharest and Sofia , all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere , and all are subject in one form or another , not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and , in many cases , increasing measure of control from Moscow .
Athens alone —
Greece with its immortal glories — is free to decide its future at an election under British , American and French observation .
Ironic , as I will address , that he should mention Greece .
Much less well known perhaps is this later passage :
Our difficulties and dangers will not be removed by closing our eyes to them .
They will not be removed by mere waiting to see what happens ; nor will they be removed by a policy of appeasement .
What is needed is a settlement , and the longer this is delayed , the more difficult it will be and the greater our dangers will become . [ fn ]
The full text of the address is available here . [/ fn ]
The " Iron Curtain " came , of course , to signify the cavernous ideological , and eventually concretely physical , divide between East and West .
It took some 43 years before it was lifted once more , first and haltingly , in the form of the removal of Hungary 's border fence in mid-1989 and then , of course , finally via the fall of the Berlin Wall in November that same year .
Not to be compared with a production of Italian Opera , the Iron Curtain did not describe a sudden , smooth , abrupt descent over the stages of Eastern Europe .
Quite the contrary , its drop was in stutters of discrete , fractional lowerings , such that it was a full fifteen years after Churchill used the term before its ultimate expression , the Berlin Wall , was finally erected in response to the emigration westward of a full fifth of East Germany 's population between 1950 and 1961 .
Appeals to patriotism ( or accusations of treason , the criminalization of abandoning the state " Republikflucht " and eventually the very credible threat of deadly force ) did little to stem the tide of departures from the East until it was erected .
But , obviously , it is in the nature of confiscatory governments to fence in the subjects from which they wish to appropriate - whether the asset that fuels their lustful avarice is freedom or ( merely ) capital .
( As if there is a difference ) .
Is it not despicable when for the sake of a few alluring job offers or other false promises about a " guaranteed future " one leaves a country in which the seed for a new and more beautiful life is sprouting , and is already showing the first fruits , for the place that favors a new war and destruction ?
Is it not an act of political depravity when citizens , whether young people , workers , or members of the intelligentsia , leave and betray what our people have created through common labor in our republic to offer themselves to the American or British secret services or work for the West German factory owners , Junkers , or militarists ? [ fn ]
From an East German propaganda booklet describing the horrors of the newly created offense " Republikflucht " ( flight from the republic ) . ( c. 1955 ) .[/fn ]
A copyeditor might change only five words in the above passage for it to be easily mistaken for the words of a democratic representative on the House floor before slipping into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 an amendment imposing confiscatory taxes on expatriating U.S. Citizens .
This last bit of déjà vu is interesting , and was not lost on foreign commentators .
When the United States tightened its grip on departing expats in 2008 , the Economist went so far as to call it " America 's Berlin Wall . "
The comparison is more than apt once one discovers § 8 USC 1182 ( " Inadmissible Aliens " ) , which asserts :
Classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter , aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States :
[...]
Any alien who is a former citizen of the United States who officially renounces United States citizenship and who is determined by the Attorney General to have renounced United States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the United States is inadmissible .
Just a few paragraphs away from the exclusion barring the admittance of :
Participants in Nazi persecution , genocide , or the commission of any act of torture or extrajudicial killing ...
You know ...
Republikflucht , Nazi persecution ... same deal .
Fortunately ( or unimportantly ) , it is not the soul of its subjects the United States seeks to hem in .
( Yet ) .
In fact , the failure of the Iron Curtain to contain what Thatcher called " the essence of the human spirit and desire for freedom " seems to be a lesson well learned by what can only be termed " the left " in these pages . [ fn ]
I use this term collectively and with particular intent .
I have long since abandoned the quest to learn if the likes of Barney Frank actually believe the laws of supply and demand to be optional , or if they are merely power hungry charlatans who no more believe that rent control is a good idea than do economists , as the correct answer actually has no mitigating effect whatsoever on the damage wrought by their collective movement . [/ fn ]
Avoiding direct assaults on this essence is a lesson the left have transformed into a most adept mastery of and adroit affinity for the more Machiavellian elements of political science .
Shadowy machinations like :
The midnight vote .
The backroom deal .
The bill we must pass in order to read .
Reconciliation .
The anonymous earmark .
The bankruptcy priority end - around .
The Cornhusker Kickback .
The Chicago Way .
This deeply Chekist approach is a subtle acknowledgement either that postmodern subjects simply cannot be made to believe in the optimistic assertions of the benefits of these interminable social programs , or that clandestine - legislation is the only means to sneak damaging edicts past an increasingly educated and informed population .
So far , this approach has worked swimmingly for both the left and ( despite ? ) the right .
Consider :
It is almost impossible not to smirk just imperceptibly in admiration when contemplating the achievements of Rep. Barney Frank .
He did , after all , manage in the short span of fifteen years to transfer several trillion dollars from the middle and upper classes to his constituents ( and if you think these are limited to Massachusetts residents you are n't paying attention ) right under the nose of an opposition party via the DeBeersian invention of " The American Dream of Home Ownership . "
Even linguistically , simply grafting the term " Home Ownership " onto the brand of " The American Dream " is a bit of elegant marketing genius that should forevermore serve as a centerpiece in graduate level marketing programs .
As if this were not itself impressive , he has managed to deflect essentially all criticism related to the inevitable collapse onto the evil specters of greedy bankers .
Lavrentiy Beria would have wept to be able to wield such control while maintaining such a low profile .
The selection of Supreme Court Justices now almost excludes the possibility of selecting talented and brilliant jurists in favor of those political devotees unassailable enough to be confirmed by virtue of the raw rarity of written work which might actually tend to illuminate their skills and talents .
Despite terms like " Lockbox , " " Trust Fund " and " Trustees " the only assets currently held by the Social Security Trust Fund are IOUs from the United States Treasury that will , in any event , have to borrow ( or seize ) the money to repay them - literally an impossible endeavor to complete .
Of course , this effectively means that for some time now , social security has been nothing more than a tax and that its description as " security " or a retirement scheme has long been a rather unimaginative lie .
Against this background Kevin Drum asserts :
Back in 1983 , we made a deal .
The deal was this : for 30 years poor people would overpay their taxes , building up the trust fund and helping lower the taxes of the rich .
For the next 30 years , rich people would overpay their taxes , drawing down the trust fund and helping lower the taxes of the poor .
Well , the first 30 years are about up .
And now the rich are complaining about the deal that Alan Greenspan cut back in 1983 .
As it happens , I agree that it was a bad deal .
If it were up to me , I 'd fund Social Security out of current taxes and leave it at that .
But it does n't matter .
Once the deal is made , you can't stop halfway through and toss it out .
The rich got their subsidy for 30 years , and soon it 's going to be time to raise their taxes and use it to subsidize the poor .
Any other option would be an unconscionable fraud .
The ease with which the assertion that this was obviously merely a regressive to progressive mutating tax scheme all this time and everyone knew better comes to Mr. Drum should be instructive ( though others are prone to call it historical revisionism ) .
If it was really true that this was merely a tax scheme all this time with proceeds intended all along for the general fund why not say so ?
Voters may have been upset perhaps ?
Of course , this implies a rather deep penchant for deception on the part of the political class .
On the other hand , its possible that Social Security was the progeny of the best intentions , and was merely raped and pillaged wildly by Congress to fund ... well ... whatever they liked .
This would make the same political class nothing more than felons in effect .
Of course , in the end it makes no difference if the political class are charlatans or outright thieves .
What is of no small import is the pattern of governance here .
It is a pattern that has become so prevalent that my own ego cannot resist the temptation to label it with a term that I hope takes root .
This manner of government is not driven by overt collectivism and the blatant , state - enforced social subjugation that characterizes communism .
Nor is it well understood to be dominated by the pernicious nationalism , autocratic industrial centralization and megalomaniacal personality cults framed by fascism .
Neither can it be sketched as the consenting construction of broad and broadly parasitic labor pools and growth retarding redistribution schemes that make up the key tenants of socialism .
Quite differently , this manner of government is premised on the suspension of disbelief via sophistication , word play , disguise , deception , mistaken identity , the deliberate use of nonsense and absurdity to distract and will , no doubt , end in a melodramatic chase scene ( treasury officials in absurd uniforms chasing stage left to stage right after foreign borrowers perhaps ? )
In short , the United States has come to be governed by Farcism .
Farcist PIIGS
The success of Farcism depends on , and in some ways derives a measure of legitimacy from , the acquiescence ( or abject ignorance of ) a lazy citizenry .
Truly , it is hard otherwise to explain phenomena like the perpetuation of the myth that President Reagan shrunk the government , or that President Clinton ever presided over a surplus in the United States when budget and historical debt outstanding figures are openly available permitting anyone at all to falsify these claims in seconds .
In fact , under the Clinton administration it was the wholesale pillaging of the Social Security trust fund ( accounted for in Intragovernmental Holdings instead of " public debt " ) that permitted the specious claim that somehow a material slice of the aggregate debt of the country had been paid off .
In other words , the sort of accounting and insurance fraud that would send anyone in the private sector to jail and so familiar to forensic accountants and prosecutors it actually has a name : " Cookie Jarring . "
The last real surplus was in 1957 , by the way .
Likewise , and in a more contemporary construction , that any member of Congress or the current administration might assert that pouring trillions of dollars of liquidity via Government Sponsored Entities into cheap mortgages had no real inflationary effect on housing prices and , almost in the same breath , scold the public on the importance of supporting via blank check the unaudited Fannie , Freddie and Federal Housing Administration to prevent a housing crash , and so assert without howls of public protest strains the very imagination in the absence of rampant Farcism .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , America is not alone in these practices .
In fact , with apologies to Churchill , a silver curtain , lovingly lowered by Farcist leaders , has long since descended over the free markets of the West .
It encompasses and conceals from public view the finances and balance sheets of all the major powers and many private firms housed therein .
It is typified by the sort of opacity that permits the United States to claim a mere $ 12.9 trillion in debt .
It is the blocking force that simply dares " independent " ratings agencies to even think of downgrading a sovereign ( clearly Egan Jones must then be a member of the financial Maquis on this basis ) .
It smothers the utility of FAS 157 , drawing a metallic shield over the balance sheets of large banks until guessing what lies behind becomes an exercise in futility .
It surrounds and isolates price inputs like short sellers and buyers of credit default swaps .
It permits European banks to reduce capital requirements ( read : increase leverage ) by loading AIG up with $ 172 billion in exposure in its " foreign regulatory capital portfolio . "
It retains the heat required to keep mysterious Special Purpose Vehicles within e.g. , the Federal Reserve warm and dry .
And in the United States , member of a very exclusive club of sovereigns that tax worldwide income of their subjects , a club in which North Korea is also a charter member , as the desperate need for capital to support a flagging treasury begins to bite down , it carves out a " death strip " and orders its revenue agents to audit on sight , and its immigration officials to banish forever any subject with thoughts of Republikflucht .
It is somewhat Ironic that Greece , also called out by Churchill would be among the first to begin to emerge ( entirely involuntarily as it happens ) from behind the silver curtain .
It is as if Farcism , which erected the barrier in the first place , is itself eventually corrosive to the metal .
No surprise that Farcism 's NKVD immediately targeted and hunted down , like Western agents caught in East Berlin , traders in sovereign credit default swaps .
In the case of Greece , they even used the state intelligence services to do so .
( Sheesh , at least Germany only uses its Gestapo foreign intelligence appendages to track down tax evaders ) .
Perhaps lies , damn lies and GDP statistics eventually burn holes in silver curtains , when the painted over rust that is a Farcist economy can no longer support its own weight .
Until then , however , you must realize that you actually have no idea how much something in a Farcist market is actually worth .
For a moment , just a brief moment this week , the silver curtain seemed at least translucent in the United Kingdom .
Some days ago , carefully after the shadow of Gordon Brown seemed sure to recede , Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King made several simply astounding pronouncements prompting Jeremy Warner at the Telegraph to Headline " Free At Last " .
With crooked finger King pointed at the United States , shattering for a precious moment the illusion that letters like AAA should appear on the same page with the words United States or United Kingdom .
But even as the ripples in the pond undulated , the forces of Farcism , reeling for just a moment , seemed to collect themselves and reassert their dominance .
I do not want to comment on a particular measure by a particular country , but I do want to suggest that within the Euro Area it ’s become very clear that there is a need for a fiscal union to make the Monetary Union work .
Read : Euro wide tax and spend authority .
Act III , The Chase Scene
Even the smallest cracks in the silver curtain may permit subjects in the United States to finally realize the extent and duration of the outright lies they have been subjected to by the Farcist political and regulatory classes .
It remains to be seen if these revelations will have any impact or if , in fact , the great power of Farcism ( denial ) will overcome enlightenment until utter collapse finally takes hold .
The fact is that , absent assumptions that strain the very fabric of space - time ( perhaps the United States will invent cheap fusion power and become an energy exporter to the world ?
Or will the massive deflation of such a discovery merely accelerate the debt collapse ? ) there is simply no math that results in a calculation whereby the United States can pay off its outstanding obligations .
The United States will not outgrow its debt .
The United States will not tax away its debt ( even marginal rates of 70 % and 80 % would not achieve this ) .
( " Mr. Obama , tear down this wall ! " seems unlikely to do much good . )
The United States almost certainly lacks the political will to austere away the debt ( to even balance the budget would require a 40 % across the board cut using the 2009 or 2010 baseline , a 30 % across the board cut using the 2011 baseline ... etc ) .
Even a Republican sweep is highly unlikely to bring out the required change .
Instead the country must , as Greece has , begin to pursue frantically any source of capital it can grasp at .
Taxes must not only increase , but broaden , and capture more and more of the economy .
In this connection , slipping into the unread health bill the requirement that 1099s be filed for effectively every single transaction in the country over $ 600 easily reminds one of Greece 's recent ban on cash transactions over € 1500 .
When a business buys a $ 1,000 used car , it will have to gather information on the seller and mail 1099s to the seller and the IRS .
When a small shop owner pays her rent , she will have to send a 1099 to the landlord and IRS .
And here too is a measure of the power of Farcism .
It seems to Americans impossible that their 401 ( k ) plans or IRAs might be the targets of sovereigns in the Final Chase scene .
" We would never let that happen ! "
Of course , they forget that outright seizure and forfeiture are the hallmarks of communism and fascism .
Farcism is hardly so crude .
The Farcist government does n't pass laws with overt seizure of retirement funds spelled out .
The Farcist government waits until midnight before slipping a small provision into the fast - tracked Child Protection and Education Act of 2011 that simply levies a corporate level tax on greedy retirement communities , the wealthy and exploitative licensed medical professionals who service them , slaps safety surcharges on the sale of each of those dangerous " ultra - light super compact electric vehicles , " ( read : Rascals ) , establishes a Homeland Security and border protection fee on all cruise tickets to the Bahamas , and establishes a surcharge on Kenny Rogers tickets .
This is Part I of a multi-part series on global rise of Farcism .
Part II " On the Pensioning of Roman Veterans " can be viewed here .
Szajba , which vaguely translates as “ something between madness and fury , ” attracts a young , well - coifed crowd with its airy ‘ 60s living - room - style ambience and vast selection of cocktails , showily mixed by an eager bar staff .
The walls are peppered with old American magazine advertisements and a plethora of vintage tabletop transistor radios .
Some of Wroclaw ’s best offerings are to be found only in dingier , more offbeat corners of the city .
Opened five years ago by a local painter , the sepia - toned Graciarnia Pub and Cafe is covered floor to ceiling in mid-century ephemera .
Billowing opera costumes , donated by thespian friends of the owner , hang in the bathrooms , and patrons can enjoy their vodka and apple juice cocktail  a Polish favorite  while sitting in antique wooden wardrobes or at sewing machine tables .
Tucked away on a darkened row of sex shops underneath a stretch of train tracks near the city center , you ’ll find Armine , a small , family - run Georgian restaurant with painted - on brick walls and mountain range murals that shake every few minutes as trains pass over the building .
But Armine ’s signature dishes , like red beans and fried nuts or beef sautéed with green beans and bell peppers , are so delicious you ’ll understand why Wroclaw ’s popular and charismatic mayor , Rafal Dutkiewicz , is rumored to make frequent visits .
Finding cheap , authentic Polish food in central Wroclaw is not as easy as one might like .
But if you do n’t mind listening to cheesy Polish pop radio and ordering your food in a fake thatched hut , Chatka at Jatkach in Old Town serves up well - prepared regional dishes , like ribs with fresh cut potatoes and sour cabbage , at very reasonable prices .
Swing around the corner to the tiny cobbled Stare Jatki , site of a 13th - century slaughterhouse , and browse old butcher stalls that have been converted into galleries and high - end souvenir shops .
Do n’t miss the local dwarf  a butcher , of course  or the cluster of miniature animal statues at the end of the street that graze next to a plaque inscribed , “ In honor of the slaughtered animals  from the consumers . ”
In recent years , Wroclaw ’s formerly neglected Old Jewish Quarter , with Wlodkowica street as its anchor , has become one of the city ’s hippest neighborhoods , thanks largely to the work of Bente Kahan , a Jewish - Norwegian singer who serves as founding artistic director of the Jewish Cultural and Education center of the White Stork , the city ’s only remaining synagogue .
Designing an Infographic with HTML , CSS & jQuery
Learn how to design an infographic with HTML , CSS and jQuery , by following this easy , step by step tutorial .
Check it out and start learning !
I ’ve been wanting to get stuck into a creative infographic for quite some time , so recently I started work on a personal project that involved the design and build of a graphic to portray the stats and figures of Line25 .
To mix things up a little and to take it a step further , I decided to have a shot at building the whole infographic as a complete web page .
Here ’s a walkthrough of the project , showing how resources like Cufon and jQuery ’s ScrollTo plugin were used to add some flair and interactivity to the design .
The concept
View the infographic
The design itself was put together in Adobe Illustrator using a bunch of Line25 stats .
A limited colour palette was used to stay true to traditional infographic designs like airplane safety cards , with a couple of blues , greens and greys making up the scheme for the design .
Large typography was one of the main ingredients , with League Gothic being the perfect fit with its tall and bold appearance .
Charts , diagrams and icons also make up large portions of the design , all aiming to add interest to the otherwise boring facts and figures .
With the idea of building a web page out of the design in mind , I bundled in some large margins and gaps between the sections , the idea being that the jQuery ScrollTo plugin could make for some cool interactive scrolling .
Swirly lines and gradients in these areas would add some visual flair as the browser window zooms past .
The basic webpage
Once the overall design concept was complete , the basic information was laid out in plain old HTML .
Paragraphs of text and headings were used where possible to allow the majority of the design to be rendered by the browser , then it was all styled up with CSS one section at a time .
Intro section
< div id =" intro " > < h1 > The stats behind < span> Line25</ span></h1 > < p
> The LINE25 web design blog by Chris Spooner is home to a range of posts that aim to provide ideas and inspiration to web creatives .
At just over one year old it ’s already amassed a wealth of stats and figures .
Sit back and take a look behind the scenes .
</ p> < p class = " btn " >< a href= " #section1 " >
Continue</a></p> </div>
# intro { background : url( images / section - 1.png ) 0 485 px no-repeat ; padding : 0 0 1102px 0 ; margin : 0 0 0 100 px ; } #intro h1 { font - size : 78 px ; color : # c0d8f1 ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 0 0 25 px 0 ; } #intro h1 span { display : block ; width : 625 px ; height : 188 px ; margin : 8px 0 0 0 ; background : url ( images / line25.png ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; } #intro p { width : 850 px ; font - size : 28 px ; color : # c0d8f1 ; } #intro p.btn a { display : block ; width : 128 px ; height : 128 px ; background : url( images / down-btn.jpg ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; float : right ; margin : 160 px - 3px 0 0 ; }
The intro section consists of a short header , the Line25 logo , intro paragraph and the first button element .
The background of the design was added as a background image to the intro < div > , and plenty of padding added to replicate the large portions of white space .
The heading is configured in size and colour , with the < span > coming in handy for some image replacement as the Line25 logo .
Section one
< div id =" section1 " > < h2 class= " march2009 " > March 2009 </ h2 > < h2 class =" launched " >
Line25 is launched </ h2 > < p
>
On its first day , Line25 brought in 1,750 visitors .
One year later in March 2010 , the average daily visitor rate has grown to 5,572 .</p> < img src=" images/graph.png " alt = " Graph displaying visitor count from March 2009 and March 2010 " /> < h2 class= " average " >
On average each month , there are : </ h2 > < dl > < dt>9</dt > < dd> New posts</dd > < dt>299</dt > < dd> New comments</dd > < dt>4,378</dt > < dd> New subscribers</dd > < dt>39,205</dt > < dd> Visits</dd > < dt>82,072</dt > < dd> Pageviews</dd > </dl > </div >
# section1 { margin : 0 0 0 100 px ; } #section1 h2.launched { font - size : 154 px ; color : # c0d8f1 ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 0 0 15px 0 ; } #section1 h2.march2009 { width : 858 px ; height : 398 px ; margin : - 21 px 0 30px 0 ; background : url( images / march-2009.png ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; } #section1 p { width : 850 px ; margin : - 25 px 0 45 px 0 ; font - size : 37 px ; line - height : 47 px ; color : # a7a9 ac ; } #section1 img { margin : 0 0 45 px 0 ; } #section1 h2.average { font - size : 82 px ; color : # c0d8f1 ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 0 0 15 px 0 ; } #section1 dl { overflow : hidden ; margin : 0 0 100 px 0 ; } #section1 dl dt { width : 360 px ; float : left ; clear : left ; font - size : 130 px ; color : # c1e6e9 ; text - transform : uppercase ; text - align : right ; margin : 0 0 5px 0 ; } #section1 dl dd { float : left ; * float : none ; /* Quick and dirty IE7 fix */ font - size : 70 px ; color : # c0d8f1 ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 43 px 0 0 25 px ; }
After a short scroll section one begins with a simple graphic , followed by paragraph text which introduces the first chart .
The large lists of facts and figures fits perfectly as a definition list , with the two pieces of related information being marked up as either < dt > or < dd > .
Section two
< div id =" section2 " > < h2 class = " total " >
In total < span > ( as of May 2010 ) </ span > , that 's ...</ h2 > < p class= " btn total " >< a href= " #stats " >
Continue </a></p> [...] < h2 class=" categories " >
The 126 posts are split into 4 categories :</ h2 > < img src=" images/pie-chart.png " alt =
" Pie chart displaying posts per category " /> < p class = " btn continue " >< a href= " #user " >
Continue </a></p> </div>
#section2 { background : # 476079 url( images/swirls.png ) 220 px 210 px no-repeat ; padding : 75 px 0 50 px 100 px ; } # section2 h2.total { font - size : 82 px ; color : # fff ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 0 0 2362px 0 ; float : left ; } #section2 h2.total span { font - size : 55 px ; } #section2 p.btn.total a { display : block ; width : 128 px ; height : 128 px ; background : url( images / down-btn.jpg ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; float : left ; margin : - 32px 0 0 10 px ; } [...] # section2 h2.categories { font - size : 82 px ; color : # fff ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 0 0 150px 0 ; } #section2 img { margin : 0 0 150px 0 ; } #section2 p.btn.continue a { display : block ; width : 128 px ; height : 128 px ; background : url( images / down-btn.jpg ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; margin : 0 0 0 415 px ; }
Section two switches from a grey background to a dark blue , and starts with a short title and swirly pattern graphic before heading down to the meaty information lower down .
This graphic is added as a background image to the section2 < div > and lots of padding added to bump down the content .
Classes on each title allows the sizing to be altered to adhere to the original design .
Section three
< div id =" section3 " > < h2 class = " user " id =" user " >
The average Line25 user ...</ h2 > < ul > < li class= " firefox " >
Uses Firefox < / li > < li class = " pc " > Has a PC < / li > < li class = " time " > Browses for 1:39 < / li > < li class = " usa " >
Lives in the USA < / li > < li class= " awesome " >
Is awesome </ li > </ul > < img src=" images/thankyou.png " alt = " Thank You , The End " /> < h3 > Again ?</h3 > < p class = " btn " >< a href= " # intro " > Back to top</a></p> </div>
#section3 { background : # c1e6e9 url( images/gradient.jpg ) repeat-x ; padding : 4100 px 0 200 px 100 px ; overflow : hidden ; } # section3 h2.user { font - size : 120 px ; color : # 476079 ; text - transform : uppercase ; margin : 0 0 100px 0 ; padding : 100px 0 0 0 ; } #section3 ul { width : 534 px ; height : 1135 px ; padding : 75 px 0 200 px 600 px ; background : url( images/user - bg.png ) no-repeat ; } #section3 ul li { list - style : none ; height : 60 px ; padding : 40 px 0 30 px 130 px ; margin : 0 0 106px 0 ; font - size : 70 px ; color : # 476079 ; text - transform : uppercase ; } # section3 ul li.firefox { background : url( images / firefox - icon.png ) left no -repeat ; } #section3 ul li.pc { background : url ( images / pc-icon.png ) left no -repeat ; } #section3 ul li.time { background : url( images / clock-icon.png ) left no -repeat ; } #section3 ul li.usa { background : url( images/usa-icon.png ) left no -repeat ; } #section3 ul li.awesome { background : url( images /awesome-icon.png ) left no -repeat ; } # section3 img { margin : 0 0 100px 0 ; } #section3 h3 { font - size : 70 px ; color : # 476079 ; text - transform : uppercase ; float : left ; margin : 0 0 0 830 px ; } #section3 p.btn a { display : block ; width : 115 px ; height : 115 px ; float : left ; margin : - 30 px 0 0 10 px ; background : url ( images /top- btn.png ) ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; }
Section three begins after another short scroll which transitions from the dark blue background to mint green .
This section presents information overlaid over a graphic , which is set as the background of a < ul > and the information itself marked up as < li > elements .
Classes on each < li > make it easy to attach icon graphics alongside each title , and margins align up each list item between the dotted area of the background image .
Entire HTML in summary
Javascript coolness
A couple of simple Javascript resources quickly add some extra coolness to the design .
Firstly we have Cufon , which allows us to bring the League Gothic font from the concept into the web based design .
Then there ’s the implementation of jQuery and the handy ScrollTo plugin which adds all the fancy page scrolling functionality we need .
< script src="js/jquery.js " type = " text / javascript " ></ script > < script src="js/cufon.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script src="js/League_Gothic_400.font.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script src="js/jquery.scrollTo.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script src="js/scripts.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
In total there ’s five Javascript files ; the jQuery library ; the Cufon script ; a Cufon generated font file for League Gothic ; the ScollTo plugin for jQuery ; and finally my own scripts file for activating and configuring all the Javascript functionality .
To activate League Gothic on the appropriate HTML elements , they ’re inserted into the scripts file like so :
Cufon.replace ( 'h1 , h2 , h3 , dl , ul ' ) ;
As for the scrolling , I already added anchor links to the relevant element IDs in the HTML , so to implement auto - scrolling , the ScrollTo plugin is activated :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " p.btn a " ) .click ( function ( ) { $ .scrollTo( $ ( this ) .attr ( " href " ) , 1000 ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
Rather than write commands for every button , I targeted the ‘ btn ’ anchor , then used .attr ( " href " ) to grab the target from that particular anchor .
return false ; then stops the original HTML anchor link from working .
The final design
So here it is , the final result of my little experiment !

The problem is not merely that holders of Greek government debt would dump their investments , or even that they would ditch their Spanish and Portuguese bonds while they were at it .
It is that government debt is the very bedrock of the financial system : should Greek government bonds collapse , the country 's banking system would become insolvent overnight .
In fact , banks throughout the euro area would be at risk , given that they tend to hold so much of their neighbours ' government debt .
That , at least , is the theory , but as was the case in the aftermath of Lehman 's collapse , no one really knows how great their exposure is .

Introduction
Two years ago I had an itch that needed scratching .
“ RIA ” was the future of the web and every major company seemed to have a solution to get us there .
I developed the first version of GUIMark to not only get a good understanding of the respective technologies , but also to give my clients through EffectiveUI and everyone else something to actively gauge the rendering performance of the different runtimes .
After releasing it I got a good response from both the tech community as well as several platform engineers interested in resolving problems .
There were however two serious flaws in the test that immediately stood out .
First , the test was relying too heavily on text layout performance .
I was barely engaging the the vector and bitmap side of the rendering engines .
Secondly , the test was too artificial and developers have a tendency of resisting optimizing apis against unrecognizable test cases .
Evolution
Fast forward to today and the web is a different beast .
Attempt to shine a positive light on a plugin technology and you will be booed off the stage .
Create something fun and silly in HTML5 and you ’ll have hundreds of thousands of visitors pounding down the front door of your blog to speculate on the death of Flash .
It ’s undeniable that a new anchor technology is taking root in the web space , and needless to say I ’ve got a new itch to scratch .
GUIMark 2
Like the first GUIMark , this new benchmark is designed for one sole purpose , to burn a hole in your CPU .
I still believe that by completely saturating the rendering pipeline , we can get a better idea of which technologies are best suited for running interactive content on the web .
Developers tend to focus primarily on the speed of the programming language itself , when in reality , most of your cpu time is spent inside internal rendering APIs .
I also firmly believe that any benchmark testing rendering performance should stick to sub 60 fps numbers .
Almost all users on the web today are browsing with 60 Hz LCD monitors and there ’s no reason to design a test that has to throw away frame data .
While the new benchmark sticks to the original in theory , this version introduces some much needed changes .
First , I ’ve split GUIMark into 3 separate tests : Vector , Bitmap , and Text rendering , and I ’ve attempted to make the test cases as real world as possible .
Second , I ’ve only implemented these tests in HTML5 and Flash .
I ’m not opposed to adding Silverlight and JavaFX to the benchmark , it ’s just that I did n’t have the time to build them right now and something tells me a much smaller percentage of the internet crowd is interested in those results anyway .
( Feel free to flame me in the comments section for that one ) .
Lastly , I ’ve added mobile versions of some of the tests , we ’ve all heard inflammatory statements from certain CEOs about mobile web performance , let ’s see if the numbers back that up .
Enough already , on to the results .
Test environment
All of the tests below were performed on a 15 ″ unibody Macbook Pro with a 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and an NVIDIA GeForce 9400 m .
On the Mac side I ’m running Snow Leopard with Flash player 10.0.45.2 installed .
On the PC side I have Windows 7 32 bit with Aero turned on and again with Flash player 10.0.45.2 .
For Linux I ran a Linux Mint 8 Live CD with Firefox and Flash player 10.0.45.2 .
Unfortunately running off the Live CD meant no access to Nvidia drivers .
Vector Charting Test
This benchmark is designed to stress the vector apis by simulating a streaming stock chart .
The test makes heavy use of strokes with complex alpha fills .
Originally I had added gradient fills into the mix to make sure that a good majority of vector APIs were being flexed , but there was no significant difference in the results so I pulled them out to make the visuals cleaner .
While the source may appear to be heavy on the javascript side , the actual speed of code excluding canvas draw calls is less then 1 millisecond .

* Safari on Windows 7 will not animate the chart , it will only render one frame each time I press down on my mouse button .
Results are all over the place for this test .
On the HTML5 side Opera delivers the best performance on both platforms .
Flash on the PC is consistently high , but on OS X , Chrome takes the top spot .
Linux pulls off great numbers despite running off a Live CD .
HTML5 on the Mac side requires closer inspection though .
When I first made the test and showed it to my co-worker John Blanco , he started ripping apart the code to find any mistakes I might have made .
What he discovered was that by changing the stroke size on my lines from 2 pixels to 1 pixel , performance in Safari , Firefox and Chrome shot up to rates closer to Flash , while Opera stayed at the exact same FPS .
1 Pixel Stroke Results Safari – 23.59 fps Firefox – 17.43 fps Chrome – 17.12 fps Opera – 12.12 fps
Flash on the Mac , as well as HTML5 and Flash on PC were largely unaffected by this change though , gaining maybe a single frame rate by changing to 1 pixel strokes .
I ’m not sure what to make of these findings .
What kind of bug causes this and what side effects might be introduced by fixing it ?
Will a change allow both 1 and 2 pixel strokes to run at higher speeds , or will they both settle somewhere near Operas numbers .
Bitmap Gaming Test
The bitmap test was designed to simulate a tower defense type game .
The test stresses pushing around lots of bitmap assets that animate each frame .
The entire rectangle view needs to be cleared each frame to account for all the changes happening in the scene .
The test supports a minimal amount of z depth ordering but not so much as to cause user scripts to take more then 1 millisecond to execute .
Both environments are using anti-aliasing to scale the bitmap images .

* Safari on PC again only renders one frame per mousedown event , so the results are impossible to verify .
These results are really surprising .
Chrome on OS X manages to push Flash higher then even Windows based browsers .
I was so surprised I ended up rebooting and running the test again just to make sure something was n’t wrong .
We ’re starting to see a trend where HTML5 on average runs slower for Canvas based animations and I ’ll explain why a bit further below .
Linux takes a huge performance hit in this test but the percentage difference mirrors the other platforms exactly .
With Nvidia drivers I ’d imagine the real numbers would be closer to Mac performance .
Text Column Test
This test is designed to push the text layout and rendering engine in HTML and Flash .
The test utilizes custom fonts introduced with CSS3 as well as multibyte character string .
This is my least favorite test in the group because it does n’t simulate any real world test cases , however it should provide a good estimate of how quickly a page full of text can be calculated .
I call it the “ iceberg ” test since 80 % of the hit on the CPU happens outside the renderable view .
It works because although text that overflows outside the textblock does n’t get rendered , it does have to get calculated in order to know how many lines of text can be scrolled .
HTML pages do this all the time when you load a site with text below the fold .

* Safari continues to show problems on PC .
Safari reports 30 fps but it looks like it ’s running at 10 fps .
I ’ve included the results but they ’re really wrong .
* Internet Explorer renders the view , but is unable to display the custom fonts .
* Chrome on both platforms is unable to render the Jedi custom font .
I did n’t have time to investigate whether the super slow PC performance in Flash is my fault or Adobe ’s , but I expect that will be uncovered soon enough .
As for the general differences between HTML and Flash in the text test , this is exactly what I was expecting .
HTML was built for text rendering and this is further proof that browsers do this best .
GUIMark Mobile
The Vector and Bitmap tests have been ported into miniature forms to test on mobile devices with a minimum resolution of 320×480 .
This is the area I imagine will see a lot of updates over the next 6 months .
I ’ve ordered the results by the release date of each phone tested .

Two phones running the Flash player is n’t conclusive evidence about Flash ’s performance in general in the mobile space , but it does cast immediate doubts on claims that Flash is slow on ARM based smart phones .
Meanwhile , if you want the best performance in HTML5 based web content , Palm Pre and Nexus One are sitting at the top of the pile .
If you have results you ’d like to see added to the chart , you can email results to mech {at} craftymind dot com .
What about video comparison ?
I had really hoped to add a video test to this benchmark but I quickly found out there ’s no reliable way to record rendering performance for video objects .
As far as I can tell , HTML5 video does n’t provide an api to catch frame dropping events , or a way to determine the playback fps .
Blindly running a Timer object on the main thread did n’t seem to help either .
At that point I did n’t even bother seeing what hurdles Flash had to testing playback .
Parsing the Results
I imagine half of the people reading this page will have one of two thoughts at this point , “ Who cares if HTML5 is slower , I just want Flash to die ” and “ HTML5 is still brand new , it ’s going to get a lot faster ” .
While I ’m not interested in addressing the first point , developers should have context around the second point .
There is a fundamental difference between the rendering models used in HTML5 Canvas and Flash which heavily influence the performance divide .
The difference is , Canvas uses an immediate mode renderer while Flash uses a retained mode renderer .
When you write a line of javascript that draws a vector or bitmap to a Canvas the browser will immediately render that change before moving on to the next line of javascript .
Since the browser has to block that line of javascript while rendering , it means the environment is most efficient when running on a single thread .
Text rendering on the other hand occurs at the end of the event loop , behaving more like Flash .
In contrast , Flash commits all renderable changes to an internal store , and after the main event loop finishes processing user code it hands out rendering tasks to all available cores .
As a result , Flash scales with both the speed of your processor cores and the number of cores available .
Here ’s an illustration to better understand .
Theoretically you might achieve twice the performance in Flash on a dual core system , but in practice there is overhead that you need to take into account like z ordering , bounds checking and re-compositing , and dividing tasks between cores is never perfect .
All of this might not seem like a big deal to HTML5 developers , but the truth is the next 10 years are going to be dominated by increases to cpu core count , not single threaded execution speed .
You can already see the results of this on a quad core i7 2.67 GHz processor .
Windows 7 Firefox 3.6.3 HTML5 Bitmap Game – 6.07 fps Flash 10 Bitmap Game – 30.1 fps
HTML5 Canvas performance saw virtually no increase jumping to 4 cores , while Flash performance nearly doubled .
Without a major shift in execution processing , Javascript based animations and interactions are going to remain stagnate over the coming years .
Unfortunately I do n’t see that change coming .
All the talks of multithreading coming from browser vendors right now is between the browser interface and the html view , but not the HTML rendering model .
HTML5 video is largely exempt from this problem however .
While the video api exposes hooks to the main thread for playback control , all rendering and sound is processed under the hood on secondary threads .
As a result , media performance increases with GPU and CPU cores .
TL;DR
There is no doubt that HTML5 adoption will grow significantly in the next 2 years , and that more and more content will be targeted to SVG and Canvas implementations .
But developers need to be cautious with adopting one technology or another wholesale .
HTML5 may not be fast , but it is proficient at a good amount of tasks .
If you need static or limited interactive content on your website , HTML5 will soon be your best option .
If you need complex interactive content , you ’re probably better targeting Flash .
As for me , you ’ll find me abusing the hell out of both technologies and posting the results to this blog .
In the meantime , if you want the best HTML5 performance on Windows , you should be using Opera right now .
On the Mac side , it ’s a tossup depending on the type of content you ’re interacting with .
If you ’re looking for good Flash performance on Windows any browser will do , whereas on the Mac side Chrome is clearly outperforming everyone else .
The sources for each test should be linked within the test itself if you want to peruse the code .
I tried to make sure everything could be contained to one file whenever possible and not rely on external dependencies .
You can download all the fonts and tower defense assets here .
If you find any errors with the results , or feel like taking a stab at testing another technology , feel free to email me at mech {at} craftymind dot com .
Flame on !
Updates
10/05/07 – As I should have assumed , quite a few people have started sending in updated tests with their own levels of optimizations .
I want to be very clear on certain improvements , the purpose of these benchamarks is to stress the graphics APIs available to developers , not cancel them out .
An optimization that affects both platforms equally ( like caching the grid lines behind the charting test ) does n’t further the goal of exposing how efficient the two platforms are internally .
If you have a unique optimization that can only be applied to one platform and not the other , please let me know and I ’ll try to incorporate the change and retest .
10/05/09 – Changed some language on the rendering model for HTML5 .
Canvas paints immediately , standard text paints at the end of the event loop
Budget night is always a major event in the Australian calendar .
While Anzac Day has the historical resonance , Australia Day has the celebratory atmosphere , and Schoolies Week has the rampant date rape , Budget Night is different .
Budget night is the night when Australians everywhere , no matter what their race , creed or colour , are united in their firm belief that the Government should be giving them more money .
Just why and how the Government should be giving this money , though , is well beyond the ken of the average Australian .
Life is hard enough , what with mortgages and private school fees and deceitful MasterChef dishes , without having to wade through the budget and unpick every miserly injustice and fiscal disgrace .
This is why we have budget analysts to do it for you .
And in particular , this is why newmatilda.com now presents my " Handy , Time - Saving 2010 Budget Guide for Ordinary , Stupid Australians " .
I am here to provide you with all the information you need to make sound financial whingeing noises .
Here we go .
What kind of Budget was it ?
As Treasurer Wayne Swan made clear , it was a " no - frills " budget .
In other words , unlike previous budgets that were filled with frivolous bells , shiny whistles and extravagant thingamajigs , this one was filled with strict discipline , calm efficiency , and noble restraint .
Not for Swan the 1997 budget , in which Peter Costello promised every adult male a free poodle ; or the 1989 budget , in which Paul Keating stood on the balcony of Parliament House tossing diamonds to the crowd below .
No , there was none of that sort of reckless profligacy .
There was extra money for health , with a pledge to build 23 more GP super - clinics , which at the current rate may well be completed prior to the melting of the polar ice caps ; there was also a boost to funding for elite athletes , which came as a great relief to all those " Aussie battlers " who had been fearing the global financial crisis might cause us a certain amount of embarrassment on the archery range .
But overall , it was a conservative budget , aimed squarely at keeping spending in check , boosting revenue , and returning to surplus in that nasty , stingy way that politicians have when they take all your money and then refuse to give it back .
What ’s in the Budget for me ?
That ’s fairly hard to answer without knowing who you are .
Let us assume I am a middle - aged white male with an income between $ 40,000 and $ 60,000 and a strong sense of entitlement .
Then the Budget does not leave you completely empty - handed .
You will get a tax cut that will leave you about $ 9 per week better off — easily enough to cover a weekly breakfast at Hungry Jack ’s — and tax on interest on your savings will be cut .
Also , you will be able to call a 24 - hour hotline to find a doctor in your area at any time .
This will come as an enormous help to the burgeoning and increasingly politically active nightclub - brawler demographic .
As Nicola Roxon put it , " This means knowing that your loved ones can get the care they need . "
You yourself will not be entitled to any care , but your loved ones are all set .
Should you have no loved ones , the Government will assign you some .
Will the budget help the country achieve fiscal solvency ?
Indeed it will .
Having last year spent such massive lashings of cash that the Opposition stated confidently that the deficit was just a few pennies away from taking on physical form and devouring peasants , it was a nice surprise to learn that in fact , the budget will return to surplus within just three years .
This is conclusive proof that Wayne Swan is not just a sweat patch searching for a shirt to stain ; he also knows about money and owns a calculator , or knows someone who does .
What part will the brand new " super- profits " tax play in Australia ’s economic future ?
The new Resource Super Profits Tax ( or " RSPT " ) is a major plank in the hardwood floor of the Government ’s fiscal policy .
It will bring in $ 3 billion in its first year , and $ 9 billion per year after that , thanks to Australia ’s bountiful natural mineral wealth .
The downside , of course , is that it will cause all the mining companies to leave the country .
" Take your mineral wealth and shove it , " seems to be the miners ’ attitude at present .
The trouble with the Government is that it has neglected the number one rule of economics : nobody will want to make money if they ca n’t make more money than they otherwise might have made .
All economists know that corporations , at heart , are proud , haughty creatures .
They are happy to exploit resources and earn massive profits as long as they are treated with respect , but they would rather have no profits at all than have to stump up big chunks of them for the good of a bunch of lazy little proles who ca n’t even summon up the initiative to build an open - cut mine , let alone charge hyper - inflated prices to huge Chinese steel mills for the products of it .
If this RSPT is brought in , it seems inevitable that the companies will run off to Indonesia or Sudan or Ibiza or something , and all those minerals will just sit in the ground , undug and unloved .
So it is probably best that we try to ignore the seductive riches that Swan , the wily old spiv , is promising us , and listen instead to Tony Abbott , who describes the RSPT as just " a great big new tax " .
Mind you , Abbott describes everything as a " great big new tax " , including the emissions trading scheme , the company tax , the Medicare levy , and Julia Gillard ’s hairdo .
It ’s part of his programming .
But that does n’t mean he ’s wrong .
How much of my hard - earned money will go to keep illegal queue - jumping economic pseudo - refugee terrorists living in the lap of luxury ?
A massive amount — over $ 1 billion over the next 12 months .
This amount would come down , of course , were the Government to institute a few simple commonsense measures , like taking away the asylum seekers ’ minibar privileges , or reducing the size of the marching bands employed to welcome each boat to the country ; but the Government refuses to do this because it is in thrall to the powerful and malevolent asylum seeker lobby .
Is the Opposition in favour of the 2010 Budget ?
It is not .
Surprisingly , in light of the many positives outlined by Wayne Swan , the Opposition seems reluctant to give unqualified support to Labor ’s plans .
Shadow Treasurer and Chief Ogre Joe Hockey , in particular , was scathing , describing the Budget as " built on quicksand " , a dangerous scenario indeed , given that this means the more the Budget struggles , the faster it will sink .
The Opposition has pledged that if it is elected , it will immediately place the Budget on its back , and gradually move it forward until it can grab hold of a strong vine or tree branch .
Hockey also made the point that the Government was basing its Budget on shaky assumptions , which is quite true .
The Government is assuming , for example , that China will continue wanting our iron ore and coal ; that smokers will keep buying cigarettes even though they are in ugly boxes ; that Kevin Rudd will not get drunk and shove the education budget down a stripper ’s underpants ; and so on .
Dangerous assumptions indeed , and yet the Opposition ’s refusal to back the Government does seem a little churlish .
Just for once , you ’d think they could be good sports about things .
What is the opinion of distinguished News Ltd business commentator Terry McCrann ?
McCrann has quite clearly stated that not only is this the worst Budget ever devised , a horrific grab - bag of over - taxing , over - spending , and wild speculation , but that he has conclusive evidence that the Prime Minister was long ago driven insane by congenital syphilis , and is even now plotting to have us all shot so he can steal our fillings and mould them into a gigantic statue of himself .
McCrann also makes the point that the National Broadband Network is an underhand scheme to turn us all gay with gamma rays , and that Wayne Swan is the true identity of Jack the Ripper .
Am I still in danger of being killed by insulation ?
No .
The Budget earmarks funds for fixing the insulation fiasco , which means Peter Garrett will be forced to kill you with his bare hands .
Why ca n’t we hear the opinions of ordinary Australians whose lives are directly affected by the Budget ?
Because they are mouth - breathing morons who say stupid things like , " There should be more money for childcare , " or " I ’d like to see more done to support small businesspeople . "
Really , they should all be rounded up and herded into pens , where they can be used to provide energy for important commentators in the media .
No , there are no frills in this budget , no gaudy baubles to distract the eye .
Just a long - term plan to make sure Australia carries on towards tomorrow with strength and confidence .
You may not have gotten much in the budget yourself , but thanks to the deeper understanding of the issues you have gained from pundits like me and Alan " Sex Bomb " Kohler , you can sleep soundly at night knowing that the money you did n’t receive is even now hard at work opening up hospital beds in rural areas , topping up the superannuation of low - income workers , and most importantly of all , buying thick , fluffy towels for Stephanie Rice .
It ’s fiscal discipline we can believe in .
Onward to prosperity , Australia !
Sempre che capiscano qualcosa , perché si calcola che ad ogni traduzione si perda in media il 30 per cento del significato .
Che sia una prerogativa dei più " meritevoli " ottenere lo scranno europeo senza sapere questo idioma né tantomeno studiarlo una volta eletto ?
Misteri della meritocrazia nazionale , tanto osannata ma ancor più evasa ; che ci stiano prendendo per il cubo ?
Ebbene , anche in questa mandata elettorale , come nella quasi totalità delle precedenti , pur sentendo elencata quotidianamente l'importanza del turismo nei conteggi erariali , sociali , lavorativi nonché in quelli definiti come indispensabili per la rispresa economica nazionale che stà attraversando un momento di grave crisi , appare uno ( 1 ) solo , ripeto uno ( 1 ) che abbia conoscenze del settore ; Franco Bonanini se sarà eletto ma invece non mancano ... 25 ( venticinque ) candidati con conflitto d'interessi .
Anche nel Parlamento europeo esiste la commissione turismo e quindi immagino colei / ui che dovrà farne parte , le smorfie di dolore psicologico al sentir menzionare di classificazioni , esami , relazioni , proposte , ordini , discussioni , processi , testi , verbali , progetti , osservatori e ricerche Hotrec , direttive turistiche che si trascinano da decenni , WTO , WEF e tanto altro di probabilmente incomprensibile ; è pur vero che l ’Italia non è apprezzata per la sua capacità industriale e per la credibilità di quello che dice ; ma se a questi italiani piace così , a me no !
Ma veniamo alla lista del PD a cui faranno naturalmente seguito le liste degli altri partiti :

Per questioni di Par Condicio eccovi gli elenchi dei candidati alle prossime elezioni europee 2009 dove anche nella remota ipotesi che vi sia qualcuno di professionalmente preparato in campo turistico , cosa di cui non credo affatto , questo sarà impossibilitato ad essere eletto per motivi di raggiungimento quorum ma soprattutto , perché le prime posizioni sono ad appannaggio dei politici che ‘ tanto conoscono ’ questo settore .

When unemployment ticks higher in the months ahead , and people start freaking out about a dying recovery , remind this :
WaPo :
Some economists assert that the unemployment rate , which held steady at 9.7 percent in March , is likely to be driven higher as many more such people are lured into looking for work by signs of recovery .
The number of people looking for jobs rose by more than 200,000 last month compared with February , according to the Economic Policy Institute -- and that 's a good sign , economists say .
It means that Americans are seeing more jobs being created and that they 're optimistic about their prospects .
But the supply of new jobs -- 162,000 in March , the biggest monthly increase in three years -- will accommodate only a fraction of the unemployed .
Thus from the perspective of the individual job seeker , it'd be far better if the discouraged stay home .
A New Great Wall
One of the truly great war correspondents , a monumental figure who reported from Afghanistan for 20 years and won almost every literary prize offered in Italy ; a humanistic French - Tunisian scholar who has sought a middle way between Islam and secularism ; an Eritrean writer whose epic saga of his country ’s troubled history subverts both official versions , the Ethiopian and the American .
They are some of the most important voices in the world today , honored intellectuals in their own countries .
You ’re not likely to have heard of Ettore Mo , Abdelwahab Meddeb , or Alemseged Tesfai , however , because they are rarely translated into English .
In the English - speaking world , in fact , major publishing houses are inexplicably resistant to any kind of translated material at all .
The statistics are shocking in this age of so - called globalization :
In the United States and Britain , only 2 to 3 percent of books published each year are translations , compared with almost 35 percent in Latin America and Western Europe .
Horace Engdahl , then the secretary of the Swedish Academy , chided the United States in 2008 for its literary parochialism : " The U.S. is too isolated , too insular .
They do n’t translate enough and do n’t really participate in the big dialogue of literature . "
But this is no mere national embarrassment :
The dearth of translated literature in the English - speaking world represents a new kind of iron curtain we have constructed around ourselves .
We are choosing to block off access to the writing of a large and significant portion of the world , including movements and societies whose potentially dreadful political impact on us is made even more menacing by our general lack of familiarity with them .
Our stubborn and willful ignorance could have — and arguably , already has had — dangerous consequences .
The problem starts in the Anglophone publishing industry , where translated books are not only avoided but actively discouraged .
They can be commercially successful ( think of the cachet enjoyed in the United States by The Name of the Rose , The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , or anything by Roberto Bolaño ) , and still most U.S. and British publishers resist the very idea of translation .
Some years ago , a senior editor at a prestigious house told me that he could not even consider taking on another translation because he already had two on his list .
Publishers have their excuses , of course .
A persistent but not very convincing explanation is that English - language readers are , for some reason , put off by translations .
This is nothing but a publishing shibboleth that leads to a chicken - and - egg conundrum :
Is a limited readership for translations the reason so few are published in the Anglophone world ?
Or is that readership limited because English - language publishers provide their readers with so few translations ?
Certainly , the number of readers of literature — in any language — is on the decline , and serious , dedicated editors face real difficulties bringing good books to the marketplace .
But that is not the fault of translation .
And ignoring literature in translation in no way helps solve the problem .
On the contrary , we need to ask what we forfeit as readers and as a society if we lose access to translated literature by voluntarily reducing its presence in our community or quietly standing by as it is drastically and arbitrarily curtailed .
The crisis in translation does not hurt only English - speaking readers — it affects everyone who cares about knowledge worldwide .
For one , the English - language market is immense and generally located in areas where the population tends to be literate and prosperous enough to purchase books .
Then , too , a truism has it that a body of work must be translated into English before a writer can even be considered for the Nobel Prize in literature because it is claimed , perhaps with reason , that ours is the only language all the judges read .
Even more significant may be the fact that English often serves as the linguistic bridge for the translation of a book into a number of Asian and African languages .
For a book written in Spanish to enter the enormous potential market of China , for example , it must often be translated into English first .
By limiting English translation , we ’re turning off a spigot that flows not just to us but to the rest of the world as well .
Most important , we confront a hovering and constant threat to civil liberties as we reduce the number of translations we publish .
The free exchange of literary ideas , insights , and intuitions — a basic reciprocity of thought facilitated by the translation of works from other cultures — is central to a free society .
Dictators know this :
They place tremendous importance on language , how it is used , to what end , and by whom .
Imprisoned writers , banned books , censored media , restrictions on translations , even repeated attempts to abolish what are called " minority " languages are all clear indications that tyrannies take language , books , and access to information and ideas very seriously .
Democracies have an obligation to take these matters even more seriously — and at the moment , the English - speaking world is failing in that task .
It may well be that in the best of all possible worlds — the one that predates the construction of the Tower of Babel — all humans were able to communicate with all other humans and the function of translators was quite literally unthinkable .
But here we are in a world whose shrinking store of languages comes to roughly 6,000 , a world where isolationism and rampaging nationalism are on the rise and countries are beginning to erect actual as well as metaphorical walls around themselves .
I do not believe I am overstating the case when I say that translation can be , for readers as well as writers , one of the ways past a menacing babble of incomprehensible tongues and closed frontiers into mutual comprehension .
It is not a possibility we can safely turn our backs on .
As far as level selection .
The arrow keys , Z , Space , R , C and Enter wont let me start .

THE HAGGLER asked readers to send their favorite techniques and stratagems for prevailing in consumer disputes , and let ’s just say you came through .
Loud and clear .
And in very large numbers , with some rather novel ideas .
If anything , a few of these ideas were a little too — what is the word ? — proactive for the Haggler .
Several of you recommended suing in small claims court , which turns out to be a pretty effective way to get the attention of just about any corporation .
Apparently , they tend to surrender once the case is filed , or skip the court date .
Max Davies of Orlando , Fla. , reports that he still gets a thrill remembering the day he called an airline he ’d sued to say that a county sheriff would “ impound one of their jets ” if the company did n’t pay the $ 800 judgment he ’d won in court .
( He was bluffing , but it worked . )
Another reader claims occasional success screaming a vivid and succinct obscenity at the automated voice in phone trees .
( “ It sounds as though you would like to speak to a representative now , ” the robo-voice replied . )
Well , the Haggler is reluctant to endorse any dispute resolution methods that involve four - letter words or litigation , as effective as they might be .
So here are some G - rated ideas that do n’t require legal forms , presented in no particular order .
USE YOUR CAMERA Suzanne Barchers of Stanford , Calif. , always photographs any unpleasant surprises in hotel rooms , using her handy digital camera .
Of a recent trip to Las Vegas hotel she writes , “ When asked upon checkout how my stay was , I simply said , ‘ Let me show you . ’ ” The images included some dingy towels , broken shelves and a view that was less than promised and paid for .
“ My bill was cut in half without any prompting . ”
Today as I type this billions of Christians all over the world are celebrating the " Holy Day " known as Easter , the celebration of the supposed resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead .
Today , hundreds of thousands – perhaps even millions of atheists are delighting themselves in calling it Zombie Jesus Day , much like I did last year .
This year , for me , the joke is old – I get it and all and of course it makes sense but I just do n't find the same humor in it that I once did because I know that it offends some of my dear friends .
As a result of perhaps maturing another year I 've chosen to make this day a different sort of holiday for me at least and I wonder if my atheist cohorts would decide to do the same .
A New Proposal
Rather than trolling message boards , Reddit , and Facebook all day today calling Christians out on their worship of a man that may never have existed I intend to make this day , and any other Christian holiday a day of reason – and I 'm going to do so respectfully .
On this day , now and until we are all dead I propose that we should approach the Christian multitudes with facts and reason rather than taunts and hate .
Lets talk about the historical context , pagan origins , and logical fallacies of this belief system in meaningful ways in order to promote a reasonable dialog between our two groups because I honestly do n't feel that Zombie Jesus Day promotes anything more than anger and hurt feelings .
Do n't get me wrong here , I 'm not saying Christendom is innocent of causing massive amounts of harm to our society because it most certainly has – I just do n't believe that you can fight fire with fire any longer .
If we are going to attempt to put out the flames of hate , intolerance , and myth we must stop being hateful , stop being intolerant , and start presenting facts even IF they will fall of deaf ears .
What to do
Here are the things that I think we , as atheists and overall reasonable people should do on days such as this :
Know the history of Easter and the similarities between Jesus and other Christ - myth deities past such as Mithras and Glycon .
Ask believers why there are so many religions that existed PRIOR to Christianity that share a nearly identical story .
Discuss the Burden of Proof that Christians have since they are making positive claims as to the existence and person of God .
Discuss and present the evidence for the superiority of the Scientific Method and why God is unnecessary for life / the universe
Do n't act like an ass – Sure I 'm guilty , but it 's never done anything positive for me or anyone else .
I 'm not saying that we are necessarily wrong to ridicule Christianity , what I am saying is that ridiculing Christianity is fruitless .
Yes , the premise of Christianity and all religions are regurgitated myths and belief in them often has very dangerous results but the only way to dispel those myths is by presenting the facts regarding them .
No , this wo n't change every Christian 's mind but at the very least it provides the opportunity to reason and grow if they are open to it .

Rollins did n't address the media after the game .
But teammate Greg Dobbs said Rollins -- who was hitting .391 , with a .516 on - base percentage -- was " extremely frustrated " by his freak injury .
" After he came out of the lineup , I came up into the clubhouse to check on him , " Dobbs said .
" And he was kind of like , ' I ca n't believe this . '
He was frustrated , extremely frustrated . "
Rollins was in the original starting lineup , was introduced before the game and was even on the lineup card that was handed to the umpires just before game time .
But after the pregame ceremonies , he went out to the outfield to stretch and do some light jogging and " grabbed his calf , " said manager Charlie Manuel .
First baseman Ryan Howard was loosening up at the same time but said afterward , " I 'm not sure what happened .
He just said he felt something in his calf . "
Some Phillies were n't even aware Rollins had hurt himself until utility man Juan Castro trotted out to shortstop in the first inning .
" Everyone was surprised not to see J - Roll in there , " Werth said .
" That 's a situation where everyone knew it was probably pretty serious for him to come out before the game even starts . "
Werth , meanwhile , said his own injury does not appear serious .
He said he " felt [ his ] hip flexor grab a little bit while [ he ] was running to first " in the fourth inning .
He stayed in the game for another inning and even singled in the fifth , but decided the smart thing to do was to leave and get treatment , rather than risk further injury .
" I just thought it would be best not to play any longer , " he said , " especially because we 've got guys on the bench who are more than capable of getting the job done .
It 's a situation where , if you stay in there , you could create a situation that 's theoretically a lot worse . "
Last year , six of the Phillies ' eight starting position players played in 150 games or more -- something only one other National League team has done in the past 20 years .
But one of their big offseason objectives was upgrading their bench with players like Castro and Ross Gload .
So now , they may find out fast how well they succeeded at accomplishing that upgrade .
The most immediate effect , if Rollins is out for any length of time , is that Castro -- who has never started more than 66 games in any of his 15 big league seasons -- would take over as the regular shortstop .
And Shane Victorino , who has been hitting seventh this season , would likely move up to the leadoff spot while Rollins is out .
" We 've been doing this for about four years now , " Manuel said .
" I want to tell you something .
Just because somebody goes down , we 're going to keep right on playing .
We 've got guys who like to play .
We 've got guys sitting on the bench who can get the job done . "
" Yeah , it 's unfortunate , " said Werth .
" But the show goes on . "

Dr. Roland Borrasi chuckled as he told three doctors how he used kickbacks and cash bribes to shuttle unsuspecting nursing home residents into Chicago - area hospitals and psychiatric wards .
" Basically , I have a commodity ; my commodity is nursing home patients , " Borrasi explained .
He did n't know it at the time , but federal agents were secretly recording that meeting .
One of the doctors was wearing a wire as Borrasi matter - of - factly explained the mechanics of patient brokering to physicians in his medical group .
Those recordings , along with court documents and federal investigative reports obtained by the Tribune , describe a web of corruption in which hundreds of thousands of dollars flowed among doctors , nursing home executives and hospital administrators as the facility operators sought to fill their beds with a steady flow of destitute patients .
While taxpayers paid millions of dollars in fraudulent Medicaid and Medicare bills , one Alzheimer 's patient was given inappropriate brain radiation treatments , a Borrasi associate told federal agents .
A second patient , a disoriented elderly woman , was sent to an acute psychiatric ward after she refused to eat in her nursing home dining hall , another medical professional told federal agents .
" The fact that … greed subordinated the care of elderly and infirm patients who really needed it is horrific at best , " federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing earlier this year after Borrasi was sentenced for accepting more than $ 500,000 in kickbacks to steer vulnerable patients .
Prosecutors described " the scope and breadth of the bribes " as " extraordinary . "
Borrasi , now serving a six - year stint in a Kentucky federal prison , declined to comment .
The illegal operation centered on Rock Creek Center , a now - shuttered psychiatric facility in southwest suburban Lemont .
Also named but never charged in the federal probe were two of the state 's largest nursing home chains , whose patients allegedly were used in the scheme , as well as executives from two well - known Chicago hospitals , Methodist and Loretto , which " paid Borrasi for patients , " prosecutors wrote in a federal court filing .
Federal anti-kickback laws prohibit facilities from offering payments or inducements in exchange for referring Medicaid or Medicare patients .
The crimes took place in 2002 and before , but it took federal agents years to uncover the conspiracy .
Their investigative reports and transcripts of undercover recordings have surfaced only recently as the prosecutions near conclusion .
Advocates for the disabled such as ACLU attorney Benjamin Wolf believe similar patient - brokering schemes continue in Illinois today .
Government - funded patients ,
Wolf said , " become a money machine " for the homes and hospitals alike .
Borrasi made himself the indispensible middleman in the patient - brokering racket :
He worked at both nursing homes and hospitals and thus could shuttle hundreds of patients to maximize the facilities ' profits .
The brash medical group boss drove a Porsche , kept several mistresses and began wearing a bulletproof vest after being shot at close range in the parking lot of a nursing home in 2002 , records show .
In addition to Borrasi , Rock Creek 's CEO and its director of operations were sentenced for related crimes in recent months .
A fourth defendant , Dr. Naseem Chaudhry — a psychiatrist who worked as a consultant for Borrasi 's medical group and also as medical director of Rock Creek — pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of health care fraud .
His sentencing is scheduled for August .
Federal agents have traced a cat 's cradle of illicit payments , with money allegedly flowing to and from Borrasi through the medical group he owned and operated .
To ensure a steady stream of patients to their facilities , operators of hospitals and nursing homes paid Borrasi 's medical group " stipends " that were really " bribes disguised as legitimate income , " prosecutors said in court papers .
Four nursing homes linked to the Alden Management Services nursing home group , founded by Floyd Schlossberg , paid Borrasi 's medical group stipends totaling $ 54,000 in 2002 , according to records and interviews .
Borrasi told his medical colleague and co-worker Abhin Singla that Alden nursing homes were paying him " in exchange for admitting patients " there , according to the federal investigative reports .
Schlossberg and Alden representatives declined to comment .
Methodist Hospital of Chicago , on the North Side , paid Borrasi 's group stipends of $ 8,267 in 2000 , while Loretto Hospital , on the West Side , paid $ 12,500 in 2002 , records and interviews show .
Prosecutors said Borrasi had " payment - for - referral arrangements " at both places , but the facilities declined to comment .
Also paying Borrasi 's medical group and serving as a source of patients , according to prosecutors and court exhibits , were nursing homes operated by Philip Esformes and his father , Morris Esformes .
They and their companies have an ownership stake or management and consulting role in 28 nursing facilities in Illinois and Florida .
Three Esformes facilities paid Borrasi 's group a total of $ 25,400 from 2000 to 2002 , according to government records and interviews .
Borrasi was medical director at Burnham Healthcare , for example , from approximately July 2000 through December 2002 , and he continued to see patients there for several years afterward , records and interviews show .
Through their attorneys , Philip and Morris Esformes vigorously denied wrongdoing and said the payments to Borrasi " were market rate and ordinary and customary payments for services as medical director , " adding that Borrasi did a good job .
" There is absolutely no evidence that these payments were tied into patient referrals , " said attorney Michael Pasano .
Attorneys for the Esformeses say their clients have never been contacted by federal investigators regarding the patient - brokering allegations .
Government records raise questions about the quality of care provided by Borrasi 's medical group at Esformes homes .
At Burnham , for example , Borrasi knew two of his doctors were not visiting some patients , but he " fixed all the charts ... to conceal the fact that services were not provided , " one of those doctors , Singla , told authorities .
WASHINGTON — The Web site WikiLeaks.org released a graphic video on Monday showing an American helicopter shooting and killing a Reuters photographer and driver in a July 2007 attack in Baghdad .
A senior American military official confirmed that the video was authentic .
Reuters had long pressed for the release of the video , which consists of 38 minutes of black - and - white aerial video and conversations between pilots in two Apache helicopters as they open fire on people on a street in Baghdad .
The attack killed 12 , among them the Reuters photographer , Namir Noor - Eldeen , 22 , and the driver , Saeed Chmagh , 40 .
Reuters employees were allowed to view the video on an off - the - record basis two weeks after the killings , but they were not allowed to obtain a copy of it .
The news organization said its Freedom of Information Act requests were not approved .
At a news conference at the National Press Club , WikiLeaks said it had acquired the video from whistle - blowers in the military and viewed it after breaking the encryption code .
WikiLeaks released the full 38 - minute video as well as a 17 - minute edited version .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have two new contenders for the “ dumbest TSA workers of the year ” award .
An airport cop and TSA worker both showed up at a Hartland Township , MI gas station to buy some booze in order to continue their buzz ( which means they drove there drunk already ) .
The two paid for the booze , then Renee Zima , the TSA officer , is accused of stealing two pieces of pizza , and leaving the store .
When the store clerk approached them demanding payment for the items , Zima flashed her TSA badge , claiming she was with Homeland Security .
When the clerk tried to get their plate number , these two idiots bent the plate , then stood in front of it , blocking his view .
When the clerk went back outside , Zima ’s partner in crime ( and off duty airport police officer ) Richard Frederick punched him in the face .
The funny part is that all the effort put into covering up their license plate was completely useless , as these two smart criminals already identified themselves by paying for their booze purchase with a credit card , and I ’m sure all the surveillance footage does n’t help their case that much either .
When apprehended , Frederick claimed he punched the clerk because he felt threatened by “ all the store clerks surrounding him ” , even though the video clips only show one person .
Both the Wayne County Airport Authority and the TSA have started an investigation into the actions .
Zima has been placed on administrative leave , and Frederick has entered rehab .

I was a huge fan of their more recent work , THE BOOK OF ELI , and have followed their careers since they burst onto the scene with MENACE TO SOCIETY at the tender age of 21 .
A quick glance at their IMDB pages reveals that they have split before but it does n’t really seem to be the magic formula for the duo who have received far better praise for films they ’ve produced together .
This year at SXSW I posed the question of parting ways to the recently - on - the - radar Duplass Brothers who outright said they had no desire to ever split and felt they had adapted their talents to necessitate feeding off of eachother .
The report is kind of vague and hints that they may still both have their hands in the project – I for one hope that turns out to be true .
50 years had passed .
Another 100 will pass and there is always going to be someone who is wondering what is that mark standing for .
It started life as the emblem of the British anti-nuclear movement but it has become an international sign for peace , and arguably the most widely used protest symbol in the world .
It has also been adapted , attacked and commercialised .
Many people have speculated on just what the symbol represents ; some religious zealots even claim it signifies Christ on the cross with arms broken , or a Teutonic rune representing death and despair .
But the truth is not so mysterious .
What does it mean ?
One of the most widely known symbols in the world , in Britain it is recognised as standing for nuclear disarmament — and in particular as the logo of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) .
It was designed from the naval code of semaphore , and the symbol represents the code letters for ND which means Nuclear Disarmament .
The circle , representing the concept of total or complete , surrounds the N and D signifying total or complete nuclear disarmament .
In the United States and much of the rest of the world it is known more broadly as the peace symbol .
It was designed in 1958 by Gerald Holtom , a professional designer and artist and a graduate of the Royal College of Arts .
He showed his preliminary sketches to a small group of people in the Peace News office in North London and to the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War , one of several smaller organisations that came together to set up CND .
The Direct Action Committee had already planned what was to be the first major anti-nuclear march , from London to Aldermaston , where British nuclear weapons were and still are manufactured .
It was on that march , over the 1958 Easter weekend that the symbol first appeared in public .
Five hundred cardboard lollipops on sticks were produced .
Half were black on white and half white on green .
Just as the church ’s liturgical colours change over Easter , so the colours were to change , “ from Winter to Spring , from Death to Life . ”
Black and white would be displayed on Good Friday and Saturday , green and white on Easter Sunday and Monday .
The first badges were made by Eric Austin of Kensington CND using white clay with the symbol painted black .
Again there was a conscious symbolism .
They were distributed with a note explaining that in the event of a nuclear war , these fired pottery badges would be among the few human artifacts to survive the nuclear inferno .
These early ceramic badges can still be found and one , lent by CND , was included in the Imperial War Museum ’s 1999 / 2000 exhibition ” From the Bomb to the Beatles ” .
Later , in a letter , Holtom also admitted that the symbol reflected his mood at the time .
“ I was in despair , ” he wrote .
“ Deep despair .
I drew myself : the representative of an individual in despair , with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya ’s peasant before the firing squad .
I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle around it . ”
American journalist and playwright Herb Greer adds support for the Holtom explanation .
He reported , “ I was actually there on and before the first Aldermaston march for which it was created .
I visited Holtom , I saw the original sketches and discussed it with him . ”
Ken Kolsbun , author of the book Peace : The Biography of a Symbol , reported that Holtom expressed regret in not designing the peace symbol with the joyful lifting of arms towards the sky .
For most of Holtom ’s life he would draw only the upright peace symbol .
Holtom requested that the upright peace symbol be placed on his tombstone in Kent , England .
If we take a look on the picture of his tombstone , we ’ll see that his wish was unfortunately ignored .
While it appears reasonable that the modern day peace symbol comes from Gerald Holtom , this logic fails to address the fact that the symbol has been used for evil both in modern times and for thousands of years .
This same symbol was used by Hitler ’s 3rd Panzer Division from 1941 to 1945 .
The image on the left is the regimental 3rd Panzer Division symbol .
Soviet , Polish , and Hungarian citizens , having suffered from the Nazi massacres , undoubtedly struggled with Holtom ’s use of the symbol as a thoughtful way to communicate peace .
The symbol can also be found on some of Hitler ’s SS soldiers ’ tombstones .
Another flaw in the Holtom creation story is the use of the symbol as an anti-Christian symbol by the Saracens as early as 711 A.D.
For the Saracens , the image placed on their shields symbolized the breaking of the Christian cross .
For some the broken cross was equated to a satanic symbol known as the raven ’s craw or witch ’s foot .
While Holtom may not have known the historical meaning of the peace symbol , Bertrand Russell was a historian and member of the Fabian Society .
A 1970 article in the American Opinion magazine claimed Russell knew the historical occult meaning and intentionally selected an “ anti-Christian design long associated with Satanism . ”
The fifth and final Roman emperor of the Julio - Claudian dynasty , Nero ( born Lucius Domitius Ahenabarbus 37 – 68 AD ) , is remembered in history for persecuting Christians .
Nero ’s rule was so wicked he even had his mother executed .
The First Roman - Jewish War ( 66 – 70 AD ) started during his reign and today the term “ Nero Cross ” is the symbol of the “ broken Jew ” or “ broken cross . ”
The most famous person believed to be crucified by Nero was the Apostle Peter .
To symbolize humility and unworthiness in comparison to Christ , Peter requested that he be crucified with his head toward the ground .
As a result of Peter ’s death the upside down cross was used by early Christians as a positive symbol for peace .
The symbol of the upside down cross changes its meaning when the person on the upside down cross is no longer Peter but Jesus .
Anti-religious and satanic groups use the “ Nero Cross ” or inverted “ Latin Cross ” to symbolize everything opposite of Christianity .
Today this is clearly illustrated by “ black metal ” or heavy metal music lyrics and imagery that communicate anti-Christian sentiments .
In addition to musicians , film makers have reinforced the notion that the upside down cross is an anti-Christian symbol as illustrated by The Omen in 1976 and The Exorcism of Emily Rose in 2005 .
The symbol has also been used to communicate support for communism .
Bertrand Russell once said : “ There is no hope in anything but the Soviet way . ”
Governments –both those who supported communism and those opposed to it –have perceived benefits in aligning the peace symbol with communist ideology .
For people like Bertrand Russell , the author of the 1927 essay Why I Am Not Christian , the symbol represented not only a pro-communism meaning but peace without God .
CND has never registered the sign as a trademark , arguing that “ a symbol of freedom , it is free for all ” .
It has now appeared on millions of mugs , T - shirts , rings and nose - studs .
Bizarrely , it has also made an appearance on packets of Lucky Strike cigarettes .
A decade ago , the sign was chosen during a public vote to appear on a US commemorative postage stamp saluting the 1960s .
The symbol that helped define a generation of baby boomers may not be as widely used today as in the past .
It is in danger of becoming to many people a retro fashion item , although the Iraq war has seen it re-emerge with something like its original purpose .
“ It is still the dominant peace sign , ” argues Lawrence Wittner , an expert on peace movements at the University at Albany in New York .
” Part of that is down to its simplicity .
It can be used as a shorthand for many causes because it can be reproduced really quickly – on walls on floors , which is important , in say , repressive societies . ”
And can its success be measured ?
Fifty years on , wars have continued to be waged and the list of nuclear - armed states has steadily lengthened .
But the cup is half - full as well as half empty .
“ There are many ways in which nuclear war has been prevented , ” says Mr Wittner .
“ The hawks say that the reason nuclear weapons have not been used is because of the deterrent .
But I believe popular pressure has restrained powers from using them and helped curbed the arms race .
And the symbol of and inspiration for that popular pressure , says Mr Wittner , is Mr Holtom ’s graphic .
“ Today because many people carry the symbol without understanding the history , we miss an opportunity to address historical uses and move forward to reclaim the symbol for good .
When you see the peace symbol , I encourage you to see the person displaying it as communicating a message of love .
If you display the peace symbol , my recommendation is point the arms of the peace symbol toward the sky to honor Holtom ’s wish , address historical objections , and communicate love of all people .
” Dave Dionisi , Teach Peace Foundation

A look at whether the key principle of the Children Act - that in family breakdown and divorce , the welfare of the child is paramount - is being adhered to .
A major series to mark 20 years since the passing of the Children Act , investigates whether its key principle is being adhered to - that in family breakdown and divorce , the welfare of the child is paramount .
One in three British children have parents who are separated , and it's their relationship with the absent parent that 's the key factor in their long - term wellbeing .
The first film follows two families , one locked in a long battle in the Family Court , and the other determined to stay out of court and manage the split themselves .
The film explores the impact of separation on children 's lives and how decisions made in court play out in already troubled relationships .

You may recall Bernhard Braun as the wizard from UnmannedSpaceflight.com who created the amazing 3 - D images of the Mars avalanche .
Now he ’s created incredible planetary landscapes for a different world : the Moon .
“ Actually , this has been my very first attempt with lunar imagery after my previous work has almost been exclusively devoted to Mars , ” Braun said .
The special software he developed can create three dimensional images from one 2 - dimensional picture , but he says the real stars are the spacecraft that gather the data , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
“ It is the unprecedented quality together with the unprecedented availability of the raw data that opens the door for everyone to explore new ideas and processing techniques , ” Braun said .
See below for more stunning from - the - surface 3 - D looks at the Moon – no special 3 - D glasses needed !
I asked Braun if working with images from the Moon was different than working with Mars images .
“ Creating the single - image shading - derived DEMs from the Moon imagery is both easier and more difficult at the same time when compared to the same process applied to Mars images , ” he said .
“ It ’s easier because the lunar surface does not vary as much in its intrinsic albedo , i.e. the visible brightness variations are almost exclusively caused by variations in surface topography , especially at low illumination angles , which can be exploited by the reconstruction algorithm to derive high precision 3D geometry . ”
But the work is more difficult because of the totally black shadows on the Moon due to lack of any atmosphere .
“ So on the Moon any shadows are virtually featureless areas where the 3 - D reconstruction algorithm cannot infer anything about the structure of the invisible shadowed surface , ” Braun said .
“ This is different on Mars , where the shadowed areas are usually lit indirectly by considerable amounts of ambient light scattered by dust particles suspended in the atmosphere .
So the 3 - D models of the Mars surface can be more complete , showing surface details even in shadowed areas . ”
“ All in all it ’s a lot of fun to play around with both camera and sun positions until an interesting landscape shot is found , ” Braun said .
“ I would like to add that much of the credit must really go to those true wizards at NASA / JPL for not only making and bringing to orbit these almost unearthly powerful cameras like LROC and HiRISE … but also for sharing the whole image catalog via the internet with everyone in the world ! ”
Braun said he hopes to tackle 3 - D views of the Apollo landing sites — which we cannot wait to see !

March 13 , 2007  --
As a girl , Sunny Lane wanted to be a professional ice skater .
Her mother , Shelby , decorated her glittery competition costumes , and her dad , Mike , cheered for his only child from the sidelines .
Years later , they 're still at it -- only now they 're helping their daughter chase her dreams of becoming a porn star .
" I like to be in front of the camera , " Sunny said .
" I like to show my talent .
I have many , many talents in a lot of different areas , and I want to show them . "
But it 's more than just showing off the physical assets and the innocent pouts that have earned her the nickname the " Shirley Temple of Porn , " because she looks much younger than she is .
Sunny will only say that she 's in her 20s .
" It would totally mess the fantasy up for my fans , " she said about her reluctance to reveal her age .
" I look very young , which I 'm very grateful [ for ] . "
Sunny sees more than the opportunity to show off her talents ; she also sees dollar signs in an industry that made almost $ 13 billion last year , and she demands hands - on control of her career .
" I'm a businesswoman , " she said .
" I have an empire , and I have a massive team backing me . "
Lawyers , a publicist and image consultants are on call for Sunny , but the foundation for her team is still in the Lane apartment , where Sunny lives with her parents .
Sunny Lane is her stage name , and her parents also go by the same last name .
For the last year and a half , life in the apartment has revolved around the business of selling Sunny , whom they market as " The Girl Next Door Turned Hard Core . "
On a recent afternoon , Shelby answered the phone while Mike sat nearby in the living room .
Upstairs , Sunny packed a suitcase for an evening full of appearances and outfit changes .
Shelby helped , filling small plastic bags with costumes , makeup and music .
Once Sunny has worn an outfit , Shelby puts it -- unwashed , of course -- back in a small plastic bags to one day auction off on their Web site .
Sunny 's underwear can bring in a lot of cash .
" They 'll pay $ 50 to $ 100 for panties , " her mother said .
' Dreams Do Come True '
" We 're not kinky parents , " Mike said .
Married for 29 years , he and Shelby say that their own secret to staying monogamous was watching porn movies .
For them , Sunny 's co-stars are her " dates , " and they say they 'd rather her have sex on a porn set than with a " civilian " who might eventually break her heart .
" She does her thing , safely , in a good environment , and I do n't worry about that .
When she comes back home , I just ask her how her date was , " Mike said .
Mike and Shelby are proud of Sunny 's success .
Mike said that when he first saw Sunny on the Playboy channel , his reaction was , " Well , dreams do come true , I guess . "
" To me , it 's all entertainment .
I see it all as entertainment , " said Shelby .
Mike and Shelby say they fast - forward through the sex scenes in their daughter 's movies , despite having made a cameo appearance in one of her early films .
If she has a good scene , Mike relies on her fans to let him know whether it was good or bad .
" And if it 's good , that means the movie 's going to be good , her scene 's going to be good , and everybody 's going to make a lot of money hopefully , " he said .
To keep making all that money , Sunny promotes herself relentlessly -- giggling , bouncing and blowing kisses at red carpet events and private parties .
" I'm a product , " she said , " And I know that , and I 'm a dang good product . "
Promoting the Product
At the adult video convention in Las Vegas in January , Sunny was there to market herself , and her parents were right there beside her .
But Shelby and Mike seem to have taken their support to a whole new level .
While at the conference , they looked into getting life - size , anatomically correct sex dolls molded of their daughter .
" I do want to have a doll that looks exactly like me , " said Sunny .
" [ My parents ] support anything that I have to do with my business , and it 's my decision .
And if I want a doll , I want a doll . "
But what does the industry think of her parents ?
Mike says he and Shelby are involved in Sunny 's career to look after those people who want to use her .
He sees himself as the porn equivalent of Jessica and Ashlee Simpson 's father , Joe .
" Some of the industry has accepted us very , very well , and some of the industry do n't understand any of it , " Mike said .
But Sunny is adamant that her parents are only there for support .
" They do not make money off of me .
If anything , I pay them .
I pay them in return for everything that they have loved and supported me after all these years . "
' Why Am I Doing This ? '
A few miles away in the San Fernando Valley , another young woman who achieved early success as a porn star made the difficult decision to leave this industry .
Unlike Sunny , Sophia Lynn entered her career in pornography alone , with no family support .
After only being in the business for a few months , she already seemed to be an experienced pro .
The blonde glamour girl says she comes from a devout Christian family and only got into porn to make some extra money .
She had gone through a divorce and had a young child to help support .
" When you have bill collectors calling you every five minutes , you start to feel hopeless , " she said .
She started out modeling and was encouraged to give porn a try .
" I kept thinking , ' Why am I doing this ? '
But then I reminded [ myself ] [ that ] my car payment was due . "
These days , many girls look up to porn stars like Jenna Jameson , who 's had a best - selling autobiography and recently sold her own adult entertainment company , Club Jenna , to Playboy for millions .
A Contract Girl
Today , there are more girls clamoring to enter the business than 10 years ago .
Like any business , more product means less profit , so girls are often asked to do more degrading acts for fewer dollars than they used to .
" Would I want to be a young woman getting into the adult [ business ] right now ?
Perfectly honestly , no , " said porn legend Taylor Wane .
When she got into the business in 1989 , Wane said it was more about women exploring their sexuality .
Nowadays , she said , it 's about pushing the envelope to extremes .
Newcomer Lynn was lucky to escape that path .
Within a few weeks of leaving her child with her ex and arriving in Los Angeles , Lynn was on the path toward becoming a new Jenna Jameson .
She signed on as a contract girl with Adam & Eve , something only a tiny fraction of girls in the business get offered .
As a contract girl , she had the potential to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year , but only needed to film a few days each month .
She was able to make more female - friendly and couple - friendly films , rather than the gonzo videos that try to outgross each other .
For the first time in Lynn 's life , she was making real money .
She was being told every day that she was beautiful , meeting celebrities , boosting her confidence .
Still , she missed her daughter , and she chain - smoked and drank sugary drinks to deal with nerves .
" You have a million people tell you you 're beautiful every single day , a million -- and not one of them really give a s --t about you , " she said .
' I Let a Lot of My Morals Go '
Between her own red carpet appearances , movie sets and how - to sex books , Lynn appeared to be going through the motions .
She was distracted , tired and often disoriented .
" I made a very , very large risk in coming out here , " she said , " by being away from my child so much .
I 've gone through some pretty good times and pretty bad times here .
The hardest point is when I realized that I let a lot of my morals that I thought I had go . "
While Lynn ultimately decided to leave the industry , she said there was no guarantee she could stay out .
" There 's never , ever any certainties in life . …
I do n't know exactly what my future holds , " she said .
What really happened at the protest
How the products really scored
Join the Organic Consumers Association 's boycott of brands
Good organic brands to buy
( Natural News ) The Organic Consumers Association has long fought against what it calls " organic cheater brands " -- personal care products that use the name " organic " in the product name or brand , yet are not truly organic products at all .
This year at the Expo West Natural Products Expo in Anaheim , California , the OCA staged a very visible public protest to expose what it calls " sham poo products " that are " organic cheaters .
"
The protest was part of the OCA ' swhich continues to expose dishonest or misleading products in the skin care industry .
Due in large part to the OCA 's efforts , now says it will enforce honest labeling by taking a closer look at the word " organic " on personal care products ( http://www.organicconsumers.org/bodycare/ind... ) .
I was present at the protest , where I spoke with some of the participants and captured some video footage of the action .
You can watch the full video right now on YouTube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BaO_fnQTnI
The protest was largely peaceful , and even though police did search the protestors -- a violation of their 4th Amendment rights -- they did not make any arrests . , the company that organizes the Expo West trade show each year , dispatched staffers to act asto visually block the protest signs by standing in front of them .
I attempted to get some of the New Hope Media personnel to explain why they were standing in front of the signs , asking them if they were attempting to block the signs , and they told me that they actually had no intention of blocking anything , that they were just " standing here " for no particular reason .
( Yeah , right ... ) They could n't say , of course , that the " organic cheater " brands whose signs they were blocking also happened to be some of the largest paying exhibitors at the show , and these show organizers were no doubt attempting to shield these companies from being publicly shamed .
That act alone raises the all - important question :
There 's something you need to know about the Expo West trade show :
That show has an on - dutywho runs around the show threatening companies that make truthful health claims on their product labels .
New Hope Media is apparently quite content with an FDA tyrant running around the show threatening people for telling the truth , but when the Organic Consumers Association tries to expose the truth about organic cheater brands , New Hope Media places itself in the position of Why is it illegal to tell the truth at Expo West , but it 's perfectly fine for some companies to lie to consumers through misleading product names ... and New Hope Media will actually go to bat for those cheaters by sending people onto the street to disrupt a public protest that exposes the lies !
I find this all quite fascinating .
Expo
West is a terrific trade show with lots of really great companies sharing their health products , but it does seem that New Hope Media is eroding its own credibility by going to bat for organic cheater brands .
Instead of defending organic cheater brands , the company might do itself a favor by requiring them to have honest labels before they can exhibit at the show !
Watch the video yourself to see the signs being blocked by New Hope Media employees ( the guys in the suits ) :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BaO_fnQTnI
The OCA has published an online spreadsheet detailing the test results of many personal care products to show their " Skin Deep Hazard Rating " -- a score that indicates the presence of potentially hazardous or toxic chemicals in product formulations .
A score of 7 or higher is considered bad enough to earn that product a " do n't buy this " rating .
A score of 2 or lower is considered very good .
Check out the spreadsheet yourself here : ( Click on the brand names at the top of the spreadsheet to see the score results for each brand . )
The OCA maintains a boycott against the following brands , which it characterizes as " fake organic brands " : • Avalon " Organics " • Desert Essence " Organics " • Earth 's Best " Organic " • Eminence " Organic " ( Except Few w / USDA Seal ) • Giovanni " Organic " • Goodstuff " Organics " • Head " Organics " • Jason " Pure , Natural & Organic " • Kiss My Face " Obsessively Organic " • Nature 's Gate " Organics " • Physicians Formula " Organic " Wear• Stella McCartney " 100 % Organic " NaturalNews urges readers to join in this boycott and avoid buying these brands until they reformulate to be truly organic ( USDA organic ) .
Note carefully that even the " Obsessively Organic " products are not considered truly organic by the OCA .
Do n't trust product names alone , as brand names and product names may be misleading .
Here are some of the honest organic brands you may wish to support through the purchasing of their products : • Alteya Organics • Baby Bear Shop• Badger• Brittanie 's Thyme• Bubble and Bee Organic• Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps• Earth Mama Angel Baby• Indian Meadow Herbals• Intelligent Nutrients • Kimberly Parry Organics • Little Angel• Mercola• Miessence Certified Organics • Nature 's Paradise• OGmama and OGbaby • Organicare• Organic Essence• Origins Organics • Purely Shea• Rose Tattoo Aftercare• SoCal Cleanse• Sensibility Soaps / Nourish• Terressentials • Trillium Organics • Vermont SoapStay informed at the OCA 'sweb page : http://www.organicconsumers.org/bodycare/ind...

* Claims in ITC complaint Apple infringed 5 patents
* Apple sued HTC in March for patent infringement ( Adds background , analyst comment , byline )
NEW YORK / SAN FRANCISCO , May 12 ( Reuters ) - HTC Corp 2498 .
TW on Wednesday fired back in its legal battle with Apple Inc AAPL.O , asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to ban U.S. sales of iPhones , iPads and iPods .
HTC said it filed a complaint with the ITC , accusing Apple of infringing five of its patents .
HTC ’s action was widely expected after Apple filed a patent infringement suit against the company in March .
Apple 's move against HTC was seen as a proxy for an attack on Google Inc GOOG.O. Taiwan 's HTC makes smartphones based on Google 's Android software , which has gained ground on Apple 's popular iPhone .
The ITC confirmed the complaint had been filed but said it had yet to put a copy on its website .
HTC , which did provide details on the patents in question , said it was seeking a ban on importation and sale of Apple ’s popular mobile devices in the United States .
Apple , whose products are made in countries such as China , declined comment .
For its part , Apple accused HTC of infringing 20 patents .
In addition , Apple filed a complaint with the ITC and also sued HTC in the U.S. District Court in Delaware .
[ ID :nN02151903 ]
“ We are taking this action against Apple to protect our intellectual property , our industry partners , and most importantly , our customers that use HTC phones , ” Jason Mackenzie , HTC ’s vice president for North America , said in a statement .
MKM Partners analyst Tero Kuittinen was not surprised by HTC 's move against Apple , but he said the larger question is about HTC 's patent portfolio , which he said does n't measure up to those of other handset makers , such as Nokia Oyj NOK1V.HE .
“ I think its widely acknowledged that HTC ’s IP portfolio is not particularly strong , because they got started on this way later than they other guys , ” he said .
CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood said HTC ’s patents stretch back to the days before it was making its own branded handsets .
“ This move might see it drawing on intellectual property created when it was working as an ODM supplier to several mobile carriers and other manufacturers such as Compaq , ” he said .
ODM stands for original design manufacturer .
According to IDC , Apple held 16 percent of the global smartphone market in the January - March period , and HTC around 5 percent .
Apple was the No. 3 vendor , one slot ahead of HTC .
SMARTPHONE WARS
While Apple 's lawsuit against HTC did not name Google as a defendant , it was seen as a strategic move against Google , whose mobile software powers handsets from Samsung Electronics 005930.KS , Motorola Inc MOT.N and others .
Google allows smartphone makers to use its software for free .
Research group NPD said smartphones using Android software passed Apple to claim the No. 2 spot in the U.S. market in the first quarter .
[ ID :nN10217010 ]
The ITC , a U.S. trade panel that investigates patent infringement involving imported goods , has become an increasingly popular venue for patent lawsuits because it can bar the importation of products that infringe patents .
Legal wrangling is commonplace in the smartphone market , an industry where many vendors work under cross-licensing agreements .
Just last month , HTC struck a licensing deal with Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. [ ID :nN27130435 ]
Apple is currently fighting a high - profile legal battle with Nokia , the world ’s top handset maker .
The companies have sued each other over patents related to mobile device technology .

Frank Frazetta
Frank Frazetta , an illustrator whose vivid colors and striking brushstrokes conjured up fantastic worlds of musclebound heroes fighting with broad swords and battle axes to defend helpless women from horrible beasts , died on Monday in Fort Myers , Fla .
He was 82 .
The death , caused by a stroke , was confirmed by Rob Pistella and Steve Ferzoco , his business managers .
In a telephone interview , Mr. Pistella said that Mr. Frazetta , who had a history of strokes , had returned from a Mother ’s Day dinner with his family on Sunday night and fell ill .
Emergency medical services were called and Mr. Frazetta was rushed to the hospital , where he died .
In the 1940s and 50s , Mr. Frazetta drew for comic strips like Al Capp ’s “ Lil’ Abner ” and comic books like “ Famous Funnies , ” for which he contributed a series of covers depicting the futuristic adventurer Buck Rogers .
He also had his own newspaper strip that ran from 1952 to 1953 , called “ Johnny Comet ” ( later retitled “ Ace McCoy ” ) .
He drew the movie poster for “ What ’s New Pussycat ? ” in 1964 , and hit his stride executing detailed illustrations of pulp heroes like Conan the Barbarian and John Carter of Mars for their comic magazines and books .
His realistic renderings of otherworldly scenarios ( and barely clad women ) made him the ideal candidate to illustrate the album covers for popular heavy metal albums like Molly Hatchet ’s “ Flirtin ’ With Disaster ” and Nazareth ’s “ Expect No Mercy . ”
In November , Wired.com reported , Mr. Frazetta ’s cover artwork for the paperback reissue of “ Conan the Conqueror ” by Robert E. Howard sold to an unnamed collector for $ 1 million .
An obituary article will follow at nytimes.com .

* Second crude unit was shut for turnaround
* No injuries were reported due to blaze
( Updates with company statement )
HOUSTON , May 17 ( Reuters ) - Production at LyondellBasell ’s [ ACCELC.UL ] 270,000 barrel per day ( bpd ) Houston refinery was “ down to very low rates ” with one crude unit shut by a Monday afternoon fire and a second crude unit in the process of restarting from planned work , a company spokesman said .
Crude distillation units do the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery .
“ We would be down to very low rates , ” Harpole said .
The fire broke out at about 2:30 p.m. local time ( 1930 GMT ) at the refinery located along the Houston Ship Channel .
No injuries were reported due to the fire , which was extinguished about an hour after it began , he said .
The fire generated heavy black smoke because a product of a grade between residual oil and diesel was was burning , Harpole said .
Local residents were told to remain inside and shut down their air conditioning units due to the smoke .
It was too early to tell what damage the crude unit had sustained and how long it would take to return it to production , he said .
( Reporting by Erwin Seba ; Editing by Marguerita Choy )
Within four years , the brewery had maxed out its production capacity .
Soon thereafter , Maytag was forced to ration the number of cases distributors could buy .
He remembers the next few years as a nightmare .
Customers were beating down his door , and there was simply no way he could satisfy the demand .
He desperately looked for a new site , but he limited himself to locations in San Francisco out of respect for the historical connection between the city and the beer .
Finally he found an old coffee roastery , where the brewery moved in 1979 .
Maytag vowed he would never go through rationing again .

At least that ’s what those New York City based food experts over at Serious Eats are claiming .
In The Year That Was : Street Food , Serious Eats does n’t mince words ,
Portland : The Street Food Mecca : Alright , Portland , you win .
No other city ( in the world — there I said it ) has anything on your street - vendin ’ people .
Set up in parking lots , sidewalks , and even parks , the cuisines cover just about everything your tum could crave …
Now , some of you might remember the fun little smack down this past summer between NYC ’s Mayor Bloomberg and PDX ’s own Mayor Sam Adams over which of the two cities has the best cart scene , and the subsequent lively discussion that followed on Midtown Lunch .
The comments were intense , but Portland does seem to be coming out ahead on this particular urban dining phenomenon .
I ’m not so sure about the “ no other city in the world ” claim ( hmmm , ever been to Singapore or Hong Kong ? ) and will leave that decision to the United Nations , lest I start an international incident .
In addition , rather than a swarmy I told you so , I think most of us will continue to do the polite Portland thing and just sit here contemplating which of the many fine food carts to get lunch from .
Still , congratulations Portland ’s Food Carts and Bona Fortuna 2010 .

Perhaps you 've seen the headlines :
The petabyte will soon need to step aside in favor of the zettabyte for use in describing humankind 's ever - expanding yearly output of digital information .
And , as we all know ( ahem ) a zettabyte equals 1 trillion gigabytes , or a 1 followed by 21 zeroes .
So what do we make of that ?
...
No , really , what does a zettabyte mean in the meaningful sense of mean ?
EMC took a swing answering the question this week in releasing an IDC report it commissioned called " The Digital Universe Decade - Are you ready ? "
Let 's just say they did the best they could .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
In a general , I understand that a zettabyte is really big and that the comparisons being offered are really big things , too , albeit big things that might be a tad more accessible to my limited grasp of such scale .
The comparisons are helpful , all right ; it 's just that they do n't help all that much .
Let 's take a look at what was offered in an EMC press release : " The amount of digital information created in 2010 ( 1.2 zettabytes ) will equal : "
" The digital information created by every man , woman and child on Earth ' tweeting ' continuously for 100 years . "
The first problem with this is you need to know the world 's population , which today straddles the 7 billion mark , depending on which guesser you want to cite .
You also need to know that there 's nothing other than trendiness calling for all the world 's people to drop what they are doing and spend a full century tweeting , as opposed to say , sending e-mail or writing haiku .
And , of course , the fact that the calculation comes out to a nice round 100 years - not 96.5 , not 103.7 - suggests that maybe someone decided to wing it here , because , well , who 's going to even try to check the math on this one ?
The next attempt borrows more from the tried - and - true football field approach , placing the 1.2 zettabytes of data on a lot more iPads than Apple could even think about building before meeting its unmet commitment to jilted international buyers :
" 75 billion fully - loaded 16 GB Apple iPads , which would fill the entire area of Wembley Stadium to the brim 41 times , the Mont Blanc Tunnel 84 times , CERN 's Large Hadron Collider tunnel 151 times , Beijing National Stadium 15.5 times or the Taipei 101 Tower 23 times . "
What have we learned here ?
OK , 75 billion iPads would be more than enough to give seven to every man , woman and child on the planet , provided Apple can ramp up production .
Nothing to sneeze at .
But the clearest thing we learn is that the Beijing National Stadium could steal Wembley 's lunch money .
Next up , we turn to TV for a familiar reference point .
" A full - length episode of FOX TV's hit series ' 24 ' running continuously for 125 million years . "
This did n't help at all in my quest to understand the magnitude of a zettabyte , perhaps because I 've never watched so much as a nanosecond of " 24 . "
And here 's the last one :
" 707 trillion copies of the more than 2,000 - page U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into Law in March 2010 .
Stacked end to end , the documents would stretch from Earth to Pluto and back 16 times or cover every inch of the United States in paper 3 feet deep . "
That just made my head hurt .
Let 's give up .

I 've simply had it with all the people who keep telling me that they revere
The Elements of Style because it 's such a nice little book and helped them so much with their writing when they were in college that they carry it everywhere they go and give it to all their students or hand a copy to each new employee that they hire for their company yadda yadda yadda …
I have decided that my campaign against Strunk and White 's toxic little compendium of unfollowable dumb advice , bungled grammar claims , and outright mendacity must be taken directly to America 's colleges , starting with the great universities of the East Coast .
For the opening event I have chosen Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island .
I will speak on the Brown campus at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday night next week , April 13 , in the Metcalf Chemistry Building Auditorium at 190 - 194 Thayer Street .
Admission is free , and Language Log readers get a 30 % discount off that .
Be there .
The lecture is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for almost anyone with an interest in the English language — except perhaps for people who want to tell me that they revere
The Elements of Style because it 's such a nice little book and helped them so much with their writing when they were in college that they carry it everywhere they go and give it to all their students or hand a copy to each new employee that they hire for their company yadda yadda yadda .
I hoped originally to stoke up the crowd to a huge outburst of anger against The Elements of Style and end the evening with a cathartic mass burning of copies of the book , everyone setting fire to copies they had brought with them and holding them aloft like a candles , waving them so that embers of flaming nonsense like " Write with nouns and verbs " scatter through the air like precious twinkling sparks of wisdom and truth …
But I am told that the fire marshals for the Metcalf Chemistry Building have ruled that out in no uncertain terms .
They are not happy about the courtyard bonfire idea , either .
Another idea I had was that everyone would strip naked in a symbolic throwing off of prescriptivist strictures , a return to the naked innocence of using the language as it is rather than as a pair of misinformed old authoritarians once wanted it to be …
But it turns out that they already do that at Brown in the various undergraduate libraries , during the celebrated naked donut run every semester , so this would be absolutely nothing new .
The event now planned , therefore , is likely to be quite safe despite the huge crowds expected , and fit for family TV news viewing .
( The networks are a little disappointed ; their location crews had been making plans for coverage of either a major blaze or a lot of titillating pixelized shots of public nudity . )
Brown University , the 7th to be founded in America , was the first to accept students regardless of their religious faith .
That element of tolerance is important when you are going to speak out against a book that many people seem to regard as a sacred text .
Brown is also the university where it was first proposed that computer - searchable corpora of text would one day be important for linguistic investigation — for finding out what the language is actually like so you do n't have to go by the unfiltered prejudices that dopey old coots stuff into their cockamamie usage books .
The Longman group now own the rights to the current ( 4th ) edition of The Elements of Style .
I hope the rumors I have heard about them capitalizing on my campaign by setting up a book display in the lobby of the Metcalf Building are untrue .
You would n't believe how tiring it is kicking over tables of books .
I want to reserve my energy for giving the lecture .
See you there .

When the female stranger left the room and the two men remained sitting together , the volunteer 's stress levels did not rise .
However , when the volunteer was left alone with the female stranger , his cortisol levels rose .
Twenty - two years ago , the founders of Google invented PageRank , and forever changed the web .
A few things that made PageRank dramatically different from existing ranking algorithms :
Links on the web count as votes .
Initially , all votes are equal .
.
Initially , all votes are equal .
Pages which receive more votes become more important ( and rank higher . )
( and rank higher . )
More important pages cast more important votes .
But Google did n't stop there : they innovated with anchor text , topic - modeling , content analysis , trust signals , user engagement , and more to deliver better and better results .
Links are no longer equal .
Not by a long shot .
Rand Fishkin published the original version of this post in 2010 — and to be honest , it rocked our world .
Parts of his original have been heavily borrowed here , and Rand graciously consulted on this update .
In this post , we 'll walk you through 20 principles of link valuation that have been observed and tested by SEOs .
In some cases , they have been confirmed by Google , while others have been patented .
Please note that these are not hard and fast rules , but principles that interplay with one another .
A burst of fresh link can often outweigh powerful links , spam links can blunt the effect of fresh links , etc .
We strongly encourage you to test these yourselves .
To quote Rand , " Nothing is better for learning SEO than going out and experimenting in the wild . "
Contents :
1. Links From Popular Pages Cast More Powerful Votes
Let ’s begin with a foundational principle .
This concept formed the basis of Google ’s original PageRank patent , and quickly help vault it to the most popular search engine in the world .
PageRank can become incredibly complex very quickly — but to oversimplify — the more votes ( links ) a page has pointed to it , the more PageRank ( and other possible link - based signals ) it accumulates .
The more votes it accumulates , the more it can pass on to other pages through outbound links .
In basic terms , popular pages are ones that have accumulated a lot of votes themselves .
Scoring a link from a popular page can typically be more powerful than earning a link from a page with fewer link votes .
2. Links Inside Unique Main Content Pass More Value than Boilerplate Links
Google ’s Reasonable Surfer , Page Segmentation , and Boilerplate patents all suggest valuing content and links more highly if they are positioned in the unique , main text area of the page , versus sidebars , headers , and footers , aka the “ boilerplate . ”
It certainly makes sense , as boilerplate links are not truly editorial , but typically automatically inserted by a CMS ( even if a human decided to put them there . )
Google ’s Quality Rater Guidelines encourage evaluators to focus on the “ Main Content ” of a page .
Similarly , SEO experiments have found that links hidden within expandable tabs or accordions ( by either CSS or JavaScript ) may carry less weight than fully visible links , though Google says they fully index and weight these links .
3. Links Higher Up in the Main Content Cast More Powerful Votes
If you had a choice between 2 links , which would you choose ?
One placed prominently in the first paragraph of a page , or One placed lower beneath several paragraphs
Of course , you ’d pick the link visitors would likely click on , and Google would want to do the same .
Google ’s Reasonable Surfer Patent describes methods for giving more weight to links it believes people will actually click , including links placed in more prominent positions on the page .
Matt Cutts , former head of Google ’s Webspam team , once famously encouraged SEOs to pay attention to the first link on the page , and not bury important links .
( source )
4. Links With Relevant Anchor Text May Pass More Value
Also included in Google ’s Reasonable Surfer patent is the concept of giving more weight to links with relevant anchor text .
This is only one of several Google patents where anchor text plays an important role .
Multiple experiments over the years repeatedly confirm the power of relevant anchor text to boost a page ’s ranking better than generic or non-relevant anchor text .
It ’s important to note that the same Google patents that propose boosting the value of highly - relevant anchors , also discuss devaluing or even ignoring off - topic or irrelevant anchors altogether .
Not that you should spam your pages with an abundance of exact match anchors .
Data typically shows that high ranking pages typically have a healthy , natural mix of relevant anchors pointing to them .
﻿ ﻿
Similarly , links may carry the context of the words + phrases around / near the link .
Though hard evidence is scant , this is mentioned in Google ’s patents , and it makes sense that a link surrounded by topically relevant content would be more contextually relevant than the alternative .
5. Links from Unique Domains Matter More than Links from Previously Linking Sites
Experience shows that it ’s far better to have 50 links from 50 different domains than to have 500 more links from a site that already links to you .
This makes sense , as Google ’s algorithms are designed to measure popularity across the entire web and not simply popularity from a single site .
In fact , this idea has been supported by nearly every SEO ranking factor correlation study ever performed .
The number of unique linking root domains is almost always a better predictor of Google rankings than a site ’s raw number of total links .
Rand points out that this principle is not always universally true .
" When given the option between a 2nd or 3rd link from the NYTimes vs. randomsitexyz , it 's almost always more rank - boosting and marketing helpful to go with another NYT link . "
6. External Links are More Influential than Internal Links
If we extend the concept from # 3 above , then it follows that links from external sites should count more than internal links from your own site .
The same correlation studies almost always show that high ranking sites are associated with more external links than lower ranking sites .
Search engines seem to follow the concept that what others say about you is more important than what you say about yourself .
That ’s not to say that internal links do n’t count .
On the contrary , internal linking and good site architecture can be hugely impactful on Google rankings .
That said , building external links is often the fastest way to higher rankings and more traffic .
7. Links from Sites Closer to a Trusted Seed Set May Pass More Value
The idea of TrustRank has been around for many years .
Bill Slawski covers it here .
More recently , Google updated its original PageRank patent with a section that incorporates the concept of “ trust ” using seed sites .
The closer a site is linked to a trusted seed site , the more of a boost it receives .
In theory , this means that black hat Private Blog Networks ( PBNs ) would be less effective if they were a large link distance away from more trusted sites .
Beyond links , other ways that Google may evaluate trust is through online reputation — e.g. through online reviews or sentiment analysis — and use of accurate information ( facts ) .
This is of particular concern with YMYL ( Your Money or Your Life ) pages that " impact the future happiness , health , financial stability , or safety of users . "
This means links from sites that Google considers misleading and / or dangerous may be valued less than links from sites that present more reputable information .
8. Links From Topically Relevant Pages May Cast More Powerful Votes
You run a dairy farm .
All things being equal , would you rather have a link from :
The National Dairy Association The Association of Automobile Mechanics
Hopefully , you choose “ a ” because you recognize it ’s more relevant .
Though several mechanisms , Google may act in the same way to toward topically relevant links , including Topic - Sensitive PageRank , phrase - based indexing , and local inter-connectivity .
These concepts also help discount spam links from non-relevant pages .
While I 've included the image above , the concepts around Google 's use of topical relevance is incredibly complex .
For a primer on SEO relevance signals , I recommend reading :
9. Links From Fresh Pages Can Pass More Value Than Links From Stale Pages
Freshness counts .
Google uses several ways of evaluating content based on freshness .
One way to determine the relevancy of a page is to look at the freshness of the links pointing at it .
The basic concept is that pages with links from fresher pages — e.g. newer pages and those more regularly updated — are likely more relevant than pages with links from mostly stale pages , or pages that have n’t been updated in a while .
For a good read on the subject , Justin Briggs has described and named this concept FreshRank .
A page with a burst of links from fresher pages may indicate immediate relevance , compared to a page that has had the same old links for the past 10 years .
In these cases , the rate of link growth and the freshness of the linking pages can have a significant influence on rankings .
It 's important to note that " old " is not the same thing as stale .
A stale page is one that :
Is n't updated , often with outdated content
Earns fewer new links over time
Exhibits declining user engagement
If a page does n't meet these requirements , it can be considered fresh - no matter its actual age .
As Rand notes , " Old crusty links can also be really valuable , especially if the page is kept up to date . "
10 . The Rate of Link Growth Can Signal Freshness
If Google sees a burst of new links to a page , this could indicate a signal of relevance .
By the same measure , a decrease in the overall rate of link growth would indicate that the page has become stale , and likely to be devalued in search results .
All of these freshness concepts , and more , are covered by Google ’s Information Retrieval Based on Historical Data patent .
If a webpage sees an increase in its link growth rate , this could indicate a signal of relevance to search engines .
For example , if folks start linking to your personal website because you 're about to get married , your site could be deemed more relevant and fresh ( as far as this current event goes . )
11 . Google Devalues Spam and Low - Quality Links
While there are trillions of links on the web , the truth is that Google likely ignores a large swath of them .
Google ’s goal is to focus on editorial links , e.g. unique links that you do n't control , freely placed by others .
Since Penguin 4.0 , Google has implied that their algorithms simply ignore links that they do n’t feel meet these standards .
These include links generated by negative SEO and link schemes .
That said , there ’s lots of debate if Google truly ignores all low - quality links , as there ’s evidence that low - quality links — especially those Google might see as manipulative — may actually hurt you .
12 . Link Echos : The Influence Of A Link May Persist Even After It Disappears
Link Echos ( a.k.a. Link Ghosts ) describe the phenomenon where the ranking impact of a link often appears to persist , even long after the link is gone .
Rand has performed several experiments on this and the reverberation effect of links is incredibly persistent , even months after the links have dropped from the web , and Google has recrawled and indexed these pages several times .
Speculation as to why this happens includes : Google looking at other ranking factors once the page has climbed in rankings ( e.g. user engagement ) , Google assigning persistence or degradation to link value that is n’t wholly dependent on its existence on the page , or factors we ca n’t quite recognize .
Whatever the root cause , the value of a link can have a reverberating , ethereal quality that exists separately from its HTML roots .
As a counterpoint , Niel Patel recently ran an experiment where rankings dropped after low - authority sites lost a large number of links all at once , so it appears possible to overcome this phenomenon under the right circumstances .
13 . Pages Linking to Authoritative Content May Count More Than Those That Do Not
While Google claims that linking out to quality sites is n’t an explicit ranking factor , they ’ve also made statements in the past that it can impact your search performance .
“ In the same way that Google trusts sites less when they link to spammy sites or bad neighborhoods , parts of our system encourage links to good sites . ” – Matt Cutts
Furthermore , multiple SEO experiments and anecdotal evidence over the years suggest that linking out to relevant , authoritative sites can result in a net positive effect on rankings and visibility .
14 . Pages That Link To Spam May Devalue The Other Links They Host
If we take the quote above and focus specifically on the first part , we understand that Google trusts sites less when they link to spam .
This concept can be extended further , as there ’s ample evidence of Google demoting sites it believes to be hosting paid links , or part of a private blog network .
Basic advice : when relevant and helpful , link to authoritative sites ( and avoid linking to bad sites ) when it will benefit your audience .
15 . Nofollowed Links Are n't Followed , But May Have Value In Some Cases
Google invented the nofollow link specifically because many webmasters found it hard to prevent spammy , outbound links on their sites - especially those generated by comment spam and UGC .
A common belief is that nofollow links do n’t count at all , but Google ’s own language leaves some wriggle room .
They do n’t follow them absolutely , but “ in general ” and only “ essentially ” drop the links from their web graph .
That said , numerous SEO experiments and correlation data all suggest that nofollow links can have some value , and webmasters would be wise to maximize their value .
16 . Many JavaScript Links Pass Value , But Only If Google Renders
Them
In the old days of SEO , it was common practice to “ hide ” links using JavaScript , knowing Google could n’t crawl them .
Today , Google has gotten significantly better at crawling and rendering JavaScript , so that most JavaScript links today will count .
That said , Google still may not crawl or index every JavaScript link .
For one , they need extra time and effort to render the JavaScript , and not every site delivers compatible code .
Furthermore , Google only considers full links with an anchor tag and href attribute .
17 . If A Page Links To The Same URL More Than Once , The First Link Has Priority
...
Or more specifically , only the first anchor text counts .
If Google crawls a page with two or more links pointing to the same URL , they have explained that while PageRank flows normally through both , they will only use the first anchor text for ranking purposes .
This scenario often comes into play when your sitewide navigation links to an important page , and you also link to it within an article below .
Through testing , folks have discovered a number of clever ways to bypass the First Link Priority rule , but newer studies have n’t been published for several years .
18 . Robots.txt and Meta Robots May Impact How and Whether Links Are Seen
Seems obvious , but in order for Google to weigh a link in it ’s ranking algorithm , it has to be able to crawl and follow it .
Unsurprisingly , there are a number of site and page - level directives which can get in Google ’s way .
These include :
The URL is blocked from crawling by robots.
txt
Robots meta tag or X - Robots - Tag HTTP header use the “ nofollow ” directive
The page is set to “ noindex , follow ” but Google eventually stops crawling
Often Google will include a URL in its search results if other pages link to it , even if that page is blocked by robots .
txt .
But because Google can’t actually crawl the page , any links on the page are virtually invisible .
19 . Disavowed Links Do n’t Pass Value ( Typically )
If you ’ve built some shady links , or been hit by a penalty , you can use Google ’s disavow tool to help wipe away your sins .
By disavowing , Google effectively removes these backlinks for consideration when they crawl the web .
On the other hand , if Google thinks you ’ve made a mistake with your disavow file , they may choose to ignore it entirely - probably to prevent you from self - inflicted harm .
20 . Unlinked Mentions May Associate Data or Authority With A Website
Google may connect data about entities ( concepts like a business , a person , a work of art , etc ) without the presence of HTML links , like the way it does with local business citations or with which data refers to a brand , a movie , a notable person , etc .
In this fashion , unlinked mentions may still associate data or authority with a website or a set of information — even when no link is present .
Bill Slawski has written extensively about entities in search ( a few examples here , here , and here ) .
It ’s a heady subject , but suffice to say Google does n’t always need links to associate data and websites together , and strong entity associations may help a site to rank .

Below , you 'll find all twenty principals combined into a single graphic .
A submarine exploring the ocean 's depths recently returned with an unexpected visitor : a crablike critter that has left many readers startled and horrified .
In a posting to social bookmarking site Reddit , a deep - sea technician detailed the finding , asking the site 's readers to help identify what exactly the bizarre looking creature was .
The post reads , " I work for a Sub- sea Survey Company , recently this beast came up attached to one of our ROVs .
It measures a wee bit over 2.5 feet head to tail , and we expect it latched onto the ROV at roughly 8,500 feet depth .
Unfortunately , the e-mail that these pictures were attached to came from a contractor , and the ship he was operating from ( and therefore location ) is unknown , so I can't tell you what part of the Earth this beast was living . "
The pictures reveal the creature to be a giant isopod , a large crustacean that dwells in deep Atlantic and Pacific waters .
This particular creature is a Bathynomus giganteus , a deep - sea scavenger that feeds on dead whales , fish and squid .
Scientists have long remarked on the massive scale of this creature .
C.R. McClain wrote on ScienceBlogs explained one theory for the size , that " deep - sea gigantism , for all crustaceans , is a consequence of larger cells sizes obtained under cold temperatures , " citing a research paper from 1996 .
He also speculated that " in crustaceans , bathymetric gigantism may also in part reflect decreases in temperature leading to longer lifespans and thus larger sizes in indeterminate growers . "
Responses to the original post ranged from the curious to the horrified .
One reader notes the connection between the isopod and a more familiar household pest :
" The giant isopod is related to the " woodlouse " -- turns out this is the common bug that I grew up calling a " roly poly " or pillbug .
Neat ! "
Others were more disgusted with the crustacean .
" I remember watching some documentary ( Blue Planet maybe ? ) with a time lapse of these things swarming a whale carcass .
it was horrifying , " writes one reader .
another
One reader saw nothing but dinner in the flesh of the behemoth bug , writing " It could be because I really like seafood , but those isopods look tasty .
Land bugs = ew !
Sea bugs = mm mmm good . "
Walk into her office about two hours after lunch ( when the lull kicks in ) we do that kind of junk all the time while alone .
Personally I like to put tape over one eye and whistle the opening of Twisted Nerve while carrying a folder down the hall to the copy room , ala Elle Driver 's entrance in Kill Bill .
I always enjoy the idea of people not getting what it is that ’s controversial about them .
I think it shows a weird nexus of innocence , naivety , and ignorance rolled into one .
The best part , however , is that he really feels like he gets the issue , but really has no clue .
Yes , we enjoy making up things for characters to say that make them look stupid and then laughing at them .
We ’re bad people .

The Drivers Of Tropical Deforestation Are Changing
The United Nations estimates that some 13 million hectares ( 33 million acres ) of tropical forest are destroyed each year ; but these numbers mask a transition from mostly subsistence - driven to mostly corporate - driven forest destruction , say Butler and Laurance .
by Staff Writers
Washington DC ( SPX ) Aug 08 , 2008
A shift from poverty - driven to industry - driven deforestation threatens the world 's tropical forests but offers new opportunities for conservation , according to an article coauthored by William Laurance of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama .
" New Strategies for Conserving Tropical Forests " will be featured in the September issue of the leading journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution .
Rhett Butler of Mongabay.com , a leading tropical - forest Web site , and Laurance argue that the sharp increase in deforestation by big corporations provides environmental lobby groups with clear , identifiable targets that can be pressured to be more responsive to environmental concerns .
" Rather than being dominated by rural farmers , tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries - especially large - scale farming , mining , and logging , " said Laurance .
" Although this trend is pretty scary , it 's also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers . "
The United Nations estimates that some 13 million hectares ( 33 million acres ) of tropical forest are destroyed each year ; but these numbers mask a transition from mostly subsistence - driven to mostly corporate - driven forest destruction , say Butler and Laurance .
According to the authors , a global financial market and a worldwide commodity boom are creating conditions ripe for corporate exploitation of the environment .
Surging demand for grain , driven by the thirst for biofuels and rising standards of living in developing countries , is also fueling this trend .
" Green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys , " said Butler .
" And it works - we 're already seeing the global soy , palm oil , and timber industries beginning to change their approach .
They 're realizing they can't run roughshod over the environment - it 's just too risky for them . "
" In addition , some massive financial firms , including Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , and Bank of America , have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists , " said Butler .
" Environmental groups are using carrots as well as sticks , " said Laurance .
" Many multinational corporations are developing greener products because they 're more profitable .
For example , the market for eco-friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the U.S. by 2010 . "
" We argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud , clear message to the corporate sector , " said Laurance .
" There 's just no profit in destroying the natural world . "

The European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Fed differ in many aspects .
First , the ECB is considered to be more hawkish on fighting inflationary tendencies .
Its primary goal is price stability and it has continued to watch money growth .
Output gaps below full - employment are only considered secondary as instrument to forecast inflation .
Secondly the ECB was constructed to be more independent than the Fed .
Thus there has been less interaction with fiscal authorities .
Less mobility from governments to the ECB ( and vice versa ) documents this independence .
While in the US it is common to see central bank officials and the secretary of treasury plan the future of the economy , in Europe this is not the case .
Central bank independence is considered an important aspect of credibility and stability of the currency ( the German central bank model ) .
However , the current crisis has made the ECB more “ Anglo - Saxon . ”
Recently the ECB has announced to buy government bonds of crisis countries .
This should help pushing down risk premia of bonds to a “ normal ” level ( wherever this could be ) to allow these countries to cope with consolidation and austerity plans .
For the first time the ECB has followed Anglo - Saxon central bank policies to stabilize markets , because other solutions to the problems – such as defaults and insolvencies – have no political support .
The Fed bought 5 % of the treasuries and more than 10 % of the mortgages in the latest crisis .
A similar policy is likely to prevent a spill - over of the debt crisis from Greece to Portugal and may depress speculation against the euro .
If this does not help , the ECB could monetize the debt completely .
Therefore signaling that the ECB will do everything to keep countries solvent may contribute to stability ( in the short - run ) .
In the long run , inflation expectations could rise .
However , the ECB promises to watch money growth and sterilize bond purchases to not fuel inflation .
There are at least three ways to sterilize : First , it could absorb surplus liquidity from last year ’s 12 month tender in June , which could account for 442 billion euro or 600 billion dollars ( link ) Second , the ECB could go over to fine tuning measures and absorb liquidity here and there .
And third , the ECB could sell debt securities to banks to take liquidity out of the system .
But currently the ECB does not even have control over money supply as it fully serves money demand of the banking sector through full allotment fixed rate tender operations , in which banks can ask for any amount of liquidity at a fixed interest rate .
Further additional tenders ( due to the crisis ) rather increase money supply .
Banks even store deposits at the central bank .
If the ECB takes money out of the system , these low - yielding deposits may shrink ( which are being build up currently to have liquidity when the ECB starts absorbing ) , but not necessarily the money in the economy .
Thus sterilization may not be successful right away .
It is also not very likely in the midst of crisis due to two reasons :
First , the latest fall in the euro does nothing but help the euro area ’s periphery countries to regain some competitiveness and supports their recovery .
Second , prices are levels are stable and a second recession could actually have deflationary consequences in some areas .
Thus it is going to be interesting to watch the near future wording of ECB statements .
I believe they are likely to change from addressing the issues of money growth to price level stabilization as it is done in the US .
If sterilization works , the ECB may remain credible and could possibly point to this as a one - time bail - out .
But even this is problematic as with the introduction of the “ transfer union ” countries with thriving deficits will expect to be bailed - out .
Thus the independence of the ECB from fiscal policy making is in danger .
If this last bastion falls , the transformation of the ECB to an Anglo - Saxon style central bank will be completed .
France and other countries have been pushing for this for a long time .

Six - inch - wide rumble stripes to be ground into the edge lines on rural roads in Ohio this year are meant to decrease accidents , but could cause problems for bicyclists .
The rumble stripes may be difficult to ride over and may not leave enough pavement on the road 's shoulder for riders wary of pedaling in the traffic lane with speeding vehicles , cyclists say .
The Ohio Department of Transportation is spending $ 3.6 million to cut grooves 3/8 - inch deep into the pavement on the white line that divides the road lane and shoulder on about 1,600 miles of state roads .
The stripes are narrower and shallower than rumble strips milled into pavement on the shoulders of interstates .
But they have the same function : Creating noise and vibration when vehicles drive over them to alert motorists that they are veering off the roadway , said ODOT spokesman Scott Varner .
Even though a 12 - foot gap between each 50 feet of rumble stripe will allow bike riders to maneuver in and out of the lane , bicyclists remain concerned about safety .
Some even question the need for the project .
" They are doing these on roads that they have no history or record of collisions or fatalities , " said Ed Stewart of Elyria , a certified cycling instructor and founder of the Silver Wheels Cyling Club .
The Federal Highway Administration recommends rumble stripes on rural roads and provided the necessary funds to Ohio and other states .
Putting them on painted edge lines increases visibility , Varner said .
Crashes by motorists who run off the road account for almost one - third of the deaths and serious injuries each year on the nation 's highways , according to the federal agency .
Many involve drivers who are distracted and tired .
But studies have shown rumble stripes and rumble strips can decrease crashes by from 20 percent to 35 percent .
The rumble stripes will be placed on two - lane roads that have a speed limit of 50 mph or more , lanes at least 11 feet wide and shoulders at least two feet wide .
However , after learning of ODOT 's plans , Stewart and cyclists in Lorain and Medina counties measured shoulders on roads slated for rumble stripes last month , finding some less than two feet wide .
And many of those roads were identified in the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency 's 2008 regional bicycle plan as priority routes that should be improved for bicyclists because of heavy use , said NOACA transportation planner Sally Hanley .
She said priority routes should have shoulders at least three feet wide .
Hanley , a bicyclist , said bicycles have a legal right to use the road and the shoulders are often filled with debris .
After meeting with NOACA staffers and bicyclists , ODOT agreed this month to alter its rumble stripe guidelines statewide .
It will not put the stripes on any road designated by a metropolitan planning organization , like NOACA , as a bicycle route unless the shoulder is at least three feet wide .
About 30 miles of proposed rumble stripes will not be installed in Medina and Lorain counties because the shoulders were not wide enough , Varner said .
A total of 28.6 miles of rumble stripes will be in Lorain County and 15.6 miles in Medina County .
Varner said the only ODOT district in the state contacted by concerned bicyclists was the district that includes Lorain and Medina counties .
In northeast Ohio , rumble stripes also will be placed on some roads in Portage and Ashtabula counties .
Chuck Smith , the chairman of the Ohio Bicycle Federation , said in an e-mail that his organization is working with ODOT to make sure the rumble stripes do n't adversely affect bicyclists .
Stewart said he teaches students to ride three or four feet from where the shoulder ends .
" A lot of times that is right on the edge line and they will be putting the rumble stripe right where we should be riding , " he said .
Stewart said some Lorain County roads heavily used by bicyclists , including Ohio 57 east of Grafton , are still slated for rumble stripes .
He thinks ODOT should reconsider .
" We use the roads just like everybody else , " he said .
" We just use them a little differently . "
This is my blog for exploring the ideas and issues which are important to me .
Another Minnesota school district is moving to a four - day school week .
The school board for the west - central Minnesota Atwater - Cosmos - Grove City school district voted Monday night for the change , which still needs state approval .
The small district near Willmar has about 800 students .
Officials estimate they 'll save about $ 64,000 mostly because they 'll need fewer bus runs and substitute teachers , but that savings represents less than 1 percent of the district 's $ 8 million budget .
Districts in Minnesota that have moved to four days have all done so to save money , but the change does not solve all their budget woes .
Still , Superintendent Sherri Broderius said the estimated savings will help in her district , which has had to make cuts in each of the past six years .
" $ 64,000 is a lot of money when you think about what it can do for kids , " Broderius said .
Broderius also said studying the four - day week found potential educational benefits because each class period will be 11 minutes longer .
Students will have Mondays off , but the school day on Tuesdays through Fridays will be longer .
The ACGC vote comes about a month after the North Branch district also voted to go to four days next year .
Those two districts join MACCRAY , Blackduck , Ogilvie and Warroad - who already operate on four - day schedules .
LAKE FOREST – Terrified , 6 - year - old Anna Cooper curled into a ball .
Still , the brown and white boxer came at her .
He bit Anna ’s face , her shoulder and several areas on her left leg .
The girl screamed .
Watch video here .
Her brother Steven , 14 , heard the screams and ran to help .
He beat the dog over the head with closed fists .
Anna ’s sister Grace , 3 , ran to next - door neighbor Lisa Horner , who came out with Windex and rose clippers .
The dog biting , Anna screaming , siblings and neighbors rushing to save her ; it upended this tranquil Lake Forest neighborhood near El Toro and Trabuco roads on Wednesday .
And it brought Jennifer Cooper , Anna ’s mother , running from the family room .
Cooper , 43 , home schools her children : in addition to Steven , Anna and Grace , there is Matthew , 12 , Nathan , 8 , and Gabriel , 14 months .
Cooper and her son Steven were going over lesson plans for speech , debate and piano when the dog attacked .
Anna ’s shrieking got everyone ’s attention .
“ It was a mother ’s worst nightmare , seeing my child being harmed , ” Cooper said .
“ I kicked ( the dog ) , but he kept coming back and attacking my daughter .
Finally , I pulled Anna from the dog .
I started yelling ‘ bad dog ’ and ‘ go home , ’ but he was so aggressive he was n’t leaving .
The rest of my children were out , and I carried Anna back with blood running down her legs .
He came at my baby , bit his pant leg and then stood over him . ”
Steven was the last one in .
He walked backward to the front door – afraid to turn his back – as the dog continued to show aggression .
Once inside Cooper checked on Anna and Gabriel .
They were crying but seemed stable otherwise .
She said she thought about calling 911 , but said she was worried about other children in the area .
Cooper ran to an upstairs bedroom , where she and her husband have a gun safe .
Cooper pulled out a Glock 19 loaded with 9 mm Hornady hollow - point ammunition , cocked it while running down the stairs and went to the door .
“ I looked out my peep hole , and the dog was still there , standing 20 feet from my door , ” said Cooper , who was raised on an Oregon farm around animals and guns .
“ I made sure there were no people out there in the cul - de - sac , I pulled the door open and aimed at the dog ’s chest and shot him .
“ Dogs are so tough and vicious .
I was afraid of it running down the street and attacking another person .
I knew the only way to stop him was the gun .
My only regret is that I was n’t able to kill the dog , ” she said .
The dog did die of its wounds Thursday , said Ryan Drabek , interim director of OC Animal Care .
He said the dog was not automatically euthanized because “ it is somebody ’s animal .
If it is deemed treatable , we have to provide the best care possible . ”
The animal – officials are considering it a stray dog ; the owner has not been located – will be tested for rabies and a necropsy will be performed as part of an investigation into the incident by the Orange County Sheriff ’s Department , Drabek said .
The lesson Cooper wants for her children is that they know they are safe in their own home .
“ I want them to know that Mom is just a step away , and I ’ll be there to protect them , ” she said .
No need to prove that to Anna , who was doing better Thursday , although she said she ’s afraid of all dogs now except puppies and Chihuahuas .
“ My mom is really brave , ” she said .

HTML5 apps
Right now nobody ’s interested in a mobile solution that does not contain the words “ iPhone ” and “ app ” and that is not submitted to a closed environment where it competes with approximately 2,437 similar mobile solutions .
Compared to the current crop of mobile clients and developers , lemmings marching off a cliff follow a solid , sensible strategy .
Startling them out of this obsession requires nothing short of a new buzzword .
Therefore I ’d like to re-brand standards - based mobile websites and applications , definitely including W3C Widgets , as “ HTML5 apps . ”
People outside our little technical circle are already aware of the existence of HTML5 , and I do n’t think it needs much of an effort to elevate it to full buzzwordiness .
Technically , HTML5 apps would encompass all websites as well as all the myriads of ( usually locally installed ) web - standards - based application systems on mobile .
The guiding principle would be to write and maintain one single core application that uses web standards , as well as a mechanism that deploys that core application across a wide range of platforms .
What are HTML5 apps ?
HTML5 apps
have one single core application ; are written with web standards , primarily HTML , CSS , and JavaScript ; and are deployed on more than one mobile platform .
Thus , normal websites are HTML5 apps .
They are written with web standards , have one single core application ( the website ) and are deployed on more than one mobile platform ( all of them , in fact ) .
Although I ’m concentrating on the mobile web here , there ’s no reason why a normal website meant primarily for desktop could n’t also become an HTML5 app , as long as it also works on at least two mobile platforms ( most likely iPhone and Android ) .
In addition to websites , local applications written with web standards , including but not restricted to W3C Widgets , would also qualify as HTML5 apps , as long as they share one core application .
The fact that we ’re dealing with one single core application means that it ’s fairly easy to update the HTML5 app .
The fact that we ’re using web technologies to deploy it means that there is no need to go through 27 app stores ’ worth of approval processes .
We just have to update the core files , redeploy the app , and it works everywhere .
Still , the problem lies in the deployment .
In the short - term we probably have to use several systems in order the HTML5 app working on more than one platform .
The market situation is chaotic , and we have to adapt — for now .
I ’ll get back to the technical details in a bit .
A new name
From a technical perspective all this makes solid sense , but there ’s no real need for a new name .
Still , I believe this scheme will fail without calling the resulting applications “ HTML5 apps . ”
There ’s some justification for the “ HTML ” and “ app ” bits .
HTML5 apps are all about applications ( web - based or locally installed ) that are squarely based on web standards , symbolised by HTML .
Of course the “ 5 ” makes no sense from a technical perspective .
It ’s quite possible to write an HTML5 app that does not use any actual HTML5 features .
From a marketing perspective this new name is exactly what we need , though .
If we include the “ 5 , ” mobile web standards can hitch a ride on HTML5 ’s increasing popularity as a buzzword .
It ’s just a marketing ploy .
I hope Hixie does n’t mind .
The problem
I am convinced that the HTML5 app route is the best one for a fat slice of the non -game iPhone apps currently out there , especially those that are simple and face stiff competition .
Increased interoperability will help them more than a relative lack of eye candy will hinder them .
The problem is convincing clients of that .
Friends of mine have a two - year old daughter .
Clients remind me of her .
Picture her in her high chair .
Picture her wanting something .
Portrait of the client as a two - year old , take 1
Client [ points at iPhone ]
Want iPhone app .
Me
That ’ll only work on the iPhone , and about 80 % of smartphone users have another phone .
Interoperability is critical for a simple social media client facing stiff competition .
Eye candy is n’t .
Client Want ! iPhone !
App !
Me [ tries to hand non-iPhone device to client ]
Take this one , for instance .
It ’s very popular .
An iPhone app wo n’t work on it , but a [ website | web app | W3C Widget ] would .
Client [ pushes non-iPhone device away ]
Do n’t want that one .
Want iPhone app !
Me [ shoves non-iPhone device into client ’s hands ]
You need [ website | web app | W3C Widget ] !
Client [ throws non-iPhone device to ground ]
WANT IPHONE APP ! [ cries ]
IPHONE !
...
APP !
non-iPhone device [ sad ]
Bleep .
The solution
Instead of going against the grain and explaining that what they ask for is not actually what ’s good for them , why not try to get clients to want a web - based solution ?
That , basically , is why we need a new buzzword .
Clients are very buzzword - sensitive because they do n’t know better .
They ’re shielded from reality by a business logic layer of consultants who use a continuous stream of buzzwords to explain their high hourly rates .
Thus we ’d have to insert a new buzzword into this stream : “ HTML5 app . ”
The HTML5 bit helps a lot because it is a proto - buzzword with quite a bit of potential right now .
Witness :
The Morgan Stanley mobile report ( 48 M PDF ) states on p. 142 : “ Products with best HTML5 browsers gain share . ”
Nobody bothers to define “ HTML5 browsers , ” but that does n’t matter .
We ’re talking buzzwords here .
See also pages 162- 4 .
“ Developers [ are ] defecting from App Store to HTML5 ” according to ZDNet .
The Google Mobile blog already described the Google Voice application for iPhone and Palm as an “ HTML5 application . ”
If we just get rid of the “ lication ” bit we ’re in business .
Better , clients and even consultants know that HTML has something to do with the web .
The new buzzword will point them in the right direction , while terms like “ W3C Widgets ” might conceivably cause confusion .
So let ’s try to make “ HTML5 apps ” bloom into full buzzwordiness as the worthy successor to “ iPhone app . ”
Who knows , it might even work .
Portrait of the client as a two - year old , take 2

That ’ll only work on the iPhone , and about 80 % of smartphone users have another phone .

Eye candy is n’t .
Client Want ! iPhone !
App !
Me [ gives non-iPhone device to client ]
Take this one , for instance .
It ’s very popular .
An iPhone app wo n’t work on it , but an HTML5 app would .
Client [ pays real attention for the first time ] ... HTML5 app ?
Me
You want an HTML5 app ?
Client [ swings legs happily ]
HTML5 app !
Want HTML5 app !
Me [ takes HTML5 app from pocket and installs it on non-iPhone device ]
Look what we ’ve got for you here ?
Client [ clasps device ecstatically ]
HTML5 app !
[ Shows it to me ]
Look , HTML5 app !
non-iPhone device [ happy ]
Bleep !
Selling HTML5 apps
So how do we sell the HTML5 app concept ?
In the short run we wo n’t be able to avoid a comparison to iPhone apps .
( A mid-range goal would be to get rid of this comparison . )
Right now I think we should try to sell it as “ an iPhone app that works on several other platforms , too , and does n’t have to go through the app store approval process . ”
Of course it ’ll also be less advanced in eye candy , but that ’s something we should conveniently neglect to mention if it ’s in our client ’s interest .
What you can do
Supposing you think all this is a good idea , there are several things you can do .
First of all , take actual business cases from actual clients and see whether they ’d be served by an HTML5 app .
The reasons for choosing an HTML5 app over a native app need more study .
You could even try to sell the concept to the client right now , but I think we need the buzzword to become better known before you can really have success in that arena .
More importantly , you could start to use the term “ HTML5 app ” with artful carelessness whenever it ’s appropriate ( and even when it is n’t ) , all the while projecting the assumption that obviously everybody knows what you ’re talking about .
That ’s how a buzzword starts its life .
I have no idea if this is actually going to work , but it would be worth a shot .
I myself am definitely going to try it .
Technical details
Still , selling HTML5 apps also means solving a few tricky technical problems .
They fall apart in browser compatibility problems , for which progressive enhancement is the solution , and deployment problems , for which there is the beginning of a solution that has no name yet .
Progressive enhancement
If an HTML5 app must run on a plethora of browsers you have to test it in those browsers ( or at least a good subset of them ) and solve CSS and JavaScript issues .
This is going to be a problem , but it ’s nothing fundamentally new .
Although we ’ll have to discover and solve a lot of brand - new compatibility problems , our mindset and tools are fundamentally the correct ones for the job ahead .
By far the most important tool is progressive enhancement .
Where on the desktop progressive enhancement means not much more than daringly leaving out the rounded corners in IE6 and 7 , the mobile space calls for a significant upgrade of the concept .
“ If it does n’t work , leave it out . ”
That ’s the fundamental rule .
For instance , the BlackBerry browser is totally lousy when it comes to JavaScript performance .
If the problems get too hard , just switch off the script for BlackBerry and use a plain HTML / CSS version of the HTML5 app .
( RIM , the Blackberry vendor , is fully aware of these problems , by the way , and is working on a wholly new WebKit - based browser .
Of course this browser will be different from all other WebKit - based browsers , but I expect it to be good . )
On the other side of the spectrum there ’s the advanced CSS transformations and animations that Safari iPhone and Android WebKit support .
It ’s perfectly fine to use those , as long as you make sure your HTML5 app also works without them .
And do n’t believe the silly nonsense that these advanced effects somehow must work in order for your HTML5 app to be a success .
They do n’t .
They ’re just eye candy .
Use them when possible , but leave them out when necessary .
( That ’ll happen automatically anyway , because other browsers just wo n’t react to the transformation and animation CSS .
There is no technical problem here , only a mindset problem . )
In order to create HTML5 apps we must use progressive enhancement as it ’s really meant , and not as a theoretical construct that makes for a nice conference discussion topic but is shelved as soon as the client whispers “ IE6 . ”
On mobile there is no other way to deliver an HTML5 app on time and keep your sanity .
( Oh , and remember , IE does n’t matter on mobile !
Microsoft may make it matter by vastly improving its standards support , but mobile web developers are n’t required spend 30 % of their time squashing IE bugs .
Windows Mobile has only a 6 % market share , and many Windows Mobile devices already use Opera as default browser .
The ball is in Microsoft ’s court here .
Let ’s see what the Windows Phone will bring . )
Deployment
Once we ’ve solved the browser issues by applying progressive enhancement we need to deploy our HTML5 app to as many platforms as possible .
The simplest deployment mechanism is already in place and is called the World Wide Web .
All smartphones , and even a goodly part of the feature phones , contain a browser , so all their users can visit your website .
Still , sometimes a local HTML5 app makes more sense , particularly when the app uses quite large JavaScript files .
Avoiding a reload of those files every time the user starts up the app is well worth the effort .
Besides , a local app can also function when the user has no connectivity at all .
If we want to offer our HTML5 app as a local application , we need a deployment mechanism that ’s considerably more complicated than the WWW .
Still , this is not an impossible task .
In fact , Uxebu has done some ground - breaking work by deploying an HTML5 app in pretty much the way described below .
It was n’t always easy , but it works .
And now that we start to understand the basics it it will only get easier .
For local HTML5 apps W3C Widget packaging and configuration is the deployment mechanism of choice .
It will become the worldwide standard because it ’s already there , it makes sense , and it ’s close to becoming a formal specification .
Besides , many vendors are already hard at work implementing it .
W3C Widgets work on Vodafone S60 and Samsung phones , Opera desktop and mobile on any platform , the Bolt browser ( a thin - client solution like Opera Mini ) , and Windows Mobile 6.5 , while BlackBerry also supports them , though right now they need a special Java wrapper as an interface to the BlackBerry OS .
There ’s no reason to assume that the W3C Widget march will stop here .
Still , W3C Widgets are not enough for now .
They do n’t work on several platforms , most notably iPhone and Android , and that ’s where the Phonegap library enters the picture .
As a stop - gap measure it would become a deployment tool to make HTML5 apps available for the iPhone , Android , and BlackBerry platforms .
Its creators consider Phonegap to be temporary ; eventually all phones will have to support this sort of thing natively .
For now we need a library , though .
Apple Dashboard widgets and their close cousins the Nokia Widgets would also count as HTML5 apps .
They ’re nearly the same as W3C Widgets except that they require an info. plist instead of a config.xml .
Adding that file is of course trivial .
Besides , Nokia will switch to true W3C Widgets in the not - too - distant future .
On the iPhone ( and probably on other platforms , too ) a native app can contain a Safari instance .
Thus you can create a native app that still downloads its data from the Web , and combine some of the advantages of a native app with most of the advantages of an HTML5 app .
Then we need to study Palm ’s webOS , the appcache technique that works on iPhone , maybe the NetFront widget manager , as well as any way of getting HTML5 apps to work on Moblin and LiMo devices .
Yes , it ’s going to be complicated .
It ’s going to take time and effort .
It ’s also going to take automation .
I expect that in the not - too - distant future a clever web developer will create a site that gives people a way of uploading a core HTML5 app and automatically convert it to a W3C Widget , Phonegap - based native iPhone , Android , and BlackBerry apps , a Dashboard widget , a Palm webOS native app , plus any other platform - specific solution that is necessary .
Conclusion
Concluding , deployment is by far the most tricky problem that early HTML5 apps will run in to , and even there we have the beginnings of a solution .
Other than that there are n’t that many arguments against HTML5 apps .
As far as I ’m concerned the new buzzword will force all relevant parties in the mobile space to firmly opt for web standards , and that ’s what we all want , do n’t we ?

Listen , TLC , we know the " L " in your name used to stand for " Learning . "
You used to have shows that actually taught something — something other than that you can become nationally famous just for having a whole lot of kids , that is .
We 've watched your path move you steadily away from your original mission , and , as people who used to think highly of you , we feel like it 's up to us to show you how far you 've fallen .
So : TLC , this is an intervention .
Way back in the 1980s , you used to have more educational programming than your then - rival Discovery Channel .
Back then , the idea of having a show without a clear educational purpose would have been a non-starter for you .
Parents could have , and many probably did , turn their cable box to you and sit their kids in front of the TV , sure that their kids would learn something useful .
Can you imagine a parent doing such a thing now ?
Would you want your kids to watch Jon and Kate Gosselin in , well , anything — you know , if a cable network could have kids ?
Please do n't get us wrong : all of us here at GeekDad are huge fans of your owner , Discovery Communications .
While there are shows on your sibling networks that we think are more sensational than informative , that fact is mitigated by some of the incredibly good programs they show much of the time .
We wish we could say the same about you , but , alas , we can't think of any show you air that would counterbalance such content as " Say Yes to the Dress " or , worse , " Toddlers and Tiaras . "
We understand that your path has been shifted by the siren song of mass appeal .
We 're quite aware that " 19 Kids and Counting " and " What Not to Wear " draw more viewers than non-exploitative shows , and that more viewers equals more ad revenue .
We know that Discovery is a business , and businesses need to make money to survive .
But we see shows like " MythBusters , " " Dirty Jobs , " " The Deadliest Catch , " and " Life " on Discovery Channel , and we can only shake our heads at the kind of programming you show .
We understand why you feel you need to show what you do , but that fact still disappoints and saddens us .
It 's not too late for you to change !
You have the resources to produce quality , educational shows ; you 're just not using them .
If you put on good shows that teach as well as entertain , we promise to tune in , and to let our kids watch , too .
It 's not too late to put the " Learning " back in your name .
Thousands protested when the new law was introduced in 2009
An imam in Mali is living in fear after backing a new family law which no longer obliges wives to obey their husbands , angering Muslim groups .
He has received threatening phone calls and local Muslim leaders have tried to dismiss him .
The new law is currently being given a second reading in parliament after Mali 's president refused to sign it because of the Muslim protests .
More than 90 % of Mali 's population is Muslim .
In April , the imam of Kati , 15 km ( 9 miles ) north - west of the capital , Bamako , wrote a letter to Mali's High Islamic Council stating he saw nothing in the new family law which infringed the country 's social values , much less Islam , the BBC's Martin Vogl in Mali says .
The High Islamic Council has said imams can only be dismissed by their congregation and it is unclear what weight the decision by local Muslim leaders to sack the imam will have , our reporter explains .
But the incident has highlighted the intense feelings among Muslims towards the new family law .
Its most contentious provisions give more rights to women .
For example , under the law husbands and wives owe each other loyalty and protection rather than obedience , women get greater inheritance rights and the minimum age for girls to marry in most circumstances is raised to 18 .
When the law was introduced in August 2009 , the parliament building was attacked and it was difficult to find anyone to defend the law in public , our reporter says .
Mali's President Amadou Toumani
Toure said he was sending the law back to parliament for the sake of national unity .

The star of “ The Late , Late Show with Craig Ferguson ” took the long road to fame from his early days in the U.K. , where he carved out a career in music , theater , comedy and drinking .
That last bit ended in 1992 , when Ferguson noticed : “ If I have one beer , I wake up in Tijuana four days later with a tattoo and a sore ass . ”
He moved to Los Angeles in the mid-‘90s , snagging a role on “ The Drew Carey Show . ”
In 2005 , he took over as host of “ The Late , Late Show , ” three years later beating Conan O’Brien in the ratings and never looking back .
He also lent his voice to the role of Gobber in DreamWorks Animation ’s “ How to Train Your Dragon . ”
He sat down with TheWrap to talk about the late - night wars , inspirational words from Howard Stern , Paris Hilton and why he dresses like a ‘ 50s car salesman .
I ’d be remiss if we did n’t talk about the late - night wars .
I do n’t give a f— about the late - night wars .
You can quote me on that .
I do n’t even think that I do a late night show .
What I do is I do a TV show that goes on late at night .
If anybody thinks I ’m part of all that , they have n’t seen my show for more than five f—ing minutes .
So my opinion about how the business is run is really meaningless .
What I think is that the wake - up call for me , when it all broke down between Conan and Jay and stuff , is that there was a lesson there about trying to be something you ’re not .
Jay was trying to be some primetime guy , and he ’s not that .
And Conan was trying to be this kind of corporate thing , and he ain’t that .
It ’s like everybody f—s up when you try and not be what you want to be .
So here ’s what I ’m not .
I ’m not that guy .
I ’m not any of these dudes .
I ’m who I am and I do my show .
And if late night is a club , then I do n’t want to be a member .
What would you have done in Conan or Leno ’s place ?
Would you have just walked away ?
Yeah , I do n’t care about being a f—ing late night - talk show host .
What the f— do I care ?
I swear to God , you must hear this if you do n’t hear anything else : I genuinely do n’t give a f — .
I do this show because I like doing it and they pay me good money to do it .
I do n’t define myself by being on f—ing television .
If you define yourself by being on television , you ’re already f–ing lost .
And if they fire me , guess what , I ’ve been fired before and I ’ll f—ing live .
When you came to “ The Late , Late Show , ” did you look at what everybody else was doing and decide to go in the opposite direction ?
When I started , I wanted to fit in .
It was a five - minute conversation with Howard Stern .
He said , “ Now look , make it your own .
Make it your own or you ’ll die . ”
And he said , “ That ’ll be hard . ”
As I worked on the show , as I did n’t get canceled , little by little I started doing things with it .
It felt like the show was becoming more mine .
My show is n’t done .
My show is in process and it will continue to be in process until they cancel me , as they assuredly will .
Your numbers are good !
My numbers are fine but f— the numbers .
Numbers are n’t important .
Jay ’s numbers were great .
You seem to want to do things your own way .
That can be career suicide in this town .
It ’s a chance you take .
There ’s plenty of people that follow the rule and do n’t work anyway .
There ’ve been plenty of times in my life where I ’ve toed the line .
In “ How to Train Your Dragon , ” they say , “ I ’d like you to do this , ” I do it .
I ’m not some unreasonable f—ing maniac .
My job is to provide whatever they need at the time , then they take away and make it fit in the movie .
The nice thing about working with these guys is they kind of have a track record , DreamWorks .
So you do the script , you serve the story and you also throw whatever you can add to it .
Some they take and some they do n’t .
That ’s not true on your show …
There I do what I want .
And actually , as time goes on , I want to do more of that .
The bug in my ass I have at the moment is why am I dressed like a 1950s f—ing car salesman !?
It ’s like , ‘ Well , that ’s how guys dress ! ’
Well look , guess what , it ’s the 21st f— century , why am I dressed like a f—ing mortician ?!
Are you the next in line for when Dave Letterman retires ?
I ’d be lying if I said I have n’t thought about it .
But here ’s the thing : David Letterman does a fine job of being David Letterman .
I , however , have no interest ever in my life of being David Letterman or Jay Leno or Conan or anybody else .
If the network puts me on at any time of day , that ’s their f—ing choice , it ai n’t mine .
I have no ambition to change the timeslot of my show or to see the end of David Letterman ’s career .
To be honest with you , I think this is my golden time .
I ’d be intimidated to be a guest on your show .
You have to be on your toes .
Yeah , some guests are intimidated .
But my job is to make them , but not at the expense of the show .
So if the only thing that makes you comfortable is me asking you about your movie , do n’t come .
But if you can trust the fact that I am not trying to make you look stupid and I ’m not trying to make you look dumb — like , one of my favorite guests is Paris Hilton .
This is not a woman who ’s going to be picking up a Nobel Peace Prize .
She ’s not going to look any dumber on my show than she does anywhere else .
So why not just f— in ’ try and include her in the fun .
Do you ever have a guest who is just too slow to hang with you ?
Or do you ever have any get pissed off and lay into you ?
They tell their publicist to lay into my people , but they do n’t lay into me .
They ’re too smart for that .
It does n’t happen anymore .
They know what they ’re getting into .
I ’m not trying to make them look stupid .
And anyone who has the remotest sense of humor understands that if you ’re talking about business acumen , you want to sell your f—in ’ movie , sell yourself .
So if you come on and say , “ Everybody in show business loves each other , y’know .
We were all great friends on the set . ”
They know you ’re lying .
So , rather than do that , tell the truth .
Normally , homeschoolers are sprinkled here and there throughout cities and , due to this spotty distribution , they have little effect on mainstream parenting .
I have the rare good fortune to live in a neighborhood with seven other homeschooled families in it .
Our local playground is filled with children of all ages during school hours .
At the library , we often meet one another on sunny afternoons .
Last winter , we organized a homeschooling hockey clinic on Wednesdays after lunch at our community league rink .
When the sun was shining and our skates were carving up the ice , we could n’t help but feel sad that our children were the only ones out enjoying the beautiful weather .
We are the wild element , the bad example to schooled children !
We represent an alternative lifestyle .
When we get together en masse , we are a formidable crowd .
We provide living proof that not all children have to spend five days a week shut away from the larger community .
There are a lot of children in our neighborhood , but one by one the daytime access to these playmates dwindled as kindergarten and first grade claimed many of them .
Because of our presence , however , it ’s not uncommon to hear schooled children ask their parents , “ Why ca n’t I be a homeschooler ? ”
The kind of freedom unschooled children enjoy – no early bedtimes , sleeping in and no homework , to name just a few – must be perceived as a threat to mainstream parenting .
I assume that the parents whose kids are in school tolerate us .
Sometimes I ’m convinced they avoid us .
Probably they judge us .
Alternatively , they might just feel sorry for us .
They ca n’t imagine spending the entire day with their children .
So when their own kids inform them that not all children go to school , they likely have ample ammunition to justify the importance and necessity of doing curriculum and regular schooling .
Every now and then , however , their real thoughts about homeschooling slip out .
But that ’s okay because , as homeschoolers , many of us are engaged in the same comparison and judging of their children ’s schooled lives .
At times we mingle warily , at times freely .
Most importantly , to preserve relationships , we routinely keep our opinions to ourselves .
After all , every one of us believes we are doing what ’s best for our children .
No one way is perfect , and it does little good to create an “ us against them ” standoff , for even though the abundance of homeschoolers in my immediate vicinity suggests we ’re not a minority , I know that ’s not the case .
The peers my children will have as adults will likely have been schooled .
Some of them will have fared better than others .
Regardless of who went to school and who did n’t , they will be of the same generation and they will find common denominators in order to get along .
To my mind , parenting today is more challenging than ever before .
Perhaps at no other time in history has so much focus and attention been spent on analyzing how children develop , how they do n’t develop and what we need to do to get them to develop .
Sadly , today ’s children are diagnosed with all kinds of deficiencies and behavioral problems .
Professional pathologists analyze the speech of kindergarten children .
Reading tests are done at an increasingly younger level .
Schools practice lock - downs as commonly as fire drills .
One can almost feel the collective held breath of an entire community of schooled parents who desperately hope their child will not be the bullied one or the one singled out as a remedial student .
My children have never gone to school and , aside from asking once to go to a daycare that had enticing toys and a playground barred to them by a chain link fence , they have never voiced a desire to attend school .
Articles in magazines discuss the realities and pitfalls of competitive parenting .
Somewhere along the line we have lost our bearings .
Rampant individualism is replacing cooperative communities as more and more folks operate not collectively but as individual family units ( and even within these units , there is often a shocking lack of interaction ) .
The homeschooling community , because we routinely seek each other out for social activities , may be more cooperative out of necessity .
However , even though I ’m not drawn into discussions about what school is better , what teacher I wish my kids had or who is getting better marks , I am not immune to the anxieties and pitfalls that stem from contemporary parenting .
Perhaps this says more about me and my own insecurities than it does about homeschooling , which is an arena that challenges me in positive ways because I ca n’t blame the “ teachers ” if my kids do n’t appear to be learning anything .
I was n’t the mother who always knew she ’d homeschool her children .
Luckily for me , I had friends and neighbors who were already on the “ beam , ” so to speak , and who answered my many questions .
One friend said , “ I did n’t want someone else to have my children for the best hours of the day . ”
The coin dropped when I realized I did n’t want that either .
For the most part I am the happy life learning mother of three children aged nine , seven and five , and I ’m immensely grateful for the freedom and flexibility my family enjoys .
Not doing school - at - home or following any set curriculum enables us to set our own schedule , make spontaneous plans , lie low and read all day or pursue any old adventure that comes our way .
My children have never gone to school and , aside from asking once to go to a daycare that had enticing toys and a playground barred to them by a chain link fence , they have never voiced a desire to attend school .
Yet I must admit that there are days when I question my pedagogical beliefs within the homeschool community and wonder if I ’m giving my children enough .
I ’m not very “ crafty , ” you see , and , aside from music lessons , I avoid putting my children into activities that have pre-set learning outcomes .
However , parenting is not something done in isolation and I ’m always rubbing shoulders with parents whose children , schooled or homeschooled , are engaged in highly “ productive ” activities .
Sometimes I wish I had a Teflon shield ( “ force field UP ! ” ) that I could deploy to ward off well - intentioned bits of advice or to redirect the stressed vibes that emanate from highly - ambitious parents who seem to believe they know exactly what ’s best for their children .
On a good day I can easily protect my chosen family existence and defend it if need be .
However , on a bad day ( like when the children are fighting incessantly , the house is beyond chaotic or my patience is at an all time low ) I find myself falling victim to the belief that other people are doing far more interesting things with their children than I am .
While I ’m trying to lock myself in the bathroom for a moment ’s peace , these families are likely working on science projects , engaging in clay and woodworking instruction , taking sewing lessons or painting murals in their bedrooms .
By contrast , my days with my children are largely unstructured and unambitious .
My kids usually sleep in .
Sometimes we start the day by reading .
Sometimes they go their own way and listen to book tapes , play dollhouse , work on their Lego base or play hockey in the hall .
At some point in the day they ask when we can all go to a café ( yes , my need for an afternoon coffee has resulted in having three café kids ) .
I love the mornings that start slow and begin without any rushing whatsoever .
So why , then , if I ’m mostly content with my day - to - day life , do I have the tendency to compare my unschooling regime with that of others ?
Where does this underlying kernel of dissatisfaction or doubt come from ?
I guess I ’m not immune to the cult of competitive parenting that has contemporary families engaged in far too many activities .
Yet I consciously try to resist the mainstream map ( or trap ) that has parents running hither and yon , continually linked to a cell phone .
No , I think my impulse to compare stems from having a guilty conscience .
By not having my children in school , I feel like I ’m getting away with something big , that my family and I have somehow managed to slip between the cracks of the overly - scheduled world out there , and we are all laughing .
It ca n’t last , can it ?
The shoe ’s going to drop , is n’t it ?
But here ’s the glitch : I also have a guilty conscience because I enjoy leaving my children alone and waiting for them to initiate activities .
In fact , what unnerves me is that I think I do my best parenting when my children entertain themselves .
Abandoning the need to teach my kids specific subjects can , at times , make me feel negligent .
Should n’t I be taking a more hands - on approach to their learning ?
Should n’t I be introducing them to numerous new things each week to ensure that I do n’t miss any outstanding abilities they might have ?
Deep down , am I really a true believer in the unstructured life we lead as life learners or am I simply lazy ?
Is n’t unschooling , in a way , simply a gussied up form of unparenting ?
Sure , I cook with my children when they ask , and yeah , I chase the puck on the rinks with my boys and , okay , I can load stitches on a knitting needle for my daughter .
But I ’m also really happy when they do their own thing .
In fact , I ’m mostly operating on the belief that it ’s not my job to initiate great projects for my children .
I like to believe that giving them their freedom is the best thing I can do for them .
On good days , I do n’t feel guilty at all about letting them find ways to amuse themselves but on a bad day I think :
Should n’t a real homeschooler be more engaged with her children ?
Should n’t she have some kind of a “ plan ? ”
I usually suffer this educational crisis when I visit the home of a parent leading a more structured homeschooling life .
As we all know , there is a wide range of pedagogical beliefs in the homeschooling community and there ’s also no shortage of things to get involved in .
The daily choices can , in fact , be overwhelming .
By trying to keep life simple , I ’m hoping to slow down a little and create some kind of sustainable desire in day - to - day living .
So what if my kids spend their days listening to book tapes and building LEGO bases or drawing ?
So what if they play hair salon or pretend they ’re in a spaceship ?
Does it really matter if my eldest son can name all 30 NHL teams off the top of his head but has trouble remembering the ten provinces and three territories ?
( If only more expansion teams would come to Canada ! )
Am I failing him ?
Or will he figure it out on his own one day ?
It ’s important for me to remember that , to paraphrase the writer Allison McKee , not only am I unschooling my children but I ’m also unschooling myself .
The latter is the greater challenge of the two because when I succumb to doubts about the path I ’ve taken I know it stems from my own schooled childhood .
I received the gold stars .
I won the spelling bees .
My learning was structured so that I ’d always be told when it was time to do a history project or to hand in a book report .
Did I love school ?
No .
I just happened to be smart enough to get by without much effort .
From a parenting perspective , however , I look back on my own childhood with mild regret .
If I had n’t gone to school , what might I have done instead ?
A woman I know once told me her son had been a late talker .
“ If he did n’t talk to me , I did n’t talk to him , ” she laughed .
Yet he learned how to speak .
I believe the same thing will be true of my children .
If I do n’t lead or prompt them , they will naturally end up leading me and leading themselves .
Aside from asking them to play music on a daily basis , I ’m as hands - off as I can be , yet I ’m always around for guidance and assistance should my children ask for it .
That ’s the key thing – to have them ask .
I try not to pose the questions for them and I also try not to test them by asking them questions to which I already know the answers ( no easy task , that one ! ) .
When my youngest son , Levi , first began to write his name , he spelled it I - V - E - L. I was amazed !
He was learning his own letters !
I did n’t need to point out he ’d written his name backwards .
I knew he ’d figure it out on his own at some point , and he did .
However , to some people , the fact that I did n’t “ correct ” his writing ( “ No , Levi , you ’ve written your name backwards ; it ’s L - E - V - I ! ” ) would be seen as an act of unparenting .
For is n’t it my job or duty to correct him ?
Yes , if he came right out and asked , “ Is this right ? ”
But he never asked .
I remain convinced that many of my neighbors and acquaintances also believe my unschooling methods are a nifty way of unparenting .
My children , for instance , are often the only unparented ones playing outside .
Over the years my husband and I have taught them road safety and we certainly did our time on the sidewalk when they were really small .
Now we trust that all will be well .
If it ’s not , we expect one of the kids will come and find us .
But to the other parents on the block , our parenting likely looks negligent .
Little do they know how much time our children spend playing together while theirs are in school .
Even I must admit , however , that when my kids were outside in the dark one night at 11:15 enjoying a game of glow - in - the - dark wand tag I suddenly realized that my unschooling lifestyle could probably land me in trouble with social services or child welfare .
Should n’t they be in bed by that time or , at the very least , inside ?
Every now and then another parent will say something that gives me an insight into what they really think of homeschooling .
A friend of mine whose children go to school recently told me about the new piano teacher she had found .
For awhile , I was contemplating changing my daughter ’s instructor so I asked a few questions .
She replied that the teacher was pleased that her daughter went to school because she liked kids who had discipline in their lives .
“ I ’m not sure , ” she went on , “ what she ’d make of a homeschooler . ”
Of course she did n’t mean anything by it , but the comment revealed her belief that homeschoolers have no discipline in their lives .
What I wanted to ask , but did n’t , was how she thought a child learned “ discipline ” by being dropped off at school in the morning and having all her time structured for her until being released at 3:22 ?
Of course , my friend ’s brand of discipline is the popular one :
It means learning to do what you ’re told .
I would prefer to see discipline defined as the ability to structure one ’s time or , better yet , as the ability to handle freedom .
Most people believe that sending their children to school is easier than keeping them home , the theory being that daily separations help to replenish the supply of patience .
But it does n’t work that way .
Parenting has its own “ zone . ”
If you ’ve ever gone away for a day or two without your children , you ’ll know what I mean .
I return home thinking I ’ll be a deep well of patience but it takes me some time to get used to everybody talking at me simultaneously .
My husband , meanwhile , having been on his own , is in the “ zone . ”
One does n’t step in and out of parenting seamlessly .
Surprisingly , I have discovered that the more time I spend with my children , the easier it is to be with them .
School creates a whole host of problems that parents are willing to accept in order to procure their own “ freedom . ”
My siblings and I spent our childhoods going to school .
For ten months of the year we were separated five days a week , for the majority of the day .
When we returned home , we watched television or played with friends , then we had more “ school ” to do in the form of homework .
The parenting we received was transitional – we were transitioned to school , transitioned from school , then readied again for school .
Much of our out - of - school time was spent preparing for school .
I ’m telling you this to illustrate that unschooling my children is not a natural thing for me .
It ’s the “ schooled ” voice in my head that wants me to believe my children are n’t truly learning anything but , when I stop to question that belief , I see an abundance of proof that suggests the contrary .
It takes time to rid ourselves of the need to accomplish things educationally with our children .
How well I related to Allison McKee ’s anecdote in Unschooling Our Children , Unschooling Ourselves ( Life Learning , May / June 2006 ) when she admitted to taking over her son ’s pond project by suggesting ways he could better chart the changes .
Only later did she discover that by applying so many structures she completely deflated her son ’s sense of wonder and fascination with the initial idea .
But staying out of the way or minding my own business does not come naturally .
Hence the occasional doubt about unschooling and the inevitable fall that follows into believing that it ’s really a way of sanctioning unparenting .
The good news is that every time I go through a period of questioning my pedagogical beliefs I come out the other side with a renewed conviction that life learning is exactly what my family needs and benefits from .
It ’s the “ schooled ” voice in my head that wants me to believe my children are n’t truly learning anything but , when I stop to question that belief , I see an abundance of proof that suggests the contrary .
My eldest son Dashiell , for example , learned how to read on his own when he was eight .
He did n’t have to suffer through phonics or undergo any alphabet drills .
Again , it was his interest in hockey that got him going .
He wanted to be able to read the sports page on his own .
That same interest in sports has furthered his math and geography skills .
Why not get the world map out when watching the World Cup of Soccer to see how far some of the teams traveled ?
My daughter Sadie , at seven , is going through the same preliminary reading process that her older brother did .
Every day she asks me how to spell certain words as she writes her “ books ” and when we go on outings she often asks me to tell her what signs and advertisements say .
Sadly , she too will be reading soon .
I say sadly because , once children learn how to read , there is no going back to that time of innocence when they are immune to print culture , to reading everything from store and brand names to some of the smuttier graffiti around town .
I hope my daughter takes her time learning to read and I hope my youngest also does n’t break any early literacy records .
I routinely wince when I hear parents of schooled children complaining about the difficulty of getting their six - and seven - year - olds to read .
I wish I had the courage to tell them all just to leave their children alone .
What ’s the big rush ?
Children have an entire lifetime to be literate .
Their pre-literate life is so short .
In the long run , asking the “ big ” pedagogical questions is not a bad thing .
In fact , it ultimately strengthens and confirms my more intuitive convictions about unschooling .
I want to give my children a childhood that ’s not entirely governed by the clock .
I want them to have time to develop their imaginative worlds .
I want them to know that freedom from the daily grind is not something that necessarily stops once you become an adult .
And I want them to understand that a life in which one simply grins and bears it , because everyone else is doing the same thing , is not a life they need to lead .
I know that , to many parents who are leading a more mainstream life , my unschooling looks suspiciously like unparenting .
But if “ unparenting ” to them means having no set bedtime , no “ discipline ” and no real structured learning , so be it .
I know I ’ve found the right thing for my family .
And I still feel like we ’re getting away with something big .
Theresa Shea is the mother of three unschooled children .
Her poetry and non-fiction have appeared in several magazines and anthologies in Canada .
She has recently published her first novel .
An amateur violinist , Theresa spends much of her time trying to get her children to do their music practice .
Any free time she has generally involves drinking americanos in cafés , reading the latest in contemporary fiction and non-fiction , or homeschooling her new golden retriever puppy .
She lives in Edmonton , Alberta .
Comedy seems to work best when done in groups .
This is not just true of older comedy routines – most modern television comedy hits are such due to the supporting actors .
For example , Will and Grace would never have survived were it not for the character of Karen Walker .
This list looks at ten of the most prolific and most well known comedy teams .
It is perhaps a little light on the British comedy duos such as the Goons – but do feel free to name them all in the comments .
10 Amos and Andy
Voiced by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll , performing on the radio from 1928 all the way 1960 .
This sketch comedy act was based on turn of the century black minstrel acts , and the two voice artists depicted black people as poor , lower class menial workers , who eventually move from Georgia to Chicago and become taxi drivers .
At least once , in 1931 , when the Pittsburgh Courier took up the article of a black preacher who considered the show racially offensive ( since the two voice artists were white ) .
They tried to get a million names on a petition , in order to get the show canceled , but few people would sign it , not out of racial fear as much as out of enjoyment of the show .
The black leads are always shown to be very simple - minded , but very polite and good - natured , and smarter than the average white man .
They also thrived on malaprops , which are incorrect uses of a language .
One of George “ Kingfish ” Stevens ’s ( played by Gosden ) best such lines is , “ Heck , naw , I ai n’t gawn let my kids use no ‘ cyclopedia !
They kin walk to school like I did ! ”
This was subsequently blamed on Yogi Berra , who , never to be outdone , said , “ I did n’t say half the stuff I said . ”
9 Frick and Frack
Werner Groebli and Hans Mauch , respectively .
They were comedic figure skaters , both from Basel , Switzerland , and performed all over the world in lederhosen and traditional German “ Oktoberfest ” garb .
They performed in a few films , beginning with Lady , Let ’s Dance , in 1944 .
They never performed in the Olympics , but a lot of Olympic figure skaters think they would have been shoe-ins for gold medals .
“ Frick and Frack ” has become a household phrase in English , due to their popularity from the 1930s to the 1950s .
Some of the stunts they performed defy belief , most notably Frack ’s rubber legs , which were twisting , collapsing legs while skating in a spread - eagle .
Frick ’s signature move was a cantilever spread - eagle , which he invented .
8 The Smothers Brothers
Tommy Smothers always plays the slower buffoon to Dick Smothers ’s straight man .
Tommy ’s signature line was “ Mom always liked you best ! ” after which they would argue over whether that were true or not .
When their mother died , they never performed this routine again .
They are accomplished guitar players , and Tommy is a master of the yo- yo .
They have the distinction of being the longest - lived comedy team in American history , having performed for about 52 years .
During the late 1960s , they had their own show , “ The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , ” which was extremely controversial ( and funny ) because of their peace advocacy .
They regularly poked fun at the Vietnam War , President Nixon , and racism .
The show lasted an amazing 2 years , 1967 to 1969 , before being canceled for what CBS was forced to call “ Anti-American Peace Propaganda . ”
Ah , the ’60s .
7 Cheech and Chong
The hippies and counter - culturalists found their idols in the weed - smoking surrealists Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong .
They broke up in 1985 , but reunited in 2008 much to everyone ’s delight .
They made a number of films from 1978 through the 1980s , all having heavily to do with drug use , the free love of hippies , etc .
Arguably their best work is the 1983 film Still Smokin ’ , in which they travel to Amsterdam , Netherlands , for a film festival about Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton .
When the latter two stars do n’t show up , Cheech and Chong save the day with their own live stage performance .
One of the best bits is Chong as “ the old man in the park , ” and the duo as “ Ralph and Herbie the dogs . ”
6 Abbott and Costello
Bud Abbott played the straight man to Lou Costello , and even if they had only done one routine during their entire career , “ Who ’s on First ? ” would net them the # 6 spot .
They had already rehearsed it to perfection , but had not had a chance to perform it on stage .
The first televised performance of it was at the Steel Pier , in Atlantic City , New Jersey .
They had a few sheets of material written by someone else , and they did n’t think much of it , so Abbot asked Costello , “ You wanna do Baseball ? ” “ Yeah , let ’s do it . ”
And they walked out and made history .
It had been many times since before the radio days of burlesque vaudeville , with the simple gag of Who and What being proper nouns .
Abbott and Costello were the first to hone it into its modern form of a baseball team ’s names .
They copyrighted it , and performed it several times in different films .
None of this mentions the host of other outstanding performances to their credit .
5 Laurel and Hardy
Well known to film buffs today as a duo of true friends .
They were vaudevillians , in countless silent films together and separate , before teaming up in 1927 , and remained together until Hardy ’s death in 1957 , appearing in a lot of films .
By the 1950s , their healths were declining rapidly , and they no longer looked like their old selves .
They were masters of slapstick , and an interesting idea that Laurel called “ white magic . ”
A good example is in the film Way Out West , from 1937 , one of their most famous , in which Laurel ( the thin one ) makes a fist , pours tobacco into it , flicks up his thumb and lights it , then blows real smoke out of his fist .
Hardy proceeds to try duplicating it throughout the film , getting it right at the end , and freaking out about burning his thumb .
They also have a famous soft - shoe dance number in this film .
4 Monty Python
Britain’s , arguably the world ’s , most irreverent comedy team so far , appearing on stage and in films from the late 1960s through the 1980s .
Their films are still extremely popular , and very funny , the most famous of which is probably Monty Python and the Holy Grail .
In it , King Arthur and his knights of Camelot , who eat ham and jam and spam a lot , traipse all over the English countryside looking for the Holy Grail , encountering a particularly tough Black Knight , a riddle - posing bridge guard , and God Himself .
They have no horses , but at least they have coconuts to sound like horses , which a Cockney castle wall guard reminds them are not quite the same as horses .
The conversation goes downhill thence .
Their stage work is comparatively unheralded in America , but you can find a lot of it on YouTube .
It is some of their very finest work .
This lister ’s favorite is a bit involving a man who ’s just lost his mother , trying to get a mortician to bury her .
The mortician replies that the mortuary can cook her or bury her , or dump in her the Thames .
In finally ends with the mortician saying that he ’ll cook her , the son can eat her , and then they ’ll dig a grave and he can throw up in it .
3 The Three Stooges
The most well known artists of slapstick in history were Moe and Curly Howard , and Larry Fine .
Curly died of a stroke in 1952 , and several people were chosen as replacements for a few more years , but it was never quite as good without him .
Moe was the straight man , Curly the comedian , and Larry was something of both .
Some of their gags are as physically demanding and dangerous as stunts you might see in a Looney Tunes cartoon .
Curly or Larry would accidentally smack
Moe in the head with something made of metal , and he would respond angrily , sometimes running a ripsaw over their heads , or smacking them with hammers .
Their slap gags are always uproarious , and one of their most famous moments comes in the short Micro- phonies , from 1945 , in which they lip - synch to the Sextet from Lucia di Lammermoor .
2 Martin and Lewis
Martin was the straight man to Lewis ’s utmost in zaniness .
From 1946 to 1956 , they were the pinnacle of the comedy world in Hollywood , performing around the country and in films .
Martin was one of the finest crooners in history , but Lewis could belt out a song when he wanted .
They could do it all , sing , dance , slapstick , vaudeville jokes , stand - up , and outstanding ad - lib segments .
Their patented sketch was a Martin crooner , into which Lewis would walk with a silly face , and continue to interrupt him while he sang .
1 The Marx Brothers
Modern comedians of all kinds , stand - up , sitcom , sketch , film and stage , look on the Marx Brothers with awe at how brilliant they were at every aspect of comedy .
They grew as vaudeville performers , and although they could n’t tapdance , they could certainly do everything else , and this lister means EVERYTHING .
Harpo played the harp better than most professionals , and he taught himself by ear .
His form was all wrong , but professionals came to him for instruction on how to play like him .
Groucho was a fine singer , and usually sent himself up as a horrible singer .
Chico could play the piano effortlessly , and was loved for his “ shooting the keys ” manner of playing , seen in A Night at the Opera , among others .
Groucho’s one - liners and insults run throughout all their films and are still the stuff of legend .
His greasepaint eyebrows and mustache are part of the classic Halloween , or gag glasses , with huge nose , that kids like to wear , or cartoons use to hide identities .
Harpo ’s voice was a rich baritone , and too low for his clownish persona , so he elected never to speak , except a few times at ceremonies , and on a talk show in the 1970s .
This was one of his finest jokes , since he was begged to finally say something , and once he got going , the talk show host could not shut him up for a good 15 minutes .
Chico ’s name should be pronounced “ Chick - O ” not “ Cheek - O , ” because he was the brother all the chicks were after ( according to him ) .
He was also a gamblaholic , and they made some of their films just to pay off his debts .
According to the late , great George Carlin , Groucho Marx told by far the funniest “ Aristocrats ” joke in history .
It ’s a notoriously dirty joke told from the turn of the century , by comedians who ad - lib the nastiest filth they can think of , and then end with the stupid punch - line “ The Aristocrats ! ”
Groucho did n’t care for dirty jokes , preferring clean jokes , in which more art is required to get a laugh .
When asked about his version of it , he replied , “ Well , bestiality ’s not all that dirty . ”
Their performances in A Night at the Opera and Duck Soup are their finest efforts .
The former includes the famous stateroom scene , the complete destruction of a production of Verdi’s Il Trovatore , and “ The First Party of the First Part ” sequence between Groucho and Chico .
The latter includes their legendary mirror scene , the lemonade stand , their combat spoof ( Groucho wears an American Civil War hat , then a coonskin cap , then a Napoleon hat , etc. ) and their parody of Paul Revere ’s Ride .
They used a running joke throughout their films involving their meager accommodations growing up .
Whenever they spot food in a film , they dash madly around the set , getting to the table , where they devour everything in sight , even their clothing .
It ’s been 20 years since the world lost Jim Henson , and I still ca n’t think about it without tearing up a bit .
His death at age 53 was sudden and catastrophic , like being hit by lightning on a cloudless day .
Along with countless others around the world who had never met him , I felt like a close friend was gone .

Five of my fellow GeekDads and I have put together this article as a tribute to his memory .
On the following pages are our thoughts on this anniversary of his passing , and at the end are videos from his memorial service in 1990 , which are some of the saddest and most wonderful things you are ever likely to see .
Please take a few minutes to read and watch , and then add your own tribute in the comments .
This is my now - six - year - old , back when she was about 2 1/2 , at the Children ’s Museum in Portland , Oregon .
They were having a Sesame Street exhibit , and in one of the stations , kids could dress as a furry Muppet .
There was also a bit with a blue screen behind a brick half - wall , so you could appear on the TV with various Muppets , just like other little kids from the show .
My daughter at this point had n’t watched much TV before , but she loved being on TV and it did n’t seem to bother her at all that there was n’t an actual Muppet next to her .
I remember growing up with two Sesame Street books in particular : The Monster at the End of This Book ( starring Grover ) and Cookie Monster and the Cookie Tree .
I managed to find copies of both books when my daughter was little , and I loved reading it to her and doing the voices .
( I can manage a pretty good Grover and Cookie Monster , sometimes Ernie , and I get by on the rest . )
More recently , when I was helping with an after - school program and trying to read books to second - and third - graders , I discovered one day that the only thing that got them to sit still and listen was when I read a book as Grover .
They were immediately hooked .

When I think about Jim Henson , I think about my childhood , Muppets and his ’70s sense of style .
I think about his voice , which he changed slightly ( or more than slightly ) for Kermit , Ernie , The Swedish Chef and others .
I grew up watching Sesame Street and The Muppet Show , Emmet Otter ’s Jug - Band Christmas , and later Fraggle Rock , so I knew Jim Henson ’s work very well .
We even had two Sesame Street records that we listened to until they were filled with skips .
I still have them to this day .
As a grown - up , I bought some Sesame Street music on CD .
Knowing that Jim Henson died far too early in life , the song “ I Do n’t Want to Live on the Moon ” never fails to bring me to tears .
It is an interesting song , and does n’t have particularly sad lyrics .
But the music is so melancholic , and it is sung by Jim Henson , so it always makes me sad , but in a happy way .
He left behind so much beautiful work , and he brought joy to so many millions of children .
Fortunately , his company continues to do so .
Now that I have kids of my own , I ’ve been delighted to share my love of Jim Henson ’s work with them .
We get The Muppet Show from Netflix , we watch Fraggle Rock on the DVDs I bought many years ago .
But at the same time , the older I get , the more sad I get about Jim Henson ’s death .
I realize more and more just how much we have missed out on all these years , not having him with us to make more wonderful things .
He was such a champion for kids ’ television programming , and he created such wonderful worlds for us and our children .
Thank you , Jim Henson .
Your life touched mine , and countless others .

I was born in 1976 , the same year The Muppet Show premiered on CBS .
It was a simpler time ; we had no commercial internet , an almost obscene number of telephones were still rotary and television was limited in most areas to around a half - dozen measly channels .
We Gen Xers prefer to paint this era as the golden age of children ’s entertainment , but , as is often the case with nostalgia , we delude ourselves .
Still , Jim Henson ’s Muppets were one of a few blessed exceptions .
Whether they were teaching us about life ( and death ) on Sesame Street or dazzling us with parody skits in prime time , the Muppets truly connected with viewers .
They spoke to us .
Every kid of my generation had a favorite .
Some related to the good - natured but neurotic Kermit the Frog ; others , the affable second banana Fozzie Bear , and even relatively underexposed characters like The Swedish Chef had their rabid fans .
While I was ( and remain ) more of a Gonzo the Great kind of guy in real life , my Muppet of choice was understated wise - ass Rowlf the Dog .
Though Rowlf is likely remembered as the cast ’s pianist and occasional soap opera star , his defining moment , for me at least , occurs in 1979 ’s The Muppet Movie .
Therein , this humble canine , cast as a player at a piano bar , sings a duet with Kermit entitled “ I Hope That Somethin ’ Better Comes Along . ”
It ’s a simple scene meant to introduce Rowlf as a secondary character as much as it is to expound upon the romantic problems inherent in a frog - pig relationship , but it does so much more .
It does n’t merely paint Rowlf as a sympathetic ear for our green hero ; it establishes him as a complex character with a strong ( if slightly misogynistic ) personal philosophy .
Performed and voiced by Henson himself , Rowlf disappeared from the land of Muppets after his master ’s death , and , when he returned , was sadly silent .
In recent years , he has once again began to speak and have an active role in that special brand of madness that only Muppets can create , but longtime fans realize that the Rowlf of old is truly no more .
Still , we make do with this new iteration .
At least until somethin’ better comes along .

I ’ve only got two words to say about Jim Henson .
Actually , it ’s one word repeated :
Mahnà Mahnà !
I remember when the episode was on TV back in the day , sitting with my younger sister giggling along beside me , as the two pink fluffy things and orange - haired dude ran through the number .
I remember the school playground the next day , everyone running around singing it — it ’s not like the lyrics were hard to learn .
I remember hearing the song on the radio a few weeks later and being so excited when I learned that you could buy a “ record ” and be able to play it whenever you liked .
I hounded my parents non -stop until they brought it .
I never knew then that it was originally from a film about “ wild sexual activity and other behaviour in Sweden . ”
I remember watching The Muppet Show whenever it was on in the vague hope that the episode would be repeated , these were the dark ages before home video and multichannel cable or satellite .
Years later , when The Muppet Show was finally released on video and then DVD , I finally got to relive the experience .
The “ best of ” DVD has been staple viewing for my little girl now since she was born .
I ’d much rather put it on for her to watch than Fifi or even Shaun the Sheep .
And thanks to YouTube , we can pull it up at a moment ’s notice if we ’re away from the house .
Whenever we go on a car journey longer than 10 minutes , I always hear a request from the backseat for mahna , mahna , closely followed by , “ you be the boy and I ’ll be the girls ” and then we sing a lovely duet as we go along , bobbing our heads — I dread to think what any onlookers might make it , but that does n’t stop us .
The MP3 is the most played track in my iTunes library and I can now sing along with the ad - lib stylings of the main man .
And we even do the Statler and Waldorf skit on the end of the track , too .
So , thank you Jim Henson , for “ Mahnà Mahnà , ” “ Put Da Lime in the Coconut ” and all of the other great songs on the most sensational , celebrational , muppetational Muppet Show !
— Nathan Barry
The Dark Crystal was one of the first fantasy films I ever saw , and one that portrayed an alternate world — with unique creatures and flora and fauna — to a degree I never had imagined possible .
I can still remember sitting on our plaid couch sometime in the mid-’80s , leaning over , hearing and watching the humming Mystics shamble across the screen , recoiling in horror at the Skeksis , and cheering for Jen and Kira the entire way .
The film really affected me , it resonated deeply on an emotional level , and no matter how many times I watch it , I feel the same way .
It simply moves me .
What ’s even more important is that it has all the perfect ingredients for children ’s fantasy and never shies away from elements of horror and deeper philosophy .
That I ’m a speculative fiction writer today is not surprising .
Between Henson ’s The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth ( a good film , but not as great as The Dark Crystal , in my mind ) I learned very early on just how powerful fantasy can be , just how remarkably it can remove us from the world we know and place us somewhere else — and I wanted in .
For his time , Henson ’s vision was immense .
We can harp on and on about special effects of today , but Henson was nothing short of genius , given what he had access to .
And that ’s not even to point out the sheer quality of his storytelling , his willingness to question our perceptions of good and evil — something that many blockbuster science fiction and fantasy films today can’t ( and do n’t ) even touch .
— Natania Barron
The Muppets have been part of my life for as long as I can remember .
I grew up watching Sesame Street , and later The Muppet Show and the various movies and other series .
I ca n’t imagine how different my life now would be without them , because I can only picture figurative holes in it shaped like Kermit , Ernie , Rowlf and the Swedish Chef .
I ca n’t even imagine what Jim Henson would have done if he ’d grown up before television came along .
The Muppets began as a TV show and sketches on variety shows , moved into commercials , and then of course blossomed into the phenomenon they still are today .
Their staying power has been proved time and again , with their incredible cover of “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” taking the internet by storm .
I was 17 when I heard Jim Henson had died .
It seemed impossible : He was Kermit , and Kermit was always there .
He was only a few years older than my parents , so what kind of world was it where someone that young and that brilliant could die ?
I was , truly , as sad as I would have been if a friend had died suddenly , and felt the loss as keenly .
I was angry , too , when I heard that he had died of untreated pneumonia , angry that he had n’t gone to the doctor .
Angry that the Muppets would never be the same .
I ’m not angry any more , but the sadness is still there .
I feel it every time I see — or , more accurately , hear — any of the characters he used to play .
I do n’t envy Steve Whitmire his job :
How hard must it have been to pick up Kermit the first time after Henson ’s death , put his hand inside the sleeve , and try to sound as much like Henson as possible ?
I ’m glad that the Muppets , and Henson ’s former characters , are still around .
But they will never quite be the same .

Well folks , it ’s been a while , but Netflix has finally added several more Criterion Collection films to their Watch Instantly streaming options .
Back in December we saw a rather large group of films added , with each following month adding fewer and fewer Criterion films .
This past week has seen the addition of 8 films ( one on April 1st , and 7 on the 3rd ) , all of which you should add to your Queue .
We recently reported that Jean Luc Godard ’s Breathless would be re-released in theaters with a new transfer this month as part of the TCM Classic Film Festival , with a general release at the end of May in New York , and a national roll out afterwards .
You can now see the film that made our writer James McCormick ’s Top Ten Jean Paul Belmondo Film list , via Watch Instantly .
It will be interesting to see if this print of the film is the new restored copy , as we saw with the recent addition of the Red Shoes , or if it will be the older version .
Also available on April 3rd , Orson Welles F For Fake ( read about the new , animated Orson Welles project here ) , which we ’ll be discussing on an upcoming episode .
The Chantal Ackerman film , Jeanne Dielman , is also now available for all of your foodie viewing pleasures .
Yasujiro Ozu ’s film Late Spring , which we discussed way back in Episode 9 , is also available .
This film was loved all around by us on that episode , and I cannot wait to re-watch it in all of its heart - breaking glory .
When Criterion recently released Max Ophul ’s Lola Montes , I was a little unsure as to what to expect from this release , not having seen any of his previous works .
I can safely say that this film leapt directly into my heart , with its charming , and eventually heart breaking tale of this lovely , titular character .
You can hear me discuss it in several of our past episodes , primarily this Disc 2 .
Finally , you can now add Jules Dassin ’s Night and the City , Fritz Lang ’s The Testament of Dr. Mabuse , and Alexander Korda ’s That Hamilton Woman , to your Netflix Watch Instantly queue .
With the recent announcement that Netflix would be creating an iPad application , I ’d imagine that we ’ll see an upswing in subscriptions , just for the ability to stream these incredible films wherever you might find yourself with Wi-fi .
Which of these films are you most excited about adding to your queue ?
Did you find any of the transfers particularly beautiful or horrendous ?
Let us know in the comments below .
Also , on a related note , we have , in conjunction with Zac Schellhardt , created a page linking to every Criterion film on Netflix , with notes as to whether they are available with a streaming option .
For those interested in keeping an eye on what is coming to Netflix Watch Instantly , I ’d recommend checking out Feed Fliks .
Below you can click both the title and the cover art , and find yourself transported magically to Netflix to view these films .
Breathless
There was before Breathless , and there was after Breathless .
With its lack of polish , surplus of attitude , crackling personalities of rising stars Jean - Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg , and anything - goes crime narrative , Jean - Luc Godard ‘s debut fashioned a simultaneous homage to and critique of the American film genres that influenced and rocked him as a film writer for Cahiers du cinéma .
Jazzy , free - form , and sexy , Breathless ( Ã€ bout de souffle ) helped launch the French New Wave and ensured cinema would never be the same .
F For Fake Trickery .
Deceit .
Magic .
In Orson Welles ‘s free - form documentary F for Fake , the legendary filmmaker ( and self - described charlatan ) gleefully engages the central preoccupation of his career ’” the tenuous line between truth and illusion , art and lies .
Beginning with portraits of world - renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer , Clifford Irving , Welles embarks on a dizzying cinematic journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes ’” not the least of whom is Welles himself .
Charming and inventive , F for Fake is an inspired prank and a searching examination of the essential duplicity of cinema .
Jeanne Dielman
A singular work in film history , Chantal Akerman ‘s Jeanne Dielman , 23 , quai du Commerce , 1080 Bruxelles meticulously details , with a sense of impending doom , the daily routine of a middle - aged widow ’” whose chores include making the beds , cooking dinner for her son , and turning the occasional trick .
In its enormous spareness , Akerman ’s film seems simple , but it encompasses an entire world .
Whether seen as an exacting character study or one of cinema ’s most hypnotic and complete depictions of space and time , Jeanne Dielman is an astonishing , compelling movie experiment , one that has been analyzed and argued over for decades .
Late Spring
One of the most powerful of Yasujiro Ozu ‘s family portraits , Late Spring tells the story of a widowed father who feels compelled to marry off his beloved only daughter .
Eminent Ozu players Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara command this poignant tale of love and loss in postwar Japan , which remains as potent today as ever ’” almost alone justifying Ozu ’s inclusion in the pantheon of cinema ’s greatest directors .
Lola Montes Lola MontÃ¨s is a visually ravishing , narratively daring dramatization of the life of the notorious courtesan and showgirl , played by Martine Carol .
With his customary cinematographic flourish and , for the first time , vibrant color , Max Ophuls charts the course of MontÃ¨s ’s scandalous past through the invocations of the bombastic ringmaster ( Peter Ustinov ) of the American circus where she has ended up performing .
Ophuls ’s final film , Lola MontÃ¨s is at once a magnificent romantic melodrama , a meditation on the lurid fascination with celebrity , and a one - of - a - kind movie spectacle .
Night and the City Two - bit hustler Harry Fabian ( Richard Widmark ) aches for a life of ease and plenty .
Trailed by an inglorious history of go - nowhere schemes , he stumbles upon a chance of a lifetime in the form of legendary wrestler Gregorius the Great ( Stanislaus Zbyszko ) .
But there is no easy money in this underworld of shifting alliances , bottomless graft , and pummeled flesh ’ “ ’“ and Fabian soon learns the horrible price of his ambition .
Luminously shot in the streets of London , Jules Dassin‘s Night and the City is film noir of the first order and one of the director ’s crowning achievements .
The Testament of Dr. Mabuse Locked away in an asylum for a decade and teetering between life and death , the criminal mastermind Doctor Mabuse ( Rudolf Klein - Rogge ) has scribbled his last will and testament : a manifesto establishing a future empire of crime .
When the document ’s nefarious writings start leading to terrifying parallels in reality , it ’s up to Berlin ’s star detective , Inspector Lohmann ( Otto Wernicke , reprising his role from M ) to connect the most fragmented , maddening clues in a case unlike any other .
A sequel to his enormously successful silent film Dr. Mabuse : The Gambler , Fritz Lang ’s The Testament of Dr. Mabuse reunites the director with the character that had effectively launched his career .
Lang put slogans and ideas expounded by the Nazis into the mouth of a madman , warning his audience of an imminent menace , which was soon to become a reality .
Nazi Minister of Information Joseph Goebbels saw the film as an instruction manual for terrorist action against the government and banned it for ‘ endangering public order and security .’
A landmark of mystery and suspense for countless espionage and noir thrillers to come , this is the complete , uncut original director ’s version in a stunning new transfer .
First prize , a new car .
Second prize , you 're fired .

When I grew up , it was hard to get a trophy .
To get one in sports , you had to play in a competition with a large number of teams and come in at least second , if not first .
Even more vividly , I remember the ice cream .
To get an ice cream after the little league baseball games , you had to win the game .
Not tie , not come in close , but win .
I remember clear as day my Little League team losing the first 5 games and not getting an ice cream at Friendly ’s or Carvel for the whole first month .
But when we did get it , it tasted sweet .
Sometime after my generation , everybody became a winner just for trying .
Everybody got an ice cream .
Everybody who participated got a trophy .
It was n’t about winning or losing but about trying hard .
It sometimes feels like this attitude has crept into the psyche of some entrepreneurs .
I respect nothing more than someone who quits a safe job and takes a huge risk to start something new .
I did and I know how scary it can be .
But startups are a brutal business , where few make money and many lose .
The following are situations where I find myself having to tread carefully when I know what the right answer is .
1 ) Do n’t tell me my idea wo n’t work
The right answer : Look , I do not know for certain as I have been wrong before , but I am highly confident your idea will not work or ever get funded .
The key to being a venture capitalist is pattern recognition .
I have seen what you are trying to do many times in many industries , and it has never worked .
There is a small chance that I am wrong , but a much larger chance that you are about to waste years of your life .
What I feel I am supposed to say :
It ’s an interesting idea but we cannot fund it at the current time .
Why ?
Because it would be hurtful to say that I do n’t believe the idea wo n’t work .
But maybe being truthful would save this entrepreneur years of his career or his life savings .
If I tell the truth though , then I am arrogant or dismissive .
I gain a reputation as being a jerk and wo n’t see the more interesting deals .
So , what is the upside for me to tell the truth ?
2 ) Do n’t tell me I am not an entrepreneur
The right answer : Look , if you are telling me that you do n’t want to take any risk in your job and need at least the same amount of cash as when you worked for IBM , you are not an entrepreneur .
Startup guys ( and gals ) take a lower cash salary for the higher upside they get in stock .
They love working without a bureaucracy , contributing concrete results , are okay making do with less and having no staff .
What I feel I am supposed to say :
You have a great background ; sorry we have no openings right now at our portfolio companies .
Why ?
Because it would be hurtful to tell the truth .
But , by not telling the truth , certain people will continue to seek jobs where they will not excel and will likely get fired .
But if I tell people that , again , I will be called an arrogant jerk .
So what is the upside for me to tell the truth ?
3 ) Give me a follow - on as convertible debt
The right answer : Look , you have missed your budget or tried a different business model .
You are not worth as much as the last time I invested but I still want to back you because I believe in you .
Go out to the market and get a term sheet from an outsider .
That will be the right price for the company at this time .
I will do my part once new money has set a price .
But do n’t push me to give you convertible debt at a price that both you and I know is too high .
What I am supposed to say : Go to market and get a term sheet .
I do n’t know whether you are worth more than the last round or less , but we need to let the market decide it .
If you ca n’t then I will likely support you anyway .
Why ?
Nobody wants to admit their pride and joy is not performing while the team tried really hard .
But , get ready to be known as a monster if you try to explain to the CEO what the company is really worth right now .
4 ) Do n’t disagree with me on selling the company
The right answer :
When you ( the CEO ) raised money from me at $ 25 million post , you showed me how you were going to sell it for $ 200 mm or more .
Now , you have an offer for $ 30 mm to sell the company and you are upset when I am unenthusiastic .
Why ?
Because you personally own 20 % of the company and will make $ 6 mm .
I get back $ 6 mm on my $ 5 mm investment , for a profit of $ 1 mm after x number of years , leading to a poor return , on a company I believe has a huge upside .
It is not a good deal for me as an investor , and you promised you would n’t sell it at a cheap price like this .
Now that you can put away $ 6 mm personally , however , you do n’t care what you told me .
If I try to block the deal using the terms we both agreed on when I invested , I am an ogre , a financial engineer who does n’t understand entrepreneurs .
But I am the one holding true to my word , you are n’t .
What I am supposed to say : I really think there is a huge upside to this business and believe we may be selling it prematurely .
Why ?
Who wants to be called an ogre .
5 ) Pay me a bonus whether I hit my plan or not
The right answer :
It is a pay - for - performance job and if the company does n’t perform , then investors and our limited partners make no money .
You have a guaranteed performance bonus and you missed it .
It does n’t matter if you tried really hard .
You did n’t win , you lost .
What I am supposed to say : Yes , you tried very hard and we will come up with a bonus that reflects your efforts .
Why ?
Perhaps in part because I need to keep the employees that are critical to the business , but increasingly often it has more to do with an expectation that trying hard = winning .
This is a black and white business .
You either make money or you do n’t .
Somewhere along the line , being politically correct has entered the fray .
And when that happens , people stop communicating honestly .
Bad things tend to follow .

DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings forward Patrick Eaves will sit out his second game in a row tonight against San Jose due to an elbow injury .
Coach Mike Babcock said he was planning on using the same lineup for Game 3 that he did in Game 2 , " at this point . ''
So Jason Williams is in for Eaves again .
" Patrick Eaves for us is a forechecking , banging , penalty - killer .
Thats ' where the adjustment is , '' Babcock said .
" When you take 10 penalties in a game you can use a penalty - killer .
Our plan tonight is to not take any penalties , so we do n't have to worry about it as much . ''
Defenseman Brian Rafalski ( back ) did n't skate , but that 's been common the last two weeks .
He will play tonight .
The Red Wings skated with the same line combinations they used the last game :
Franzen - Datsyuk- Holmstrom
Filppula - Zetterberg - Bertuzzi ( fixed )
Draper - Helm - Cleary
Miller - Abdelkader - Williams
The defense pairs are expected to be the same :
Lidstrom - Rafalski
Kronwall - Stuart
Ericsson - Lilja
Tonight 's referees are Marc Joanette and Dan O'Rourke .
These days , when media focus is on the panic surrounding Greek debt , the Icelandic drama is largely forgotten .
When Iceland is mentioned it is usually related to the recent Volcano eruption , and not its 2008 meltdown and its repercussions .
But the problems have not disappeared , contrary to the presictions of prominent pro-inflationist columnists Consider first of all the collapse in real wages for Icelandic workers .
Average hourly earnings rose in nominal terms by 3.6 % between March 2009 and March 2010 , after having risen by 5.5 % between March 2008 and March 2009 .
As a result the cumulative 2 year increase is 9.3 % , not so bad , eh ?
Or actually , yes , it is bad , since consumer prices rose 11.6 % between March 2009 and March 2010 , after having risen by 19.9 % between March 2008 and March 2009 .
As a result , real wages fell 7.2 % in the latest year , after having fallen 12 % during the previous year , for a cumulative 2 year decline of 18.3 % .
An 18.3 % decline in real hourly earnings would by itself be more than bad enough , but it gets worse as Icelandic workers that have kept their jobs have also seen a decline in the number of hours they get to work , meaning that their real weekly / monthly pay declined even more .
With the average work week declining by 5.5 % , from 41.9 to 39.6 hours , this implies a decline in real earnings for workers who have kept their jobs of 22.8 % .
And it gets even worse if you consider that the employment rate fell from 81.3 % in 2007 to 75.1 % in 2009 .
Add that into the equation , and you 'll find that the average real pay of all people in Iceland fell by as much as 28.7 % .
And note that all of these numbers reflect on the situation before the Volcano eruption ( whose effect on the Icelandic economy is unclear , but probably negative ) , so it can't be blamed on that .
The lesson here is that having your own currency , and the ability and will to seriously debase its value , is not something which will enable you to escape negative consequences of economic mismanagement , as some claim is the conclusion to be reached from the Greek debt panic .

A lung - less frog and a slug that shoots love darts :
Just two of the 123 new species found in Borneo rainforest since 2007
A lung - less frog , a frog that flies and a slug that shoots love darts are among 123 new species found in Borneo since 2007 in a project to conserve one of the oldest rainforests in the world .
The global conservation group World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) has called for protecting the threatened species and equatorial rain forest on Borneo , the South China Sea island that is the world 's third - largest and is shared by Malaysia , Indonesia and Brunei .
' The challenge is to ensure that these precious landscapes are still intact for future generations , ' said a WWF report released today .
No lungs : Known as the Barbourula kalimantanensis and discovered in 2008 , this flat - headed frog breathes entirely through its skin .
It is among 123 new species found in Borneo since 2007
The search for the new species was part of the Heart of Borneo project that started in February 2007 and is backed by the WWF and the three countries that share the island .
The aim is to conserve 85,000 square miles of rain forest that was described by Charles Darwin as ' one great luxuriant hothouse made by nature for herself ' .
Explorers have been visiting Borneo for centuries , but vast tracts of its interior are yet to be biologically explored , said Adam Tomasek , leader of WWF 's Heart of Borneo project .
He said : ' If this stretch of irreplaceable rain forest can be conserved for our children , the promise of more discoveries must be a tantalizing one for the next generation of researchers to contemplate . '
Dendrelaphis kopsteini :
This snake has an almost flame - like neck colouration that gradually fuses into a vivid blue , green and brown pattern .
When threatened it flares its nape , revealing bright orange colours
Ibycus rachelae :
This slug uses ' love darts ' made of calcium carbonate to pierce and inject a hormone into a mate to increase the chances of reproduction
The scientists ' discoveries include the world 's longest known stick insect at 56.7 cm , a flame - coloured snake and a frog that flies and changes its skin and eye colour .
In total , 67 plants , 29 invertebrates , 17 fish , five frogs , three snakes and two lizards and a brand new species of bird were discovered , said the report .
Borneo has long been known as a hub for monster insects , including giant cockroaches about 10 cm long .
Flying frog :
The Rhacophorus Penanorum changes colour at night
Notable among the species discovered are :
A snake that has a bright orange , almost flame - like , neck colouration that gradually fuses into an extraordinary iridescent and vivid blue , green and brown pattern .
When threatened it flares its nape , revealing bright orange colours
A frog that breathes through its skin because it has no lungs , which makes it appear flat .
This aerodynamic shape allows the frogs to move swiftly in fast flowing streams .
Although the species was discovered in 1978 , it was only now that scientists found the frog has no lungs
A high - altitude slug found on Mount Kinabalu that has a tail three times the length of its head .
They shoot calcium carbonate ' love darts ' during courtship to inject a hormone into a mate .
While resting , the slug wraps its long tail around its body .
The Heart of Borneo , the core island area the conservation effort targets , is home to ten species of primate , more than 350 birds , 150 reptiles and amphibians and a staggering 10,000 plants that are found nowhere else in the world , the report says .
Phobaeticus chani :
Now officially the world 's longest stick insect , it measures 56.7 cm long with a body of 35.7 cm ) .
Only three have ever been found , all discovered near Gunung Kinabalu Park
Crystal - clear fins :
Another new discovery is the Eirmotus insignis

Maternal Mortality , Slavery , Fistula Fill Half the Sky
by Elayne Clift
I�ve always felt ambivalent about Nicolas Kristof�s columns in The New York Times , even though they have exposed so effectively the tragic lives of so many women around the world .
The reason is that for decades before he got all those column inches , women ( like myself ) working in the trenches of women�s empowerment globally could not get any mainstream newspaper or magazine in the entire country to run our stories .
Even when we covered essential issues from various places around the globe during the United Nations Decade for Women and the subsequent Fourth World Conference for Women in 1995 , we couldn�t get our stories printed except in obscure , alternative , non-paying publications that are now , for the most part , defunct .
At the same time , I�ve always been glad that Kristof had a forum , and the commitment , to get those stories out .
So having licked my wounds , I was pleased to see his book , Half the Sky : Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide , co-authored with his wife , Sheryl WuDunn , garner so much attention .
And with good reason :
They have written a deeply compelling work that documents the pain of half the people on the planet , and they have called upon our collective conscience to do something about it .
The book , which takes its name from Chairman Mao proclaiming the Chinese proverb , �women hold up half the sky , � has sufficient data to shock and alarm , whether it is about sexual slavery and rape , honor killings , or maternal morbidity and mortality .
Some of this data is offered in the spirit of creative epidemiology : � As many infant girls die unnecessarily every week in China as protesters died in the one incident at Tiananmen . �
Some of it is offered in research - based facts and hard numbers : � Women aged 15 through 45 are more likely to be maimed or die from male violence than from cancer , malaria , traffic accidents and war combined . �
But what really packs a punch is that each chapter , from � Emancipating Twenty - First - Century Slaves� to � Maternal Mortality � One Woman a Minute , � shares the story of real women whose faces we see in photographs , whose tragedies we cannot ignore , whose courage and intelligence we must applaud , whose lives we must help change .
In Cambodia there is Srey Rath , who was sold into sexual slavery when she was fifteen .
In Pakistan there is Naeema Azar , who was blinded when acid was thrown at her by an irate ex-husband .
There is
Woineshet , who was kidnapped from her bed in Ethiopia at the age of thirteen and repeatedly beaten and raped .
There is Dina from the Congo , who at the age of seventeen suffered a brutal rape by soldiers that left her with an extensive fistula � a tear that resulted in urine and feces dripping down her legs .
There are the stories of other women as well , heroic women who miraculously have managed to rise above the violence and discrimination that silences them and tries to render them helpless , docile and victimized .
One of them is Edna Adan Ismail , who previously has written about her work On The Issues Magazine .
Adan founded and directs a maternity hospital in Somaliland .
� I was of a generation that had no school for girls , � she told Kristof and WuDunn .
� It was considered undesirable to teach a girl to read and write� because they would become promiscuous .
Adan also recalled the experience of having her genitals cut , even though her father was a doctor ( who was not told until after the deed was done ) .
She was eight years old .
� I was caught , held down and it was done .�
Somehow , she rose above all the forces , cultural and economic , that have kept so many other women from achieving autonomous adulthood .
Adan became a nurse - midwife who eventually worked for the World Health Organization before opening her own hospital .
Half the Sky offers a crash course in gender , health and development , while at the same time urgently advocating action .
In fact , its last chapter , � What You Can Do� is a clarion call for Americans to stop looking the other way , to pressure government to be more effective by supporting proven indigenous efforts , and to continue writing checks while also engaging directly in on - the - ground volunteerism .
� The tide of history is turning women from beasts of burden and sexual play things into full - fledged human beings , � Kristof and WuDunn conclude .
� Before long , we will consider sex slavery , honor killings , and acid attacks as unfathomable as foot - binding .
The question is how long that transformation will take and how many girls will be kidnapped into brothels before it is complete � and whether each of us will be part of that historical movement , or a bystander . �

MADLIB MEDICINE SHOW #5 : THE HISTORY OF THE LOOP DIGGA , 1990 - 2000
Pre-order for CD and 3LP .
Release date : May 25 .
CD 34
tracks , 12 - page booklet / comic ( 64:00 mins )
3 -LP DELUXE 34 tracks + 10 track bonus disc , limited edition , numbered , with individually screened LP
covers ( 98:00 mins )
Back in the 90s , “ beat tapes ” were literally that : cassette tapes of beats that a producer made either for himself , friends , or potential collaborators .
Madlib made a bunch of them in the days between his early productions for the Alkaholiks ( circa ’ 92 ) and the release of his Quasimoto album ( 2000 ) , after which he took a couple of years off of the beats to focus on making jazz music before beginning a new era of hip - hop with Madvillain , Jaylib and Beat Konducta .
This collection of beats showcases the way that Madlib ’s early hip - hop demos were filtered out to his crew of friends and associates , providing an opportunity for a unique view into Madlib ’s working process .
These beats , often freestyled on SP1200 or whatever machine he had at the ready , were picked up by rappers over a period of many years .
Trainspotters will find it interesting that beats later destined for the likes of Wildchild and Percee P were made some years before those albums saw release .
This album is punctuated with a series of early solo - raps by Madlib and his Quasimoto alter ego and features the crew known collectively as CDP – those rappers who worked side by side with Madlib during the days of his Oxnard CA - based “ Crate Diggas Palace ” studios .
The Madlib Medicine
Show series is a combination of Madlib's new hip - hop productions , remixes , beat tapes and jazz , as well as mixtapes of funk , soul , Brazilian , psych , jazz and other undefined forms of music .
About the CD & vinyl release :
Madlib Medicine Show # 5 : The History of the Loop Digga will be released on CD , digital and a deluxe 3LP format .
The deluxe 3LP set includes 34 minutes of vocal & instrumental material not available on the CD or digital release , and one - of - a- kind individually screened covers by Hit+Run .
The artwork is by Benjamin Marra who has created a comic book for the album about the fictional 90s - era Rapper X who goes on a vengeful cop-killing rampage .
The comic is included with the CD .

The " voice of the Cuban revolution " has hinted at change
Two of Cuba 's biggest stars have been granted visas to visit the United States next month .
It will be the first time in decades that the folk singer Silvio Rodriguez and the prima ballerina Alicia Alonso have been allowed to perform in the US .
Both have been staunch supporters of Cuba 's communist system .
President Obama has been encouraging people - to - people contacts with Cuba , while maintaining a decades - long trade embargo .
Silvio Rodriguez , who gave his last concert in the US in 1979 , is booked for a multi-city tour starting in New York 's Carnegie Hall on 4 June .
The 63 - year - old musician is known throughout Latin America as the voice of the Cuban revolution .
Change of tune ?
But some of his more recent lyrics have included subtle criticism of life in the communist - run island .
" If we do n't change , they are going to change us , " he said in a recent interview .
Alicia Alonso , the legendary founder of the Cuban national ballet , is also due to appear on stage in New York .
Aged nearly 90 , she first rose to fame as a prima ballerina with the American ballet company .
She 's been granted a visa to attend a special anniversary performance on 3 June .
Cultural exchanges like this were routinely blocked under former President George W Bush .
Relations have eased slightly under President Barack Obama - who has lifted restrictions on Cuban Americans visiting the island - and there has been an increase in academic and cultural exchanges .
But the American embargo is still in force , and Mr Obama has criticised the treatment of dissidents and lack of democratic reform on the island .
One maid has resigned with colleagues threatening to follow suit
Gordon Brown ’s “ Spring of Discontent ” has reached Buckingham Palace , with unhappy domestic staff threatening industrial unrest .
Royal maids are up in arms after being roped in to work evenings , on top of their day jobs , for no extra pay .
The situation is so serious one maid has resigned with colleagues threatening to follow suit .
The move comes after staff signed contracts three years ago agreeing to “ help out ” at evening events .
A source said : “ We had no idea just how much extra evening work would be involved .
“ It was a novelty , being asked to serve drinks to the great and the good , so we agreed thinking it would only be once or twice a month .
But we ’ve been asked to do more and more , some of us working two or three nights a week , for nothing .
“ We do n’t feel we can say no – there ’s a climate of fear .
We ’re asked to come in on evenings when we ’re not in work during the day but it just ends up feeling like we are always working .
Our social and family lives are suffering .
We are already on minimum wage , but the extra work makes it feel like slave wages – we’d be better off working in a hotel . ”
Up to 35 chambermaids are employed at Buckingham Palace , on pay of about £ 12,000 a year , to do all the cleaning and laundry .
Before the contractual changes , footmen were paid up to £ 20 an hour to staff after - hours functions .
However they were axed and replaced by maids working for free .
It is not the first time Buckingham Palace has angered its staff .
The Queen ’s former treasurer Sir Michael Peat , now Prince Charles ’s private secretary , was dubbed “ the axe man ” during his time at Buckingham Palace in the Nineties , when he shut the subsidised staff bar and stopped the practice of staff being allowed to keep unfinished bottles of wine opened to serve to guests .
The source added : “ We love working for the Queen and accept the low wages because of all the privileges , but we feel we ’re being taken advantage of . ”
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said : “ For the last three years the household has broadened employees ’ skills through a focus on training and development .
“ This enables us to use staff more flexibly , giving better job satisfaction , better value for public money and enhancing skills for the future . ”
The author of the closely - watched Dow Theory Letters newsletter warned investors to get out of US stocks now in a report published Tuesday .
Richard Russell wrote that there is a risk of a “ major crash ” if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls below the May 7 closing price of 10,380.43 , according to several media reports .
" If I read the stock market correctly , it 's telling me that there is a surprise ahead , " Russell wrote .
" And that surprise will be a reversal to the downside for the economy , plus a collection of other troubles ahead . "
" Do your friends a favor .
Tell them to “ batten down the hatches ” because there ’s a hard rain coming , " Russell warned .
" Tell them to get out of debt and sell anything they can sell in order to get liquid .
Tell them that Richard Russell says that by the end of this year they wo n’t recognize the country .
They ’ll retort , ‘ How the dickens does Russell know — who told him ? ’
Tell them the stock market told him . "
Russell said he has seen problems with the Dow since April
" If business is even better than expected , then why is the Dow down over 600 points ? "
Disclaimer
Still , he has clearly been staggered this week by an advertisement released by Mr. Sestak showing former President George W. Bush praising Mr. Specter as a “ firm ally . ”
That is precisely the kind of advertisement Democrats are planning to use against Republicans this fall .
Democrats and some of Mr. Specter ’s supporters said the advertisement , which also shows the senator appearing alongside Sarah Palin and a clip of Mr. Specter arching an eyebrow as he declared , “ My change in party will enable me to be re-elected , ” was crystallizing concerns about him among both Democratic partisans and voters weary with Washington .
“ It ’s been a rugged time , candidly , ” Mr. Specter said .
The most likely Republican candidate , Pat Toomey , a former member of Congress and former head of the Club for Growth , a conservative organization , helped drive Mr. Specter from the Republican Party .
But some of Mr. Specter ’s supporters say that Mr. Specter would be a much stronger candidate than Mr. Sestak , a retired Navy admiral , against Mr. Toomey in the fall .
“ I am firmly of the belief that Arlen Specter is head and shoulders above anyone else in his ability to lead us to victory this November , ” T. J. Rooney , the head of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party , said Tuesday .
“ Arlen Specter knows how to beat Toomey : he has done it before . ”
Mr. Rooney pointed to Mr. Sestak ’s unconventional campaign manner —
“ He does n’t have a campaign manager ! ” he said — and said that Mr. Specter is a tougher campaigner who could appeal to independent voters and moderate Republicans , who he said would be lost to Mr. Toomey if Mr. Sestak won .
Mr. Rooney also suggested that Mr. Sestak would be hurt in a general election campaign by an issue raised in advertising and on the campaign trail by Mr. Specter : the circumstances of Mr. Sestak ’s retirement from the Navy .
A report at the time said Mr. Sestak had created “ a poor command climate . ”
Mr. Sestak said he was simply carrying out a tough assignment , assessing the Navy ’s fleet to recommend cutbacks , and he has refused Mr. Specter ’s demands that he release his records .
Dear human race ,
First of all , you ’re welcome .
In the last few days I ’ve been overwhelmed by your letters and calls expressing your gratitude to Apple , and mostly to me personally , for inventing yet another life - changing , mind - altering product .
All I can tell you is that with iPad , as with all of our products , all we did was create something that we want to use .
We ’re just so glad that you want to use it too .
It ’s humbling , actually .
When you devote your entire life to the endless , selfless quest to improve the lives of others ; when you live a monk - like existence , and focus all of your power and genius on the singular goal of creating objects that nourish souls and transform people ’s lives with magic and wonder ; and when people tell you that this is , indeed , what you ’ve done — well , it ’s gratifying .
Namaste , entire population of Spaceship Earth .
I honor the place where your desire to consume becomes one with my desire to create .
Some pundits have posed the question :
Why do anyone need this thing ?
Indeed , even those of you are lining up and standing outside stores may be wondering , Why am I doing this ?
Why am I lining up like a zombie for an expensive piece of consumer electronics , a product for which there is no shortage and which , let ’s face it , nobody really needs ?
Back in the early days of our design process , Jonny Ive came in to see me and we spent a long time trying to decide where on Mazlow ’s triangle this product would sit .
Because we knew if we could n’t be way up above the very top of that pyramid , floating above it , totally outside the needs it describes , then this would n’t be a product we wanted to make .
Some of our early iterations , in fact , had to be tossed out because when we looked at them we realized that parts of them were too , well , necessary .
Do n’t get me wrong .
That ’s fine for other companies .
It ’s just not what we do here at Apple .
But let ’s get back to you people who are waiting in line .
I mean it ’s not like you ’re in Bolivia and there ’s just been an earthquake and you need to line up to get food and clean water .
It ’s not like you ’ve time - traveled back into the Depression and you ’re waiting in line at a soup kitchen .
And yet , in fact , that ’s exactly what you ’re doing .
Spiritually speaking , we are living in the Great Depression , and you are waiting in line for sustenance .
We , all of us , are experiencing the world that Deleuze and Guattari described so presciently in Capitalism and Schizophrenia .
If you have n’t read this incredibly important two - volume work , I highly recommend that wait for us to make both volumes available on our iBooks store and then order them right away .
The cool thing is that then , as you ’re reading , you will have the strange and circular experience of discovering why you bought the iPad in the first place .
The truth is , this is all about spiritual emptiness .
That is why you ’re standing in line .
Except for Scoble , who is an attention whore and just doing it to get attention .
The truth is , all over the world , across every culture , there exists a sense of yearning .
A kind of malaise .
An emptiness .
At the risk of sounding like Dr. Seuss :
There is a hole in your soul .
That is what we ’re addressing at Apple .
That is the hole we aim to fill .
Sadly , as you may have begun to suspect , that hole can never really be filled .
The truth is that modernity , the condition of living in our modern world , has inflicted terrible wounds on your inner self .
These wounds can never be healed .
They can only be treated .
At best we provide palliative care .
Not a cure .
Because , my dear fellow human beings , there is no cure for what ails you .
The products we create provide only temporary relief .
Their magic eventually wears off .
The sense of childlike wonder they impart will , over time , begin to fade .
And then you need a new product .
Think back to June 29 , 2007 .
Do you remember the rapture ?
The wonder of iPhone ?
The magic ?
Now that is gone , but here we come with another shot of digital Dilaudid .
Sleep well , my friends .
Sleep deeply and rest , cradled in the arms of my electronic medicine .
I ’d also like to take a moment to thank all of the engineers and designers and programmers inside Apple who worked so tirelessly on this product , toiling way in total secrecy .
I know it was n’t easy .
You had to work on a machine that was inside a sealed metal box , so you could n’t actually see what you were doing .
The box itself was chained to a desk , which was bolted to the floor in a windowless , lead - sealed concrete bunker .
And you were chained to that same desk by your ankle .
I know some of you considered it humiliating .
I know many of you did not enjoy having to use a chamber pot instead of being allowed to leave the room for bathroom breaks .
To be sure , the chamber pot was designed by Jonny Ive and is a model of simplicity and elegant design .
Nevertheless , not a lot of fun .
I know some of you grumbled , privately , about having your personal email read , and your phone calls monitored .
You did not appreciate having your children followed to school and interrogated to see if Mom or Dad had been talking about work .
The cars parked outside your house at night , the strange calls to your neighbors and relatives , the questionnaires about your sexual history , the lists of all your past lovers that you needed to provide — I know .
It ’s not easy to work at Apple .
But I think you ’ll agree with me that it ’s worth the trouble .
I honor your dedication , and I hope you will all enjoy the new wonder device that you have helped bring into the world .
Hold your iPad .
Gaze at it .
Pray to it .
Let it transform you .
And do it soon , because before you know it we are going to release version 2 , which will make this one look like a total piece of crap .
Peace be upon you .
Dear Leader
“ Set it on fire and walk away ” is basically my go to solution for all of life ’s problems .
- Alex
The fort is , as you might guess , rather far from efficient  dwarves routinely walk 300 - 500 steps to the dining pod , or the stalactite apartments , or the ship , and gods forbid if they ever need to go outside .
Each project was given a lot of space , primarily so it would look good in visualizers  as such , Ill be ignoring in - game screenies except for two spots ; if you want to see more in - game stuff there are plenty of POIs on the DFMA maps .
Why dont we start with the exterior ?
Mountaingate is the name I gave to the hollowed - out spire mountain that serves as an entirely - ornamental entrance to the fortress .
When I embarked , I had intended on making the entrance directly in the mountain range , but upon seeing the spire , I decided to make the spire the access point and build a bridge to connect to the true entrance .
I carved away several nearby layers of mountain in order to give Mountaingate its own moat as well as make the approach look more formidable and impressive .
I also opened up its entrance to have a big semi-circle cave opening for coolness effect .
Within the spire is a lake , with a long ramp moving upwards to the bridge .
The large arch and bridge in front of the mountain houses my rather small 7 - dwarf military , who are the sole defense measure of the fortress .
I tore down the arch just for these shots , as as nice as it was it blocked the view of the mountain ( not sure why the water in the VF one froze , temp is off ) .
We enter the mountain , follow the walkway up , cross the bridge , and follow the tunneland end up in a small water - filled cavern .
The tunnel forks and heads farther downwards here , but well come back to that later .
For now , we cross this cavern and enter the main cavern .
I am immensely proud of this cavern , which was the first thing I visualized when getting ideas for Undergrotto .
The above view is from a mid-level alcove that the previous cavern connects to .
Well start by going to the right and will eventually make our way around the entire cavern .
Heading down a slope we find ourselves in a large tower - cap park .
There is an artifact statue hidden among the mushrooms that turns the entire plateau into a statue garden for dwarves to relax in , and traffic orders over a decade or so caused the caps to grow thicker in some areas and thinner in others , making a pleasant path for dwarves to stroll through .
To create the park I had to build scaffolding below the plateau in order to build walls 
I was very picky about what would get muddy and what wouldnt .
I dont harvest any of these trees  theres a separate tower - cap farm elsewhere .
From the park there is a small entrance to the archives  360 tiles are engraved per year , and a new level is dug annually .
I mistakenly thought DF months had 30 days instead of 28 when I planned it out ; I pretend the extra 24 engravings are like  the best of the year kind of thing .
Neither of my preferred visualizers show engravings yet , unfortunately .
We exit the archives and stroll back through the park , following a ramp off the plateau and to the lakeshore .
The lake is probably the centerpiece of the grotto ; its only 2z deep , but is rather large and peaceful .
It s fed through a three - pump - wide stack drawing directly from the underground rivers waterfall source tiles , which refill near - instantaneously and can feed pumps faster than aquifers .
In the center of the lake is the shrine to Armok .
Unlike many other places of blood worship , this one is rather small and simple .
It makes up for its plainness in function , to be showcased later .
Over to the side is the beach , where the Rummy Dodger is anchored .
The beach is one of the few things about the grotto that is artificial , as will be explained later .
The Dodger is a sail - less ship that serves as the alcohol warehouse for the entire fortress .
I like to image the dwarves drunkenly rock from side to side in time with the ship .
Capn Flask is in charge of the ship , but I thought it was more appropriate to give him the custom profession of Drunk rather than Captain .
He does have a gear assembly that he plays with like a steering wheel sometimes though .
Ships 100 % wood aside from the gold - bar railings .
A cave in the side of the cliff face leads down a short tunnel away from the beach and into the graveyards chamber .
Mort , the undertaker , has a small shack here from which he accesses each tomb ( hes the only one with the Burial labour ) .
I give each deceased dwarf or pet a mound with a coffin underneath ; occupied mounds are marked with obsidian statues as headstones .
Returning to the beach , we pass under a small arch and arrive at the Industrial Plaza .
As of right now , there is absolutely nothing my dwarves need , and as a result Ive mostly removed the stockpiles and workshops .
I developed an industry theory a while ago that you can seperate dwarven industry into organics , metal , stoneworking , wood / glassworking , and cloth , and are able to follow each of these industries from raw resource into final product in each of their sectors , along with a misc .
sector for stuff like jewelry , alchemy , and siegeworking .
To put the idea to use , I gave each industry a spoke on the gear .
It worked pretty well in practice , except I gave too much space to the workshops and not enough to storage .
I usually only have one or maybe two dwarves who do each workshop labour , anyhow .
Through a small tunnel here we have the old abandoned miners guild .
Back when I needed a lot of miners , there were 32 regular offices and a larger office for Sickle , the head miner .
Unfortunately I no longer need more than two active miners , so the guild was dissolved .
When Sickle died , I turned her old office into a tomb for both her and Picks coffins .
These two miners are the still the only two of the starting seven to die ; the former was frozen during a winter aquifer excavation and the former died in a cave - in accident while hollowing out Mountaingate .
Returning to the beach then back up to the park , we follow an arch up to the social sectors plateau .
Shortly well be heading to the central square , but first , let s go to prison !
At the top of the slope on a lonely plateau sits the Undergrotto penitentiary .
It has a mere twelve cells , two floors of six , but also has offices for each of the fortress guard as well as a watchtower , an armoury , and an illegal still ( which explains a lot about dwarven justice  besides , even guards can get hammered  ) .
Below the penitentiary lies the Hammerers dungeon .
Two platforms , one shaped like an axe and the other a hammer , make up the cavern , which is coated in cages containing helpless and insane humans and elves .
The platforms and thin outcroppings rise up form water far below .
The hammerer enjoys sitting at his desk between torture sessions , listening to water trickle down from above as his prisoners cry quietly to themselves .
I forgot to take VF screenies of this and dont have access to a computer that can right now , but you can go take a look for yourselves later .
Leaving the jailhouse and descending down the slope we pass the hospital , with four cozy rooms and a private well for recovering dwarves ( and a helipad ) , and end up in the town square .
Here there is a lighthouse , with a small pond beneath it for reasons I no longer remember , the mayoral manor with many fine rooms , and the zoo , with two giant olms , a sasquatch , and a dragon on a platform surrounded by water .
Until the Rummy Dodger was built , there was a pub here , but it didnt have nearly enough space to hold all the forts alcohol .
We continue past the social sector down a small slope to the magma caldera .
Though completely useless and ornamental , the caldera was one of the first things in the grotto Id envisioned .
Later , while looking for somewhere to build the DMs dungeon , I realized how perfect it was , and created a tunnel downwards .
The dungeon has lava running all along it , with grates connecting the platforms .
All animal training is done here , and I even created a private swimming pool for my titan , Cerol .
He swam for a decade until he became a level 62 swimmer with 8 strength , 10 agility and 9 toughness .
Cerol was recently moved up from the caldera dungeon to the Crescent Arena , where he is to do battle with the hydra Thicivi .
The arena is nt as nice as I had wanted it to be , but with a small glass dome over the arena itself I think it does the job well enough .
It s named after the moon - like shape the audiences area took on once Id made the arenas circle take up some of the entire buildings circle space .
Theres a very handy bridge system that allows you to prepare very dangerous critters without fear of job cancellations , escape , or them destroying your bridges .
A winding path rises from the arenas plateau , but we wont follow it up just yet .
First weve got to finish our lap around the cavern , so lets go down and follow the path around to the trade depots post , resting towards the center of the cavern .
The cage , a small structure around the depot , is what I came up with while trying to think of how to make the depot impressive .
It s appropriately named as I routinely catch trading humans and elves , and is built entirely out of copper , with the depot in black bronze .
A small square hole in the wall near the depot leads down to a very large room with water crisscrossing across the floor .
This is Engineering .
The current setup generates a mere 4000 power , but I could easily adapt it to generate 5000 , or expand it much more if I wanted .
Mostly it just powers the huge pump stacks I have running .
The original system drained from the brook above and poured into the underground rivers chasm , but a tower cap grew in the system so I blocked it all up and now it feeds itself .
On the catwalk above , all my engineers have impressive green glass offices with their own private workshops .
The head engineer , Gear , has an aquarium office because I thought it was cool .
At the back of engineering there is a complex path of bridges .
This is an elf trap  as elves dont bring wagons , they instead path to this much - closer depot .
While walking through the trap to it , I pull the switch and they all fall onto the below cage traps .
It s a pretty fun system .
Theres another path back here that leads upwards into a small wooden cabin .
This is Hermits house , and the back entrance to the fort .
The cabin sits in the center of a dwarf - made lake , and has a drawbridge to the mainland that s operated only by Hermit , the bridgekeeper .
Theres an iron fence set up so that even in winter its protected .
Going back through engineering and back in the main cavern , we see to our left a large pool .
I had hoped to train all my dwarves to legendary swimmers here , but 3/ 4 was too low to give experience and 4/7 was too high to get them to path in , so all I got was dangerous terrain spam .
Now it just adds colour to the grotto .
We could continue past the pool down to the alcove where we originally entered the cavern , but instead well go back to the arenas plateau and head up that winding path ... in the next spoiler !
April 3 , 2010  --
A federal court this week ordered Iran to pay $ 1.3 billion to the victims of the 1983 United States Marine barracks bombing in Beirut , the latest in a series of enormous verdicts against rogue nations that the judge said may be providing false hopes to those who seek justice .
" The Court seeks to send the strongest possible message that Iran 's support of terrorism against citizens of the United States absolutely will not be tolerated by the courts of this nation , " U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth wrote in a searing , and at times poignant , opinion published Wednesday .
This is the second huge judgment for victims of the bombing – another group was awarded more than $ 2.6 billion in 2007 .
But for now , the money appears to be mirage , or , as Lamberth described it in an earlier opinion related to the latest case , " a meaningless charade . "
Congress first changed the law in 1996 to allow American victims to sue foreign sponsors of terror attacks .
Lawmakers have returned to the issue several times to try and make it easier for victims to find justice .
And in some instances , victims have collected large payments .
Plaintiffs in a series of cases brought against Libya , for example , eventually recovered money as part of the U.S. agreement to normalize relations with Libya .
But by Lamberth 's estimate , cases against Iran alone had already piled up more than $ 9 billion in unpaid judgments before the latest opinion issued this week .
In an unorthodox 191 - page opinion late last year , he called on President Obama and Congress to find a new approach .
Those trying to compel Iran to pay by bringing new lawsuits face a " long road ahead , " he wrote .
" This meaningless charade … has gone on far too long , " he wrote .
" It is high time for our political leaders to consider the flaws of this private litigation experience and address the deeper political problems that this court has no authority to resolve . "
Lawyers in those cases believe the promise of a payday is not as far off as Lamberth suggests .
" We harbor a patient belief that there will be adequate assets located and attached to enforce this judgment , as well as the other outstanding judgments , " said Joseph Peter Drennan , an Alexandria attorney involved in the case .
" Iran is a large and wealthy country and garners tens of billions of dollars a year from exporting petroleum .
Iran can pay these judgments , and pay them it must if it has any desire to rejoin the family of nations . "
Lawyers in this and other cases have been relentless in their pursuit of Iranian assets that remain squirreled away within the United States .
One promising sign that the Beirut victims may succeed in collecting came in December , when the Wall Street Journal reported that a federal court secretly froze more than $ 2 billion allegedly held on behalf of Iran in Citigroup Inc. accounts .
Court records from the case are under seal , but if the assets are turned over to the plaintiffs , the Journal reported that it would mark the largest American seizure of Iranian assets since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Thomas Fortune Fay , another Washington lawyer who represents the Beirut bombing victims , said Friday that while he is not permitted to discuss the status of the funds held by Citibank , " I do n't have any information to contradict what was in that article . "
If the lawyers were able to get their hands on those funds , the latest billion - dollar judgment would be divided among the roughly 100 plaintiffs who brought suit -- survivors , relatives , and descendants of those killed in the gruesome suicide bombing that killed 241 American servicemen in what was at the time the most deadly foreign - sponsored terror attack targeting Americans .
Some victims , such as lead plaintiff Terance J. Valore , were singled out by the judge for additional compensation because of what they went through .
" Mr. Valore suffered particularly horrendous physical injuries , in both number and severity , " the judge wrote .
" Immediately after the blast , Mr. Valore lost consciousness for about 30 seconds .
He regained consciousness to find his skin hanging from his body ; severe hole - like wounds passing through his chest ; pieces of metal , concrete , and glass embedded in his body ; and his leg split open .
Mr. Valore had been in the middle of the fireball .
His clothes had been blown off , all of hair the on his body had been burned off , and burns covered 90 % of his body . "
In awarding the $ 1.3 billion to Valore and others Wednesday , Lamberth quoted from Iranian poet Simin Behbahani , who has implored her nation to " Stop this screaming , mayhem , and bloodshed .
Stop doing what makes God 's creatures mourn with tears . "
Lamberth concludes : " The Court sincerely hopes that the compensatory damages awarded today help to alleviate plaintiffs ' physical , emotional , and financial injury and that the punitive damages also awarded inspire Iran to heed Ms. Behbahani 's words . "

Google has not handed over sensitive data requested by German authorities , despite a deadline of 26 May .
Dr Johannes Caspar , the Information Commissioner for Hamburg , Germany , told BBC News that there was " no sign " of the requested hard disk
The firm has until midnight to hand over data harvested by its Street View cars from private wi-fi networks .
A spokesperson for Google declined to comment further , but indicated that it would say more on the matter later .
The Hamburg commissioner also expects answers to a range of questions his office posed four weeks ago .
Dr Caspar added " We know that Google always thinks it 's better to hold back the answers for as long as they are able to . "
Earlier this month , the search firm admitted that it had collected information people had sent over unencrypted wi-fi networks for the last three years .
Last week , Google 's CEO Eric Schmidt said that there was " no , harm , no foul " , in relation to the data breach .
Google said the wi-fi data collection was a " mistake " and that it had not been authorised .
The search giant 's admission came in response to an official German request to audit data gathered by Google 's Street View cars .
Different approaches
Google 's actions are under increasing scrutiny around the world , but countries are approaching the matter differently .
In the UK , the country 's Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) has ordered the firm to destroy the data which it collected in 2008 .
To allow a government to investigate a privacy breach by further violating privacy is senseless Jennifer Granick , Electronic Frontier Foundation
The ICO said it took the matter " seriously " but that it would not take any further action against the company .
Its German counterpart has asked to see the data before it proceeds , and has sought answers from Google to a range of technical questions about how the data was gathered and stored .
One of them points out that a database of unencrypted wi-fi hotspots would be very useful to criminal gangs , and asks what steps Google had taken to prevent unauthorised access .
Some countries , including Germany , have said they are considering prosecuting Google , once the extent of the data breach becomes clearer .
But civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation has questioned the wisdom of passing the data to authorities .
" Calls from some quarters for Google to simply turn over the data to the U.S. or other governments are wrong - headed , " said EFF Civil Liberties director Jennifer Granick in a post on the organisation 's website last week .
" To allow a government to investigate a privacy breach by further violating privacy is senseless . "
Google has said that it is in discussions with data protection authorities in all affected countries about what to do with the data .
30,000 years ago , somebody took a vulture ’s bone , and carved it into a flute .
It is the oldest known musical instrument .
The flute was found in a cave in what is now Southern Germany , and it sounds like this .
I 'm Anna Arrowsmith , the Liberal Democrat PPC for Gravesend or , as many will know me , Anna Span , the UK 's first female porn director .
Take your pick .
Since news of my selection broke on Thursday , many people have asked me why I want to be an MP .
The answer is : for exactly the same reason I decided to start making pornography for women more than 12 years ago .
Someone had to do it and it did n't look like anyone else was going to – at least not with the drive , enthusiasm and determination that I could offer .
The unfortunate truth is that there are far too few female MPs in this country compared to the rest of the world .
Did you know that Rwanda has the highest number of female MPs of all countries at 53 % ?
Imagine living in a country with a female majority !
Well , here I am again thinking that another male - dominated field needs challenging .
Back in 1998 I was in the final year of my degree , studying film at Central St Martin 's College of Art & Design .
I had decided to write my dissertation on what fundamental changes would need to be made to mainstream pornography in order for it to be enjoyed by women .
I called it Towards a New Pornography , intending it to sound like a manifesto , more for my own amusement than anything else .
Then came lesson one in the British psyche .
Even the so - called experimental filmmaker lecturers at this outstanding college were actually conservative with a small ' c ' .
My adverts for performers to appear in my graduation film were defaced and torn down by members of staff and my final film was refused a public airing " for fear of upsetting people 's grandparents " , according to the head of the department .
All this for a film where the sex was actually simulated due to lead actor issues .
Twelve years later I have won many awards , including Indie Porn Pioneer at the international Feminist Porn Awards in Toronto and best director for two years in the UK .
I have fought long and hard for women 's right to sexual expression and consumption , as well as for freedom of speech .
I have long since felt vindicated about my choices back at college and know my pro-sex feminist argument is based on sound principles and logic .
So why do n't I stay in my industry and continue to reap the rewards of my efforts ?
Because I am the type of person who needs a challenge .
I achieved much in my last career and now I want to broaden my campaign to other pressing issues such as why this or previous governments do n't think they have a responsibility to give young people something productive and engaging to do with their spare time .
I lived on a council estate in Bermondsey and saw first hand why the kids were taking drugs , fighting and committing crimes .
They are simply bored .
I want to campaign to give young people in Gravesham the help they deserve .
To do this I have to fight yet another old man 's club – only this time without the dirty raincoats .
Some wo n't like it ; they 'll assume that my selection means the world is going to hell .
I 've been here before ; last time I changed my industry for ever .
That , among other issues , is why I am making the transition from porn to Parliament .
Watch this space ; I 've got a lot of – for want of a better word – balls .

​ " Do I need great credit to get a mortgage ? " Quick answer : " No ! " Complete answer : Credit score is one of the most misunderstood topics about getting a mortgage .
Many people believe that you have to have perfect credit and high scores to qualify .
While having a higher score may help you obtain a slightly better interest rate , it is usually possible to get a mortgage with less than perfect credit .
Rather than try to tell you everything you need to know about credit here , I 'd like to offer you a free , no obligation conversation to discuss your credit .
We can talk about what your score is now ( and how the score used to qualify for a mortgage is different than the scores you may get through credit card company monitoring or websites like Credit Karma ) , how it will affect your ability to get a mortgage , and more .
If during our conversation we discover that it's not the right time to get a mortgage , I can also help you take the steps necessary to improve your score .
If you 've been wanting to look into buying a home , but are afraid your credit score is n't high enough , let 's find out for sure together .
Remember , it 's no obligation , totally free , and you have nothing to lose .

​ For the week of April 27 , 2020 Recap of last week : Rates were slightly better Average mortgage rates among lenders improved slightly last week compared to the week before , helped by the Fed 's bond purchase program and a stable mortgage bond market .
Mortgage Rate Forecast : Rates likely to remain low Mortgage rates should remain stable , meaning we could see small movements up or down but are not likely to see a large move either way .
For some borrowers rates will remain the same but may have higher closing costs or points .
If you 're looking at closing soon , be sure to discuss your unique situation with your mortgage professional to decide if now is a good time for you to lock in your rate .
What 's affecting rates this week : - The Fed : Holding its Federal Open Market Committee meeting , will release a statement on Wednesday but is not expected to raise or lower rates .
Continued bond buying is keeping rates low .
- Forbearance requests : Borrowers requesting forbearance from mortgage payments are causing issues among mortgage servicers , pressuring rates higher .
If you 're considering forbearance , talk to a mortgage professional first to fully understand the pros and cons .
- Economic data :
Although there 's more data this week , it 's not likely to cause much movement in rates
3 ) Get a home inspection .
Ask your agent to suggest a qualified home inspector , preferably one that deals with sight unseen sales .
Ask for pictures and / or video as well as the written report .
I can still help you buy a home , even sight unseen .
Contact me today for more information on why now is such a great time to buy and how I can help !
2 ) Consider asking the seller for a home warranty that covers most large appliances , plumping , electrical , HVAC and any other large home systems for peace of mind .
Your agent can advise you on how to do this .
1 ) Start with the right agent .
The real estate agent will be your eyes and ears , and in most cases can still go and tour a home for you .
With Zoom , FaceTime or other equivalent , your agent may be able to take you through the home with a live tour .
If not , they can take lots of pictures and video , and know what to look for to help you make an informed decision on if you want to make an offer .
To some people it sounds crazy , but for many others who have moved across the country or move frequently ( like a military family ) it is commonplace .
But now that the COVID - 19 pandemic has turned the home buying process on it ’s head , you may be looking at making this decision yourself .
Mortgage Rate Forecast : Rates likely to be unchanged or slightly worse Mortgage rates could be pushed slightly higher this week , pressured by market conditions making it harder to securitize and service mortgages after they have been originated and processed .
Rates will still remain low though , and anyone considering buying a home or refinancing should talk about their unique situation with a mortgage professional for better guidance .
Recap of last week : Rates were slightly improved
On average , mortgage rates improved last week , with some borrowers seeing slightly better rates while others just saw better closing cost rebate pricing .
Rates were helped by Fed quantitative easing , and were more stable than weeks past .
Ben ’s honesty and his knowledge of the mortgage industry was very helpful when my wife and I purchased our home .
I would recommend Ben to anyone who is looking for a home !
Bottom Line if you do n’t put 20 % down you will most likely have to pay - MIP .
Does n’t matter what loan you get : VA - has a funding fee ; FHA – has MIP and Conventional loans have PMI .
Example :
You put 5 % down on the home your buying in Denver Colorado .
You then have to get insurance for the other 15 % that is left .
What is PMI and Why Do I Need it on my Colorado Mortgage Loan ?
Short answer – your not putting 20 % down on a conventional Colorado home Loan .
So , the banks to offset the risk of a low down loan , make you get insurance .
This private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) insures the lender for the amount - up to 20 % down that you did n’t put down .
Please let me know if you need any help with a Home Buyer program and have any questions about your mortgage .

How Do Mortgage Lenders Decide If You ’re Creditworthy ?
It ’s complicated , but this breakdown of the loan process is easy .
By Ann Brenoff
Ben Yost Agrees : Applying for a mortgage is arguably everyone ’s least - favorite and least - understood part of the home - buying process .
Nobody enjoys assembling the mountain of paperwork required for a loan application .
But 90 percent of us need a mortgage loan to buy a house .
So it behooves us to learn what prospective lenders really want to see in all the pay stubs and bank records they ask for .
How do they decide who gets a loan ?
What matters the most ?
Here ’s a short guide to how lenders judge your mortgageability .
Income vs. Housing Expenses
Lenders do n’t want your total monthly housing expense , or MHE , to exceed a certain percentage of your gross income .
Your MHE consists of the mortgage payment , property taxes , homeowner ’s insurance and any homeowners association fee .
The lender determines what the cutoff percentage will be .
Most stick pretty close to the traditional maximum of 28 percent of your gross income , but not always , according to Steve O’Connor , a senior vice president at the Mortgage Bankers Association .
“ There is quite a bit of variation among lenders , and each borrower ’s unique circumstances are taken into account , ” O’Connor said .
Lenders may be willing to accept an MHE above 28 percent if there are compensating factors , such as a high credit score , a large down payment and low non-housing debt .
Wells Fargo makes several suggestions if you exceed that 28 percent mark , including increasing your down payment , looking for a less expensive home and considering an area with lower property taxes .
But still , you may be wondering why the lender gets to decide what percentage of your hard - earned money you should be spending on housing ?
Maybe you ’re willing to sacrifice eating out and forgo buying a new car so that more of your income can go toward that new house .
Why should it matter to the lender ?
Well , because lenders would really like you to be able to repay the loan .
And federal guidelines warn that a household paying more than 30 percent of its gross income on housing and utilities should be considered “ rent - burdened , ” according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development .
If more than half of your income is spent on rent , you are considered “ extremely rent - burdened . ”
What does this 28 percent actually look like in determining how much money you can borrow ?
The website Mortgage Professor gives this example :
If your monthly gross income is $ 4,000 , your housing expenses ca n’t exceed $ 1,120 .
Deduct estimated property taxes of $ 261 and insurance of $ 103 , and you will be left with a maximum mortgage payment of $ 756 under the 28 percent rule .
With a 4 percent 30 - year fixed rate mortgage , $ 756 will support a loan amount of $ 158,353 .
With 5 percent down , this suggests that you can afford a home with a maximum sale price of $ 166,687 .
But What Actually Counts As Income ?
Lenders also have some thoughts on what qualifies as income .
You will need to show them pay stubs , of course , but they will also be looking at the type of work you do , how long you ’ve been employed and what opportunities you have for advancement .
Good for you if you ’ve been working a part - time second job to save up for a down payment , but some lenders wo n’t consider that money as income unless you ’ve had the job for 12 to 24 consecutive months .
Any commissions , bonuses or overtime pay will also usually be ignored unless they ’ve been steady for two years and your employer verifies that they ’re likely to continue .
If you want to count alimony or child support as income , you better have received it for the previous 12 months and know that it will continue for the next three years .
Lenders will want to see a divorce decree and court records to verify on - time payments .
Yes , your ex has to pay on time or you might not get a mortgage .
Should your income stem from a trust fund , interest or dividends , you ’ll likely need to show proof of those moneys for the previous 12 months .
In what many millennials find to be a real kick in the pants , you generally can’t count potential rental income from a roommate in your primary residence .
The only accepted source of rental income is from an investment property .
Even then , most lenders will consider only 75 percent of the monthly rent and then subtract ownership expenses , as verified by Schedule E of your tax returns .
Are you self - employed ?
It may feel like lenders hate you .
They do n’t , but they will be super - cautious .
You need to have been self - employed for at least two years , and lenders will likely take the average of your monthly adjusted gross income .
Self - employed borrowers often struggle qualifying for a mortgage because they write off a lot of expenses on their income tax filings , thereby reducing their adjusted gross income .
Some lenders of late are starting to show the self - employed a little more love by requiring only one year of documentation instead of two and lightening the strict controls .
Income vs. Existing Debt
lender will also consider what other debt you ’re already carrying .
Student loans , credit cards , automobile debt and money you have borrowed for any other reason are all weighed against your gross income .
So if you know that you ’ll be applying for a mortgage soon , do n’t go out and buy a car on borrowed money .
And do n’t charge new furniture before you buy the house you hope to furnish .

While the portion of your income that you spend on housing should n’t exceed 41 percent of gross income , your total debt service ― including housing ― should n’t exceed 45 percent .
Combined , this is known as the 36/45 rule and is used by mortgage lenders and other creditors to assess your borrowing capacity .
The argument is that any expense and debt burden in excess of the 36/45 yardstick would be difficult for most individuals or households to handle and could lead to default .
So in real numbers , what does this 41 percent cutoff look like ?
If you pay $ 1,300 a month for housing and another $ 300 for a car lease and $ 400 for the rest of your debts , your total monthly debt payment is $ 2,000 .
If your gross monthly income is $ 6,000 , then your debt - to - income ratio is 33 percent .
Congrats !
You came in under !
But what if your ratio is above 36 percent ?
Before applying for a mortgage , make some adjustments , advises mortgage columnist and author Jack M. Guttentag , professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School .
For instance , if you were planning to make a larger down payment than the absolute minimum required , consider using that cash instead to reduce your debt ― like paying off a credit card or car loan .
“ Just make sure that when you reduce your down payment you are n’t going to be pushed into a higher mortgage insurance premium category , which could offset most of the benefit , ” Guttentag wrote at Mortgage Professor .
And talk these things out with your mortgage broker , O’Connor said .
Different types of debt may factor into the lender ’s decision in different ways .
For example , a borrower may have student loans that are scheduled to be forgiven in the near future ― good ― or adjustable - rate loans that are scheduled to reset in the near future ― possibly not so good .
“ These varying repayment schedules will influence the borrower ’s overall debt burden , and therefore influence the borrower ’s capacity to repay the mortgage , ” O’Connor said .
Besides income and debt , lenders also consider such other factors as credit history , cash reserves and collateral ( the value of mortgaged property ) when making mortgage decisions .
A Show Them The Money
Lenders want to know that the borrower has sufficient cash to meet the down payment and other settlement costs that show up in the escrow process .
Wannabe borrowers who lack sufficient cash are considered “ cash constrained . ”
They have two choices : reduce the amount of the down payment , if possible , or find a way to cough up more money ― asking a parent for help , for instance .
But there are rules to that as well .
The down payment gift rules are as follows :
The gift must be documented with a formal “ gift letter , ” there must be a paper trail for the money as it goes from the giver ’s account to the homebuyer ’s account , and the gift ca n’t be a loan - in - disguise .
Buyers can accept up to 6 percent of a home ’s purchase price in the form of a cash gift to cover the down payment .
U.S. buyers like to put at least 20 percent down because that likely qualifies them for the lowest mortgage rates available .
Plus , with 20 percent down , no private mortgage insurance is required .
But very few first - time buyers can actually muster that much .
The National Association of Realtors says 81 percent of Americans purchase their first home with less than 20 percent down .
Put another way , only 19 percent of us manage to accumulate what has , for some reason , remained the standard mark for a down payment .
A recent study by Attom Data Solutions found that 22.8 percent of all purchase loan originations on single - family homes in the second quarter of 2017 involved co-borrowers listed on the mortgage or deed of trust ― an increase from 20.5 percent during the same period in 2016 .
That would often be the Bank of Mom and Dad helping out .
P.S. The Best Advice On Mortgages
This example comes from Mortgage Report ’s First - Time Home Buyers ’ Guide :
You want to buy a house for $ 250,000 with 10 percent down ( $ 25,000 ) .
You ’ve determined that you can afford $ 1,100 a month for your mortgage , including principal and interest .
If your mortgage rate is 3.75 percent , the payment will be $ 1,043 , which is within your budget .
But if the best loan you can get has a rate of 4.25 percent , the payment will be $ 1,107 ― and that ’s out of budget .
It ’s the same house ― affordable under one loan , not affordable under another .
And those are just two loan options .
Mortgage rates are like shifting sands .
They go up and down all day .
So the best advice we can offer is this :
Shop mortgage rates , not housing prices .
Ben Yost Says that most of the loans I see use 3 - 5 % down to get into a home !

The Obama administration 's proposed 2010 budget outlines a plan to increase funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs by $ 25 billion over the next five years , starting with an 11 percent increase in discretionary funding next year .
According to a fact sheet prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget , the president 's Veterans Affairs budget " enables VA to create Centers of Excellence and provides additional veteran - oriented specialty care in areas including prosthetics , vision and spinal cord injury , aging , and women "s health . "
A more detailed version of the president 's proposed budget shows a nearly 14 percent increase in funding for medical and prosthetic research next year .
The budget also earmarks up to $ 5 million for the Graduate Psychology Education Program , which includes treatment of veterans , to support increased training of psychologists skilled in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder , traumatic brain injury and related disorders .
And the economic stimulus plan approved in February included $ 150 million for the construction of state extended - care facilities , including nursing homes , for veterans .
It remains to be seen where Congress will end up on the president 's budget plan , but Obama has set in motion a plan to keep this promise .
And so we rate it In the Works .
On April 15 , 1955 , Ray Kroc opened his own McDonald ’s franchise in Des Plaines , Illinois ( seen below ) .
While tons of people head to this so - called “ first McDonald ’s ” every year , the fact is , the building standing there is not only not the first McDonald ’s ( Kroc actually opened the ninth location of the franchise ) , it ’s not even the original building , but just a reconstruction .
Even so , that spot of ground did have a huge impact on American life as we know it and spawned what was at one point the largest restaurant chain in the world -- the title is now held by Yum !
Brands ( KFC , Taco Bell , etc. ) and followed by Subway .
Image via ChicagoGeek [ Flickr ]
How Did McDonald ’s Get Taken Over By Kroc ?
When I was a kid , I always thought whoever Mr. McDonald was , he must be super rich .
As it turns out , Richard and Maurice McDonald , who started the original restaurant , only made $ 2.7 million on the deal .
While that does seem like a good amount of cash , just think how much the restaurant is worth these days .
To make matters worse , the brothers insisted on retaining the rights to their first restaurant in San Bernardino , so Ray opened a McDonald ’s restaurant right by theirs and ran them out of business .
Worse still , even though the original deal involved the brothers earning 0.5 % of the chain ’s annual revenues , Kroc refused to honor that part of the verbal agreement after the McDonald ’s brothers refused to sell him their original restaurant and the land it stood on .
And it ’s not like the McDonald ’s Brothers did n’t do anything but open an everyday burger joint ; if they did , Ray probably would n’t have been so interested in taking the whole thing over .
They innovated many of the ideas that have made modern fast food restaurants so successful , including assembly line kitchens , simplistic menus and self - serve counters .
The menus had nothing on them but hamburgers , cheeseburgers , French fries , potato chips , sodas , milkshakes and apple pies .
Because things were so quick and efficient , prices were about half of what it cost to get a similar meal at a diner .

McDonald ’s Across the Globe
It was n’t too long after Kroc took over completely that the chain expanded out of America , first to Canada , then Costa Rica , Panama , Japan , Europe and Australia .
These days , there 's McDonald 's located all over the world .
In fact , the image above shows just how widely spread they are in the U.S.
While this world - wide globalization has led to many negative views of the corporation , some people say the company has actually helped improve the standard of service in some areas of the world .
For example , when McDonald ’s opened in Hong Kong in 1975 , it was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean public restrooms .
Soon afterwards , customers began to demand the same from other restaurants in the area .
Whether McDonald ’s has a positive or negative impact in the country it enters may be a matter of opinion , but one thing the restaurant takes great pride in is their localization of the menu based on the native tastes of the area .
Some interesting menu items from around the world include :
Quebec has a regional treat known as poutine , which is a dish with French fries and cheese curds covered in gravy .
McDonald ’s in the area serve this as a popular side dish .
Throughout Canada , you can order chicken fajitas from McDonald’s .
This seemed weird to me that you ca n’t find these in South Western American states where fajitas are a popular staple of Mexican restaurants .
In Egypt , you can find Big Macs with chicken or fish in place of beef and a “ McFalafel ” sandwich .
Throughout the Middle East , McDonald ’s offers a “ McArabia ” sandwich , which is a piece of flat bread with chicken or beef patties .
They also serve a special wrap called the Paneer Salsa wrap , which takes fried , seasoned cottage cheese and wraps it in flat bread with veggies .
Most Indian menus are largely different than those in America , as pig and cow products are not served outside of Southern India .
The chicken and fish are also prepared in separate areas because or strict religious laws regarding the preparation of food for vegetarians .
One of the area ’s specialties is the Maharaja Mac , which was originally made with lamb meat but now is made with chicken .
They also serve a dish called the McCurry pan , which consists of a bowl made from flakey dough filled with chicken in a tomato - curry sauce .
Of all the international McDonald ’s menu items , I think this is the one I ’d want to try the most .
Throughout Asia , you can order a side of McRice in place of fries , this is just an order of plain rice with a cool name .
In China , you can enjoy pineapple and taro pies and a Shogun burger with teriyaki pork .
You might also consider the Rice Fantastic , which is like a beef or chicken sandwich with rice patties in place of buns .
On the Chinese island of Cheung Chau , you can also enjoy mushroom burgers in place of beef during the local Bun Festival .
In Japan , they serve something called the Ebi Fillet - O , which is a fried shrimp sandwich .
There is also a Tamago Double Mac , which has three beef paties , a poached egg , bacon and pepper sauce .
You can even top off your meal with tea milkshakes .
In Thailand they sell corn pies .
In Finland and Norway , you can have wraps with fried fish instead of chicken or beef .
In El Salvador , you can often have French fries made with yucca instead of potatoes .
In Mexico , a popular breakfast option is the McMolletes , English muffins with refried beans , cheese and pico de gallo salsa .
In New Zealand , a popular favorite is the Kiwiburger , which has beef , a poached egg , veggies , cheese and beetroot .

Good Ol’ American Innovation
Even in America , certain locations have their own specialty treats .
The McLobster and McCrab are served seasonally throughout New England .
And in the late 1990’s , Chicago locations offered a hamburger with barbecue sauce and Canadian bacon that was dubbed “ the Beef Wennington ” after a notable Chicago Bulls player .
Many of the company ’s biggest successes were actually created locally by franchisees , including the Filet - O - Fish , the Big Mac and the Egg McMuffin .
The Filet - O - Fish was made by a Cincinnati franchise owner who wanted to offer his Catholic customers a meal they could still eat on Fridays and during lent .
Ray Kroc tried a similar idea at his original restaurant , but his Hula Burger , a sandwich a pineapple slice in place of meat was a huge flop .
As for the Big Mac , it was created by an early Pittsburgh franchiser who wanted to serve something adults would enjoy when feeding their kiddos at the restaurant .
The corporate heads told him he could only create new menu items creating ingredients on the existing menu , which is where the Big Mac was born .
The Egg McMuffin was in a similar position as the Big Mac inventor , only he went ahead and added a new creation to the menu without contacting headquarters .
The corporation was quite upset that he started selling the McMuffin without their blessing , but they quickly changed their minds when they saw how popular it was .

McDecor
It ’s not only the menu that headquarters like to keep consistent .
Locations are largely required to look similar to one another on the inside .
That ’s not to say there are n’t a few stand out locations though .
The “ Solid Gold McDonald ’s ” by the Rock and Roll of Fame is themed after fifties rock and roll .
Victoria , British Columbia has a restaurant with a 24 - carat gold chandelier and other fancy light fixtures ( seen above ) .
The McDonald ’s in Stratford - upon - Avon has a very subtle design , as all buildings in the area are required to conform to the historic look of Shakespeare ’s birthplace .
Whether you love McDonald ’s or loathe it , there ’s no arguing that the restaurant has had a huge impact on our society .
Heck , Fast Food Nation has estimated that one of eight workers in America have been employed at the restaurant at some point of their lives .
So you guys have any weird McDonald ’s in your area ?
Maybe one with unique menu items or a strange design .

Many Wall Street chief executives took a big pay cut for 2009 .
But their real value may have been in deflecting attention from their troops — who enjoyed the largest collective payday on record .
Across Wall Street , leading firms paid out $ 140 billion in compensation and benefits , the highest number in history , based on a final tally of the pay disclosures at 38 financial - services firms .
That figure , which was projected earlier by The Wall Street Journal , represented an increase from $ 123 billion earned by financial professionals ...
Russian scientists say that Moscow stray dogs became much smarter .
The four legged oldest human ’s friends demonstrate real smartness such as riding the Moscow metro every morning to get from their suburban places of living to the fat regions of Moscow center .
Once they arrive to the downtown they demonstrate different new , previously unseen for the dog skills .
Those skills can include “ the hunt for shawarma ” for example , the popular among Muscovites eastern cuisine dish .
This hunt scene can be seen as this :
Regular Moscow busy street with some small food kiosks .
A middle - aged man buys himself a piece of hot fast food and walks aside chewing it without a rush .
Then just in a second he jumps up frightened – some doggy has sneaked up on him and barked out loudly .
His tasty snack falls out from his hands down to the ground and the dog gets it .
Just ten minutes later , on the same place , the teen youngster loses his dinner in exactly the same manner .
The modern Russian dogs are on their urban hunt .
“ This method of ambushing people from their back is widely exercised by Moscow dogs ” , saying A. Poiarkov , working in Ecology and Evolution Institute of Moscow .
“ The main point here is to define who would drop the food scared and who wo n’t , but the dogs are great psychologists they can do it better than us ” .
Moscow ecologists think that dogs started acquiring this habits in 1990s , when the Soviet union collapsed and Moscow has fell into the hands of new class of Russian capitalists .
They understood the true value of the downtown realty underestimated by previous Communist owners and became removing all the industrial complexes Moscow had in its centre to its outskirts .
Those places were used by homeless dogs as a shelter often , so the dogs had to move together with their houses , so they had to learn how to travel Moscow subway – first to get to the centre in the morning then back home in the evening , just as us people .
“ Sometimes dogs are doing mistakes adapting in metro , but they are studying . ”
The commercial revolution of Moscow made their usual feeding places like trash bins out of direct reach , so they had to get to know new ways of getting their piece of food .
That ’s how appeared those “ Shawarma hunts ” .
Sometimes though they use more gentle methods .
Young girl sits on the bench to eat her hot dog – a big cute looking dog appears from the surrounding bushes and puts her head on her knees .
The girl ca n’t help herself sharing the hotdog with a dog .
Among some more amazing skill those Moscow dogs are the ability not to miss their stop while going on the subway train .
Biologists say dogs have very nice sense of time which helps them not to miss their destination .
Another skill they have is to cross the road on the green traffic light .
“ They do n’t react on color , but on the picture they see on the traffic light ” , Moscow scientist tells .
Also they choose often the last or the first metro car – those are less crowded usually .
It ’s funny but the ecologists studying Moscow stray dogs also tell the dogs do n’t miss a chance to get some play while on their travel in the subway .
They are fond of jumping in the train just seconds before the doors shut closed risking their tails be jammed .
“ They do it for fun , just they have enough food ” , they conclude .
continued below …
“ Traveling first class , compared to this human ”
“ Practice makes perfect , true . ”
“ Just a regular member of busy day underground stream ”
“ Waiting for the right train ”
“ What ?
Questions you ’ve got ? ”
“ Wrong place ?
Well , we still are learning what ’s wrong and what ’s not . ”

Despite the fact that Greece has already implemented radical austerity measures and despite the € 45 billion secured from the EU and the IMF , the bond markets have continued to decent into insanity .
The current 10 - year yield spread between German and Greek 10 - year bonds imply a 100 % certainty of a 44 % default ( bond holders will get only 56 % of the nominal value ) assuming 0 % risk of a German default .
Anyone who studies historical defaults , not to mention the adverse consequences to Greece if it defaults should recognize that this is irrational .
But it appears that the bond markets are driven by speculators determined to implement a self - fulfilling prophecy , i.e. by short - selling they hope to drive up yields , something which they know will raise the assumed probability of default , and thus help raise yields further in a self - reinforcing vicious spiral .
How can this be solved ?
Since euro area exit and default are closed , and since further austerity measures would - at least alone - likely have no significant effect given current market sentiment , only one solution will be effective : namely for Germany and others to extend the 5 % loan offer to indefinite amounts , coupled of course with tough demands to implement deficit reduction measures .
This would eliminate the risk of default , and would ultimately mean that Greek bond yields would fall to levels below 5 % , thereby eliminating the need for the facility .
Bond markets may not respond this way in the short term given the current irrationality , but it really would n't matter since Greece would n't have to borrow from them anyway .
And since people in time would realize that this will be a obvious losing bet , yields would ultimately adjust .
But would n't this be unfair to tax payers in Germany and elsewhere who has to " bail out " Greece ?
The answer to this is an emphatic , because it would n't really be a bailout since " bailout " traditionally means that the entity that bails out loses economically from it .
But in this case it wo n't .
If Germany borrows € 25 billion from the bond markets at 3 % and lends that money to Greece , the German tax payers will500 million euros per year .
If the amount is € 50 billion , the gain will be € 1 billion per year , if the amount is € 100 billion , the gain will be € 2 billion per year , and so on .
The German government ( and other governments ) will engage in arbitrage , not a bail out .
Since the mutual gain to both will be greater the greater the arbitraged sum , there is nothing unsustainable about this , regardless of how great the transactions will be .
Another key argument against this is that it might encourage other European governments to be fiscally reckless , because they expect to receive a similar deal .
This argument completely overlooks first of all that these loans comes associated with exactly the kind of fiscal austerity measures that the loans are allegedly discouraging and secondly that even with this help , Greece will pay a much heavier price than other countries with similar fiscal situations .
At 5 % , the real cost of borrowing will be much higher than for governments with similar deficits both inside and outside the euro zone .
Greece is being more than sufficiently punished for its fiscal sins .
If EU leaders adopted this plan , the crisis would quickly fade away , relieving Europe 's economic problems .
If they do n't , then anything could happen , and then ashes from Icelandic volcanoes might not be the only thing darkening the future economic picture in Europe .
The Effectiveness of Political Assassinations
This is an excellent read :
I would n’t have believed you if you ’d told me 20 years ago that America would someday be routinely firing missiles into countries it ’s not at war with .
For that matter , I would n’t have believed you if you ’d told me a few months ago that America would soon be plotting the assassination of an American citizen who lives abroad .
He goes on to discuss Obama ’s authorization of the assassination of Anwar al - Awlaki , an American living in Yemen .
He speculates on whether or not this is illegal , but spends more time musing about the effectiveness of assassination , referring to a 2009 paper from Security Studies : “ When Heads Roll : Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Decapitation “ :
“ She studied 298 attempts , from 1945 through 2004 , to weaken or eliminate terrorist groups through ‘ leadership decapitation ’ — eliminating people in senior positions . ”
From the paper ’s conclusion :
The data presented in this paper show that decapitation is not an effective counterterrorism strategy .
While decapitation is effective in 17 percent of all cases , when compared to the overall rate of organizational decline , decapitated groups have a lower rate of decline than groups that have not had their leaders removed .
The findings show that decapitation is more likely to have counterproductive effects in larger , older , religious , and separatist organizations .
In these cases decapitation not only has a much lower rate of success , the marginal value is , in fact , negative .
The data provide an essential test of decapitation ’s value as a counterterrorism policy .
There are important policy implications that can be derived from this study of leadership decapitation .
Leadership decapitation seems to be a misguided strategy , particularly given the nature of organizations being currently targeted .
The rise of religious and separatist organizations indicates that decapitation will continue to be an ineffective means of reducing terrorist activity .
It is essential that policy makers understand when decapitation is unlikely to be successful .
Given these conditions , targeting bin Laden and other senior members of al Qaeda , independent of other measures , is not likely to result in organizational collapse .
Finally , it is essential that policy makers look at trends in organizational decline .
Understanding whether certain types of organizations are more prone to destabilization is an important first step in formulating successful counterterrorism policies .
Back to the article :
Particularly ominous are Jordan ’s findings about groups that , like Al Qaeda and the Taliban , are religious .
The chances that a religious terrorist group will collapse in the wake of a decapitation strategy are 17 percent .
Of course , that ’s better than zero , but it turns out that the chances of such a group fading away when there ’s no decapitation are 33 percent .
In other words , killing leaders of a religious terrorist group seems to increase the group ’s chances of survival from 67 percent to 83 percent .
Of course the usual caveat applies :
It ’s hard to disentangle cause and effect .
Maybe it ’s the more formidable terrorist groups that invite decapitation in the first place — and , needless to say , formidable groups are good at survival .
Still , the other interpretation of Jordan ’s findings — that decapitation just does n’t work , and in some cases is counterproductive — does make sense when you think about it .
For starters , reflect on your personal workplace experience .
When an executive leaves a company — whether through retirement , relocation or death — what happens ?
Exactly : He or she gets replaced .
And about half the time ( in my experience , at least ) the successor is more capable than the predecessor .
There ’s no reason to think things would work differently in a terrorist organization .
Maybe that ’s why newspapers keep reporting the death of a “ high ranking Al Qaeda lieutenant ” ; it is n’t that we keep killing the same guy , but rather that there ’s an endless stream of replacements .
You ’re not going to end the terrorism business by putting individual terrorists out of business .
You might as well try to end the personal computer business by killing executives at Apple and Dell .
Capitalism being the stubborn thing it is , new executives would fill the void , so long as there was a demand for computers .
Of course , if you did enough killing , you might make the job of computer executive so unattractive that companies had to pay more and more for ever - less - capable executives .
But that ’s one difference between the computer business and the terrorism business .
Terrorists are n’t in it for the money to begin with .
They have less tangible incentives — and some of these may be strengthened by targeted killings .
Read the whole thing .
I thought this comment , from former senator Gary Hart , was particularly good .
As a veteran of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate the Intelligence Services of the U.S. ( so - called Church committee ) , we discovered at least five official plots to assassinate foreign leaders , including Fidel Castro with almost demented insistence .
None of them worked , though the Diem brothers in Vietnam and Salvador Allende in Chile might argue otherwise .
In no case did it work out well for the U.S. or its policy .
Indeed , once exposed , as these things inevitably are , the ideals underlying our Constitution and the nation ’s prestige suffered incalculable damage .
The issue is principle versus expediency .
Principle always suffers when expediency becomes the rule .
We simply cannot continue to sacrifice principle to fear .

Most extraordinary event since Christian the Lion .
Masturbation in infant girls sometimes leads to doctor visits because parents think the children have a movement disorder , a new study finds .
Do n't worry , the researchers say .
It 's all natural and harmless .
In the study , researchers reviewed a dozen cases of young girls who were referred to pediatric movement disorder clinics between 1997 and 2002 for evaluation of episodic dystonic posturing , characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal movements and positions .
After sometimes invasive testing and medication , the neurologists discovered the symptoms were actually normal muscle contractions that accompany masturbation .
" Masturbation is a normal human behavior .
It 's not harmful to anybody , " said study leader Jonathan Mink , Chief of Child Neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
Infant boys who masturbate do n't end up at the doctor as often , Mink figures , because the action in boys is more recognizable :
They tend to touch their genitals .
Girls do n't necessarily directly touch their genitals when masturbating .
An episode may begin in a car seat or high chair where straps place pressure on the genital area , or they may start when a child is tired or bored .
Viewing the episodes videotaped by parents , Mink determined the children were not suffering from dystonic posturing .
One child was distracted out of the episode with the promise of a cookie .
Another stopped to play with a toy truck .
Children with dystonia cannot respond or be distracted .
The research is detailed in the December issue of the journal Pediatrics .
Mink says pediatricians should ask parents to video - tape the episodes before performing invasive and often expensive tests that could be unnecessary .
He also has some reassuring words for parents :
Masturbation " does n't portend any sexual deviancy later in life , " Mink said .
" It 's such a common and normal behavior that it 's nothing to worry about .
It 's not appropriate to punish children for it .
They associate it with comfort , like thumb - sucking . "
According to the CEO of Chevron
According to David O’Reilly the CEO of CHEVRON , the world currently consumes oil at a rate of about 40,000 US gallons per second .
He says , “ the scale of the energy system is enormous . ”
So , I did some math .
1 barrel of oil = 42 US gallons
1 cubic meter = 264.17 US gallons
According to the 2008 World Fact - book , the world currently consumes about 85,270,000 barrels of oil per day .
85,270,000 barrels per day x 42 US gallons per barrel =
3,581,340,000 US gallons per day = 149,222,500 US gallons per hour = 2,487,042 US gallons per minute = 41,451 US gallons per second .
So , Mr. O’Reilly was right when he said that the world consumes about 40,000 US gallons of oil per second .
41,451 US gallons of oil per second = approximately 157 cubic meters of oil per second .
Imagine a river of oil .
I thought it might interesting to see just how much oil we are talking about here , so I compared the amount of oil that we are currently burning in the world to the amount of water that flows in various waterfalls .
I used average yearly flow rate figures .
The flow rate of Jog Falls is about 153 cubic meters per second , a little less than our imaginary river of oil .
You can see what 153 cubic meters per second looks like here :

Now imagine it on fire with black smoke billowing into the air .
To adamantly insist that this could n’t be effecting the environment is irrational .
Many combat veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan dispute this explanation .
Duncan D. Hunter , a Republican congressman from Southern California , served two tours as a Marine in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 and one tour in Afghanistan in 2007 .
He led the effort last year to include the language in the National Defense Authorization Act requiring the Pentagon to review its criteria for Medal of Honor awards .
When I met with him recently in his Washington office , he insisted that moments of extreme valor are still occurring frequently — almost as frequently as they did in Vietnam or during World War II .
“ Warfare has changed , ” he said .
“ But 90 percent of it has n’t .
You ’ve still got to take ground , and you ’ve got to hold it . ”
He raised the possibility that , in today ’s all - volunteer military , expectations and standards have gone up : an action that would have been considered heroic in the mid-20th century is seen today almost as routine conduct — “ just being a Marine . ”
Other observers have suggested — and Petraeus ’s comments to me could be seen to support the idea — that the military , after its recent experiences with Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman , is hesitant to publicize or otherwise herald tales of heroism , for fear of later embarrassment .
Both Lynch , in 2003 , and Tillman , in 2004 , were initially celebrated as war heroes .
But Lynch herself was highly critical of those who described her as a heroine , later testifying before Congress that she had been falsely portrayed as a “ little - girl Rambo from the hills . ”
Tillman ’s family also testified before Congress , suggesting that his story was deliberately manipulated by officials in order to gather support for the war effort .
“ They have to be very careful , ” O’Hanlon told me .
“ The idea of first building up this great story and then having it proven factually inaccurate would be very damaging . ”
For many critics of the Pentagon ’s handling of the Medal of Honor , Rafael Peralta ’s case is a vivid example of the perils of an overly cautious , overly bureaucratic approval process .
The standard for awarding the Medal of Honor has always been “ incontestable proof of the performance of service , ” but critics charge that in recent years the standard for “ incontestable ” must have been raised .
“ The eyewitness accounts , it seems , they mean much less than they used to , ” Hunter told me .
“ Now there ’s much more weight placed on forensic evidence . ”
George Sabga obtained redacted copies of the Medal of Honor recommendation packages that were submitted for Rafael Peralta by the Marine Corps in 2005 , which he shared with me .
The contents of these packages suggest that , long before the case reached the Pentagon , a pathologist working on an earlier - level review of Peralta ’s Medal of Honor case raised questions about his gunshot wound .
The pathologist expressed the opinion that , given the particular location of the head wound that Peralta received at the start of the firefight , he would have been cognitively disabled and could not deliberately have brought the grenade in toward his body .
A letter included with the pathologist ’s report suggests that Peralta ’s “ scooping / grabbing ” was more likely to have been a result of “ involuntary muscle spasms ” than of a conscious act of courage .
After the pathologist ’s report , the packet was returned to Peralta ’s division for reconsideration .
General Natonski , then commanding general of the First Marine Division , was evidently unconvinced by the pathologist ’s interpretation .
He ordered a thorough review of the investigation , enlisting medical specialists of his own .
In a letter addressed to the secretary of the Navy , dated Aug. 8 , 2005 , Natonski restated the case on Peralta ’s behalf : “ This package is being resubmitted based on reinterviews and sworn statements from eyewitnesses as well as new statements from three neurosurgeons with outstanding credentials who have given their medical opinion .
These doctors opine that Sergeant Peralta could have scooped the grenade under his body despite his head wound .
However , regardless of the medical opinions rendered after the fact there is sufficient eyewitness testimony and physical evidence ( grenade fuse lodged in Sergeant Peralta ’s flak jacket ) to support this award recommendation . ”
But the pathologist ’s original opinion , it appears , continued to sway those in the Pentagon reviewing the file .
MUCH OF THE anger expressed by officers and veterans groups about the decline in Medal of Honor awards reflects their perception that Pentagon officials are disrespectful , even dismissive , of eyewitness accounts by servicemen .
The feeling is compounded by the fact that , in today ’s military , younger servicemen sometimes have far more combat experience than their seniors now working in the Pentagon , who often progressed through the military hierarchy in a time of relative peace : after Vietnam but before the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
In a phone conversation with me , Robert Reynolds , one of the Marines who was with Peralta during the firefight in Falluja , expressed frustration that his testimony was not taken seriously .
He , like Peralta , was shot during the firefight , and he said he clearly recalled Peralta smothering the grenade .
“ Knowing what Sergeant Peralta did for me , ” he said , “ it angers me to know that the Marines that day are basically called liars . ”
Peralta is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego .
One recent afternoon , Rosa Peralta , along with Rafael ’s 19 - year - old brother , Ricardo ( only weeks from beginning Marine Corps boot camp himself ) , and George Sabga , drove to the cemetery with me .
As we stood around Peralta ’s simple white marble headstone , Sabga recounted the moment when he and Rosa Peralta learned that Rafael would not receive the Medal of Honor .
General Natonski had slid a copy of the Navy Cross citation across the table to Rosa .
“ Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own personal safety , ” the citation read , “ Sergeant Peralta reached out and pulled the grenade to his body , absorbing the brunt of the blast and shielding fellow Marines only feet away . ”
The wording of the citation is strikingly similar to the description of the events as Peralta ’s fellow Marines have related them , not as the pathologist interpreted them .
“ I asked the general , ‘ How can you say that there were doubts and yet you give us a Navy Cross citation that says that Sergeant Peralta did the exact same thing that the Marines say he did ? ’ ” Sabga recounted .
“ I told him , ‘ Every single Medal of Honor from now on is going to be tainted because of what ’s been done to Peralta . ’
The Marines are never going to give up .
We ’re never going to give up fighting for Peralta ’s medal . ”
Last year we spent a total of $ 690.3 billion dollars in Iraq .
Whether you view the war as effective or not is not the point .
The point is that we are in a global recession that is the worst recession since the Great Depression .
We need to take action to start to rebuild the United States economy .
We need to start to bring troops back from overseas so we can cut the cost and put that money towards education .
By funding education we give the future of our country a better chance at sucess .
It is time we take action in making the United states number one highest country for college graduates .
The corporate media has been doing their best lately to draw false equivalencies in their coverage of the recent spike in right wing violence in America .
Grasping at any little straw , pundits like MSNBC's Pat Buchanan have even gone so far as to use the Rodney King riots to show how " the left is just as bad . "
Now , Newsbusters has taken things a notch lower :
Liberals in the media have been busy parading around Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to bash the right .
As befits his organization 's MO , Potok , pictured right in a file photo , has done the best he can to link recently - arrested militia members to the Tea Party movement and conservatism generally .
Potok 's job may have just gotten a bit harder , and the liberal media may need to find another way to discredit their political opponents .
It turns out most of the militiamen were active voters , and at least one was a registered Democrat .
Party registrations for the rest are not yet known .
Jacob J. Ward , 33 , of Huron , Ohio , voted as a Democrat in the 2004 and 2008 primary elections .
He also voted in 10 other elections since 2000 .
Party affiliation in Ohio is determined by which party 's ballot they requested in the most recent primary election .
This amazingly bad article mercifully ends with this belly laugher :
Well that should put to rest the notion that these people were somehow affiliated with or influenced by mainstream conservatives .
Well , there you go .
One of these nuts was a registered Democrat so the entire group is actually a bunch of flaming LIBS !
No right wing influence here , no siree !
Give me a f*&king break !
Hmmm ... was n't some big celebrity entertainer urging his Republican fans to switch parties so they could vote in Democratic primaries back in 2008 ?
Oh yeah , that was Rush Limbaugh .
Even if Ward was n't doing Limbaugh 's bidding , and was , at one time , an actual Democrat , his membership in the Hutaree tells me that his real politics had moved hard to the right .
The brewing tuner adaptation of “ American Psycho ” has found its creative team , with Duncan Sheik penning music and lyrics and scribe Roberto Aguirre - Sacasa writing the book .
A 1991 Bret Easton Ellis novel that centers on a Wall Street banker who ’s also a serial killer , “ American Psycho ” incorporates multiples references to the popular music of the 1980s , the era in which the story is set .
Producers have said they expect the original score to share that 80s flavor .
Read on for more .
Sheik nabbed a 2007
Tony as the composer of “ Spring Awakening . ”
He also is at work on legit projects including “ Nero ” and “ Whisper House , ” which recently opened at the Old Globe in San Diego .
Aguirre - Sacasa , a writer on HBO skein “ Big Love , ” has penned plays including “ Based on a Totally True Story , ” “ Good Boys and True ” and “ Dark Matters . ”

Taking the offensive for the first time in his campaign for governor , Jerry Brown tried to counter Republican momentum by issuing a challenge from the state Democratic convention podium Saturday for his GOP opponents to debate him before the primary election in June .
Brown ’s pronouncement , in front of thousands of excited Democrats at the Los Angeles Convention Center , was meant to rally the party against a national tide favoring Republicans that threatens his chances for a second tenure as governor , and has also put Sen. Barbara Boxer in a reelection battle .
He jabbed repeatedly at Republican Meg Whitman , the billionaire former head of EBay who has put $ 59 million of her own money into her gubernatorial campaign .
“ Campaigning and democracy is not about buying hundreds of millions of dollars of 30 - second TV ads , ” Brown told the delegates , vastly exaggerating her spending .
“ When we live in a democracy , we ’re not consumers of advertising .
We ’re agents of democratic choice .
We ’re actors in a historical drama . ”
Alluding to commercials aired by Whitman and her fellow Republican Steve Poizner , who trails her in polls for the June 8 primary , Brown said : “ Come out from behind those glittering poppy fields , those beautiful car crashes over the mountain .
Let ’s set up some honest debates . ”
Poizner ’s campaign immediately accepted Brown ’s three - debate proposal ; Whitman ’s campaign at first said she was open to the idea but later declined .
It was a bit of drama in a convention with little tension among Democrats themselves , because most of the party ’s major candidates do not face serious primary challengers .
But beneath their outward enthusiasm while waving signs and handing out stickers for candidates , there was an underlying sense among attendees that they are at a disadvantage in November by virtue of the bruising fight over President Obama ’s national healthcare plan and the political pendulum that seems poised to swing against Democrats as the party of power in Washington .
“ I need you to be excited -- as excited as the ‘ tea party ’ people are , ” Boxer told Democrats , referring to the Republican - leaning national movement , after she marched into the cheering hall in an outfit of deep coral to “ Ain’t No Mountain High Enough . ”
“ Will you help me ? ” she asked , and the crowd responded with a roar .
Brown , 72 , was governor from 1975 until 1983 .
His thrifty , nearly invisible campaign has some Democrats nervous about beating the deep - pocketed Whitman , 53 .
He acknowledged the party ’s general unease at the outset of his speech .
“ Yeah , there ’s some anxiety out there , but we ’re on the move , Democrats , ” he said .
“ And I have to say I do feel humbled to be standing before you once again ready to take over the leadership in California .
And I ’m also really proud to be in a state and a country that chose Barack Obama as our president . ”
Although Whitman has yet to win her primary , she loomed large , a kind of boogeyman for Democratic leaders .
The state party chairman , John Burton , overlooked Poizner , 53 , completely in saying voters have “ two choices ” in November .
“ One is a woman in an empty suit that ’s chock - full of money that she wants to spend to buy the governor ’s office , ” Burton said .
“ The other is our candidate , a proven commodity . ”
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer accused Whitman of an “ inability to be truthful ” about the level of taxation and spending in the state , among other issues .
He criticized her for pushing “ a tax break for millionaires and billionaires ” and said Democrats needed to defend against “ selfish , scaremongering , silly and stupid right - wing ideologies . ”
Later , as Brown power - walked between caucuses at the nearby JW Marriott , he told delegates that “ your power can make a difference against her money . ”
“ Running for governor is not like trying to sell a used car with misleading ads on television , bait - and - switch , ” he said .
Whitman spokeswoman Sarah Pompei called Brown ’s criticism “ ridiculous . . . from a guy who has n’t even been on the campaign trail . ”
She said he was being propped up by independent expenditure committees that are “ union front groups ” and had refused to “ give Californians any idea where he stands on the issues . ”
On the national level , other Democrats signaled that the party would seek to turn passage of the healthcare plan into a referendum on their Republican foes .
U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said the party would eagerly defend a plan she said gives coverage to 32 million people , requires insurers to cover children with preexisting conditions , helps seniors with prescription costs , allows young adults to stay on their parents ’ plans longer and gives tax credits to assist small businesses with coverage .
“ Bring it on , ” said Solis , who as a congresswoman represented parts of the Eastside and San Gabriel Valley .
“ I for one know Sen. Barbara Boxer would love to have that discussion with any one of those GOP candidates . ”
For the first time , Boxer criticized her Republican rivals , though without naming them .
She slammed former Rep. Tom Campbell for his work when he was state budget director , criticized Carly Fiorina for her controversial tenure as chief of Hewlett - Packard and described Orange County Assemblyman Chuck DeVore as an obstructionist .
“ One of my opponents was Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s top economic advisor during our state ’s budget crises .
Need I say more about that opponent ? ” she asked .
“ Another one of my opponents had a well - crafted and perfectly executed jobs plan . . . for India , for China , for Europe , outsourcing California jobs .
A third opponent is a state legislator who ’s done nothing to stop the state ’s budget mess . ”
She told delegates she needed their energy in her reelection battle .
“ The lines are drawn and , yes , we are in a real fight , a real fight for the direction of our state and our nation , ” she said .

The Wildlife Conservation Society released a list of critically endangered species dubbed the " Rarest of the Rare " -- a group of animals most in danger of extinction , ranging from Cuban crocodiles to white - headed langurs in Vietnam .
The list of a dozen animals includes an eclectic collection of birds , mammals , reptiles and amphibians .
Some are well known , such as the Sumatran orangutan ; while others are more obscure , including vaquita , an ocean porpoise .
The list appears in the 2010 - 1011 edition of State of the Wild -- a Global Portrait .
Threats to each species vary widely .
In the case of the vaquita , fishermen 's nets are catching them and inadvertently causing them to drown .
Meanwhile , the Grenada dove -- the national bird of the small island nation -- has been severely impacted by habitat loss .
Other species suffer from illegal trade , as in the case of the ploughshare tortoise .
" The Rarest of the Rare provides a global snapshot of some of the world 's most endangered animals , " said State of the Wild Kent Redford , director of the Wildlife Conservation Society Institute .
" While the news is dire for some species , it also shows that conservation measures can and do protect wildlife if given the chance to work . "
The list of endangered species includes :
Cuban crocodile : Currently restricted to two small areas of Cuba .

The 2010 list highlights positive news , with two species on the road to recovery thanks to conservation efforts :
Rober 's tree frog whose population has grown due to captive breeding in zoos ; and Przewalski's horse , which is starting to rebuild numbers after being re-introduced into the wild .
The 2010 - 2011 State of the Wild includes a special section devoted to the impact of human conflicts on wildlife and wild places .
It considers how conservation can contribute to peace - building and reconstruction in post - conflict areas .
In today 's trading session , the Dow , S&P and NASDAQ were down nearly 9 % before rebounding , while the VIX soared over 40 % .

Advice and tips on how to survive bullying and intimidation in the workplace , and ways of dealing with individually , legally , or collectively .
Cuts in staffing and resources , increasing workloads , performance related pay : all have made work more pressurised .
The University of Manchester says bullying accounts for up to half of all employment stress .
The few studies done show the majority of incidents are by bosses , but it 's still important to support people being bullied by work ' mates ' .
Call it what you will : harassment , aggression , coercive management , intimidation , or things seen as ' just a joke ' - all are common labels for what is really bullying .
Racial or sexual harassment , or that based on sexuality or disability , may also take the form of bullying .
Bullying is any long - standing aggression , physical or psychological , by an individual or group directed against someone who is unable to defend themselves .
It is rarely confined to insulting remarks or open aggression , but can be subtle , devious , often taking place when there are no witnesses , and be difficult to confront for those whose confidence and self esteem have been worn down .
It is a myth that only quiet or ' weak ' people will be victimised since a bully will also pick on the popular or successful if they 're perceived as a threat .
Widespread bullying by bosses is hardly surprising in world which is structured hierarchically - the rich living off the working class , men dominating women , adults abusing children ...
Work is similarly organised , to control the behaviour of workers with management positions providing the perfect situation for bullying .
Bullies tend to surround themselves with supporters , spies and ' court jesters ' while cultivating allies in senior management .
The bully will create rivalries in the workforce , as people anxiously fight to stay in their favour , creating a divisive culture which brings out the worst in people .
To be ' in ' with a bully can seem the best way to survive , and cover any feelings of inadequacy by displacing these on to others , through siding with the bully 's aggression .
But as long as a bully feels that they can get away with it they will continue .
A living nightmare
Being bullied makes people feel vulnerable , isolated and frustrated , and may lead to stress related illnesses like constant headaches , loss of weight , ulcers or kidney problems .
It affects relationships with family and friends :
" Bill gradually became quiet and withdrawn .
I knew that it had something to do with work , but whenever I tried to make him talk about it , he became very irritable .
He lost weight , too , and lost interest in everything .
He would sleep for hours on end ... for three years there was no laughter in our house . "
Those being bullied often feel ashamed and that they must have done something to deserve it , which opens them to more bullying .
Spotting bullying
Spotting what 's going on early puts you in a much stronger position .
Problems often arise when a person is new or recently promoted .
The earliest sign is that a relationship at work does n't feel right : is your boss responding to you in a different way ; do you feel put down by belittling remarks or continual criticisms of your work , even though the standard has n't changed ; are you beginning to feel that supposed mistakes are all your fault ?
Other signs are constant assessment , useless errands , false complaints , persistent humiliation in front of others , and a boss 's inability to admit they could be wrong .
A bully will try to get rid of someone they perceive as a threat ; not promoting able people , taking credit for others ' ideas or work , or alternatively not giving enough work or responsibility and then claiming laziness or lack of initiative .
Surviving
In dealing with bullying it is important not to be undermined and try to remain positive , though this is easier said than done .
Try to take responsibility for your feelings and behaviour , keep things in perspective and do n't let it dominate your life .
However deflated you feel , make time to do stuff you enjoy .
Talk things over with friends , many of them will have had a similar experience .
You could try self - defence or assertiveness training , as this may help you cope better .
Initial tactics : stand firm against verbal attacks - tell the bully you wo n't tolerate personal remarks .
Keep calm and say what has to be said quietly and coherently , and if they try to shout you down , just repeat yourself and keep doing so until they listen ( or more likely walk off ) .
If instructions are unclear , ask for written clarification , suggesting this will improve your performance ; this can be useful as evidence .
Remain confident in your own judgement and ability .
Avoid being alone with the bully if you can .
The law
There 's no specific legislation dealing with bullying at work .
Employers have a legal duty to protect employees ' health and consult safety reps about health and safety matters , which includes bullying as it's a workplace stress .
Safety reps have legal rights : to inspect the workplace and to take up health and safety complaints , with paid time off for their functions .
Bullying involving a sexual racial or disability aspect may be challenged under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , Race Relations Act 1976 , or Disability Discrimination Act 1995 .
Unions should have policies to deal with bullying , making clear that it will not be tolerated .
The complaints procedure should set out on what basis the bully may be suspended pending the results of an investigation .
Independent counselling should also be available .
Bullying is not just some deviant behaviour which can be eliminated by having the correct policies , but such procedures can form the basis around which to organise ( see the excellent Solidarity Federation pamphlet : ` Health and Safety at Work ' on overcoming the pitfalls and problems of relying on legislation and the unions – email solfed ( at ) solfed.org.uk for more information ) .
Fighting back
Check your job description is n't being abused .
Keep a detailed diary , including dates , times and locations , of every verbal attack , contrary or arbitrary instruction , or where your competence was questioned .
Write to the bully after incidents , challenging them , and keep copies of relevant correspondence and memos .
When making a complaint stick to the facts and avoid character assassination .
It 's probably a good idea to send copies of your complaint to senior management .
Wherever possible , insist on a witness , either a friend or union rep , being present at meetings .
Tell your doctor what 's happening as they will usually give you a sick note giving you time to recover and plan your next move .
It 's important to state the cause , and name the bully on the sick note as it can be a very important piece of evidence .
Making a complaint may make things worse and lead to increased vindictiveness and being labelled a trouble - maker .
Confrontation can be unsafe when it 's done alone .
Bullying usually affects several members of staff , and the more people experiencing it the stronger your case and potential allies .
The staff of one school responded to problems with their headmaster by avoiding further argument , keeping silent , and not reacting .
The head 's self - satisfied smirk was replaced with a puzzled ' what are they up to now ? ' expression :
" Although this did nothing to alter the practical problems , we felt better because it was no longer the headmaster calling the tune . "
Quietly build solidarity with your colleagues , being careful who you talk to , and when you have enough information use it .
Be creative : paste a caricature of them on noticeboards , PCs etc .
If desperate deface their notes , property , car etc. with suitably , poignant life questions , but be careful , remember CCTV and do n't get caught .
If you need assistance you can contact SolFed : using an outside group can be very effective , assuring anonymity , but it 's no replacement for solidarity at work .
Last resort
As a last resort you can always resign and try to prove to an industrial tribunal that you were forced to leave due to intolerable conditions .
You must be employed for two years and will need a detailed log of the abuse to be able to claim ' constructive dismissal ' .
Tribunals will examine particular recorded incidents of abuse but their main interest is in whether the correct procedures were followed .
A request for an acceptable reference can be built into a winning claim .
Compensation varies .
In an out - of - court settlement won by Unison , a social worker in Scotland in 1996 received £ 66,000 after being forced to retire through ill health , caused by bullying by her superior .
A health visitor was awarded £ 5,000 damages in 1997 from North East Thames Community Care NHS Trust , after persistent undermining by a nursing manager .
Organising against bullying can have a knock - on effect and help build wider confidence and solidarity in the workplace as Bob , a postal worker , explains :
" Management are constantly trying to get information out of us so they can make cuts and increase profits but we do everything we can to sabotage their efficiency drives .
It 's our knowledge and experience which one day will be used to transform our working lives for the benefit of all .
In the meantime , we have an ongoing guerrilla campaign on our hands ... and that includes against union bureaucrats along with the bosses .
Sure , we are not as solid as we would all like , but the basic uncooperative attitude is always there . "

Very impressive !
Now , I 've made some cakes in the past , just as a hobby , and so I 'm curious .
What exactly is the dragon ?
Is it all chocolate ?
Did you use a gaigantic mold ?
Is it cake with parts of it being chocolate ?
Like the legs and head ?
And I know that you used fondant for the scales and such .
And is the dice a big block of chocolate ?
Or cake ?
Or just pure fondant ?

For a cow , it does n’t get much better than India .
Wander the streets surrounded by vegetarians , enjoy being adorned with garlands and treated with god - like reverence as you look forward to dying of old age .
But danger lurks , even in paradise .
A dirty little secret that most Indian politicians do n’t discuss is the thriving cow smuggling trade from their Hindu- majority nation , home of the sacred cow , to Muslim - majority Bangladesh , where many people enjoy a good steak .
The trade is particularly robust around the Muslim festival of Eid .
India has outlawed cattle exports , but that has n’t prevented well - organized traffickers from herding millions of the unlucky beasts each year onto trains and trucks , injecting them with drugs on arrival so they walk faster , then forcing them to ford rivers and lumber into slaughterhouses immediately across the border .
On the hot , flat Murshidabad plains bridging the border , Sarvender Ghankar , 24 , a member of India ’s Border Security Force , pointed toward Bangladesh .
It ’s a few hundred yards away , but the line is unmarked .
Farmers wander back and forth .
But to hear him talk , the divide is as secure as Ft. Knox .
“ There used to be smuggling , but now the border is completely sealed , ” Ghankar said , sporting camouflage fatigues , shiny black boots and a 20 - round semiautomatic rifle .
“ Soon we ’ll even have a fence . ”
Area residents have a different take .
“ The border guards are in on it , both in India and Bangladesh , and take bribes to look the other way , ” said Yasin Mullah , 55 , a Murshidabad shopkeeper and cow owner .
“ Smuggling is rampant these days with all the money and growing population . ”
Estimates suggest 1.5 million cows , valued at up to $ 500 million , are smuggled annually , providing more than half the beef consumed in Bangladesh .
The cows come from as far as Rajasthan , about 1,000 miles away .
Many trade hands several times en route .
At the Panso market in Jharkhand state , an interim stop about 300 miles from the border , the 15,000 or so cows passing through each week fetch about $ 100 apiece , local vendors say .
Animals that arrive exhausted are injected with Diclofenac sodium , a banned anti-inflammatory drug , to energize them .
Most of the traders are Muslims .
Many of the drivers and handlers are Hindus .
At the border , crossings are usually done at night .
Most cows pass through West Bengal state , which shares a 1,300 - mile border with Bangladesh .
The state ’s communist government maintains a neutral line on religion , allowing cows to be openly slaughtered and traded .
Other Indian states accuse West Bengal of encouraging the illegal trade , said Haripada Biswas , a state assemblyman from Jagadal district , a stance he sees as hypocritical .
“ Delhi is biased against cow killing , but beef is very delicious , ” Biswas said .
“ And many of the illegal cows arrive from cow - loving states .
Those guys act all principled , and quickly blame us , but do n’t seem above making a tidy profit . ”
The profits can be significant .
A $ 100 medium - size cow in Jharkhand is worth nearly double that in West Bengal and about $ 350 in Bangladesh .
Indian residents along the border complain that the markup also attracts illegal migrants from Bangladesh , who steal cows at night and dart back home .
In a bid to stem the rustling , the Murshidabad local government announced a cow - licensing system in 2007 .
Cows were issued photo IDs .
Branding or ear tags were nixed as hurtful to cows and easily altered by rustlers .
But enforcement has been lax , and the ID system is largely ineffective , residents said .
“ You can put a picture of your cat , dog , your elbow in the photo and no one looks closely , ” said Mullah , who has opted not to register his two cows .
India has mostly turned a blind eye to the smuggling problem .
In part , it ’s worried that any mention could inflame religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims , said Sreeradha Datta , an analyst with New Delhi ’s Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses .
Hindus consider cows sacred because of references in ancient religious texts .
“ It ’s too political , ” she said .
“ And every pocket is being lined , with a trade of this magnitude . ”
Bangladesh has little incentive to raise the issue publicly either , analysts said , given that it taxes the smugglers and is quite happy not to pay India the duties that a legal trade would entail .
Mohammad Jalal Uddin Sikder , professor of migration at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh , believes that the cross - border business should be legalized to reduce the number of deaths in clashes ; about 100 cattle traders and border guards are killed each .
The two nations met to discuss the idea in 2008 , but Sikder acknowledges that legalization is unlikely anytime soon , given longstanding distrust between the two sides .
One thing is clear , he said :
The trade is n’t going away .
“ My grandmother ’s house is in Bangladesh , and her field is in India , ” he said .
“ There are 21 rivers along a border that ’s [ 2,700 miles ] long .
It ’s just not possible to stop . ”

Anshul Rana of The Times ’ New Delhi Bureau and special correspondent Baldeo Sharma in Jharkhand contributed to this report .
One of the hardships of owning an old car is rebuilding rare parts when there are simply no replacements available .
My 1907 White Steamer has a feedwater heater , a part that bolts onto the cylinders .
It 's made of aluminum , and over the 100 - plus years it 's been in use , the metal has become so porous you can see steam and oil seeping through .
I thought we could just weld it up .
But it 's badly impregnated with oil and can't be repaired .
If we tried , the metal would just come apart .
So , rather than have a machinist try to copy the heater and then build it , we decided to redesign the original using our NextEngine 3D scanner and Dimension 3D printer .
These incredible devices allow you to make the form you need to create almost any part .
The scanner can measure about 50,000 points per second at a density of 160,000 dots per inch ( dpi ) to create a highly detailed digital model .
The 3D printer makes an exact copy of a part in plastic , which we then send out to create a mold .
Some machines can even make a replacement part in cobalt - chrome with the direct laser sintering process .
Just feed a plastic wire -- for a steel part you use metal wire -- into the appropriate laser cutter .
Inside the printer , the print head goes back and forth , back and forth , putting on layer after layer of plastic to form a 3D part .
If there are any irregularities in the originals , you can remove them using software .
Once the model is finished , any excess support material between moving parts is dissolved in a water - based solution .
Complexity does n't matter , but the size of the object does determine the length of the process .
Making a little part might take 5 hours .
The White 's feedwater heater required 33 hours .
Any antique car part can be reproduced with these machines -- pieces of trim , elaborately etched and even scrolled door handles .
If you have an original , you can copy it .
Or you can design a replacement on the computer , and the 3D printer makes it for you .
People say , " Why not just give the part to your machinist to make ? "
Well , if the machinist makes it wrong , you still have to pay for it .
The scanner allows you to make an exact copy in plastic , fit it and see that it 's correct .
Even when you take plans to a machinist , it can be tricky .
Say the part must be 3 mm thick here and 5 mm there .
You get it back and then , " Oh no , it does n't fit ; it 's too thick , " or " It 's too thin . "
My setup lets you create the perfect part .
And you could press the button again and again -- and keep making the part -- twice the size , half - size , whatever you need .
If you have a part that 's worn away , or has lost a big chunk of metal , you can fill in that missing link on the computer .
Then you make the part in plastic and have a machinist make a copy based on that example .
Or you can do what we do -- input that program into a Fadal CNC machine ; it reads the dimensions and replicates an exact metal copy .
Some guys are so used to working in the traditional ways .
They 're old - school .
So they 've never seen this new technology in use -- in fact , they 're not even aware it exists .
When you work on old cars , you tend to work with old machinery like lathes , milling machines or English wheels .
When someone tells you that you can take a crescent wrench , for example , scan it , then press a button , copy it , and make a new wrench , these guys say , " Well , that 's not possible .
You can't make the little wheel that moves the claw in and out .
You 'd have to make it in two sections . "
But they 're wrong .
You can duplicate the whole tool .
They stand in front of the machine and watch a wrench being made , and they still do n't believe it .
It 's like The Jetsons .
George Jetson would say , " I want a steak dinner . "
He 'd press a button and the meal would come out of the machine , with the roasted potatoes and everything , all on one plate .
We may not have the instant steak dinner yet -- but my NextEngine system is like the car - guy equivalent .
If you had a one - off Ferrari engine , you could scan each part and then re-create the entire motor .
Right now , we 're scanning a Duesenberg body .
It 's a classic example of high tech melding with old tech .
There are cars sitting in garages around the country , and they have n't moved in years for lack of some unobtainable part .
Now they can hit the road once more , thanks to this technology .
My 1907
White engine would never have run again because its slide valve ( or D- valve ) was shot .
We built that part , and now the car is back on the street .
Let 's say you have an older Cadillac or a Packard , and you can't get one of those beautifully ornate door handles .
You could go to the big swap meet in Hershey , Pa. , every day for the rest of your life and never find it .
Or you could take the one on the left side of your car , copy it , use the computer to reverse it , and put that new part on the other side .
It 's an amazingly versatile technology .
My EcoJet supercar needed air - conditioning ducts .
We used plastic parts we designed , right out of the 3D copier .
We did n't have to make these scoops out of aluminum -- plastic is what they use in a real car .
And the finished ones look like factory production pieces .
When I was in high school , a friend 's father bought the new Pulsar LED watch .
He paid $ 2200 for it .
It had a red face ; you pressed a button , it lit up and gave you the time .
The next year I bought a similar watch from Texas Instruments for $ 19.99 .
I went over and showed it to my friend 's dad , and he was sooo angry .
The NextEngine scanner costs $ 2995 .
The Dimension uPrint Personal 3D printer is now under $ 15,000 .
That 's not cheap .
But this technology used to cost 10 times that amount .
And I think the price will come down even more .
These machines are not suited for mass production , but they work well for rapid prototyping .
Just as eBay has made many swap meets go away , this machine could eliminate the need to go to eBay for parts .
Think about it :
What old part do you want to make ?

Chapter 6 . Models of sex in condom testing
Condoms are made to withstand the rigors of sex .
But the models used by governments to test condom durability have nothing to do with sex .
prevent disease transmission , prevent pregnancy , maintain sensation Goals of condom manufacture : prevent disease transmission , prevent pregnancy , maintain sensation
Condoms ( the male variety ) have long been the mainstay of last - second , desperate appeals for contraception , although with the advent of AIDS and hepatitis B virus they have taken on additional prominence in the prevention of sexually - transmitted disease ( the only purpose for which they were legally sold in many states just a couple decades ago ) .
In either case , a condom merely serves as a barrier against microbes ( sperm or pathogens ) .
And to make sure that condoms indeed function in this capacity , governments of Western countries test condoms to meet minimal standards , to ensure that the condoms do n't break or leak when in use .
Any male who has used a condom realizes that disease prevention and contraception are not the only goals in condom design - if they were , the simplest solution would be to avoid sex .
An additional goal is to minimize the loss of sensation realized during sex .
The goal of sensation is in direct conflict with the goal of preventing disease and sperm transfer , because the way to manufacture a condom to be a faultless barrier is to make it thick , whereas the way to maximize sensation is to make it thin .
Manufacturers thus make condoms as thin as possible while maintaining minimum standards for condom strength .
And it is precisely this compromise that leads to occasional condom failure .
The material used in condoms is latex ( rubber ) .
Advantages of latex are that it can be produced in thin sheets , and it can stretch greatly without breaking .
But latex is a biological material , and it is profoundly sensitive to various environmental conditions .
Even temperatures as high as body temperature degrade it , albeit slowly , and oils ( as in vegetable oil and baby oil ) degrade it rapidly .
So even if condoms meet reasonable standards in the factory , they may fail under a wide array of conditions experienced in " the field . "
There are many models of condom testing .
You might ask why .
The reason is merely that none of them are useful for each of the many goals we have in using condoms � they all have major limitations .
Different models are used to overcome the perceived shortcomings of the other tests .
Human models
Condoms need to be tested to ensure that they meet certain standards .
It is obvious that the truest model of condom performance is sex itself � that humans are the most accurate
It is otherwise difficult to know how much sensation is being lost , or what the real transmission rate of disease is .
Humans as models here have several drawbacks , however .
First , they are not convenient .
Governments are not about to hire people as condom testers , to have frequent sex with different partners , each with different sexually - transmitted diseases .
We let people make their own choices about who to sleep with and whether they are willing to risk HIV , hepatitis , gonorrhea , etc. , but we cannot ethically assign them to such risks .
Any pregnancies arising from such experiments would raise problems as well .

It is otherwise difficult to know how much sensation is being lost , or what the real transmission rate of disease is .
Humans as models here have several drawbacks , however .

A drawback of any use of humans to test condoms is time .
If a batch of condoms was being tested for disease transmission or blocking pregnancy , it would take weeks to months after sex to determine whether the condom had done its job .
Add up all these problems with humans , and you can begin to understand why condom testing is done with non-human ( non-animal ) physical models .
Physical models of durability
� Empty - condom� tests .
There are lots of ways to test condoms that avoid ethical issues while adhering to high standards of uniformity .
These kinds of tests are what all governments use .
Some tests measure the durability of the entire condom , some measure only part of the condom , and some test for holes ( see http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom).
Some of the more common tests involve testing empty condoms ( or putting water in them ) .
We might think of these as �dickless � tests , but this is of course not a term that you�ll hear used by professionals :
Electrical conductance test :
This is a non-destructive test applied to all condoms .
Each condom is tested to see if it blocks electricity .
An intact condom should not allow electricity to pass through it .
The next tests are all destructive � a tested condom cannot be sold .
Water leak test : Used by the Food and Drug Administration , this test involves filling a condom with 10 ounces of water and looking for leaks .
Tensile test ( stretch test ) :
This method involves slicing a band from the shaft of a condom and testing its stretchability .
Airburst test :
A method used by many European countries , Canada , and now the U.S. , inflates the condom with air until it bursts ; the maximum volume of air tolerated is used as the measure of strength .
Other tests are of the packaging ( package integrity test , lubricant test ) and a simulated aging test by warming the wrapped condom in an oven at 70 � C .
Regardless of which specific test is used , condom testing involves taking a sample of several condoms from a batch and calculating the fraction that pass the test .
The condoms tested are thus a sample ( sampling model ) of the others in the batch .
In the US , a batch of condoms cannot be sold if 5 or more condoms per 1000 fail the test .
So you can be relatively confident that any condom sold in the U.S. ( and maintained under proper conditions ) will survive the water test and airburst test .
Should we be comforted with that knowledge ?
Only to the extent that condom survival in these tests reflects condom survival during sex .
That is , only to the extent that a water test or airburst test is a good model of the rigors of sex .
Furthermore , the fact that different batches of condoms pass the FDA test does not mean that all of them are equivalent .
Consumer Reports has evaluated several brands of condoms using the airburst test and has ranked them accordingly ( to be presented in class ) .
Perhaps surprisingly , a few brands had failure rates of 10 % or more .
There are several levels at which models apply , beginning with the lowly one in which a few condoms in a batch are treated as a model of the entire batch ( otherwise , we would have to test every condom in the batch ) .
At a higher level , we may regard one condom brand as a model of other brands ( hence the advice from healthcare workers to " use a condom , " which makes no statement about a brand ) .
Then we have the government models of sex that are used to evaluate condom survival , such as the airburst test , the water test , and the stretch tests .
Validation of the �empty - condom� tests .
It takes little imagination to understand how these models are limited and may be seriously in error .
However , although the airburst test is not anyone 's idea of sex , when properly calibrated , it might give us a good idea of whether a condom will hold up during sex .
Not surprisingly , people have been interested in this question .
The organization Family Health International ( see website above ) has been involved in several studies and has also evaluated others to determine just how accurately the empty - condom tests predict condom failures in humans .
These tests involve ( i ) evaluating some of the condoms with the airburst test ( most commonly ) , and ( ii ) using other condoms from the same batch to obtain breakage rates from volunteers .
These tests have been the most illuminating when done with aged condoms , because breakage rates are higher with aged condoms .
In general , the physical , empty - condom tests are only mildly good at predicting condom failure rate experienced by human volunteers .
fake penises
More accurate physical models : fake penises
The foregoing physical models can be objected to on the grounds that they don�t mimic realistic forces during sex .
Over the last decade or so , there have been a few studies that tested condoms by simulating sex with various types of dildos .
None of those studies have inspired widespread acceptance of test .
The elaborate system developed a decade ago by the � Mariposa� Foundation of Topanga California ( probably now defunct ) consisted of a rubber " vagina " through which water ( at body temperature ) is circulated and into which a dildo ( model of a penis ) is thrust with a piston device .
The condoms are inserted over the dildo and subjected to several " cycles " of piston thrusting .
An ejaculation was also simulated .
The various parameters have been established by a number of methods ( quotes to be read in class ) .
It is clear from the difficulties encountered by that organization ( if only in calibrating their model ) that creating a more realistic model that could be used as an industry standard would not be easy .
Models of STD transmission
Even if the models used to test condoms are reasonable indicators of whether a condom will break during sex , and thus whether they will function adequately in preventing sperm from reaching the female 's reproductive system , but they may be rather poor indicators of whether a microscopic pathogen can pass from one partner to the other .
For example , the water test can detect holes only as small as 5 mm , but this sized hole is many times the size of sexually - transmitted viruses and even of the bacterium Chylamidia .
Similarly , the airburst test is insensitive to small holes .
So here we find new limitations of existing methods of testing condoms : these models do n't give us a good understanding of the barrier to pathogens afforded by a condom .
That is , these models have serious limitations when considering condoms as barriers to infectious disease .
Other models have been tried .
Several involve filling a condom with a pathogen ( in water , for example ) and determining whether the pathogen escapes to the outside - a passive transmission test .
. Some tests use the sexually - transmitted pathogen itself , which is the best model of a pathogen .
But those tests are expensive because they require special facilities for working with pathogens .
So other , simpler tests use the harmless bacterial virus fX174 , which is somewhat smaller than the smallest sexually - transmitted pathogen ( Hepatitis B Virus ) and is easily assayed on bacterial plates .
These tests can also be made more realistic by subjecting the condom to various forces , such as might be encountered during sex .
Volunteers .
When we want definitive data on how condom use influences disease transmission rates , there is no substitute for accuracy � using sexually active humans known to be exposed to STDs , necessarily volunteers .
There have been several studies of this sort in the last decade , mostly with HIV .
These studies use �discordant� couples , in which one partner is not infected and the other is infected .
Couples were rated ( after the fact ) as to whether they used condoms consistently or inconsistently ( the latter category including those who didn�t use them at all ) .
Overall the studies suggest that condom use greatly decreases the risk of HIV infection .
Number of couples in which the HIV - partner became HIV + during the study
consistent users inconsistent users
0/123
12/122 ( 10 % )
3/171 ( 2 % )
8/55 ( 12 % )
< 2 % 12 % ( 300 total couples )
0 % 10 % ( 250 total couples )
1996 study from Haiti : estimated a conversion rate of 1/100 person years with consistent condom use ; 6.8/100 with inconsistent use .
( a higher female - > male than male -> female infection rate was observed in this study as well )
1994 study from Europe lasting 20 months : 0/124 consistent users converted ; conversion rate of 4.8/100 person years among inconsistent users .
In an interesting twist on these and similar data , the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control ) public position on condom use shifted from emphasizing the benefits of STD prevention afforded by condoms to one that now emphasizes that condoms do not always prevent STD transmission ( see the comparison of �now and then� at http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUBLICATIONS/iag/condom.htm).
It is suspected that the change in condom advocacy was from political pressure .
To summarize this material in our templates for models :

Do you snicker and laugh every time you see someone walking around Walt Disney World holding one of those massive [ tag ]
Smoked Turkey Legs [ / tag ] ?
My wife and I do too .
There ’s nothing better than sitting back watching someone try and look respectable as they gnaw into this prehistoric looking bone with fat and meat wrapped around it .
You ca n’t help but laugh and sometimes even take a few pictures when they ’re not looking ! 🙂
Well , I was reading today and was surprised to hear that Disney sells about 1.5 MILLION turkey legs every year !
Just to put that in perspective , that would be about 7 turkey legs for every man , woman and child that lives in Orlando , Florida !
Each of these monstrous bird legs weighs in at 1.5 pounds and they supposedly come from 40 - 50 pound turkeys !
So you ’re probably thinking ‘ hey , it ’s Turkey so it has to be good for you . ’
Well , if you think that 1,092 calories , about a days worth of fat and two days worth of sodium PER TURKEY LEG is good then you ’ll need to go see a nutritionist for a refresher .
But , leave it to Disney to find better and more creative ways to sell odd things .
If you would have asked me a few years ago whether I thought the whole turkey leg idea would have worked I probably would have said no .
I do n’t know whether it ’s the taste or whether people just see them and have to try them but whatever it is , it works .
For me I just ca n’t see buying one as I ’m not a fan of grizzly looking turkey meat and fat hanging off a bone the size of my forearm .
I think I would rather head to the [ tag ]
Plaza Restaurant [ / tag ] ( Magic Kingdom ) for their Turkey Sandwich , but that ’s just me .
So next time you visit the mouse , unless you ’re super hungry and have the metabolism of a 12 - year old to burn the calories , I would steer clear of the Turkey Leg .
My guess is you could find something better for you if you can resist your prehistoric urge !

An United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) Delta 4 - M rocket boosted the GPS 2F - 1 ( ' Space Vehicle 1 ' ) navigation satellite off its launch pad at approximately 11:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday , May 27 , 2010 ( 0300 GMT on Friday , May 28 , 2010 ) .
The launch occurred from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
The GPS 2F - 1 is the first of a series of twelve next - generation GPS 2F navigation satellites that will replace the current Navistar global positioning system ( GPS ) used by the United States for military and civilian purposes .
The U.S. GPS is a space - based global navigation satellite system that provides accurate location and time information to anyone with a GPS receiver ( and in sight of four orbiting GPS satellites ) on or near the Earth .
The satellite separated from the Delta 's upper stage at 2:33 a.m EDT .
It reached its intended orbital parameters and signaled this success to Boeing and Air Force ground controllers at the Boeing Mission Operations Support Center via the Diego Garcia ground station in the Indian Ocean .
The satellite is expected to now be tested over the next week as to its ability to fulfill its mission .
Page two continues .
Boeing / Air Force ground controllers and officials expect the operational testing of the satellite will proceed normally and that the satellite will function normally at the beginning of its twelve - year mission in orbit about the Earth .
The satellite is expected to be operating nominally after 90 days in orbit about Earth .
According to Craig Cooning , who is the vice president and general manager for Boeing Space and Intelligence System ( the maker of the satellite ) , " These next - generation satellites provide improved accuracy through advanced atomic clocks ; a more jam - resistant military signal and a longer design life than earlier GPS satellites ; and a new civil signal that benefits aviation safety and search - and - rescue efforts . '
[ Fox News ( 5-28-2010 ) : ' Air Force Launches First Next - Gen GPS Satellite ' ]
Colonel David Madden , the GPS wing commander for the U.S. Air Force , adds , " GPS is used by nearly a billion people worldwide for everything from farming and aviation to public safety , disaster relief and recreation , not to mention its military purpose of providing precision navigation and timing to combat forces .
GPS 2F will increase the signal power , precision and capacity of the system , and form the core of the GPS constellation for years to come . "
[ Fox News ]
A video of the launch is provided within the GPS World article ' Block IIF Successfully Launched from Cape Canaveral .' Page three concludes .
A second GPS 2F ( GPS Block 2 F or GPS IIF ) satellite -- GPS 2F - 2 ( ' Space Vehicle 2 ' ) -- is scheduled for launch in November 2010 with an Atlas 5-401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
The GPS 2 F series of navigation satellites ( twelve in all over the next few years ) will replace the current 20 - year - old Navstar global positioning system .
The ultimate goal is to replace the interim GPS 2 F satellites with GPS 3 F satellites .

From there we move to the Orlando Sentinel for a more thorough account :
U.S. Rep Alan Grayson , D - Orlando , walked in on an Orange County Republican Executive Committee meeting Thursday night at a Perkins restaurant and got into a confrontation with county mayoral candidate Matthew Falconer , a tense face - off caught by a couple cell phone cameras .
Before we get to the reason for Grayson 's party crashing , we should note that there 's a bit of history between him and the Orange County ( FL ) Republicans .
It seems he recently had the following to say about GOP Orange County Chairman Lew Oliver :
" Oliver could n’t find his rear end with both hands , unless there was a twenty - dollar bill sticking out of it . "
Representative Grayson really needs to break out of his shell , and learn how to assert himself .
Anyway , on to what pissed him off enough to crash their party :
In the video , Grayson reads from a flier that describes a recent Republican infiltration of a pro-Obama group , and a promise to dish those details at this next GOP meeting .
Grayson chides the Republican attendees for sinking so low as to spy on the other side .
Here 's the brief video , apologies for the lopsided aspect .
Apparently the confrontation was only shot with cellphones , and this was the best of the bunch :
Can you imagine if every Democrat had this kind of gumption ?
Not to mention a sense of humor and an instinct for soundbites ( " could n’t find his rear end with both hands , unless there was a twenty - dollar bill sticking out of it " ) that should be the envy of his colleagues .
He finishes with another hard slap :
" I gave them a chance to explain how they felt about it , and they did n’t do a very good job , " Grayson said today .
" The Republican Party is resorting to its Nixonian roots : corruption , lying and spying . "
More Democrats like this , please .
************************************************************************
I love this man .
More from My Fox Orlando :
" Take a walk , " Grayson says to Falconer in the video .
" You 'll be lucky to get 5 percent of the vote my friend , " he adds .
Falconer demanded Grayson apologize for comments made about Oliver .
" I think it 's disturbing to know that the Republican Party , locally , has sunk so low , " Grayson told FOX 35 on Friday .
" It 's mired in corruption .
They can't account for $ 10,000 in contributions that seems to have gone in the chairman 's pocket , and now , they 're resorting to lying and spying . "
I do n't think he has to apologize for anything .
But that 's just my opinion .
What about when they want to pass a law that criminalizes speech that is critical of the Christian religion ?
As an over 40 atheist , I ’ve been around long enough to witness the extreme changes that have occurred in the churches over the last 30 years .
Churches now seem to compete to see who can be more extreme .
From my perspective , living in the South , the evangelic fundamentalists are the most sanctimonious bunch of hypocrites that I ’ve ever seen .
They are often unabashedly crowing about their perceived superiority and ‘ chosen ’ status .
Whereas in the past they used to be somewhat sheepish and only spoke about things like ‘ tongue talking ’ and ‘ gifts of the spirit ’ amongst themselves .
For years I viewed these people as humorous but harmless .
They did not have any impact on my life .
Then something started to happen .
Christians started to engage the scientific community .
They wanted to discuss evolution and other scientific topics .
Christians started to engage the legal community and started sending their children to conservative law schools .
They got their own TV Channel , their own book stores and more recently their own ‘ news ’ channel .
Me , I thought no one takes them seriously .
Have you heard some of the crazy crap that comes out of their mouths ?
The thought had crossed my mind several times to write down all of the crazy things I ’ve heard them say , but I ’m usually laughing so hard that I eventually lose consciousness .
Recently , however , I was discussing evolution with a fundamentalist that went by the moniker ‘ SilkyMcNasty ’ on a political blog site .
After I had stated that the schools need to emphasize more science he replied , “ Religion is a science .
His design is obvious in his creation .
I for one do n’t think they contradict each other . ”
To which I replied , “ So , ‘ scientifically ’ speaking then , how exactly does a person rise from the dead ? ” I keep telling these religious wing nuts to stay out of politics & science because the cards are stacked against them on both accounts .
The founding fathers were clear about the separation of church and state .
If the church wants to now interject itself into the state then they must be willing to overturn the U.S. Constitution AND start paying taxes on all of their obscenely monstrous church properties .
If the church wants to interject itself into science , then they will finally understand how precarious their precious ‘ miracle ’ claims really are .
Science does n’t allow outrageous statements to go unchallenged .
Science does n’t suffer superstition or care about your personal feelings or emotional experiences .
Science is a cold dark place concerned only with facts , figures , repeatable experiments , and peer reviews .
Better yet , science is always prepared to state that a theory is possibly … gasp … wrong .
I do n’t think the religiously inclined are prepared to seriously go down this path .
From what I ’ve seen these so called ‘ scientifically ’ minded Christians just want to pick and choose from the scientific smorgasbord .
If it supports their religious belief then it ’s good .
If it would harm their viewpoint then it ’s ‘ junk science ’ .
As Lemuel K. Washburn so eloquently stated , “ Most men would kill the truth if truth would kill their religion .
” What ’s interesting to me is that like political parties most of these fundamentalists do n’t get along with each other to begin with .
The only thing uniting them is their love of Fox News and their belief that liberals are ‘ destroying ’ THEIR country .
So , they lock arms in an attempt to convince the rest of us that they are the ‘ moral majority ’ and THEY should be in charge of everything from education to off shore drilling .
In Oklahoma and Texas they are in charge of both houses of government .
They are passing religiously influenced laws on women ’s reproductive rights , abortion , the removal of the liberal Thomas Jefferson from text books , the addition of monuments honoring the role of the Judeo Christian faith in the creation of the United States , encouraging prayer in schools , and legislation that reiterates that marriage is defined BY GOD as between one man and one women .
I ’ve heard from non-theists for years that ‘ it does n’t really matter if the religious nuts are in charge , it does n’t affect me . ’
Really , it does n’t affect you ?
What about when they want to pass a law that criminalizes speech that is critical of the Christian religion ?
Are you fine with that ?
When your daughter is raped , in Oklahoma , she is forced by law to view the fetus on an ultra sound before she can have an abortion .
If you think it ca n’t happen in your state your wrong .
It ’s probably already started where you live and you are n’t aware of it .
They place people on school boards where your kids go to school with the hope of gaining a majority and influencing everything from textbook choices to what will be emphasized in the classroom .
Soon , if you want your child to learn about evolution you will probably have to home school .
This is the price we pay for staying quiet and assuming that it does n’t matter that the nuts are in charge of the asylum .
The ‘ Evangelic Movement ’ that began in the late 80 ’s has come home to roost .
These nuts have built universities that crank out fundamentalist lawyers who think it ’s their God given duty to change the ‘ liberal ’ interpretations of the United States Constitution .
They now have judges that are in line to be hand picked by the next fundamentalist President that comes into office .
All of these things make me seriously wonder if we ’re not headed for another period of darkness , where scientific discoveries must once again be passed through the prism of dogma and superstition .
In the Marines I served my country in war time .
I risked my life to ensure that people like Sarah Palin have the freedom to stand up and tell the world that I am ‘ un - American ’ , that I am ‘ un - Patriotic ’ and that I am immoral because I ’m an Atheist .
Regardless of what she thinks I have as much right to the flag as anyone , as much right to free speech as anyone , as much right to pursue happiness as anyone and no wing nut fundamentalist is MORE American than I am .
So I encourage all of you to stand up and fight these bastards at every opportunity .
When they make an outrageous claim , challenge them on it .
Since none of them actually read the bible tell them what ’s in it .
The more people that stay silent the more they think they are unopposed and can do whatever they want with public policies .
Let them know that just because they want to live in ignorance does n’t mean that the rest of us want to wallow in ignorance with them .
It ’s just not funny any more .
Fleury ’s Game 7 Performance
Last year Fleury played great in the two game 7s the Penguins won .
The first was in the second round against Washington .
Fleury was n’t the deciding factor in this game since the Penguins ran away with it 6 - 2 , but his play was still important .
Fleury only made 19 saves , allowing only two goals , which is n’t Halakian , but he made an enormous breakaway save on Alexander Ovechkin early in the game .
If that goes in the entire game could have shifted .
Maybe it lifts Washington and they win 6 - 2 .
The second game 7 was in the Stanley Cup final .
Fleury made 23 saves , allowing just one goal , and made a spectacular save in the dying seconds to preserve Pittsburgh ’s third Stanley Cup .
Throughout the entire 2009 playoffs
Fleury did n’t play amazingly ( 2.61 GAA and .908 % ) , but he made big saves when the Penguins needed him to .
This year he had a poor playoffs , posting a 2.78 GAA and an awful .891 % .
Instead of making big saves when the Penguins needed him to , he was giving up soft goals at the most inopportune moments .
When these happened in Montreal it just drained Pittsburgh of all their momentum and gave the Canadiens an unshakable confidence thanks to the crowd ’s craziness and knowing they were playing with a lead in front of Halak .
All would have been forgiven if Fleury managed to pull out a 2009 - like game 7 performance .
Instead , he was yanked early after letting the Penguins fall behind 4 - 0 .
Giving up a goal 30 seconds in almost sealed their fate .
Even worse , in Pittsburgh ’s two potential series clinching games Fleury posted an atrocious 5.68 GAA and .789 % .
The Loss of Gill and Scuderi
Pittsburgh needed to only look at the Montreal bench to see the difference in their roster from this post - season to last .
Gill played an integral role in the Pens ’ playoff run the previous season and he provided the Canadiens with a similar steady and physical game .
Gill ’s defence partner in Pittsburgh , Rob Scuderi , was lost to free agency as well over the off - season and the defection of two of Pittsburgh ’s most physical defenceman really hurt them this year .
The brunt of the physical load was placed on the shoulders of Brooks Orpik , who managed 50 hits and 30 blocked shots over the post - season .
The next leading hitter was Kris Letang with 19 .
Gonchar , Goligoski , and Leopold did n’t even manage 10 hits each ( although Leopold played only 8 games ) .
In a cap world there will always be tough decisions to make during the off - season and the Penguins could n’t realistically sign both Gill and Scuderi .
Unfortunately , they did n’t replace them with any defenceman who play a similar game and instead banked heavy on puck - movers .
Gonchar , Goligoski , and Letang were n’t able to fill the void left by the two deportees and the Penguins paid for it in the playoffs .
Philosophically , I ’d say you should go with half puck - moving and half steady , physical defencemen .
Any imbalance should favour the steady , physical style of player , since , you know , they can actually play defence .
Miscalculations at the Trade Deadline
Last season the Penguins made two savvy acquisitions that put them over the top .
They poached Bill Guerin from the Islanders for a low - level draft pick and acquired Chris Kunitz from the Ducks for Ryan Whitney ( who was expendable because of Goligoski and Letang ) .
These two players provided the Penguins with the sandpaper they needed and also came with a proven track record of winning the Stanley Cup .
This year the Penguins ’ management tried to replicate this by acquiring Alexei Ponikarovski from the Maple Leafs in exchange for Luca Caputi .
The fit looked good on paper .
I thought Poni would be a great addition to Malkin ’s wing , in the same way that Kunitz and Guerin worked well with Crosby .
He 's big , he 's strong , and he has a pretty nice set of hands .
I also overlooked what drove me nuts as a Leafs fan .
The Penguins probably thought the same thing - they were going to get a bigger and stronger version of Chris Kunitz .
Unfortunately , they did n’t realize that while Ponikarovski is 6 ’ 4 220 , he does n’t play like he ’s that big at all – maybe once every three or four games .
In the playoffs Ponikarovski only scored one goal and managed to produce only five points .
He was even a healthy scratch for a stretch in the second round .
He was a dud really .
The Penguins other deadline addition was Jordan Leopold , who cost them a second round pick .
Leopold registered zero points and was a - 2 in eight playoff games .
This may have been the effect of a vicious Andy Sutton body check that must have left Leopold ’s head groggy .
Regardless of crushed melons , Jordan Leopold has never been a steady , physical defenceman , which is what the Penguins needed .
He has always been an offense first player .
The Penguins did n’t need to add another soft , offensive player to their blueline .
They should have tried to land the aforementioned Andy Sutton , who would have definitely added a physical dimension to the Penguins defence that was desperately needed .
While the Penguins were probably a good enough team to go further in the playoffs based on the relatively weak competition in the East ( on paper … which is why they play the games I guess ) , it is n’t entirely shocking that they did n’t .
This was a team with one too many holes and it caught up to them in the playoffs .
With both Crosby and Malkin shut - down it became apparent that the Penguins did n’t have enough in the way of support to advance to the third round .
I ’m still shocked that the Habs beat both the Penguins and the Capitals , but I suppose after looking at each situation a little closer it is n’t as ridiculous as it would have sounded in late March .
The Pittsburgh Penguins ’ round two defeat at the hands of the improbable Montreal Canadiens left a sour taste in my mouth .
Once the Canadiens eliminated the Capitals I thought that the Penguins path to the Cup final was all but sealed .
Maybe they thought the same thing .
As well as Montreal played , which was much better than Pittsburgh over the final three games of the series , there were fundamental differences between this year ’s Penguins team and the one that won the Stanley Cup a year ago .
Those differences played a large role in the Penguins ' early playoff exit .
It is still shocking that the Penguins lost in the second round to the Canadiens , but maybe it is n’t so shocking that the Penguins were unable to make it back to the finals for the third time in a row .
I ’m limiting this discussion to what was fundamentally wrong with the Penguins , not what the Habs did right throughout the series .
Obviously , Jaroslav Halak was brilliant , the defence shut down both Crosby and Malkin , and Mike Cammalleri scored big goals often .
You could even argue that the Bell Centre crowd shifted all the momentum in Montreal ’s favour before game 6 even started .
But I do n't want to talk positively about the Canadiens any longer than I have to .
Here are the three main reasons why the Penguins are shaving their beards , rather than progressing to the Viking stage of facial hair ( Sidney Crosby not included ) .
Terraced rice paddies , northern Vietnam .

The ongoing conflict between protecting biodiversity on the one - hand and feeding the world through agriculture on the other , presents perhaps the biggest challenge for conservation .
This tension has caused some to champion agricultural intensification as a way to protect tropical forests .
According to the logic behind this approach , intensified farming increases the amount of food we can produce from a given amount of land , which in turn will free up areas that we can restore and protect for biodiversity .
This logic has been used to argue for large - scale , industrial agriculture over small - scale , eco-friendly farming to best support tropical conservation .
However , a new article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , presents a compelling counterargument that demonstrates the misconceptions that underlie this logic .
Instead , scientists Ivette Perfecto and John Vandermeer propose an alternative model for conservation in the tropics based on a matrix of small - scale , ecologically friendly farms producing food while providing habitat that complements protected areas .
A false premise of the agricultural intensification model is that it assumes that increased productivity will lead to an abandonment of inefficient farms in the tropics , migration from rural to urban areas , and the return of farms to forests .
While there is historical precedence for this occuring in North America and Europe , there is not certainty it will occur in tropical areas .
In fact , numerous studies from the Tropics show either " no effect or increased deforestation with either agricultural intensification or rural population decline . "
The scientists also shoot down a commonly assumed misconception that large - scale industrial agricultural is able to grow more food per acre than alternative approaches .
Perfecto and Vandermeer point to a meta- analysis of 300 studies comparing the yields of organic versus conventional farming methods , which generally found no difference between the two approaches .
Some proponents of agricultural intensification likely confuse the productivity of land use with the profitability of operations .
Large - scale , industrial agriculture may be more profitable because it can grow more food with less labor and other inputs .
However the scientists point out that small agriculture may be able to utilize more nuanced farming techniques based on the micro conditions of the property - a level of precision that might not be worth the effort for large - scale operations .
This idea is supported by a study across 15 countries , which found that output per unit area decreased with farm size .
Furthermore , the authors argue that from a conservation perspective , a matrix of small - scale farms across the landscape with ecologically - friendly practices and integrated habitat features will lead to better outcomes for biodiversity than individual large protected areas within a biological wasteland .
The scientists cement their idea within a new theoretical framework , which they term the Matrix Quality Model and present as an alternative to the Agricultural Intensification concept .
Their model is rooted in the idea that persistence of species depends on maintaining metapopulations within a matrix of habitat patches across the landscape .
The authors write , " A new rurality based on the matrix quality approach is more likely to lead to situations in which biodiversity is conserved at the same time that more food is available to those who need it the most . "

Picture Of The Day – Texans Bear Now Comes With Built - In Vagina
Since when does a bear have anything to do with the NFL ’s Houston Texans ?
And since when do stuffed bears have vaginas ?
I think the people in the front office at Reliant Stadium have some explaining to do .
The NFL has always had a fairly decent selection of merchandise for your average animal lover , but I think this new product has taken the notion of “ animal lover ” a little too far .
After all , it certainly appears as though the vaginified stuffed bear has crossed the thin line that separates normality and bestiality .
I do n’t care how soft and cuddly that “ love box ” looks .
This is just wrong !

In another coup for the seemingly part - time political pundit Bill Donohue , CNN broadcast on Tuesday a conversation about the Catholic church ’s thousands of pedophilia scandals that would be awkward to even over - hear in public , let alone broadcast nation - wide .
That ’s because Donohue , who presides over the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , decided to take the matter of a 14 - year - old ’s sexual abuse to a level of technicality where none of his fellow contributors really cared to tread .
ADVERTISEMENT
Objecting to the term “ pedophilia ” being used to describe the rampant claims of children being sexually abused by priests and nuns , Donohue instead called the acts “ homosexuality , ” later suggesting “ that ’s what gays do . ”
Though repeatedly cited in the media as the Catholic Church ’s “ pedophilia ” problem , Donohue instead prefers a longer term , according to his editorial published by CNN on March 19 : “ the sexual molestation of minors . ”
And , actually , the two terms are not mutually exclusive , explains the psychology department at UC Davis , noting that “ pedophilia ” as used to describe the church ’s scandals “ can cause confusion . ”
“ Whereas pedophilia and hebephilia refer to psychological propensities , child molestation and child sexual abuse are used to describe actual sexual contact between an adult and someone who has not reached the legal age of consent , ” they explain .
“ In this context , the latter individual is referred to as a child , even though he or she may be a teenager . ”
What Donohue is saying is that the priests who carried out such horrendous offenses against children did not have a psychological fixation on children : they were simply attracted to people of the same sex , and that ’s just what homosexuals do .
His own bar for limiting use of the term “ pedophilia , ” according to his CNN interview , is , “ I dunno , 12 , 13 years of age ? ”

Host Larry King cut the Catholic League president off , saying : “ We ’re out of time .
We ’ve just touched the surface . ”
In this instance , Donohue simply parrots an occasional meme of the rightwing press , no more true in present day America than it was when similar charges were commonly leveled against other minority groups .
In fact , the UC Davis study notes :
In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children , some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages ( child , pubescent , and mature adult ) .
All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners .
In some of the slides shown to subjects , the model was clothed ; in others , he or she was nude .
The slides were accompanied by audio recordings .
The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject .
The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities ( e.g. , swimming ) .
To measure sexual arousal , changes in the subjects ’ penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes .
The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children ( Freund et al. , 1989 ) .
Science cannot prove a negative .
Thus , these studies do not prove that homosexual or bisexual males are no more likely than heterosexual males to molest children .
However , each of them failed to prove the alternative hypothesis that homosexual males are more likely than heterosexual men to molest children or to be sexually attracted to children or adolescents .

The Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance take a differing perspective on the definitions , classifying “ homosexuals ” as individuals who are solely attracted to adults of the same sex .
Pedophilia , they note , “ is now generally used to describe an adult who sexually abuses children ; a child molester .
Some pedophiles are attracted to both boys and girls ; some are attracted to children of only one gender . ”
Meaning : it does not matter the gender of the child , sexual abuse by an adult makes the perpetrator into a pedophile in the eyes of society .
Mr. Donohue ’s argument that “ homosexuality ” is to blame for the Catholic Church ’s problems would seem to be misplaced .

Adding insult to the victims ’ injury , The New York Times recently reported on a case in which the church moved a priest accused of sexually assaulting a 14 - year - old girl in the United States to a school in India , where he was employed in the appointment of teachers .
This video was snipped from CNN ’s Larry King Live by Crooks and Liars on April 6 , 2010 .

TUI owns First Choice in the UK Europe 's biggest travel operator TUI Travel has said the disruption caused by the volcanic ash has cost the group about £ 20 m ( $ 30 m ; 23 m euros ) so far .
TUI added that daily costs were running at about £ 5 m to £ 6 m .
The group said that as of Sunday , it had about 100,000 customers who had been unable to return home .
TUI said it was working with other tour operators to ensure that regulatory authorities and governments permit flights to resume as soon as possible .
We still have n't got any clarity regarding what the government is doing to get airspace open
Paul Botell , TUI chief financial officer TUI owns Thomson and First Choice .
Paul Bowtell , TUI 's chief financial officer , was critical of the government 's response to the crisis .
" I think the government has been very slow , " he told the BBC .
" Gatwick Airport on Thursday was still saying it hoped to have flights throughout the day .
" Now we 're five days on and we still have n't got any clarity regarding what the government is doing to get airspace open . "
Calls for review The International Air Transport Association has estimated that airlines alone will lose at least $ 200 m a day in revenues as a result of the disruption .
But the air industry has called for an urgent review of the current flight bans , questioning the need for the unprecedented curbs .
Some airlines , including British Airways , KLM , Lufthansa and Air France , have carried out test flights and say planes showed no obvious damage after flying through the ash .
EU transport ministers are to hold emergency talks by video conference later , aimed at easing the crisis .

It is unfortunate that some government officials and media continue to rely on discredited apostates to justify discriminatory policies against the Church of Scientology and its members .
Virtually all punitive government actions targeting Scientology in the past decades were based on unsubstantiated anecdotal testimony from disgruntled apostates .
When the evidence was finally reviewed by objective government officials or judicial bodies , the Church emerged completely vindicated while the false allegations of apostates were exposed and discredited .
Apostasy is a well - researched phenomenon in the field of religion and sociology , and leading scholars have devoted major studies to documenting the inherent unreliability of apostates ' allegations against their former religions .
Dr. Bryan Wilson , Reader Emeritus in Sociology at Oxford University from 1963 to 1993 , was one of the world 's pre-eminent scholars of new religions during his lifetime .
He was a fellow of All Souls College at Oxford and the British Academy .
He researched , published and lectured on religion and new religious movements around the world for 50 years and provided expert opinions on religion for the British House of Commons and the courts .
Dr. Wilson noted that apostates of new religious movements generally crave self - justification by seeking to reconstruct their past to excuse their former affiliations , while blaming those who were formerly their closest associates .
They must be regarded as inherently unreliable sources by government bodies , the judiciary and the media :
" Neither the objective sociological researcher nor the court of law can readily regard the apostate as a creditable or reliable source of evidence .
He must always be seen as one whose personal history predisposes him to bias with respect to both his previous religious commitment and affiliations , the suspicion must arise that he acts from a personal motivation to vindicate himself and to regain his self - esteem , by showing himself to have been first a victim but subsequently to have become a redeemed crusader .
As various instances have indicated , he is likely to be suggestible and ready to enlarge or embellish his grievances to satisfy that species of journalist whose interest is more in sensational copy than in an objective statement of the truth . "
( 2 )
Another acclaimed expert , Dr. Lonnie Kliever , longtime Professor of Religious Studies at Southern Methodist University , determined that the credibility of apostates is highly suspect .
Dr. Kliever found that the overwhelming majority of individuals who exit from religions harbor no ill - will toward their past religious associations and activities .
However , there is invariably a much smaller number of disaffected individuals — apostates — who are deeply committed to discrediting and undertaking actions designed to denigrate and destroy the religious communities that once claimed their loyalties .
In Dr. Kliever 's opinion , these apostates :
" [ P ] resent a distorted view of the new religions to the public , the academy , and the courts by virtue of their ready availability and eagerness to testify against their former religious associations and activities .
Such apostates always act out of a scenario that vindicates themselves by shifting responsibility for their actions to the religious group ....
Such apostates can hardly be regarded as reliable informants by responsible journalists , scholars , or jurists . " ( 3 )
Courts and administrative bodies also routinely dismiss the anecdotal testimony of apostates as inherently unreliable .
The Italian Court of Cassation ( the Supreme Court for Italy ) issued a landmark ruling in October 1997 in which it recognized Scientology 's religious bona fides , a decision now regarded as part of the pivotal jurisprudence that sets the standard regarding the definition of religion throughout the European Union .
In reaching its decision , the Supreme Court refused to rely on the testimony of apostates in determining that Scientology must be treated like other religions .
The Supreme Court questioned how a Court could know that the opinion of disgruntled ex-members is representative of the larger population of ex-members .
The Court therefore determined that the opinion of two , or even 20 , apostates is hardly representative of what the average ex-member believes .
The Court specifically noted the inherent unreliability of such witnesses , chastised the lower court for having relied upon two notorious apostates of the Church and overturned the ruling .
( 4 )
Likewise , the Administrative Court of Stuttgart ruled against the German state of Baden - Württemberg in 1999 , dismissing the reliability of the government 's key witness and questioning his credibility because he was a Scientology apostate subsequently trained by a Protestant center to publicly criticize the Church of Scientology .
( 5 )
Moreover , in the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) exemption proceedings , false allegations regarding illegal activity raised by apostates that the IRS had previously relied upon to take adverse action against the Church and its parishioners were extensively investigated and dismissed as untrue by the IRS before recognizing that Churches of Scientology are religious charitable organizations operating for the public benefit .

Family is the building block of any society .
The Church of Scientology encourages and helps its members to have excellent family relationships , whether their relatives are Scientologists or not .
Family members of Scientologists are always welcome to visit the Church , to meet other Scientologists and to have their questions about Scientology answered .
Marriage , raising children and building strong family relationships are major factors in a stable life .
Where once the family was the stable foundation upon which all else was built , today its shattered remnants are the source of much of what troubles society .
And while marriages still outnumber divorces , the gap is rapidly closing .
Marriage is well on the way to becoming a failed institution .
L. Ron Hubbard wrote extensively on interpersonal relationships , and much of it is applicable to this most personal of relationships .
Through its Volunteer Minister Program , the Church of Scientology provides online courses in building relationships .
These courses resolve how to make a marriage work , why many marriages fail , how to discover if partners are well suited to each other , and how to save a failing marriage .
People often find that once they begin practicing Scientology their relationships with their spouses and other family members are strengthened dramatically .
The Church of Scientology teaches an individual to communicate more freely with others , raises his ability to love other people and puts him in better communication with family and friends .
Scientology and Marriage
Scientology contains practical tools that can help any marriage or relationship .
The Scientology marriage ceremony itself stresses the very factors that can ensure a successful relationship .
These factors are Affinity , Reality and Communication , known as ARC - the component parts of Understanding .
The concept of ARC is represented by a triangle , known as the ARC Triangle ( pronounced " A - R - C Triangle " ) .
The first corner of the triangle is called Affinity .
The word here is used to mean " love , liking or any other emotional attitude . "
These range from high emotions such as serenity , enthusiasm and cheerfulness , down through antagonism , anger , fear and apathy .
The second corner is called Reality .
Reality could be defined as " that which appears to be . "
It is , fundamentally , agreement .
We agree with each other as to what is real and what is not real .
The opinions of people way out of agreement with commonly held realities are not well thought of .
The third point is Communication .
In understanding the composition of human relations , Communication is more important than Affinity and Reality .
These three corners of the triangle interrelate in that you cannot raise or lower one corner without it affecting the others .
In other words , without a high degree of liking and without some basis of agreement , there is no communication .
Without communication and some basis of emotional response , there can be no reality .
Without some basis for agreement and communication , there can be no affinity .
Considered together , Affinity , Reality and Communication are the component parts of Understanding .
These components of understanding are vital in a close relationship such as a marriage .
If a married couple maintains a high level of communication and affinity with each other , they improve the existence of their marriage ( i.e. , its reality ) .
If they fall out of communication and no longer share common agreements , their feelings for each other will lessen and ultimately there will be no marriage .
As a result of the application of Scientology , relationships between a Scientologist and the rest of his family routinely improve after his involvement in Scientology , because through Scientology one acquires the means to increase communication and resolve any problems that might have existed before .
Scientologists regularly note this phenomenon :
" Prior to being in Scientology , I had many troubles in life .
One of these was a marriage failing after only seven years .
My husband and I were going to separate , but then we discovered Scientology .
Life began to improve immediately .
I soon found that by continuing to apply what I had learned , things got better and better in all areas of my life .
Thanks to Scientology , my husband and I salvaged our marriage .
And I began to understand what it truly meant to be happy and spiritually aware .
Today , more than 29 years later , I am still happily married and still enthusiastic about life .
I owe this all to Scientology . "
A.M.
" We have a great family and our involvement in Scientology gives us a strong moral and spiritual base .
With Scientology , our family 's future is guaranteed . "
C.H .
After participating in Scientology services , individuals are more likely to marry or stay married and to have children than before they became Scientologists .
Scientology and Children
L. Ron Hubbard has written a great deal about raising children .
In Scientology , children are recognized as people who should be given all the respect and love granted adults .
Scientologists believe children should be encouraged to contribute to family life and not just be " seen and not heard , " as the old saying goes .
Children are spiritual beings , and as such they need to exchange with those around them for them to thrive and live productive , happy lives .
Children need respect , love , help and education .
They want to help others from a very early age and it is important that adults allow them to do so , within the realms of safety .
Children have to know they have a place in life , that they are important , and that their contributions are meaningful in a real way .
Education is an important part of this , as a child needs understanding of the workings of his family and society to be able to contribute to them in meaningful ways and in this he can be greatly assisted by his parents and other family members .
Some of the basic principles Scientologists apply to parenting are summed up in the following from L. Ron Hubbard :
" Today 's children will become tomorrow 's civilization .
... try to be the child 's friend .
It is certainly true that a child needs friends .
Try to find out what a child 's problem really is and , without crushing their own solutions , try to help solve them .
... A child factually does not do well without love .
Most children have an abundance of it to return . "
- The Way to Happiness
" The spoiled child is the child whose decisions have been interrupted continuously and who is robbed of his independence . "
- Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health
" Affection could no more spoil a child than the sun could be put out by a bucket of gasoline . "
- Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health
Most children raised in Scientology homes are above average in ability and quickly begin to understand how and why people act as they do .
Life becomes happier and safer for them .
" I was born and raised in Scientology .
My daughter ( 12 ) and son ( 4 months ) are third - generation Scientologists .
Being a Scientologist helped me to be brave , alert , competent , and aware and most of all it has made me want to help any and all who need help .
I see this as well in my daughter who is now 12 . "
K.R .
" As a kid , growing up in a Scientology family was fun , mainly because of my parents and the stable environment they provided .
I had the experience most children are lacking today , of working in the family business .
My parents believed it was good for children to earn their own way and exchange something with the family , and so did I .
I loved the feeling of independence it gave me to be earning my own money from a young age .
I worked hard on my education too , but I still had plenty of time to play .
When I left my parents ' house to go into the world on my own , I just kept on enjoying life , due to knowledge of Scientology , and the supportive environment my family had fostered .
That stability and sincere and correct application of Scientology made all the difference in the world when I was growing up , and it still does to this day . "

Restoring Family Relationships
Should any problems arise , the Church of Scientology goes to great lengths to help reconcile family relationships .
There are numerous cases on record where Scientology Chaplains have assisted in bringing family members together and enabling them to discover the real cause of their disagreements .
Regardless of whether the other family members choose to become Scientologists or not , Scientologists take deep pride in their record of resolving family problems and conflicts .
Receiving Scientology Training while Connected to Someone who is Opposed to Spiritual Betterment
Someone closely connected to a person opposed to one 's improvement and desire to be more self - determined will not be able to obtain and keep his gains from Scientology training .
Detailed information available in Scientology fully describes this phenomenon and explains how to deal with it .
Suppose a wife is unhappy being a housewife and wants a career of her own where she can use her abilities , yet she is too timid to resolve the matter with her husband , who is violently opposed to the idea and believes a wife 's place is in the home .
She begins Scientology training and starts to become stronger and more self - confident .
The husband , viewing her progress as a threat to his own plans and comfort , tells his wife that he will divorce her and leave her with no support if she does not stop attending Scientology services .
Or perhaps she comes home after an evening at the Church , tells her husband how much she is learning and how great she feels , and he sourly states that he does not see any difference in her .
This situation will cause a phenomenon whereby the person feels much better at first and is steadily improving but then loses her gains .
Training must not be continued over such a situation , as training under this kind of duress will not produce the intended results .
Fortunately , the exact technology to resolve this exists in Scientology and it can be handled quite rapidly .
The wife would sit down with a trained Scientologist who would assist her in communicating with her husband .
The situation would be resolved in such a way that her own spiritual betterment was not slowed , but also that she would engage in communicating her needs and goals to her husband so that they could achieve consensus while respecting each other 's interests .
The technology necessary to help people communicate with each other and deal with others who are antagonistic to their plans or desires for personal and spiritual betterment is available at Scientology Churches and Missions and through Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard 's books and lectures available at Scientology bookstores and online at bridgepub.com and scientologyhandbook.org .
Disconnection of Abusive Relationships in Scientology
Of equal importance to learning how to build strong , stable relationships is what to do to handle abusive relationships .
There is no policy mandating that a member of the Church of Scientology must disconnect from anyone , let alone family and friends who simply have different beliefs .
Disconnection is defined by Mr. Hubbard as " ... a self - determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another .
It is a severing of a communication line . "
Disconnection is a decision made to no longer be connected to an individual who is so antipathetic to someone and / or their beliefs that , no matter what the person does , he or she cannot resolve the matter with the antagonistic person .
L. Ron Hubbard wrote in 1983 :
" Perhaps the most fundamental right of any being is the right to communicate .
Without this freedom , other rights deteriorate .
" Communication , however , is a two - way flow .
If one has the right to communicate , then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another .
It is this latter corollary of the right to communicate that gives us our right to privacy . "
These rights to freedom of expression are so fundamental that they are enshrined in the United States Constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
" Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . "
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 19
As part of the larger body of L. Ron Hubbard 's writings dealing with the subject of ethics and justice , the Church of Scientology practice of disconnection is stated simply :
If an individual attempting to improve his life through Scientology is encountering persistent opposition from a close associate , his spiritual advancement is impeded .
Most of the time , where a person has some family member or close associate who appears antagonistic to his getting better through Scientology , it is not really a matter of the antagonistic source wanting the individual to fail .
It is most commonly a lack of correct information about Scientology that causes the problem or upset .
Providing the true data ends the matter .
As a last resort , when all attempts to sort out such situations have failed , the Scientologist may decide to disconnect from the person until the antagonism ceases .
That last phrase is a very important point : until the antagonism ceases .
If an individual ceases hostilities , the door is always open for relations to be resumed .
There are situations , though , whereby an individual is connected to someone who is dedicating his or her life to making people worse , and the antagonism and hostility have nothing to do with Scientology .
In extreme cases , the individual needs to act for his or her own safety .
A good comparative is the way in which society deals with criminal conduct .
If an individual commits criminal acts that violate societal rules , society resorts to the only practical solution : it disconnects the criminal from the society by placing the individual in jail .
In other words , the person is removed from society and put in a prison because he will not handle his problem or otherwise cease to commit criminal acts against others .
People trapped in abusive relationships have the right to sever those relationships for their own well - being , or apply to a court for an order preventing the harassing individual from contacting them .
Likewise , an individual who discovers that his or her spouse is having an affair has every right to insist that the affair cease and , failing that , to dissolve the marriage .
These are each a form of disconnection .
A person who disconnects from another is simply exercising his or her right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person .
This is one of the most fundamental human rights , the right of freedom of expression .
Moreover , freedom of religion or belief and freedom of association are fundamental rights that allow individuals to freely associate with individuals who share their religious principles and beliefs .
The right to freedom of religion includes the right to be free from coercion to change one 's religious beliefs .
Individuals who actively oppose one 's religious association and beliefs are involved in a form of coercion , which contravenes religious freedom .
" No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice . "
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 18 [2 ]
Disconnection is also practiced in another context .
When someone has been expelled from the religion , that person loses not only his or her fellowship with the Church , but with Scientologists , until they have been restored to good standing .
Like other faiths with similar practices , Scientology provides a means whereby someone who has been expelled can restore himself or herself to good standing .
These steps include the confession of wrongdoing and making up any damage caused by the harmful conduct if one has engaged in wrongdoing .
Once the person has been restored to good standing , the prohibition against fellowship with other Scientologists is lifted .
Similar practices have been part of religious communities for thousands of years and have been recognized by courts of law as a fundamental right .
Expulsion from Scientology is an extreme measure and is only resorted to after many attempts have been made to resolve the matter .
Indeed , disconnection takes place in Scientology less than in many other religions .
Religious studies scholar Dr. Frank K. Flinn has extensively studied Scientology and numerous other religions .
After thoroughly researching the subject , Dr. Flinn found that " studies of the new religious movements showed that ' disconnection ' between members and their relatives occurred the least among Scientologists . " ( 7 )
Disconnection as Practiced in Other Faiths
Disconnection is not unusual in the annals of religion .
From Biblical times to the present , members of other religions have exercised the same prerogative when confronted by those who have persistently opposed the practice of their faiths or who have committed crimes against it .
Degrees of excommunication in the Catholic Church range from full expulsion from a church with loss of all rights and contacts , to lesser limitations on communication , such as separation from the group at meals or censorship of communications ( 8 ) .
The Jehovah 's Witnesses practice of " disfellowship " has been examined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and found to be a protected religious practice ( 9 ) .
The Amish practice of shunning - avoiding a former member in every way possible , excluding that person from both the church and community — is considered a means of guarding the Amish culture .
The Amish base this practice on Biblical passages , including Matthew 18:15 - 17 : " If your brother sins against you , go and show him his fault , just between the two of you ...
But if he will not listen , take one or two others along .
...
If he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector . "
Other references are I Corinthians 5:11 and Romans 16:17 ( 10 ) .
The Church Manual of the First Church of Christ , Scientist , contains several references to excommunication of members for various causes , including apostasy and alteration of Christian Science doctrine ( 11 ) .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints practices excommunication , as well as the lesser sanctions of private counsel and caution , informal probation , formal probation , and disfellowshipment .
Excommunication is generally reserved for what are seen as the most serious sins .
In most cases , excommunication is a last resort , used only after repeated warnings ( 12 ) .
Colorado College Professor David Weddle writes that some ultra-orthodox Jewish congregations practice an extreme form of disconnection in which a mock funeral is held for apostate members ( 13 )
The practice of disconnection in the Church of Scientology is a small part of the larger subject of Ethics , the fundamentals of which are described in the book Introduction to Scientology Ethics by L. Ron Hubbard ( 14 ) .
L. Ron Hubbard simplified and codified the subject of Ethics and developed a workable technology with the aim of applying the subject to an individual 's daily life to bring about increased happiness , prosperity and survival .
The subject of Ethics includes the identification of the people in one 's environment that hold someone back from achieving their full potential .
Scientology teaches about the mechanics behind this destructive yet commonplace situation and ways to counteract it ( 15 ) .
Ethics plays a vital role in an individual 's spiritual development in Scientology .
In his essay Scientology , An Analysis and Comparison of its Religious Systems and Doctrines , the late Dr. Bryan R. Wilson of Oxford University wrote :
" In an important publication , Introduction to Scientology Ethics , L. Ron Hubbard set out the ethical standards required of a Scientologist , and made it clear that a commitment to ethics was fundamental to the faith .
The individual 's goal is survival — that is , survival on all eight dynamics , from concern for the self and the family up to concern for the urge towards existence as infinity , the so - called God dynamic .
Survival , as a Scientological concept , conforms to the general concern of all religion - salvation .
Ethical action is deemed to be rational behaviour conducive to that end .
Thus Hubbard laid stress on the individual 's need to apply ethical standards to his conduct and to behave rationally if he was to achieve his own salvation and facilitate that of all mankind " ( 16 ) .

Their website shows its many with - or - without - dock configurations with titles like " Yoga : Downward dog , " " Separation under way , " and my favorite , " Fridge magnet . "
The hardware and software are fully open source -- ready for you to do with what you like .
It comes with a custom operating system , but you can install any mobile OS you like .
Take a look at it at Gizmodo .

A 2 - pound tablet for 300- 400 € with a Linux OS designed specifically for a touchscreen with usability in mind .
That 's the completely open source iFreeTablet developed at the University of Cordoba in Spain .
And you get the Flash support and multitasking you can only dream of with that shiny iPad .
It 's biggest shortcoming is the mere 2.5 hour battery life .
Tablets from Taiwan
According to PCWorld , Taiwanese gadget makers are ready to show off at least 10 iPad competitors .
Here are two that were also shown at CES :
MSI has a 10 " Android tablet .
They 're still a little short on details , other than the fact that they use the new Tegra 2 chips .
The Asustek Eee Pad also has a 10 " touchscreen and the Tegra 2 chips .
It 's expected to come with the Chrome OS .

This one 's cheating a bit -- Google has no official plans to release a tablet .
But there has been consideration of what the Chrome OS would look like on a tablet .
And that gets the speculation started .

Do you really need an accountant to file your taxes ?
And will an accountant actually save you money versus using an off the shelf tax program like Turbo Tax ?
In this post , I discuss my own personal experiences filing my tax returns with 2 different accountants vs using Turbo Tax and Tax Cut .
Specifically , this article will shed some light on …
Whether an accountant will save you money on your taxes
will save you money on your taxes
Whether an accountant will save you time on your taxes
will save you time on your taxes
Whether an accountant will do a better job than Turbo Tax
2010 was the first year that my wife and I decided to hire an accountant to file our tax return and I remember being very nervous about the decision .
Even though I absolutely hate taxes , I ’d been filing my own returns for well over a decade and I avoided accountants because I do n’t like sharing my financial data with anyone .
I also like the feeling of control knowing how all of the numbers are calculated in my return .
Now that ’s not to say that you should n’t trust accountants but in the grand scheme of things , no one cares about your money more than you do .
Probably my biggest reservation about using an accountant back then was that I hated the idea of turning over all of my sensitive financial data to a stranger and paying him / her to file a crucial document that could have a significant effect on my finances .
In any case , over the last decade of running my 2 7 - figure online businesses , I ’ve used an accountant to file our taxes twice .
And the other years , I ’ve filed my taxes on my own using Turbo Tax .
However both times that I used an accountant , I ALSO used Turbo
Tax to compare the results which I ’ll share at the end of this article .

Why We Went With An Accountant In The First Place
Back in 2010 when I used an accountant for the first time , I was running an ecommerce store , writing for my blog , working full time , and helping to take care of a newborn child .
As a result , I did n’t have the mental energy to think about anything else .
When I file my own taxes , it typically takes my wife and I a good solid weekend to gather the data .
Then , it takes another day to enter everything into TurboTax and then another few days to double and triple check everything .
All told , it takes me about a week to file and I was hoping that the accountant would save me that time .
I was also curious whether my accountant would save me money by finding additional deductions that Turbo Tax did n’t know about .
Sounds reasonable right ?
Unfortunately , things did n’t exactly pan out how I expected .
Here ’s what I learned .
What Does An Accountant Buy You Exactly ?
Our accountant charges $ 200 an hour .
As a result , having him file our taxes costs approximately $ 500 which includes our LLC .
Compare that to the $ 75 that we usually spend on Turbo Tax and it costs us an extra $ 425 .
So what does this extra $ 425 buy us ?
The accountant prepares and file all of our taxes for us .
All we have to do is provide him with all of the necessary data .
Everything sounds pretty straightforward except for one thing .
The accountant typically does not audit the data we provide and we are the ones responsible for any writeoffs we make with our business .
While he will alert us of any red flags , by default he will not challenge or check up on our business deductions and will only do so if we ask .
Needless to say at $ 200 / hr , the cost of his time can really add up if we just hand him a bunch of receipts .
But that being said , it ’s nice to have a tax expert available to ask questions regarding any borderline deductions that could trigger an audit .
I was also under the impression that our accountant was responsible for filing our taxes correctly .
In other words , I thought that our accountant would be on the hook if we ever got audited .
While this is true to a certain extent , it turns out that you are ultimately responsible for providing the correct numbers for the tax calculations .
In the event of an audit , the accountant is responsible for only the calculations and not the actual baseline data .
For example , even if our accountant advises us to take a borderline tax deduction , we are still responsible for proving that the deduction is legit despite his advice .
In addition , in the event of an audit , it costs extra money for the accountant to respond if he is not at fault .
The good thing about having an accountant is that in theory , he is supposed to file your taxes optimally based on your numbers and your current tax situation .
He may be aware of obscure tax rules that could save you money and you do n’t have to lift a finger .
If you trust your accountant , everything should be taken care of correctly with no worrying on your part .
What About Turbo Tax ?
Good ole Turbo Tax is super cheap .
It costs us only $ 75 because we buy the home business deluxe version which covers single member LLCs .
The base version I believe is free for the federal filing .
In theory , Turbo
Tax should be aware of all of the latest deductions and ask you the right questions so you can take advantage of all of the tax breaks much like an actual accountant would .
While Turbo
Tax is supposed to act like a virtual accountant , I personally find myself always erring on the side of extreme conservativism when it comes to taking deductions with Turbo Tax .
Sometimes the descriptions are obscure and not well explained so I ’d rather not take the risk .
The thing I hate about Turbo Tax is that I ’m always afraid that I ’m leaving money on the table by not taking deductions that I ’m entitled to because I do n’t understand the deduction thoroughly .
That being said , one of the things that I like about Turbo Tax is that they offer this program called Audit Defense .
For an extra $ 40 , an accountant or an account representative will take care of dealing with the IRS for you in the event of an audit .
One of my friends was audited last year and “ Audit Defense ” took care of everything .
In the end , they discovered that he made a typo on his filing that was easily correctable and he did n’t have to pay anything extra .
There was no hassle at all because Audit Defense took care of everything .
The other thing that I like about Turbo Tax is that you get to keep an electronic version of all of the worksheets that can easily be imported into Turbo Tax the following year .
You can also try different scenarios to see what effects certain deductions and filing options have on your bottom line .
In other words , you have complete visibility over your taxes and it ’s dirt cheap .
Ultimately , Turbo
Tax is great for control freaks like myself who like to do everything themselves .

The Experiment
Since I ’m a skeptic , I decided to conduct an experiment with our accountant .
Even though I paid him $ 500 to file our taxes , I went ahead and prepared my tax return with Turbo Tax and compared the two to see if there was a difference .
If the accountant saved me more than $ 425 , then it ’d be a no brainer to use him again .
Here ’s what happened .
The Outcome Of Accountant # 1
Our accountant fulfilled his promise and delivered our tax return way ahead of the April 15th deadline .
The bad news is that our experiences with our first accountant were n’t exactly positive .
Before I continue , I just want to emphasize that the conclusions I ’m making in this article should be taken with a grain of salt and are not indicative of accountants in general .
There are thousands of CPAs out there and our experiences represent just a single data point .
To provide some context , my wife and I worked with this accountant for over a year to discuss tax strategies prior to using him to file our taxes .
Because our first accountant worked about 40 minutes away by car , it was n’t very convenient for us to talk face to face or to drop documents off at his office .
Pretty much the only convenient way to send our accountant information was through email or snail mail .
For those of you wondering why we chose an accountant so far away , it ’s because he came highly recommended by a coworker of mine .
In any case , since we did n’t want to make the drive up to his office , we decided to scan all of our 1099 ’s and other tax forms into pdf format and emailed encrypted versions to him for review .
That ’s when the trouble started .
Because we emailed him an archive of about a dozen password protected pdf’s , his assistant got fed up because she did n’t feel like opening each pdf up and printing them out .
So she called and asked us to mail a physical copy of our tax forms to their office instead .
Personally , I thought this was ridiculous .
We wasted more time on the phone than she would have spent printing out the forms .
Even though I offered to condense all of the forms into a single pdf , she said that she would have to charge us $ 200 an hour for her to take the time and print out our pdfs .
Needless to say , this left a bad taste in my mouth from the start .
But what could we do ?
We ended up sending her copies via certified mail , but I was pretty annoyed ( mainly by the $ 200 / hr threat ) .
Our Accountant Was Difficult To Get Ahold Of
Once our accountant received our tax information , things proceeded much more smoothly but what annoyed me was that it was difficult to reach him to ask even the most basic of questions .
Since it was tax season , I understood that he was probably swamped working on many other tax returns outside of ours but it would have been nice to receive quicker responses .
Perhaps it ’s because I ’m impatient and am used to doing everything on my own , but I like knowing what is going on and I need reassurance that everything is proceeding smoothly .
With our accountant , after dropping off our tax forms , we basically did n’t hear from him again until he was done with our return .
Outside of a brief questionnaire in the beginning , there was no feedback loop and no additional questions asked .
The Accountant Made Errors
Not providing us with feedback during the process was all fine and good as long as he did a good job .
But as soon as we received our tax return , we immediately noticed some errors thanks to TurboTax .
For one thing , there was a typo and the cost basis for one of our stock transactions was completely off .
Granted , it was n’t a straightforward transaction , but it should have been entered correctly .
To provide some background , the discrepancy was with a stock that I had purchased in several lots which had undergone a reverse split and then finally was acquired by an overseas company .
With Turbo Tax , I simply imported everything in directly from Schwab .
But my accountant completely missed one of our buy transactions which resulted in a lower cost basis .
In short , even though we took a loss on the stock , his return showed that we had a gain .
The second thing he missed was an energy tax credit provided by the government .
Because we recently added insulation and drywall to portions of our house , Turbo
Tax said that we were eligible for a 1 K tax credit .
However on the return filed by our accountant , this credit was nowhere to be found .
Later on when we confronted the accountant , he explained that he could not have possibly known about the work done on our house .
But should n’t this question have been covered on the questionnaire ?
Why did TurboTax ask me the question when he did not ?
The final discrepancy that we noticed was that information from one of our 1099 ’s was not entered at all .
We currently leave some of our money in Paypal ’s money market fund and there was a minuscule dividend ( around 20 bucks ) that we were paid during the year .
However , we could not find this amount anywhere in the return .
Most Of The Tax Work Is In The Prep
My wife and I went into all of this thinking that using an accountant was going to save us time in filing our taxes .
But instead , we discovered that we had to do most of the prep work .
In fact , we ended up spending many hours collating our business numbers and gathering all of the tax data for the accountant .
One of the reasons we spent extra time was because our accountant wanted our business numbers in a different format than we had them in .
In the end , all of our numbers tied out the same way but massaging them into his format took a good chunk of my wife ’s time .
In any case , once all of the data was ready to go , entering all of the numbers into Turbo Tax took hardly any time at all .
And this prep work was required whether we used an accountant or not .
Arguably , using our accountant took more time because after finding the initial error , we went through his return line by line to check for additional discrepancies .
The Benefits Of Using Accountant # 1
I do n’t want to come across as completely negative towards our first accountant because we actually got along really well but we were very disappointed with the results .
That being said , one of the benefits of using an accountant to file our taxes is that we learned the right way to file our LLC paperwork .
One of our motivations for using an accountant in 2010 was that we converted our business to an LLC midway through the year and it was unclear how to indicate this properly in our tax return .
Because we used an accountant , we learned how to do this ourselves .
The other benefit is that our accountant helped us perform a more accurate assessment of our estimated tax payments .
In the past , I had done a poor job of under paying my taxes which resulted in penalties .
In any case , our first accountant taught us how to file our LLC taxes the right way .
As a result , we decided to file on our own returns for the next 6 years until something major occurred in 2016 .
We Got Audited By The IRS – Enter Accountant # 2
What happened in 2016 ?
We got audited by the IRS and it was terrifying : )
In the grand scheme of things , the dollar amount in question was minuscule and simply paying the penalty would have been a drop in the bucket .
But the problem is that if you admit any sort of guilt , then your chances of getting audited again go up exponentially .
Because , we wanted to respond to the audit the correct way on the first try , we decided to consult a tax accountant that was highly recommended by a friend in the ecommerce space .
Accountant # 2 was significantly more expensive at $ 350 / hr but they ended up being worth every penny .
They helped us fight the audit and we ended up clearing everything up without any penalties .
As a result , we decided to use them to file our tax return that year as well .
Once again , my anal retentive nature forced me to run the same numbers using Turbo Tax and compare the results : )
Here ’s what happened .
The Outcome Of Accountant # 2
First off , unlike accountant # 1 , accountant # 2 was always available to answer questions throughout the entire process so the tax filing process was a much better experience .
However once again , we found discrepancies in their work vs ours .
In other words , they made a pretty big mistake that significantly impacted our return .
Here are the details .
2016 was the first year that I held my conference , The Sellers Summit .
And as part of running an event , I spend a lot of money on food and beverage to feed the attendees .
Typically , food and beverage can only be deducted at 50 % when you are traveling for business .
However in the case of running a large event like a conference , it should be deducted at 100 % .
In any case , the accountant only deducted our meals and entertainment at 50 % which grossly reduced our deductions .
If we did not run our own numbers with Turbo Tax , we may not have found this discrepancy .
However despite this mistake , accountant # 2 did manage to find a few additional deductions that Turbo Tax did not find .
In addition , they advised us to open up a SEP IRA which ultimately saved us a ton of cash .
All told , accountant # 2 ended up saving us a significant amount of money because of his advice which made it worthwhile overall .
However , it was upsetting that they made a careless mistake even though we were paying them $ 350 / hr .
Conclusion
So what conclusions can we draw from my 2 experiences with using an accountant vs Turbo Tax ?
No one cares about your money more than you – Accountants make mistakes and it ’s up to you to double check their work .
Is it a coincidence that we found discrepancies with both accountants ?
Maybe .
But it pays to be super anal .

An accountant ca n’t change the past – Using an accountant is probably not going to save you much money versus Turbo Tax for just filing a tax return .
In general , Turbo Tax does a pretty good job of finding deductions .

Hire an accountant when your tax situation has changed –
If you need hand holding throughout the tax filing process , then it makes sense to hire an accountant .
For example , accountant # 1 helped us learn how to file taxes as a single member LLC
– If you need hand holding throughout the tax filing process , then it makes sense to hire an accountant .
For example , accountant # 1 helped us learn how to file taxes as a single member LLC An accountant can help you improve your future tax situation – The SEP IRA was a great suggestion from accountant # 2 that we might not otherwise have considered .
Overall , I do n’t think that an accountant makes a huge difference when filing your tax return and Turbo Tax does a pretty good job .
In addition , if you are super anal like I am , you ’ll end up double checking your accountant regardless which means you probably wo n’t save that much time either : )
The true value of having an accountant on board is to provide future guidance and answer your tax questions going forward .

Intel sees its Light Peak technology for linking devices by optical cable as potentially succeeding USB 3.0 , a change that in several years could mean the disappearance of a port used almost universally in gadgets today .
Intel , which announced Light Peak last year , hopes it will be broadly used by devices ranging from PCs to consumer electronics and other gadgets , said Kevin Kahn , an Intel senior fellow , in a speech at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) in Beijing .
Intel will make the technology available late this year and expects partners to start shipping devices with it next year , Kahn said .
" We view this as a logical future successor to USB 3.0 , " Kahn said .
" In some sense we'd ... like to build the last cable you 'll ever need . "
A trend toward optical instead of electrical links raises the risk that separate optical cables could appear for many protocols , such as USB and serial ATA , said Justin Rattner , the head of Intel Labs , on the sidelines of IDF .
Light Peak can run multiple protocols at the same time over one line , so all the data meant for the separate cables could run through one Light Peak cable instead .
USB is currently widely used to link between devices .
Gadgets often made with USB ports include computers , mobile phones , digital cameras and external hard drives .
Intel insists there is no conflict between the two technologies .
The company sees Light Peak and USB 3.0 as complementary , as Light Peak enables USB and other protocols to run together on a single , longer cable and at higher speeds in the future , according to a slide in Kahn 's IDF presentation .
" We expect both to exist together in the market and perhaps on the same platform at the same time , " the slide said .
A laptop with Light Peak built in was on show during Kahn 's speech .
A long , thin Light Peak cable , which linked the laptop to a docking station and a monitor , was used simultaneously to transmit Blu-ray video , a feed from a high - definition camera and a duplication of the laptop 's display onto the other screen .
Light Peak can currently transfer data at a speed of 10G bps ( bits per second ) , or fast enough to send a full Blu - Ray movie in less than half a minute , according to Intel .
But the technology could be scaled up to 10 times that speed in the next decade , Intel says .
The Light Peak cable plugged into the laptop through a USB 3.0 port with components added to receive the optical signal .
When asked if that would be the standard port used for Light Peak , Kahn said USB 3.0 is a likely place to start because it is common , but that " you could take the size way , way down . "
That could reduce the amount of space needed for a Light Peak port , a crucial consideration for small devices like handheld computers .
The laptop in the demo could still accept normal USB 3.0 devices in its USB port .
USB 3.0 , the latest version of USB , is far slower than Light Peak with a signalling rate of 5G bps .
But it remains much faster than the current version of USB .
Still , USB 3.0 is not yet widespread in devices .
That is partly because many PC manufacturers will wait on USB 3.0 until support is built directly into the chipsets they buy , which is only expected to happen late next year , according to a research note from In - Stat .
Intel , which is a major vendor of PC chipsets , did not immediately reply to a question about whether it will launch chipsets with built - in support for USB 3.0 .
A spokesman for rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices said the company will have chipsets with built - in support for USB 3.0 but declined to say when .
When asked if Intel would build Light Peak support into its chipsets , Kahn said the company could do so if Light Peak spreads quickly , but declined to comment further .
Intel expects an industry group promoting Light Peak to launch next year , Kahn said .
The company has said it will work with the industry to make Light Peak a standard and speed its adoption .
Intel is also looking at whether Light Peak will be relevant for data centers , but it has not reached conclusions yet , Kahn said .
Intel argues that existing electrical cable technology is approaching limits that optical technology can surpass .
" What we want to see over time is a crossover " from electrical to optical connectors , Rattner said .
“ eval is Evil :
The eval function is the most misused feature of JavaScript .
Avoid it ” Douglas Crockford in JavaScript : The Good Parts
I like The Good Parts .
It ’s essential reading for anyone who ’s serious about JavaScript – and I realize that Crockford ’s goal here is to emphasize only what he likes – but still I think that such a brief yet total rejection might send the wrong message .
Let ’s consider the arguments most frequently leveled against using eval :
1 ) It requires a compile and is therefore slow
2 ) What if a malicious script found its way into the eval argument ?
3 ) It looks ugly
4 ) It inherits the execution context and this binding of the scope in which its invoked
The slowness thing is a matter of common sense – and needs a sense of perspective .
All JavaScript gets compiled when it is loaded into the browser .
When I launch my app it loads 500 K of script in a fraction of a second , so evaluating a few more lines later on will be a trivial hit .
Even IE8 will eval 1000 lines of assignments in a few milliseconds .
This is not to say performance should never be a consideration when using eval – but that consideration should include a dose of reality .
What about security ?
If its your software that ’s supplying eval with its argument then there ’s very little to fear on this front .
Sure , it would be unwise to eval the value of an input box , but running eval over a response generated by your own server code should present no special risk .
Also bear in mind there is no damage a would - be - attacker could do with client side eval that they could n’t more easily achieve with a modern browser console .
The ugliness argument is hard to disagree with .
Hard coded eval arguments are difficult to read and do n’t co-operate with auto - formatters .
I do n’t see any reason to use eval with hard coded parameters – this also applies to the eval - wrappers : setTimeout and the Function constructor .
/ /eval version - hard to read setTimeout (' sendRequest ( ' + actionName + ' , ' + validate + ' ) ' , 1000 ) ; //better setTimeout ( function ( ) { sendRequest ( actionName , validate ) } , 1000 ) ; // best ( see < a href = " https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/curry-cooking-up-tastier-functions/ ">curry</a>) setTimeout( sendRequest.curry ( actionName , validate ) , 1000 ) ;
As for eval sharing the caller ’s execution context – I ’m not convinced its either a good or a bad thing – its just something you need to know .
So when is it ok to use eval ?
No two coding situations are alike , and sometimes an unorthodox approach turns out to be the best one .
Understanding the pros and cons of an approach will get you much further in the long run than blindly adhering to someone else ’s checklist of dos and don’ts .
That said , it makes a lot of sense to use eval when it is necessary to parse response strings from your server into JSON or other JavaScript .
But do n’t just take my word for it : both Prototype ’s evalJSON and JQuery ’s parseJSON use eval … so you might be using eval in your code even as you argue against it :-) .
Interesting sidenote : ECMA 5 introduced a native JSON .
parse function ( not yet supported in all browsers .
JSON ) .
The JSON . parse specification was modelled after the json2.js implementation written by Douglas Crockford .
Take a look at the code – there is eval , right there on line 469 .
It ’s just too useful !
//
In the third stage we use the eval function to compile the text into a // JavaScript structure .
The ' { ' operator is subject to a syntactic ambiguity // in JavaScript : it can begin a block or an object literal .
We wrap the text // in parens to eliminate the ambiguity .
j = eval ( ' (' + text + ' ) ' ) ;
JQuery uses the Function constructor as a wrapper to the eval call ( presumably so that the evalled code will not execute in the local context ) .
In simplified form it goes something like this :
var evalJSON = function ( theJSON ) { // check for well formed JSON //.. //use native JSON parser ( ECMA 5 ) if available ...
//...otherwise construct a function that returns the JSON and run it immediately ... new Function ( " return " + the JSON ) ( ) ; // this does an eval .
}
Prototype opts for the more direct approach ( and it performs better ) .
Sanitize is called optionally and verifies the JSON is well formed
evalJSON : function ( sanitize ) { var json = this.unfilterJSON ( ) ; // strips comment delimiters try { if ( ! sanitize || json.isJSON ( ) ) return eval ( ' (' + json + ' ) ' ) ; } catch ( e ) { } throw new SyntaxError ( ' Badly formed JSON string : ' + this.inspect ( ) ) ; }
JQuery prefers the Function constructor over a direct eval call since this will perform an eval in the global scope .
None - the - less the heavy reliance of the major frameworks on the eval function should make even the most hardcore eval naysayer think twice .
Moreover , without eval there would be no developer tools .
So how evil is eval ?
It ’s as evil as you make it .
Use it with care , but use it if you need to – you ’ll be in good company .
“ Overwhelmingly [ eval is ] trivailized , misused , and outright condemned by most JavaScript programmers but by looking at the work of some of the best coders you can see that , when used appropriately [ it ] allows for the creation of some fantastic pieces of code that would n’t be possible otherwise ” John Resig in Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja
WASHINGTON -- Capitals center Eric Belanger really is putting his -- well , his employer 's -- money where his mouth is after losing a half - dozen or so teeth in a run-in with an opponent 's stick .
" I knew I was in trouble , but what are you going to do ?
It 's the playoffs , " Eric Belanger said Saturday of his injuries .

Belanger says Saturday he " felt my teeth shatter , right away , " when Canadiens defenseman Marc - Andre Bergeron 's stick hit him in the mouth in the first period of Montreal 's 2 - 1 victory at Washington in Game 5 of their playoff series Friday night .
Belanger needed some serious dental work at the arena , getting exposed tooth roots trimmed -- then returned to the ice midway through the third period .
Explains Belanger : " I knew I was in trouble , but what are you going to do ?
It 's the playoffs . "
He expects to play in Game 6 at Montreal on Monday .

The sessions became notorious for their bacchanalian excesses , taking place amidst a nine - month , non -stop cocktail party in a sprawling villa that had supposedly once been a headquarters for the Gestapo .
The result was a sprawling double album , Exile On Main Street , which has gone down in history as one of the band 's best .
Next week , they are re-releasing the record with 10 new tracks - including several recently rediscovered songs .
An accompanying documentary , Stones In Exile , will premiere in Cannes , before screening on BBC One on Sunday , 23 May .
Frontman Sir Mick
Jagger met up with BBC arts editor Will Gompertz to explain why the band had gone back to the archives - and whether the band would ever get back together .
The new tracks on Exile On Main Street have been promoted as " recently rediscovered " .
How lost were they ?
Well , they were n't really lost .
It was just no - one had really looked at them .
There was n't a bag at the bottom of someone 's drawer .
The patchwork album cover was created by photographer Robert Frank
Where were they ?
They were in our tape store , mouldering away .
Tapes do n't have a very good shelf life - so you bake them in the oven , get them out , play them and transfer them to somewhere else .
And then the process started of listening to them and going , " that 's really a good one " .
What sort of state were the songs in ?
They were mostly instrumental tracks with no vocals on them .
They did n't have vocals , they did n't have melodies ... because I was n't there .
I was playing maracas or I was playing harmonica or something .
But some of [ them ] were complete .
There 's a track called I'm Not Signifying and all I did was play harmonica on it .
It 's quite an early track .
It sounds early .
It could fit onto the Beggars ' Banquet album .
It might have been recorded for Beggars , but it was definitely re-recorded in the [ Exile ] period .
A lot of these songs were done more than once .
Did you put them to one side because you did n't like them at the time ?
We had so many tracks , and you can only do so much .
You 'd say , " we 'll save that one , or put it aside " not knowing that we 'd put it aside for 40 years !
So I just found some of these ones and finished them off - I wrote the words and the lyrics .
Would you describe these records as new ones or old ones ?
They 're both , really .
[ Record producer ]
Don Was , who 's a real Stones aficionado , said , " you 've got to do them in the mood of Exile " .
We had tremendous arguments late at night about whether that was correct , artistically .
Work on the album started in 1969 , when Jagger was dating Marianne Faithfull
How do you get yourself back into the mood you had in 1971 ?
By listening to Exile , of course !
But it 's not particularly difficult , technically .
It 's just an attitude in your head when you 're singing .
Don
Was said that in those days there was n't a tremendous amount of subtlety .
You just started and then , wham , barraged on ' til you finished .
But what about writing the lyrics now , as opposed to where your head was then ?
Now that 's a different thing .
Of course it 's totally different .
But you can put your head in a " mood " .
That 's what any writing is like .
You 've got to be able to .
People say , " is a song written from your own experience ? "
The answer is " of course it is n't ! "
Bits of it are your experience , bits of things you 've learnt off other people , bits you 've nicked from other people 's lives , and bits you read in a newspaper .
And all this goes to make a song , a novel or a play .
And so with all this , you 're playing a part .
And in a way , I suppose , I was playing the part of myself in 1971 .
How accurate is the mythology surrounding the recording of Exile On Main Street ?
The wild nights , the orgies , the drug taking !
I remember it well .
Every bit of it !
I mean , it was a lot of fun - but there were a few bumps .
It was a bumpy period , historically .
There was a war going on , the Nixon thing was happening .
Tax was through the roof .
It was very difficult .
The end of the '60s felt very strained .
But despite all the excesses , it was quite a creative period .
When you 're quite young , you can get away with that .
What was the environment like down at the house ?
I think it was quite simple , really .
The basement was for work , and nobody came in there who was n't working .
Upstairs was quite a lot of socialising and carrying on .
All day .
It was great fun and it got a bit out of hand , and then we left .
It felt like forever , but actually it was only six or seven months .
How much did the environment contribute to the album ?
It was very social , we had a lot of children .
They were n't singing on the record , but there was quite a family thing .
If you record in that atmosphere , you 're going to get a different kind of record .
It 's almost impossible to quantify how that is , but you just are going to get a different record .
Every endeavour is influenced by its environment .
How was your relationship with Keith at that time ?
This was his house
It was his rented house !
He rented it for a year and he never went back !
The Stones ' Bigger Bang tour earned $ 558 m - the highest - grossing tour ever What was the hardest point in those years ?
It was really problematic getting into the United States .
It was massively difficult .
The uncertainty of knowing whether you could go to America to tour was one of the major uncertainties of that period .
Things have obviously changed a great deal since those sessions .
What 's your feeling on technology and music ?
Technology and music have been together since the beginning of recording .
I 'm talking about the internet .
But that 's just one facet of the technology of music .
Music has been aligned with technology for a long time .
The model of records and record selling is a very complex subject and quite boring , to be honest .
But your view is valid because you have a huge catalogue , which is worth a lot of money , and you 've been in the business a long time , so you have perspective .
Well , it 's all changed in the last couple of years .
We 've gone through a period where everyone downloaded everything for nothing and we 've gone into a grey period it 's much easier to pay for things - assuming you 've got any money .
Are you quite relaxed about it ?
I am quite relaxed about it .
But , you know , it is a massive change and it does alter the fact that people do n't make as much money out of records .
But I have a take on that - people only made money out of records for a very , very small time .
When The Rolling Stones started out , we did n't make any money out of records because record companies would n't pay you !
They did n't pay anyone !
Then , there was a small period from 1970 to 1997 , where people did get paid , and they got paid very handsomely and everyone made money .
But now that period has gone .
So if you look at the history of recorded music from 1900 to now , there was a 25 year period where artists did very well , but the rest of the time they did n't .
What about the future .
Are you going to get back together and write more music ?
I think that would be a very good idea .
I 've been writing quite a lot of music .
Is Keith keen to get the guitar out ?
I 'm sure he is .
And I 'll be seeing him next week , so I 'm sure we 'll get together and start doing that .

Entre 1995 y 2008 hubo 628 crímenes de odio contra gays .
Los jueces son laxos con los asesinos , denuncia ONG
[ email protected ]
La sentencia de Ricardo Camacho Gómez habría alcanzado hasta 60 años , pero el juez consideró que el suyo , había sido un homicidio simple , sin alevosía y ventaja .
La condena hecha en 2002 , por el asesinato que perpetró contra Fabián Espinosa Yáñez , quien era homosexual , quedó en un castigo de 17 años y medio en prisión .
Al final sólo purgó poco más de siete años .
Fue el 8 de diciembre de 2001 cuando Fabián , de 18 años , fue encontrado muerto en un hotel de la colonia Roma .
El reporte judicial indicaba que había evidencias de sadismo y que la causa del deceso había sido por asfixia .
Hoy los familiares y amigos de Fabián temen por sus vidas , pues el asesino confeso , de lo que se consideró un crimen por homofobia , esta libre antes de lo previsto y gracias a argucias legales .
Crece el odio
El caso de Fabián es uno de los cientos que se insertan en las cifras preliminares dadas a conocer hace unos días en el Informe de Crímenes de Odio por Homofobia , de la Asociación Civil Letra S , y que en una proyección nacional , indica que entre 1995 y 2008 se han registrado 628 homicidios motivados por odio contra gays , lesbianas y transgénero .
“ México es el segundo país con mayor índice de crímenes por homofobia en América Latina , sólo superado por Brasil .
Algunas estimaciones indican que en el país puede haber un subregistro en que por cada crimen denunciado se cometen otros dos , por lo que la cifra de crímenes de odio por homofobia se elevaría a mil 884 ” , dice el informe .
El análisis realizado a partir de la revisión de 71 diarios impresos de toda la República Mexicana señala que la mayor cantidad de asesinatos de este tipo se presentan en el Distrito Federal ; le siguen el estado de México , Michoacán , Nuevo Léon y Jalisco .
Se reconoce además un aumento importante de crímenes en los últimos años , pues de 1995 a 2000 se registraron en promedio 28 asesinatos homofóbicos por año , cifra que se elevó a 59 , de 2001 a 2008 .
El 2005 fue el pico de casos con 104 asesinatos .
Conmemoración sin celebración
Según este ejercicio , la edad de las víctimas oscila entre 21 y 40 años ; se encontró el registro de 36 casos de menores de 20 años y sólo en 104 crímenes se reporta el número de averiguación previa .
Es así , sin mucho que celebrar , como llega México al Día Internacional de la Lucha Contra la Homofobia , una conmemoración que se inició el 17 de mayo de hace apenas cinco años , y justo en esa fecha , debido a que el mismo día , pero de 1990 , la Organización Mundial de la Salud ( OMS ) retiró a la homosexualidad de su lista de enfermedades mentales .
Pese a este reconocimiento internacional , la lucha contra la homofobia en México avanza lentamente .
Desde hace tres años , el movimiento lésbico gay espera que el presidente Felipe Calderón publique en el Diario Oficial de la Federación , el 17 de mayo como Día Nacional de la Lucha contra la Homofobia .
Los activistas presumen que el gobierno federal quitará la palabra “ Nacional ” del texto , hecho que augura una falta de compromiso “ nacional ” para promover la no discriminación contra personas que forman relaciones de pareja con gente de su mismo sexo .
Sobre la práctica
La homofobia es la aversión , el temor , el rechazo o el prejuicio contra las personas que no cumplen con el rol de género dominante socialmente .
Se manifiesta en diversas maneras , como puede ser omisiones , silencio , burla , desprecio , exclusión , rechazo , persecución y violencia .
Según información reciente del Consejo Nacional para Prevenir la Discriminación ( Conapred ) , en los últimos seis años y medio se presentaron 255 quejas contra particulares y 133 reclamaciones contra servidores públicos por parte de miembros de la comunidad lésbico , gay , bisexual y transgénero ( LGBT ) por actos de discriminación en su contra .
El Distrito Federal , donde existen leyes que permiten el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo , así como la adopción de niños por éstas parejas , reúne el mayor número de quejas .
Cierto es que las leyes locales parecen ir a la par de las necesidades de respeto a las diferencias .
El pasado 20 de agosto , la Asamblea Legislativa del Distrito Federal ( ALDF ) aprobó la reforma al artículo 138 del Código Penal del Distrito Federal para agregar al odio ( por apariencia física , orientación sexual y la identidad de género de la víctima ) como una de las modalidades agravantes de homicidios y lesiones .
La Procuraduría General de Justicia del Distrito Federal creó en marzo de este año la Agencia Especializada en Investigación del Delito de Homicidio Doloso en Agravio de Mujeres y Personas con Orientación o Preferencia Sexual por Identidad o Expresión de Género .
Las reclamaciones realizadas en la ciudad de México podrían encontrar justificación en la cantidad de habitantes , pero llama la atención que se desarrolle en un lugar en el que se presupone respeto y tolerancia hacia los gays .
Las estadísticas del Conapred señalan que al Distrito Federal le sigue en mayor número de agresiones el estado de México , Yucatán y Jalisco .
Se revela que en general el sector que más inconformidades tiene en su contra es el de salud .
Se ha identificado que el problema para saber la magnitud real del fenómeno consiste en que las procuradurías no permiten el acceso a los expedientes y tipifican a los crímenes de odio como pasionales , por lo que , en las entidades federativas se deben impulsar leyes contra la discriminación , tipificarla como delito , así como realizar un diagnóstico nacional sobre la homofobia en el país .
El psicoanalista Fernando Valadez explica que un agresor de gays o lesbianas es una persona con una homosexualidad latente .
“ Tenemos el caso del ‘ don Juan ’ , que tiene a muchas mujeres a su alrededor , donde existe una sobreidentificación femenina .
Muchos de los que insultan o hasta llegan a matar a homosexuales , habitualmente presentan dificultades en su propia vida sexual ” .
En México , las circunstancias se agravan porque las visiones morales y religiosas que todavía están muy arraigadas en la sociedad fijan como único fin válido de toda actividad sexual a la reproducción .
De esta forma , el disfrute de la sexualidad sin tener como resultado la concepción , es antinatural .
Cuando huir es la solución Las características de la homofobia se particularizan en las diversas entidades .
Existen casos extremos , como el de Sheila y Cristal , donde los afectados se ven obligados a escapar a otro país para obtener la protección que no pueden lograr en su propia nación .
Desde finales de 2006 , Sheila y Cristal son pareja .
Vivían en Querétaro hasta que en 2008 se enfrentaron a la homofobia institucional de ese estado .
Un juez determinó quitarle a Cristal la custodia de su hija Alexa , entonces de tres años , debido a la “ inadecuada relación ” que sostenía con Sheila .
Se argumentaba que con esa relación , Cristal ponía en “ riesgo total ” la integridad y el “ desarrollo físico y mental ” de la niña , al “ crearle un conflicto en su naturaleza sexual ” .
Sin embargo , esta resolución se hizo con base en dos simples cuestionarios hechos a dos psicólogas que nunca conocieron a la menor .
Ante este veredicto y mal asesoradas legalmente , Sheila y Cristal huyeron con la niña a Canadá , donde hoy esperan resoluciones acerca de la custodia compartida de Alexa y el refugio que les permita residir en ese país .
La imaginación como arma
Ante la inacción de las autoridades y la imposibilidad de cambiar de un golpe la mentalidad de la sociedad , la comunidad LGBT ha recurrido a estrategias de autoprotección .
En los últimos años , a consecuencia del mayor acceso a Internet , los homosexuales y las lesbianas han creado varios grupos que se especializan en la difusión de información respecto a los derechos sexuales , obligaciones legales o civiles y también estrategias simples de sobrevivencia .
Aguascontuligue.blogspot.com es un proyecto surgido en este contexto .
Al darse cuenta de que muchas de las agresiones pueden presentarse al conocer a una persona de manera ocasional , entre la comunidad advierten :
“ Si Ya Ligaste : Avisa a tus amigos a dónde vas y con quién estarás ; que tus amigos conozcan a tu ligue y pide que les tomen una fotos juntos ; procura no irte con dos o más desconocidos a la vez ; si alguien te parece sospechoso , mejor no te vayas con él ; evita llevar a tu ligue a casa el día que lo conoces ” .
Con esta y muchas otras propuestas de salvación y de defensa de sus derechos , la comunidad LGBT llega al día de la lucha contra la homofobia , problema que a decir de los especialistas se ha convertido al igual que la obesidad o la diabetes , en uno de salud pública y mental .
Mientras tanto , Alejandro Brito , director de Letra S , advierte que de acuerdo con cifras obtenidas en el informe , cada tercer día es asesinada una persona por ser homosexual , lesbiana , bisexual o transgénero en nuestro país .
A perfect example of how to turn a problem into an awesome solution , the Imperial Walker bunk bed was the perfect idea to deal with lack of space .
Jonathan posted some photos of this awesome bed that he built for his mother , on Gizmodo .
She moved into a new house that did n’t have much of a yard , and needed something that would keep her grandsons entertained , without taking up too much room .
Taking advantage of the 10 - foot - high ceiling , and being a huge Star Wars fan , Jonathan decided he was going to build a bunk bed based on an Imperial Walker .
Going for a more realistic look , the DIY master designed the walker as if it were moving , and even added a complete Hoth LEGO display case , on the second level of the bed .
He began working on the bed , at the end of September 2009 , in his modest wood workshop , and managed to complete it in February 2010 .
Jonathan estimates he put between 300-400 hours into the Imperial Walker bunk bed .
We ’ve seen other Star - Wars inspired beds before , and some pretty impressive Imperial Walkers , but Jonathan ’s bunk bed definitely takes the cake .

Kent State : The Day the War Came Home
Bullets do n’t like people
who love flowers ,
They ’re jealous ladies , bullets ,
short on kindness .
Allison Krause , nineteen years old ,
you ’re dead
for loving flowers .
May 4th , 2010 , will mark the 40th Anniversary of the Kent State Shootings , also known as the Kent State Massacre , which took place at Kent State University in Ohio .
It involved the shooting of unarmed college students by members of the Ohio National Guard on Monday , May 4 , 1970 .
The guardsmen fired 67 rounds over a period of 13 seconds , killing four students and wounding nine others .
Some of the students who were shot had been protesting against the American invasion of Cambodia , which President Richard Nixon had announced in a television address on April 30 .
Other students who were shot had been walking nearby or observing the protest from a distance .
There was a significant nation - wide response to the shootings : hundreds of universities , colleges , and high schools closed throughout the United States resulting from a student strike of four million students .

Date Mon 10 May 2010 Category Technical Tags django / aggregation / ORM / group -by
I love Django 's aggregation framework .
It very successfully abstracts the common aggregration tasks into a Pythonic syntax that sits extremely well with the rest of the ORM , and the documentation explains it all without a single reference to SQL .
But sometimes that very abstraction gets in the way of working out what you want to do .
One example of this happened to me today when I needed to do a sum of values grouped by a single value on a model - in SQL terms , a simple GROUP BY query .
The documentation is very clear about how to do aggregations across an entire QuerySet , and annotations across a relationship .
So you can , for example , easily do a sum of all the ' value ' fields in a model , or a sum of all the ' value ' fields on a related model for each instance of the parent model .
But the implication is that these are the only things you can do .
So I was left wondering if I had to create a dummy related model just to contain the unique values of the field I wanted to group on .
In fact , what I wanted to do was clearly documented , but because of the ( probably correct ) desire not to express things in terms of SQL , it 's not that easy to find .
So here 's how to do it : you just need to use values .
For instance , my model is a set of transactions for a financial accounting system .
Each transaction is associated with an order , which is just an integer ID referring to records in a completely different system .
I wanted to get the total of transactions for each unique order ID .
It 's as simple as this :
Transaction .
objects .
values ( ' order_id ' ) . annotate ( total = Sum ( ' value ' ) )
Which gives you a ValuesQuerySet along the lines of :
[ { ' order_id ' : 12345L , ' total ' : Decimal ( ' 1.23 ' ) } , { ' order_id ' : 54321L , ' total ' : Decimal ( ' 2.34 ' ) } , { ' order_id ' : 56789L , ' total ' : Decimal ( ' 3.45 ' ) } ]
As Venezuela heads toward its fifteenth internationally monitored election in ten years [ 1 ] , the international media assault against the democratically - elected Chavez government is intensifying .
On April 3rd , New York Times correspondent Simon Romero lent a hand to Venezuela ’s elite , neo-liberal opposition by warping positive news about the government ’s anti-corruption efforts into a profoundly biased diatribe about supposed political persecution .
With scant reference to several very relevant facts , Romero suggested that Chavez puppeteered an arbitrary arrest of Judge María Lourdes Afiuni merely for having displeased the president , and that this is part of Chavez ’s effort to take control of the judiciary and silence dissent . [ 2 ]
When considered even - handedly , the arrest of Judge Afiuni for illegally allowing a wealthy banker to be released from custody and thus flee the country reflects the government ’s efforts to establish the rule of law in the historically corrupt banking sector and justice system .
It also brings to light deep - rooted problems in Venezuela ’s judiciary , indicating that there is much more to be done to fully correct these problems .
What Occurred ?
Here ’s what happened :
In 2007 , Venezuelan authorities arrested Eligio Cedeño , the former president of two banks , on the charge of stealing $ 27 million from the state ’s foreign currency administrative agency , CADIVI , through a false import contract .
Last December , the government stepped up its investigations of corruption in the banking sector , leading to the arrest of 10 bankers for fraud and the liquidation or nationalization of eight banks that had violated national banking laws – including both of Cedeño ’s former banks , Banco Canarias and Banco Bolivar .
Three bank executives fled the country to avoid charges , so the government placed temporary international travel prohibitions and seized the assets of nearly thirty other bankers who were under investigation . [ 3 ]
In the middle of all of this , on December 10th , Judge Afiuni changed the conditions of Cedeño ’s arrest warrant to allow him to be freed from custody .
More importantly , she did so in an unannounced hearing without notifying the prosecution from the Attorney General ’s office , in violation of the penal procedural code .
Cedeño was released from custody and , days later , he turned up in Miami , where he was detained by U.S. immigration authorities for illegally entering the country . [ 4 ]
Had Afiuni ’s only infraction been a faulty judicial procedure , then she would not have been arrested .
Rather , she would have been disciplined by the Supreme Court according to its own code of conduct , a procedure mandated by the 1999 Constitution in order to assure the independence of the Judicial Branch .
However , there was evidence that Afiuni had conspired to help Cedeño avoid facing the charges amidst the escalating fraud scandal in which he was implicated .
So , national prosecutors brought charges against Afiuni for conspiracy , which warranted her arrest . [ 5 ]
It is important to point out that neither Judge Afiuni nor Eligio Cedeño were campaigning against or criticizing the government .
Those who spin the issue as the silencing of government critics are wrong and guilty of deliberately misleading the public .
The judge and banker were arrested for corruption and fraud , respectively , and they will go to trial like other citizens .
It is very hypocritical for the same media outlets who say there are political prisoners whenever the government takes effective measures against corruption and crime to also condemn the government for not doing enough about corruption and crime , depending on which critique is most convenient at any given time .
Nonetheless , it must be pointed out that there were problems related to the arrest of Cedeño and Afiuni .
For example , Romero refers to three U.N. human rights lawyers ’ critique of Cedeño ’s detention .
The critique centered on the fact that Cedeño ’s detention lasted for nearly two years before his trial began , constituting an infraction upon his right to an expedient trial . [ 6 ]
Indeed , delayed trials have long been and continue to be a problem in Venezuela .
But this is not evidence of state - directed persecution ; it reflects the inefficiency of the judicial process as a whole .
Such systemic problems must be distinguished as such and analyzed in detail , in the context of the government ’s comprehensive judicial reform measures .
The Venezuelan Judicial System
The Venezuelan judicial system has a huge problem with corruption that has undermined the rule of law and served the interests of the repressive ruling two - party duopoly for decades preceding Chavez .
Several infamous state - ordered massacres of political dissidents throughout the 1980s remained in complete impunity until now , and the Chavez government is investigating the events and locating the bodies of the victims . [ 7 ]
The corruption persists today , and there are still victims , but they are n’t the ones highlighted by the opposition and their international media allies .
They include the more than 220 rural organizers who , in their campaigns to gain pieces of land in accordance with the government ’s 2001 Land Law , have been killed by assassins who serve the interests of large landowners .
[ 8 ]
These rich , conservative landowners use their money to wield extraordinary influence on the courts and regional government functionaries , and as a result only a handful of people have gone to jail for these crimes . [ 9 ]
Not surprisingly , these landless farmers are not highlighted in the mainstream media , at least not with genuine concern for their struggle .
Rather , their murderers are defended against so - called government - backed “ invasions ” that threaten private property . [ 10 ]
Considering this context , Judge Afiuni ’s case reflects two major problems in the justice system :
Her treatment while in prison and the possibility of intervention by other branches of the government in her arrest .
Jails
Romero ’s article suggests that Afiuni is being persecuted by being placed in a bleak cell in the same prison with inmates who she sentenced or who are just angry at the judicial system she represents .
To be clear , no evidence has been presented that Afiuni ’s right to due process has been violated , or that she has been deprived of information or a lawyer , or other such rights , as Romero ’s tone may imply .
The Venezuelan prison system has been notoriously overcrowded , poorly maintained , corrupt , and dangerous for decades , if not longer .
Bloody prison clashes and uprisings marked the 1990s , along with a record prison population of 32,000 in 1992 .
The Chavez government launched a prison humanization program in 2006 , bringing better health care , sports facilities , and music lessons to many jails . [ 11 ]
However , prisons remain overcrowded with an average population of more than 20,000 over the past ten years , and there was a recent spike in the inmate population due to the government ’s increased anti-crime measures .
As many as two - thirds of the prisoners have been awaiting trial at certain moments , and hundreds of prisoners are killed in fights each year . [ 12 ]
Certainly , a judge should not get a cosier cell just because of her socio-economic class .
So , if one is to complain about Afiuni ’s rights as a prisoner in this context , one should point out that all prisoners need better programs to help them be rehabilitated and re-integrated into society .
Afiuni ’s comment to the New York Times that she feels like she ’s in “ hell ” is not evidence of any direct state - led attack against her in particular , but rather an indication that there is much more to be done to improve the Venezuelan prison system .
Judicial Independence
Another important issue is whether judicial independence was upheld in Afiuni ’s case .
Soon after Afiuni allowed Cedeño to be released , National Assembly Legislator Carlos Escarrá , who is a constitutional lawyer and a former Supreme Court Judge , publicly denounced Afiuni .
“ She was an accomplice of a crime , and what ’s more , she facilitated Cedeño ’s escape , ” said Escarrá .
“ Justice should be equal for everyone .
Just as someone who robs a piece of bread is put in jail , in the same way a banker or a businessman must receive the full weight of the law , ” he said . [ 13 ]
A week later , after Cedeño turned up in Miami , President Chávez expressed his outrage that a judge would be implicated in directly contradicting the anti-corruption efforts in the justice system .
He said Afiuni should spend thirty years in prison .
“ She violated the law , in the first place , because no judge can conduct a hearing without the prosecution present ... she is in jail , and I demand harshness against this judge , ” said the president . [ 14 ]
Do these public declarations coming from the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch constitute interventions in the Judicial Branch , in violation of the national constitution ?
The Red de Apoyo para la Justicia y la Paz , an independent human rights organization in Caracas , said this is debatable .
“ One thing is what a person states publicly about a case .
There is nothing wrong with a politician making a statement that someone should be put in jail , ” General Coordinator Pablo Fernández told Venezuela Analysis last week .
“ Another thing is the reaction within the judicial branch .
Was the declaration about Afiuni understood and reacted to as an order ?
Or did the Attorney General ’s Office follow the normal procedures for such a case ? ” [ 15 ]
So far , it appears prosecutors have followed procedural norms for a judge charged with a crime .
On another side of the issue of judicial independence , an opposition - aligned human rights group in Caracas , PROVEA , pointed out in its 2009 Annual Report that there is a coincidence between the declarations of functionaries of the Executive Branch and some of the actions of the Supreme Court , the Attorney General ’s Office , and the Public Defender ’s Office . [ 16 ]
Such a coincidence in itself does not constitute a violation of judicial independence .
It is necessary to look at the cases themselves for evidence that the president ’s declarations arbitrarily influenced or undermined justice .
For example , PROVEA says 509 political demonstrators have been temporarily detained or arrested over the ten years of the Chavez administration .
The organization calls them “ political prisoners and victims of political intolerance , ” and also victims of “ the use of judicial functionaries as instruments of intimidation , ” implying that the governing political party intervened in the judicial branch . [ 17 ]
Local news reports confirm that some Venezuelan opposition protests are peaceful and some are violent , and some start out peaceful and then turn violent .
Peaceful protests occur regularly with no police repression .
To the contrary , police cordon off the route until the march is finished .
However , eye witness accounts confirm that at the violent marches , which in recent years have mainly been led by opposition student groups , the demonstrators wage coordinated assaults on police using Molotov cocktails , homemade weapons , slingshots , rocks , glass , and the occasional firearm .
Police respond to the violent assaults with plastic pellets and tear gas , and the students retreat to their university campuses , where the police do not enter because it is prohibited by law .
Interspersed between violent assaults on the police , groups of unarmed protestors kneel before the police with their hands in the air , posing a non-violent victim image for the media . [ 18 ]
The mainstream media , including the New York Times , fall right into line by providing false news and distorting the events to fit their editorial line , claiming that the Chavez government represses peaceful protestors . [ 19 ]
Any demonstrator that pulls a gun or a bomb on police in the U.S. and many other countries is quickly taken down by a hail of bullets .
But in Venezuela , such protestors are temporarily detained or arrested , if that .
The fact that President Chavez publicly condemns such violent protests when they occur , and on one occasion encouraged the police to throw tear gas at them , hardly seems to constitute a violation of judicial independence , or of the demonstrators ’ right to justice .
It seems very unlikely that Chavez ’s comments really propelled the police to act and the judges to rule other than they already would have , or more harshly than they should have .
The Government ’s Judicial Reform
It is clear that Afiuni ’s arrest is presented to make it look like targeted state persecution , but it is really the result of the government ’s efforts to correct longstanding systemic problems .
It is also clear that opponents of the government use the argument of political persecution to defend their political allies when they commit crimes .
In addition to these two issues , some critics also say the government ’s judicial reform effort itself has violated judicial independence .
Shortly after Chavez took office in 1999 , a Judicial Restructuring Commission was created and 80 % of the country ’s judges were removed for being corrupt .
They were replaced by provisional judges who were appointed by the commission and were supposed to be temporary . [ 20 ]
However , PROVEA pointed out in its Annual Report that as of 2008 , only 51 % of the judges had been reviewed and granted full judgeships , while 49 % remained provisional . [ 21 ]
It could be argued that those 49 % may be influenced by the wishes of the government that put them in place .
Furthermore , part of the reason the process of reviewing provisional judges has taken so long is that many were found to be corrupt and were deposed , and new ones were put in their place .
This constant shuffling of judges has , unfortunately , interfered with the expediency and the objectivity of many trials , a fact that has also garnered criticism .
The 2004 Law of the Supreme Court has also been the subject of debate regarding judicial independence .
After the Supreme Court condoned the April 2002 coup d’état against Chavez by ruling that it was not a coup , the 2004 law was passed in an effort to reform the clearly politicized Supreme Court .
This law , among other things , permitted the National Assembly to appoint and revoke judges with a simple majority vote , if a two - thirds majority vote is not achieved after three rounds of voting and debate .
This power , critics say , seems to make the Supreme Court overly subordinated to the political alignment of the National Assembly , which was and remains mostly pro-Chavez . [ 22 ]
To make the reform process more efficient and effective , the government launched a second surge of reform efforts in 2005 .
A code of ethics was established , and municipal courts were created to expedite the processing of cases and improve citizens ’ access to justice .
Numerous new commissions were created to improve discipline within the justice system and root out bribery , corruption , violations of due process , and other common infractions .
One such commission , the National Justice System Commission , was made up of representatives from the National Assembly , the Supreme Tribunal of Justice , the Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs , police forces , the prison system , the Attorney General ’s office , the Public Defender ’s office .
The commission was tasked with coordinating state policies for the improvement of the system . [ 23 ]
In its 2009 Annual Report , PROVEA criticized that the mix of branches of the government present on the commission “ institutionalizes a permanent factor of intervention by the rest of the powers in the judicial branch . ” [ 24 ]
Unfortunately , despite these efforts at reform , corruption is still widespread .
A 2009 poll of Venezuelan judges , carried out by the human rights group Development and Justice Consortium , showed that only a third of the judges think judges who accept bribes are sanctioned , and only half the judges said judges who violate the norms are fired . [ 25 ]
These criticisms regarding judicial independence have some basis and must be considered , but they do not at all prove that Judge Afiuni ’s arrest was an example of persecution or silencing of government opponents , nor that such persecution is a growing trend in Venezuela .
They do , however , highlight the difficulty – almost the paradox – of intervening in a politicized judicial system with the intention of establishing judicial independence .
Conclusions
In his April 3rd article for the New York Times , Romero manipulated and distorted the facts about Afiuni ’s case to fit the Times ’s agenda of impeding honest news and discussion about Venezuela , driving forward the informational sabotage against the Chavez government that is widespread in the mainstream international media .
Romero asserted that Judge Afiuni and Eligio Cedeño were political prisoners .
This is clearly inaccurate , especially since no evidence was presented that they were politically active .
His piece also implied , by omission of sufficient context , that the Chavez government is the primary cause of the problems in the judicial system .
This is also inaccurate and disingenuous .
Romero even went so far as to implicitly compare Afiuni to the Dalai Lama at the end of his article , confirming the Times ’s lack of seriousness when addressing these issues .
Romero ’s article is an insult to the real political prisoners of Latin America – past and present – who have been tortured , murdered , and disappeared by dictators and neo-liberal regimes that used the justice system as a repressive tool to eliminate opponents .
And , Romero ’s article distracts his international audience from any constructive discourse about the problems in Venezuela ’s justice system and how to overcome them , in the context of this gruesome history .
The Venezuelan government has made efforts at an integral , sustainable reform of the judicial system .
This has n’t been completely successful so far .
But the response of the opposition – knee - jerk condemnation of every effort the government makes at reform , placing all the blame on the Chavez government for the problems in the judicial system , and claiming to be political prisoners – is destructive and does not help to solve Venezuela ’s historic judicial system problem .

Today I decided to try my hand at releasing a cabal package with the 4 Blocks code .
I finally managed : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/4Blocks-0.2.
( I made a newbie mistake in 0.1 so please ignore that release ) .
Unfortunately the library can be compiled only with , as far as i know :
GHC 6.8.3
Gtk2hs 0.9.13
The reasons why are in the README file in the cabal package , copy / pasted here :
Some notes :
– The game currently works only with GHC 6.8.3 due to its use of Gtk2hs 0.9.13 .
– I have n’t tested with anything later but it is likely to fail due the fact that later versions of Gtk2hs have a different system of handling events .
– To make this project compatible with later versions of GHC and Gtk2hs two changes are required :
– Remove the function “ permutations ” which was copied from a later GHC base library
– Alter key - event handling to the version used by later Gtk2hs : some functions ( in CommandKeys.hs ) were simply introduced in order to disallow some of the keys used in the game ( namely rotation ) to trigger continuously when a key is held pressed .
I believe this kind of behaviour can be managed automatically with Gtk2hs ’ new event handling mechanism , however I have n’t had time to recode accordingly myself .
– I hope to write a patch for this in the near future .
So yeah , fairly old now , but I thought , I ’d share the code all the same as some people have requested it earlier .
Hopefully I will release the code with my AI later on after my project is over and done with in summer and also a patch to make it work with newer versions of GHC and Gtk2hs .
I have to say I really enjoyed coding the game in Haskell and if you have any comments for me , regarding better ways to code stuff , silly things I did , or anything else please let me know by leaving a comment !
Until now , the Boxee that we 've known and tweaked was , at heart , an alpha - level geek toy — technically savvy , but funky to actually use .
The just - released beta version makes TV , movies , Netflix , and other web content actually easy to enjoy .
Advertisement
We got a look at some screenshots and video from the unveiling , but we 've been able to use early release versions of the Boxee beta on both Linux and Windows systems since then .
Here 's Howcast 's helpful video , showing off some features and offering tips on getting started

How To Get Started With Boxee on Howcast
And here 's what 's jumped out at us about this nifty little piece of software .
Click on any of the images in this post for a larger view .
Smoother playback and streaming , at least on Windows
Boxee is meant to be used on a media - minded , HDMI - connected mini-computer ( a.k.a. a " Home Theater PC , " or HTPC ) , or perhaps a laptop hooked up to an HDTV .
There 's a dedicated device , the Boxee Box coming in 2010 for " under $ 200 . "
The Boxee team has also recommended a few devices that are small , relatively cheap , and utilize the NVIDIA ION graphics chip to provide HD - quality video without requiring other high - end hardware .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
I 'd already built a cheap - but - powerful Boxee setup , but for the beta release , I switched that ASRock Ion 330 to a Windows 7 installation , with Boxee set to load on startup .
I did that because Windows is the main platform where Adobe " Labs " Flash 10.1 offers 3D acceleration for Hulu and other web video streams — although the Boxee Box will see accelerated Flash as well .
It 's also the best big - picture platform because Netflix requires Microsoft 's Silverlight software to stream — not available , as you might guess , for Linux .
Advertisement
Advertisement
Running the Boxee beta on Windows 7 , I 've been very , very pleased with both downloaded video files and streaming content .
Watching Hulu or other decently - high - quality video is akin to watching standard definition television , while streaming HD videos from Vimeo or YouTube feels like living in the future .
Adobe will eventually ( we 'd hope ) add hardware acceleration to its Mac and Linux Flash players , and Netflix may well make its way onto Linux systems .
For the time being , though , the specially built Boxee Box or a Windows setup seem like the road to high - definition happiness .
Focus on content , not sites
In the Boxee alpha , when you wanted to watch a movie on Netflix , you launched the Netflix button , then navigated through that app's own interface to pick a movie or TV episode .
When you were looking for a TV show , you 'd head to the TV menu , pick the CBS , WB , or Hulu Feeds button ( when it worked ) , then click - click - click to your show , and your episode .

Now when I want to check out that season finale episode of Glee I 've been meaning to get around to ( forever ) , I can head to TV Shows , start typing in G - L , and select it from the as - you - type results on the right .
Boxee will ask if I want to stream this episode through Fox 's own site or Hulu , let me know if they 're ad - supported or not , and give me the alternate option of queuing this episode up , if I 'm not ready for the sit - down yet .
Advertisement
It works this way for movies , too .
Start typing in H - A - N , and if you wanted to stream Hancock over Netflix , head over and click on it .
If you 're on a laptop , or using Boxee 's kinda awesome QWERTY remote in the future , it 's easy , and clicking out two letters on a virtual keyboard is n't so bad with a standard remote , either .
The very handy Queue
Advertisement
Boxee 's Queue feature makes this find - and - click process even easier .
If I 've added Glee to My Shows , it will automatically show up in my Queue , the right - most column on the start screen .
If I happened to see a link to the Hulu page for that episode in my web travels , I could queue it up with a bookmarklet .
Or , if I 'm really into my serial musical dramedies , I could add Glee to the ever - present pop -up menu .
When you get to Glee 's page , the episodes you 've already watched through Boxee have dimmed titles , which is quite helpful as well .
The Apps and social hooks
If Boxee did nothing but play back your video files and hook up to Netflix or Hulu , it would be , well , XBMC Live , or just an open - source Windows Media Center .
What differentiates Boxee is its support for independent app development , giving all kinds of niche , mashup , and just plain cool sites a home on your TV .
Advertisement
There are too many to try and name or catalog here in total , but in my own house , the Facebook and Flickr photo apps have become a relaxing way of keeping up on what friends are up to .
Failblog and The Daily Kitten 's apps provide shamelessly effective quick - hit entertainment , and I watched the entirety of The Guild 's third season through Boxee on my TV .
If I 'm blogging from the living room , I can have Pandora piped through our speakers , or listen to NPR through its own app , or through the RadioTime tuner .
As Boxee becomes more available and accessible to the average home , more apps are bound to come along .
Advertisement
And your friends , too , who get hooked up with Boxee will make the experience more enjoyable .
Not that I do n't think the Boxee team lacks for cultural cachet , but they 're the only people , out of the 10 I 'm friended to through Boxee , that manage to push anything into my recommended / rated feed .
When more of your friends and fellow media lovers start using it , you 're bound to enjoy bumping into little surprises on Boxee a whole lot more .
Advertisement
What 's still missing
So Boxee 's taken a big step toward making their software more content - focused and accessible , but they could go farther .
Advertisement
Hulu can remember where you left off in a video while you 're signed in , and it would be great if Boxee could do that , too — on any video site .
This is n't some overnight JavaScript hack , but , still , it 's one of the last big differences between your DVD / Blu - Ray player and web video .
Video files that we download from around the internet have a huge variety of naming schemes .
Jason 's detailed some techniques for helping the " scraper " in XBMC , and Boxee , recognize and organize your files in his guide to turbo - charging your XBMC installation
Boxee still includes an automatic torrent downloader , and a web - server - based remote control scheme , but they 're both tucked away deep in the system options .
Why not come out of the server room ghetto and make Boxee a remote - controlled BitTorrent champion , just like uTorrent

Those are our ( admittedly positive - minded ) impressions so far .
Once you 've had a chance to play around with the latest Boxee , tell us what you think in the comments .

El - Erian on the Markets
Discussing the threat of Greece and Europe and its impact on the stock market Mohamed El - Erian , Pimco CEO / co-CIO .
I live in a nicely cosmopolitan little apartment complex .
It ’s one of the cheaper places to live in town , so we get a nice mix : single people , young couples , seniors , working - class folks , grad students .
Those last two categories in particular add a good bit of racial diversity — African Americans , South Asians , East Asians .
It makes for a nice place to live .
Because I like living in places like this , I find myself conflicted on the topic of immigration .
The largest motivation for opposing immigration ( setting aside the wrong - headed opposition that springs from racism ) is economic — but most of the people trying to make the economic argument get it wrong .
Or maybe they just state it poorly .
Population density
The most important reason that the United States is an attractive place to live is the low population density .
This was true from the beginning of European settlement .
There was enough land that anyone could be a landowner .
The low population meant fewer workers , which kept wages high and working conditions good .
Natural resources were abundant , meaning everyone could have and use more timber , more water , more grain , and ( especially over the past couple of generations ) more coal , oil , and natural gas .
There is high population density in cities , and that ’s the best way to arrange things :
If most people live in an urban environment , it preserves the maximum amount of land for crops , timber , pasture , natural areas , and so on .
Sprawling the people out in subdivisions and exurbs wastes a lot of land .
But however you arrange the living and working spaces : the more people you have , the smaller the average person ’s share is going to be .
Economists dismiss this argument , on the grounds that people are productive : Each new person produces more than enough to be self - supporting , so each new person can potentially raise everyone ’s standard of living .
That ’s not wrong exactly , but it ’s largely a self - serving argument .
The monied interests benefit from an influx of new workers , because a larger labor force holds down wages .
At the same time , the monied interests do n’t suffer as their pro-rata share of nature ’s bounty declines , because they do n’t settle for a pro-rata share ; they buy as much as they want , leaving that much less for the rest of us .
Many people understand this at some level , but view it in pieces rather than as a whole .
If they ’re workers , they object to other workers willing to work for lower pay .
If they ’re business owners , they claim that there are “ certain jobs ” that Americans just wo n’t do .
( A falsehood : it would be easy to find Americans to do any job , if it were a full - time salaried position with health insurance , a pension , and education benefits — just like every job I ever had as an adult . )
Others point to the increased demand on social structures when “ different ” people arrive — people with bigger families ( more children to be educated ) or people who speak a different language ( public safety information needs to be translated ) .
At this level , the pro-business argument is correct : immigrants are productive and the taxes they pay easily cover the costs of the services that they use .
But they still increase the population density — and that means dividing all the resources of the country among more people .
It ’s an economic issue , a quality - of - life issue , and particularly an environmental issue : there are many things that are only environmentally harmful if the demand for inputs exceed the local environment ’s capability to provide them , or if the outputs produced exceed the local environment ’s capability to handle them .
So : I ’m not against immigration ; I ’m against population growth .
In the context of a stable population , I ’d like as much immigration as possible , because I enjoy a cosmopolitan community .
Where the anti-immigrant argument turns really wrong , is when it comes to strategies and tactics of handling a population that includes some immigrants .
Police state
If you ’re going to allow people to visit , whether for tourism , cultural exchange , as guest workers , or whatever , some number of those people are going to stay here .
They ’ll stay for all kinds of reasons — for economic opportunity , for freedom , because they fall in love with someone who lives here , or just because they like the place they ’re visiting .
If the number who stay are the number you want to stay , then everything ’s fine .
But if it ’s more than you want , there ’s no way to reduce the excess without turning the country into a police state .
I do n’t want to live in a police state .
I do n’t want police to ask me for my papers .
It ’s annoying .
It ’s un-American .
It ’s unconstitutional .
( Well , it ’s constitutional for the police to ask , but it ’s unconstitutional for them to do anything if I do n’t present my papers .
Note that the Supreme Court seems inclined to disagree with me on this point . )
For one thing , there ’s no obligation for a citizen to even have papers .
Almost everyone does , because a drivers license counts and it ’s so handy to be able to drive , but it ’s not required .
It ’d be pretty tough to get along without a social security number , but you can have a number without having an identity document .
( Early social security cards — I still have mine — had no security features at all : just a name and number printed on card stock . )
Since the mid-1980s , employers have been insisting on seeing identity documents , because otherwise they can face penalties if they hire illegal immigrants — an early example of exactly what I ’m unhappy about .
Even if you have papers , even if you keep them sufficiently in order that you can present them to an employer when you start a new job or a bank when you want to open a new account , there ’s still no obligation to keep them on hand to show to the police .
Still , objecting to being asked to show papers is really just a personal quirk .
The real harm comes from having people here who ca n’t safely use ordinary public institutions .
Communities where people are afraid of being arrested or deported are inevitably bad communities .
Crimes will go unreported , which will result in more crime — and more violence , as people who lack access to the courts have to resort to self - help to settle their disputes .
Sick people wo n’t seek medical care , producing pockets of disease .
Pernicious institutions like check - cashing stores and pay - day lenders thrive where people can’t open bank accounts .
I do n’t want to live in a town where there are people who do n’t feel safe talking to the police when they get robbed or the department of labor when they get cheated by an employer or the bureau of weights and measures when they get cheated by a merchant .
I do n’t want to live in a town where lots of drivers do n’t have insurance because they do n’t have a license because they do n’t have the right kind of visa .
I do n’t want to live in a town where some people have to work for cash because there ’s no legal way for them to pay taxes .
As I say , I ’m of two minds .
I want to keep the low population density we enjoy in the US — it ’s a key factor in our high standard of living .
At the same time , I enjoy living in a diverse community .
But it ’s impossible to have it both ways :
If you allow foreigners into the country , some of them will stay , and any effort to remove them produces problems that are much worse than the small hit that any one immigrant produces to our standard of living .
And yet , in the aggregate , the hit on our standard of living is significant .
In the end I come down squarely against measures like the recently passed law in Arizona — it will do a lot more harm than good .
I ’m generally in favor of efforts to control the border , to make it tougher for people to sneak into the country , but that ’s no panacea — not unless you use control of the border to hold the number of temporary visitors below the number of permanent residents that you ’d be willing to accept .
I ’m not sure there is a solution , except for the rest of the world to become as nice a place to live as the US , and thereby produce a balance between immigration and emigration .

Growing Anger At Collapse of U.S.A. Standard of Living
Hiram
Lee writes :
A series of recent studies conducted by the Pew Research Center shed new light on the scope of the economic crisis in the US and the level of hostility the majority of the American population holds for the US government .
Released in March , before the passage of the Obama administration ’s health care legislation , a survey entitled “ Health Care Reform — Ca n’t Live With It , or Without It ” indicates that 92 percent of Americans give the national economy a negative rating .
No fewer than 70 percent of the respondents report having suffered job - related and financial problems in the past year , an increase from 59 percent the year before .
Fifty - four percent report someone in their home has been without a job and looking for work in the past year , up from 39 percent in 2009 .
The poll saw an aggravation of conditions in every area of economic life studied the year before .
Increasing numbers of people are reporting difficulty receiving or affording medical care ( 26 percent ) or paying their rent or mortgage payments ( 24 percent ) .
More Americans faced problems with collections and credit agencies ( 21 percent ) , or had mortgages , loans or credit card applications denied ( 19 percent ) .
As could be expected , the poorest Americans are suffering the most .
Some 44 percent of those making $ 30,000 per year or less report difficulty obtaining medical care , compared to 11 percent of those making $ 75,000 per year or more .
A similar gap can be found in the category of rents and mortgages , with 37 percent of those making $ 30,000 or less reporting difficulty making rent or mortgage payments , compared to 11 percent of those making $ 75,000 or more .
However , the percentage of those facing difficulties paying rent has increased dramatically for both groups since 2009 .
Large numbers of workers polled in the study say they have little confidence in job security and prospects for the future , with almost half ( 49 percent ) saying it is “ very or somewhat likely ” they will suffer “ job - related financial stress ” in the next year .
Twenty - five percent of workers say they expect to be forced to take a pay cut this year , while 24 percent expect to be laid off .
The Pew survey found that 85 percent of Americans reported difficulty finding jobs in their communities .
This and other statistics revealing the increasingly dismal employment opportunities facing millions of Americans are provided context in another study released this month by the Pew Economic Policy Group .
“ A Year or More : The High Cost of Long - Term Unemployment ” reports that no fewer than 44 percent of unemployed Americans met or exceeded the standard measure of long - term unemployment ( six months or more ) in March 2010 .
This marks the highest rate for long - term unemployment levels since World War II .
In addition to this , the Pew study reports that “ 23 percent of the nearly 15 million Americans who are unemployed have been jobless for a year or more . ”
This translates to 3.4 million people , “ roughly equivalent , ” the study points out , “ to the population of the state of Connecticut . ”
These alarming numbers should be considered along with findings in another recent Pew research study entitled “ The People and Their Government , ” released April 18 .
This report finds that “ by almost every conceivable measure Americans are less positive and more critical of government these days . ”
Only 22 percent of Americans say their government can be trusted , according to the new survey .
The report puts this among the lowest measures of trust in the government in half a century .
The study also shows across - the - board declines in approval ratings for numerous federal agencies , including the Department of Education , the Food and Drug Administration , the Social Security Administration , the Environmental Protection Agency , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Forty - three percent say the government has a negative effect on their daily life , up from 31 percent in 1997 .
While approval ratings for the government are remarkably low , with 65 percent saying the federal government and congress have a negative impact “ on the way things are going in the country , ” the approval ratings for other major institutions are as low or lower .
Sixty - nine percent of those surveyed say banks and other financial institutions have a negative impact on the way things are going in the country , while 64 percent say “ large corporations ” have a negative impact .
Some 57 percent say the national news media has a negative impact , while 49 percent say labor unions have such an impact .
The report states that “ more than six - in - ten ( 62 % ) say it is a major problem that government policies unfairly benefit some groups while nearly as many ( 56 % ) say that government does not do enough to help average Americans . ”
Taken as a whole , the Pew studies from March and April offer additional insight into the growing social misery under conditions of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , and the outrage it is generating .
Wide layers of the population , who have seen trillions of dollars funneled from the public treasury into the coffers of Wall Street executives while their own living standards have been assaulted , their jobs slashed , their children ’s schools closed , and vital social programs such as Medicare cut by billions of dollars , have no faith in the US government to secure their most basic social needs .
The corporate - controlled news media , along with the major institutions overseeing the nation ’s educational needs and basic food and medical resources , are considered corrupt and untrustworthy , contributing to the suffering of millions .
President Barack Obama , continuing to pose as a populist man of the people when he finds it necessary or beneficial , stands exposed as the chief representative of the interests of the American ruling elite and the standard bearer in the assault on the working class .
The restructuring of society taking place , in the direct interests of the corporate - financial elite and at the expense of the working population , is not occurring unnoticed .

Means it does n't get posted .
One hurdle colleges and universities face as they try to improve energy efficiency is figuring out how to pay for it .
The long - term savings from these kinds of projects can be significant for a large institution — done right , such a plan could save MIT several million dollars on its energy bill each year .
But these energy projects require substantial up - front investment , and that can be challenging for schools struggling with budget cuts .
MIT is on a path to meet this challenge , thanks to a $ 1 million gift from Jeffrey Silverman ' 68 about one year ago .
With this money , the Institute has established a fund to support campus energy and efficiency projects that have rapid " paybacks " — or savings that accrue and then can be reinvested into additional projects .
Silverman was intrigued by this giving opportunity because it allowed him to make a major difference at his alma mater while also leveraging his initial investment so that it could grow and be used in different ways .
" The idea of providing the seed money that was going to create savings and then get reinvested into more savings interested me , " he said .
He was also impressed that the fund was designed so that the savings would be rigorously measured , documented and verified .
Silverman , a successful commodities trader , first heard about the investment opportunity from Theresa M. Stone , MIT 's executive vice president and treasurer , who also cochairs the Campus Energy Task Force .
The task force was established by the MIT Energy Initiative to help MIT " walk the talk " on energy use .
Stone budgeted $ 500,000 in seed money in 2008 to promote energy conservation work in response to a review by the Department of Facilities and a student team from the MIT Sloan School of Management 's Laboratory for Sustainable Business .
That review determined that the Institute could save about $ 6 million each year — or 10 percent of its annual energy bill — through conservation projects that have quick paybacks .
Stone 's team then developed a list of appropriate payback projects , estimating they would cost MIT $ 14 million in one upfront investment .
Silverman was eager to contribute to Stone 's effort , and so in April 2009 he formed the Silverman Evergreen Energy Fund .
David Desjardins ' 83 , a consultant and investor who is also passionate about campus energy issues , has since donated an additional $ 500,000 to the effort .
"
The gifts made by Jeff and David marked votes of confidence in our commitment to implement disciplined , measurable improvements designed to improve campus energy efficiency , " Stone said .
" Their seed money continues to bear fruit for the MIT community and for those who value our example .
" To date , the fund has paid to upgrade the lighting systems in the Ray and Maria Stata Center for Computer , Information , and Intelligence Sciences , as well as the Stratton Student Center .
Both projects required a combined investment of nearly $ 600,000 and have resulted in estimated annual savings of about $ 185,000 , meaning they will have paid for themselves after about three years .
Another major focus of the Silverman fund has been to recalibrate the nearly 200 fume hoods in the Dreyfus Chemistry Building ( Building 18 ) .
Fume hoods are massive ventilation devices that protect researchers from potential chemical exposure by sucking up air and exhausting it outside — and they require a lot of energy .
A significant amount of this energy consumption can be reduced by lowering the volume of air that moves through the hoods while still providing the same level of protection .
This project cost about $ 430,000 and will save about $ 160,000 annually .
The savings from the first round of projects financed by the Silverman fund will be reinvested into a second round of energy conservation work .
These additional projects will most likely include more lighting retrofits and fume hood work .
They could also involve strategies for reducing heating , ventilation , and air - conditioning needs in unoccupied spaces .
After this second round of investments is deployed , Stone will examine the fund 's effectiveness in meeting the Institute 's goals for payback opportunities .
Information on other innovative campus energy programs at MIT and a newly released task force update report is available at http://web.mit.edu/mitei/campus.
A tiny artificial butterfly takes flight in a new high - speed video .
Engineers Hiroto Tanaka and Isao Shimoyama of Harvard University and University of Tokyo , respectively , created the tiny butterfly to try to understand the biomechanics of butterfly flight .
But the tiny machine may not teach us too much about how butterflies actually row through the air , said Robert Dudley , a physiologist at the University of California , Berkeley , co-author of the research to be published May 20 in the journal Bioinspiration & Biomimetics .
“ As a technical accomplishment , this work is impressive , but there are a number of aerodynamic and biological issues that need further attention , ” Dudley wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
Butterfly flight is somewhat mysterious because it ’s roughly the opposite of “ as the crow flies . ”
Butterflies flit about rather than flying in a straight line .
That actually costs them more energy , Dudley said , so scientists assume their looping flying serves some evolutionary purpose .
“ The advantage is that it ’s thought to be an anti-predator behavior , ” Dudley said .
“ The claim is that irregular flight paths are a permanent signal of prey unprofitability . ”
Would - be predators presumably take one look at the chaotic , loopy butterfly flight and decide to go after easier to predict snacks .
The Japanese researchers somewhat capture this oscillating type of flight with their plastic - winged flyer , but Dudley argued that the differences between the bot and a real butterfly are so great as to invalidate the biological lessons the researchers try to draw .
“ There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach but it severely limits any claims to the biology , ” Dudley said .

Tens of thousands rally against New Jersey budget cuts
By a WSWS reporting team
24 May 2010
Teachers from Patterson attended the Trenton rally
Over 30,000 teachers , public workers , retirees and community activists protested on Saturday in Trenton , New Jersey ’s state capital , against Governor Chris Christie ’s massive budget cuts .
The rally had been called by a coalition of community organizations and trade unions , including the New Jersey Education Association ( NJEA ) and the Communications Workers of America ( CWA ) .
Under Christie ’s new budget plan — which calls for the elimination of nearly $ 1 billion in state aid to schools — thousands of teachers statewide will lose their jobs and sports and arts programs will be cut .
The new budget will cut after - school programs , adult education programs and higher education budgets as well as assistance to free lunch programs for poor children , and a special rent rebate for elderly and disabled tenants .
Christie has also proposed legislation that will attack other public employees .
His plan includes the elimination of seniority protection for public employees , an increase in employee contributions to health care and pensions , and raising the retirement age from 62 to 65 years .
The state legislature will vote on the cuts by June 30 .
The austerity program in New Jersey is a part of a bipartisan effort to make the working class pay for the economic crisis .
Nationwide , state budgets have suffered from the largest drop in revenue on record , largely due to the mass unemployment created by the recession .
The Obama administration has refused to significantly reduce the total $ 375 billion collective budget deficit of the states .
The thousands that attended the rally — one of the largest in the capital ’s history — were furious at Christie not only for his repeated attacks on public education and social programs , but especially because on Thursday he had vetoed a measure that would have modestly increased taxes on the state ’s 16,000 people with incomes of $ 1 million or more .
( New Jersey has a population of almost 9 million . )
Homemade signs could be seen everywhere calling for increased taxation of the rich .
The measure itself , however , was calculated to appease the widespread anger at the state ’s wealthy .
It was sponsored by the Democrats in the State Assembly , and if there had been any chance of its passing , they would not have proposed it .
Democrats do not have the two - thirds majority required to override a veto .
Even if the tax had been passed , it would have raised only about $ 640 million in revenue .
Far from offering a plan of action to resist Christie , the union leaders and others who spoke at the Trenton rally sought to divert the anger of the demonstrators into support for the Democratic Party .
Barbara Keshishian , president of the NJEA , told the rally , “ If legislators remain silent , then they will share the blame . …
This rally is only the beginning .
We will keep fighting for what we worked so hard to build .
We will stand up for what we ’ve earned .
We will fight for our rights .
We will fight for the future of this state .
We will fight until this governor and the legislature do the right thing . ”
Chris Shelton , a vice president of the Communications Workers of America , told the protesters , “ We are here to say to the governor and legislature : ‘ We are fed up , and we are not going to take it anymore ! ’ ”
This is the kind of fake “ populism ” that President Obama has also used on a few occasions lately , in the face of the growing anger of workers over unemployment , budget cuts and bailouts and growing bonuses for the bankers .
It has the same content and aim coming from the union officials as from the president — to allow workers to blow off steam while keeping them tied to the parties of big business .
The real work of the union leadership goes on away from the public stage .
NJEA leaders are already collaborating on the state ’s application for Race to the Top funds , one of the instruments by which the ruling elite seeks to undermine public education .
Local unions continue to surrender teachers ’ rights and allow layoffs to go through .
Supporters of the Socialist Equality Party distributed nearly 4,000 copies of a leaflet that called for the formation of action committees to carry out strikes and workplace occupations , for a break with the Democrats and Republicans , and for socialist polices , including the nationalization of the banks and big corporations .
This last demand evoked an especially favorable response from many teachers and other workers , whose deeply felt hostility to the Wall Street moguls was entirely different from the phony words of the bureaucrats on the stage .
The World Socialist Web Site interviewed teachers , students and workers who attended the rally .
Karitikeya Sapoo
Karitikeya Sapoo , a doctoral student at Rutgers studying cultural anthropology , told the WSWS , “ Governor Christie cut the budget for Rutgers by about 15 percent for this coming fiscal year .
The sad part is the administration invited him to commencement and awarded him an honorary degree .
The students booed him .
“ They are blatantly rolling back all kinds of services , and they are doing it with impunity .
The corporate lobbyists , especially in finance , have taken over the government .
There is a global crisis of accumulation , and there is a disconnect between production and the financial sector .
We are all part of a struggle , and we should recognize it . ”
Stan Bryant
Stan Bryant is a state worker with 10 years at the Department of Children and Families ( DCF ) .
He said , “ There are going to be a quite a few layoffs at DCF in addition to more furloughs .
Right now , we are being furloughed for 10 days .
Christie is talking about forcing us to take 26 days of furlough .
This would be about a 10 percent cut in wages .
The 10 - day furlough reduces our salaries by almost half of that .
“ We are also worried about more attacks when the lawsuit won by a child advocacy group to get improved services ends in 2011 .
We are under a court mandate until about a year from now .
There are about two or three thousand DCF workers , and we are in CWA 1037 .
We are hoping that we will strike .
They do n’t pay any attention to us .
We have to wage a struggle .
“ I would consider looking into the possibility of a workers ’ party .
I think the banks should pay for the crisis and for social services .
They created the crisis .
There are hundreds of thousands of state workers in New Jersey .
They have tried the furloughs with other state workers .
The furloughs create more pressure on us at work because you have more work to do with workers out all the time .
“ They are trying to raise our retirement age from 60 to 65 .
This is bad .
You have already worked 25 years .
Why should you have to work more , especially when so many people are out of work ?
Christie is cutting payments into the pension fund by some $ 3 billion this year .
This is when the pension system is already underfunded , as I understand . ”
Workers from the St. Lucy 's Homeless Shelter in Jersey City .
Joe Ulicki is crouched on the right with his own homemade sign
Joe Ulicki , a supervisor at St. Lucy ’s Homeless Shelter in Jersey City , pointed out , “ What is happening is that Christie is proposing to eliminate general assistance for single men and women in New Jersey .
This provides people with $ 140 in income a month .
With this $ 140 our residents need to pay for transportation to look for work , to take care of necessities like getting a haircut and buying clothes or medical supplies like aspirin .
Without this , they would have to live with no income at all .
“ The wages people make even if they find a minimum wage job are so low that with job insecurity , people become homeless because they cannot keep up with their rent .
They are constantly being laid off and have to come back to St. Lucy ’s to start over again .
They need to get clothes , haircuts , medicine to get prepared to look for a job .
They can not do this with food stamps .
Christie feels like he can make these cuts because the unemployed on welfare are some of the most vulnerable people in our society . ”
Anthony Giusto
Anthony Giusto , a special education and language teacher at the Passaic County Technical Institute , told the WSWS , “ All the first year teachers have been given notice that they wo n’t be hired back .
Many others at the lower levels of seniority at the school have also received notices .
The totals are about a couple of hundred out of 500 teachers at the school that face being laid off .
This will have a terrible effect on the teachers being laid off .
My fiancée is a teacher in Paterson and she has been sent a layoff notice along with more than 800 Paterson teachers .
This is going back six years in seniority .
“ These cuts are not only having a terrible effect on the teachers who are being laid off , but it will have a serious effect on education by raising class sizes .
Paterson is a state - run district .
Here the state can impose more cuts more easily .
In Paterson , they imposed a 1.5 percent health benefit cut .
The Paterson teachers were forced to take a pay freeze .
“ Newark and 21 other school districts in New Jersey are run by the state instead of by local school boards .
The state took them over in the early and mid 1990s .
Teachers have n’t lost collective bargaining entirely in these districts , but it is greatly curtailed .
The state is making the biggest cuts in these districts , which are the major urban districts in the state .
“ They are imposing freeze contracts on teachers , and these districts are taking the hardest hits .
There is a conscious policy by both parties to privatize education in New Jersey .
Private companies are coming in to take over just like Edison did in Philadelphia .
Obama is dangling funds for his ‘ Race to the Top ’ program to do the same thing . ”
Branden Rippey
Branden Rippey has been a teacher in Newark for 12 years .
He teaches history at Science Park High School and told the WSWS , “ I am at the demonstration because 11 teachers in my building are being laid off .
There are 80 teachers at Science Park High School , which is the magnet school in Newark and like Bronx Science High School in New York .
It is also because class sizes will be increased next year , and next year students wo n’t have elective courses like sociology , which I teach , because there will only be enough teachers to teach the core courses .
“ The ruling elite today does n’t want students to be educated .
For instance , if they do n’t teach history students wo n’t have any idea about the history of the workers ’ movement .
I teach labor history , and students are always surprised to hear about the 1919 Seattle strike where workers took over the city for about a week .
“ About 2,000 students in Newark walked out of classes on April 27 and marched to city hall because of the budget cuts .
In one of the biggest contingents in the city , about 500 walked out of our school in support of teachers and education .
I was proud of them .
“ I think it was very important there was a statewide walkout of students .
This shows that the students are not jaded by the system .
The unions have become way too bureaucratic , especially the union in Newark .
I ’m a building rep in the union , but the NTU has done nothing there .
We definitely need to break with the Democratic Party as well as the Republicans .
I ’ve also left the Green Party .
I am in favor of a mass socialist party . ”

Is an adaptation , crafted by the invisible hand of natural selection ?
Or do we just make it up ?
This turns out to be a tricky question to answer .
On the one hand , there 's little doubt that evolutionary theory can shed light on the origins of some of the behaviours that fall within the rubric of morality , including altruism , , and our characteristic attitudes about certain kinds of sexual behaviour .
On the other hand , the morality - as - adaptation hypothesis faces some serious challenges .
If morality were a direct product of evolution , why would people constantly argue about what 's right and wrong ?
Why would we spend so much time teaching our children to be good , and inculcating in them virtues such as ?
Why would we experience inner conflict between what we think is morally right and what we really want to do ?
You might expect that , as an evolutionary psychologist , I 'll have snappy comebacks for each of these questions .
But I do n't ; I think they represent important criticisms and I do n't think that morality is a direct product of evolution .
What I do think , and what I 'll argue in this post , is that morality is a social institution .
To some extent , it embodies and reflects our evolved inclinations , but to some extent it also counteracts them .
Starting with Darwin himself , various thinkers have argued that human morality has an evolutionary origin .
Like any other complex phenomenon in the biosphere , it is a product of natural selection and other evolutionary processes .
At first glance , this might seem unlikely .
Why ?
Because morality just does n't seem to aid its bearers !
Traditional moral systems tell us we should not act to satisfy our own selfish needs , but instead should act altruistically ( that is , we should act to satisfy the selfish needs of other people ) .
This hardly sounds like a recipe for evolutionary success .
However , there are at least two reasons to think morality bears the imprint of our evolutionary history .
The first comes from observations of a class of individuals that psychologists all too often ignore : other animals .
Nonhuman animals obviously do n't reason explicitly about right and wrong , but they do exhibit some aspects of human morality .
Rather than being locked into an eternal war of all - against - all , many animals display tendencies that we count among our most noble :
They cooperate ; they help one another ; they share resources ; they love their offspring .
For those who doubt that human morality has evolutionary underpinnings , the existence of these ‘ noble ' traits in other animals poses a serious challenge .
When speaking of other species , we inevitably explain these traits in evolutionary terms .
No one would want to explain the fact that female dogs love and care for their puppies as an arbitrary product of canine culture , for example .
Given that we accept an evolutionary explanation for this behaviour in other species , it seems tenuous to argue that the same behaviour in human beings is entirely a product of a completely different cause : learning or culture .
In principle , it is possible .
However , we should have a strong reason to make this exception .
Without such a reason , our default assumption should be that we are continuous with the rest of nature and thus that the behaviour has an evolutionary origin .
That 's one reason to accept that evolutionary theory has a role to play in the analysis of moral behaviour .
A second is that , not only do we know that these kinds of behaviour are part of the standard behavioural repertoire of humans in all culture and of other animals , we now have a pretty impressive arsenal of theories explaining how such behaviour evolved .
Kin selection theory explains why many animals - humans included - are more altruistic toward kin than non -kin : Kin are more likely than chance to share any contributing to this nepotistic tendency .
Reciprocal altruism theory explains how altruism can evolve even among non-relatives :
Helping others can benefit the helper , as long as there 's a sufficient probability that the help will be reciprocated and as long as people avoid helping those who do n't return the favour .
Another promising theory is that altruism is a costly display of fitness , which makes the altruist more attractive as a mate or ally .
Overall , the evolutionary explanation of altruism represents one of the real success stories of the evolutionary approach to psychology .
It 's not alone , though .
Evolutionary theory also sheds light on sexual morality , in particular our attitudes toward incest .
The logic is simple : Because kin share so many genes , they are more likely than non -kin to share deleterious recessive genes , and thus the offspring of incestuous liaisons are likely to have low fitness - often they do n't survive , and if they do , they often do n't reproduce .
As a result , any heritable psychological or behavioural trait that lessened the chances of incestuous would have a good chance of being selected .
Consistent with this reasoning , the avoidance of incest is widespread in the animal kingdom and , once again , we 're no exception to this general rule .
We see , then , that some of our basic moral inclinations and impulses make very good sense in evolutionary terms .
This does not imply , however , that morality as a whole is an evolutionary product .
An immediate and very reasonable criticism of the adaptation hypothesis is that human moral codes vary a great deal between different cultures and subcultures ( although not as much as people sometimes think ) .
Furthermore , moral beliefs sometimes change rapidly over time , both within individuals and within societies - consider , for instance , the change in expressed attitudes about in the western world in the second half of the twentieth century .
If humans share a common moral psychology , there would presumably be little debate on ethical issues .
Why , then , do we constantly wrangle over what 's right and wrong ?
And why , from time to time , would we all have such great difficulty following the dictates of morality ?
If morality were a direct product of evolution , it would presumably enhance our fitness and thus we would have evolved to want to be moral .
Often , though , doing the right thing involves an effort of will and goes against our dominant impulse .
As the philosopher Denis Diderot pointed out , ‘ There is no moral precept that does not have something inconvenient about it ' .
Certainly , in some domains , we do naturally want to do the right thing .
Very few people have trouble resisting incest , for example .
Nonetheless , often we would prefer to do the wrong thing if we thought we could get away with it .
Thus , some moral standards jar against our evolved inclinations .
To explain this , we must go beyond biological evolution and consider the contribution of cultural evolution in the making of our moral systems .
The first step is to draw a clear distinction between our morally - relevant evolved dispositions and our shared moral code .
The latter does not have a direct evolutionary origin .
It is a cultural product , and is the outcome of many different factors .
Let 's now consider some of the most important of these .
First , to some degree , our moral codes are simply reflections of our evolved human nature .
A good example relates to incest .
Many cultures ( though not all ) have formal moral rules proscribing incest .
It is tempting to ask :
If our aversion to incest has an evolutionary origin , why would we need a moral injunction against it ?
But this question raises a possibility : Maybe we do n't need a moral injunction against incest .
The vast majority of people just do n't want to engage in this form of sexual expression ; they feel an acute and pronounced disgust at the prospect .
So , in this instance at least , formalized morality may simply embody or reflect people 's values , values they would have anyway .
It 's easy to multiply examples .
As noted , human beings are evolved nepotists , and it's clear that the ethical systems of the world reflect this aspect of human nature .
The Old Testament , for example , admonishes us to honour our fathers and mothers , and one of the key Confucian virtues is filial piety : love and respect for one 's parents and ancestors .
Likewise , humans are evolved reciprocators , and the reciprocity principle is embodied in many of our ethical teachings and beliefs .
We like to believe that the scales of justice will be balanced , especially when this means that the good things we have done will be rewarded and the bad things other people have done will be punished .
The reciprocity principle is embodied in the belief that God rewards and punishes behaviour , and also in the traditional Indian belief that one gets one 's just desserts through the action of karma .
There is also a widespread trend among human beings of viewing disasters as a response to human misbehaviour , an exchange of bad for bad .
The Chinese believed that earthquakes and other disasters occurred when people stopped following the way of nature .
Similarly , the Biblical flood was construed as a response to human sins .
In these and other cases , we see that universal aspects of the human mind shine through in the very different worldviews that arise in different cultures .
There is clearly some truth , then , in the notion that our moral codes and ethical theories embody and reflect our evolved human nature .
However , if pressed too far , this view breaks down .
In some cases , morality redirects or even opposes our evolved passions .
Although we have some degree of universal compassion , we also routinely favour ourselves , family members , and members of the groups to which we belong .
This has a clear evolutionary origin .
But most ethical systems frown on this kind of favouritism , which receives pejorative labels such as selfishness and nepotism .
Similarly , although many moral precepts reflect the reciprocity principle ( return good for good and bad for bad ) , this is not always the case .
For example , the ethical precept that we should ‘ turn the other cheek ' goes against the grain of our untrained inclinations .
This demonstrates that our evolved moral psychology must be distinguished from our formalized morality , and that our official moral systems can and do stray away from the dictates of human nature .
Of course , when we have a conflict between a moral urge and a non-moral urge , this does n't necessarily mean that the non-moral urge is an evolutionary product and the moral urge a product of culture .
In some cases , it is a conflict between two evolved urges .
Some evolved tendencies are considered moral ; this includes the desire to care for one 's children and to form monogamous pair bonds .
But others are generally considered immoral ; think , for example , of , , and our proneness to be unfaithful sexually .
Why do we consider some evolved motivations good and others not ?
One reason may be that familial love and do not impinge on the harmony of the community , whereas aggression and often do .
This brings us back again to the idea that morality is not a direct product of evolution .
Instead , and to some extent , it is a humanmade system of favouring those evolved tendencies that facilitate group cohesion , while disfavouring those that are socially divisive .
Morality is a way of controlling our evolved natures , rather than a mere reflection of those natures .
Other things are going on as well .
Some of the content of our moral systems derives from preferences about how we wish others to act .
For example , people may tend to dislike selfishness in others and prefer altruism , especially when they or their kin are the recipients of that altruism .
The moral codes of a culture may have emerged from people acting on such preferences - for example , discouraging others from being selfish and discouraging members of other families from exhibiting kin favouritism where this might disadvantage them ( which is the point at which we stop seeing kin favouritism as wholesome family loyalty and start seeing it as nepotism ) .
When you think about it , moral precepts such as ‘ give without thought of reward ' are potentially highly advantageous to those who preach but do n't practice them .
Thus , people may encourage others to behave altruistically in order to satisfy their own selfish agendas !
Ironically , then , the self - interested , manipulative efforts of people pursuing this policy may have helped foster the unselfish forms of morality .
This may help to explain why we are more altruistic than evolutionary principles alone would lead us to expect .
On top of this , our moral systems embody a desire to present ourselves in a good light .
We may espouse ethical values that make us attractive as mates or friends or allies .
This may mean understating the extent of one 's toward self and kin .
This is n't necessarily a matter of conscious and deliberate .
Sometimes it is , but often we genuinely accept the moral principles we espouse , even when our behaviour does n't quite match up to the rhetoric .
The point is , though , that we sometimes display moral attitudes that convey a more flattering picture of ourselves than is strictly accurate , and these attitudes may embed themselves in the shared morality of a culture .
Finally , we sometimes try to infer moral truths from the facts of our experience .
For example , when any kind of disaster occurs , people may look at the events that preceded it and infer a causal connection .
They may interpret it as a for some moral misdemeanour , such as following the wrong religion or worshipping the wrong god or sacrificing the wrong animal in the wrong way .
By finding spurious associations between our behaviour and subsequent events in the world , our moral codes come to be shaped in part by accidents of history .
This introduces a random element into the moral code of any culture .
Ideas such as these help explain why our moral beliefs sometimes clash with our evolved predilections , and why they sometimes make little or no evolutionary sense .
They are a crucial component of a complete explanation for human morality .
Morality starts from evolved dispositions , but takes on a life of its own outside the individual 's skull .
Our shared moral code emerges over many generations as the net result of negotiations and deliberations and compromises among different people with different agendas .
As such , when people learn the morality of the surrounding culture , they end up with something different between their ears than their evolved , morally - relevant dispositions and inclinations .

How does an NFL linebacker develop a series of computer algorithms that give him a crucial edge when trading the market ?
That is the question I hoped to answer when I interviewed Jon Najarian , co-founder of OptionMonster ( click here for the site at http://www.optionmonster.com/ ) .
Jon ’s proprietary program , called Heat Seeker ® , monitors no less than 180,000 trades a second to give him an early warning of large trades that are about to hit the stock , options , and futures markets .
To give you an idea of how much data this is , think of downloading the entire contents of the Library of Congress , about 20 terabytes , every 33 minutes .
His firm maintains a 10 gigabyte per second conduit that transfers data at 6,000 times the speed of a T - 1 line , the fastest such pipe in the civilian world .
Jon then distills this ocean of data into the top movers of the day , which he puts up for free on his website , and offers much more detailed analysis through a variety of premium subscription products .
Jon is also co-founder of an online brokerage called “ TradeMonster ” off the back of this impressive research effort .
“ As with the NFL , ” says Jon , “ you ca n’t defend against speed . ”
The system catches big hedge funds , pension funds , and mutual funds in the midst of shifting large positions , giving subscribers a peak at the bullish or bearish tilt of the major players in the market .
It also offers accurate predictions of imminent moves in single stock and index volatility .
Long and short vol traders take note .
If anything , the profusion of dark pools and high frequency trading , now thought to account for 50 % of the daily volume , makes Jon ’s tools more valuable because that are exacerbating the quantitative nature of the markets .
Some 200,000 traders are believed to be following Heat Seeker ’s advice .
Jon started his career as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears , and I can personally attest that he still has a handshake that ’s like a steel vice grip .
Maybe it was his brute strength and ability to take abuse that enabled him to work as pit trader on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange for 22 years , where he was known by his floor call letters of “ DRJ ” .
He formed Mercury Trading in 1989 , built it into a substantial business , and then sold it to the mega hedge fund , Citadel , in 2004 .
Jon developed his patented algorithms for Heat Seeker® with his brother Pete , another former NFL player ( Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Minnesota Vikings ) , who like Jon , is a regular face in the financial media .
Jon thinks that if China is serious about throttling back its economy , it will have a dampening effect on global financial markets for some time .
The S&P 500 is going to stick around the 1100 level , and commodities are going to stay in a big sideways range .
Volatility is going to die .

Two or three times a week , truck driver Jesus Serrano hauls loads of Mexican - grown produce from warehouses in Nogales , Ariz . , which is just across the U.S. - Mexico border , to distribution centers in Los Angeles .
Serrano plans to stop making the trip now that Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer has signed a stringent anti-illegal immigration bill into law , however , and he 's recruited other truckers to join him .
Serrano , the independent owner - operator of a Los Angeles - based trucking company , said that about 70 drivers based in California and Arizona had agreed to stop moving loads into or out of Arizona in protest of the new law .
He hopes to get 200 truckers on board for a five - day boycott that will start within 48 hours of the bill 's signing .
The law will , of course , require that police stop anyone who may be in the country without documentation and then demand to see their immigration papers , although in truth , ascertaining immigration status properly may take weeks , according to immigration lawyers whom I 've spoken with .
The problem with this law , as well , is that it 's not Constitutional under the 4th and 6th Amendments , potentially ( and possibly the 5th as well ) , and is widely being questioned in terms of its potential for inappropriate racial profiling of all people who MAY look " like immigrants . "
Which , in Arizona , means looking Latino .
But boycott ?
That term is being flung around a lot .
What does it even mean ?
Is it effective ?
Jaime Chamberlain , the owner of two Nogales - based distribution businesses and the incoming chairman of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas , said that a boycott by 70 truckers could have a significant impact on freight rates , which would translate into higher prices .
He also thought the state would take an economic hit from lost sales revenue .
And not to be outdone by truck drivers , the American Immigration Lawyers Association is also boycotting Arizona .
After all , many say that South African apartheid was ended due to trade embargo and boycott from the United States .
So I suggest we follow the lead of these wise truck drivers , and boycott Arizona - based companies like PetSmart , U - Haul , GoDaddy , US Airways , and Cold Stone Creamery .
My husband suggested boycotting Bauxite and wolf shirts and the Tea Party , but I think we 've already got that underway .
So again , check that link for companies to avoid .
And be sure to tell them why , along with the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry :

To repeat , and h/t to SciMathGuy for the suggestion so that this one is REALLY clear :
When you decide to boycott Company X... drop a line to Company X as well as to the Chamber of Commerce .
Just go to Company X's web site and send an e-mail informing Company X that you will no longer be buying their product because of Arizona 's support of racial profiling with the passage of SB 1070 .
And be sure , if you boycott traveling there , to tell the Arizona Tourism Board too :
Arizona Office of Tourism

Heck , even if you were n't actually planning on traveling or eating at Cold Stone , you can still give them a call or shoot them an email to tell them you are boycotting Arizona until this law is repealed .
Economic pressure speaks volumes .
Sometimes it speaks louder than Civil Rights .
A sad and unfortunate truth , but whatever it takes .

For a final show of solidarity , check out this petition and this one too h/t to Deoliver47
And really , do n't take my word for it .
From Rep. Grivalja a few days ago :
The governor and legislature are blind to what this bill will really do to citizens , law enforcement and the state economy .
Tourists will not come to a state with discriminatory policies on the books .
Businesses will not move here .
Hispanic workers and taxpayers will leave .
If state lawmakers do n’t realize or do n’t care how detrimental this will be , we need to make them understand somehow .
Conventions are a large source of visitors and revenue , and targeting them is the most effective way to make this point before it ’s too late .
And just breaking as of 40 minutes ago , Grivalja reiterates :
Congressman Raul Grijalva is leading the charge for big businesses to ban Arizona and spend their convention money in other states .
At a rally held outside his downtown campaign headquarters , Grijalva said on Saturday that economic sanctions may or may not work but will get the nation 's attention on the need for national immigration reform .
Grijalva is calling for an economic boycott of Arizona and suggesting civic , religious and political groups to spend their convention money elsewhere .
And some local business owners are AGREEING with this boycott :
Business owner Fernando Gonzales said at the Grijalva event that he would support an economic boycott because " there 's a higher cause here .
There 's a moral cause . "
For those of us not planning to attend any conventions this year , there 's always other forms of economic pressure as well as threatening Arizona 's most coveted natural resource : tourism and commerce .
And to support California Truckers to get on board with this action , contact the California Trucker 's Association .
If anyone has other ideas for Truck Driving Unions to contact , please feel free to share it in a comment and I will update the diary !
Please note : any racially charged slurs will not be tolerated in this diary .
The term " undocumented immigrants " is a term used by Progressive Democrats .
No humano es ilegal so do n't say " i*** gal alien " or " i*** gal immigrant " here .
As PistolSO from PeanutButterPac has written , it 's time to retire these terms .
Those are so 1850 and rank up there with called African - American people " colored , or worse , in my book .
Thanks for the Netiquette and general propiety !
Full disclosure : I volunteer with a small immigrant amnesty group , but they are not aware of my posting this on this site , nor am I paid to blog for them ( none of my work is paid ) .
My views presented are entirely my own and do not reflect my long - standing volunteer work in the area of immigration reform .

Update :
h/t to Claude
Today 's Santa Fe New Mexican newspaperfront pages the call for a boycott of AZ .
The president of the City of Santa Fe's Immigration Committee is asking families and businesses to boycott Arizona , an action she hopes will help lead to elimination of a law signed Friday by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer .
The state law , to take effect in 90 days , is intended to allow Arizona police to identify , prosecute and deport undocumented immigrants .
Under the new law , which critics argue is unconstitutional , legal migrants in Arizona must carry at all times paperwork proving their legal status .
" This is a very clear demonstration that we need an immigration reform , so that these types of civil - rights violations are not sanctioned by any state , " María Cristina López said Friday .
Also , a special shout - out ( and must - read ) about the problems with this " anti-Mexican " law , as written by an immigration lawyer here .
Finally , it looks like the Los Angeles Spanish Daily Paper , La Opinion , is also advocating strongly for a National Boycott of the State of Arizona .
Dead to Rights : Retribution is a mixed bag of a gaming experience .
It ’s part brawler , part stealth , and part third person shooter .
It ’s also part great game , part terrible game .
Every player who experiences Dead to Rights : Retribution is going to see this game differently .
It ’s all a matter of whether you see the glass as half - empty or half - full .
In Dead to Rights , you control Jack and Shadow .
Jack is the cop who does n’t play by the rules ( probably because his daddy is the chief of police ) .
And Shadow is Jack ’s enormous crossbreed husky - akita - Cerberus - timber wolf dog .
The two work as a team to kick and bite as many groins , slash and break as many necks as it takes to bring down the crime rate in the city .
While controlling Jack , players have the option to play the game as either a brawler or a third person shooter , or as a mixture of both .
Jack has the usual array of attacks : strong , medium and light punches , grabs , throws and some absolutely vicious executions , some of which will make the execution in Gears of War 2 look like child ’s play .
The physical battles are highly satisfying and at times I could n’t help but be reminded of the Final Fight arcade series .
That ’s a good thing .
Guns can be found from dead enemies , or they can be pried from your foes hands .
There is n’t much ammunition to go around , but there are plenty of guns .
Gamers are encouraged to play as ruthlessly as they want , discard their gun and then kick some ass for another .
Each large weapon has a different execution cutscene that will make gamers want to pick up and try every one .
There is a cover system in Dead to Rights , but it ’s finicky at best .
Some items are difficult to hide behind .
While others provide useless cover as Jack ’s huge head sticks over the top .
Occasionally , players will control Shadow in some stealth missions .
Jack will tell Shadow to “ get keys ” or something similar .
Then Shadow goes into the complex and tears the throats out of everyone inside .
It ’s kind of funny because sometimes the investigation has n’t even begun and there ’s no telling whether the armed gunmen inside are innocent or guilty .
Who knows what would happen if Jack ever said “ brutally kill or castrate everyone you see ! ”
He ’d probably end up with a set of keys .
As Shadow is in stealth mode , he can see all the enemies around him and based on their color , he can tell if he ’s been detected or not .
Shadow is quick and agile and can take down enemies in one attack if he goes in unnoticed .
If seen , Shadow can only take a bullet or two before it ’s game over .
The stealth gameplay breaks up the pace of the game , but not to a distracting degree .
And as far as stealth missions go , these are all a walk in the park .
But now we move on to the major problems with the game .
Dead to Rights is an ugly game .
The character models feel incredibly dated .
With his disproportionate body , Jack looks like a goof when he runs and he looks even worse when he ’s climbing ladders .
Unfortunately , Shadow suffers from a similar problem .
When standing upright and moving slowly , he looks completely unnatural .
It ’s like watching a nature film about wolves … in slow motion .
The environments can also be a bit of an eyesore .
Aside from the highrise level ( which was fantastically reminiscent of Die Hard ) , it feels like the level designers were going for “ grungy ” and just ended up with a mess instead .
Control - wise , the buttons are mapped fairly unintuitively .
Non-hardcore gamers will probably feel completely lost picking up this game .
But that ’s what happens when you try to map two completely different play styles to one character .
The controls are n’t game - breakingly bad , but they ’re bad enough .
The voice acting is terrible .
Even though you ’ll hear some familiar voices like Paul Eiding , you ’ll find that very few lines in the game are n’t cringe worthy .
Oh , and the explosions are just … really sad .
The designers tried to mask how bad some of the explosions by playing them in slow motion .
It does n’t work .
Oh and the helicopter that just blew up … is still 99 % there .
Certainly , its no longer flight worthy , but c’mon !
It ’s very inconsistent with the rest of the game .
Big guns , big dude , big fights , big dog , weak explosions .
At one point in the game , Shadow needs to turn off some generators so Jack can go through an electric door lock .
After slaughtering a base full of super soldiers , Shadow then proceeds to pee on the generators to turn them off .
Really ?
Peeing ?
Not only is that too silly even for this game , but it ’s SNOWING outside and the generators are out in the open .
Would n’t the snow ( which would most certainly melt near the warm generators ) produce the same effect ?
I know the falling snow is just to create atmosphere in the game and I know I ’m nit picking .
But … peeing ?!
REALLY !?
In the end , Dead to Rights : Retribution really is a mixed experience .
It feels like Final Fight and Dark Sector had a baby … and adopted a demon dog .
It has a ton of technical and design flaws , but the gameplay is solid and absolutely fun and rewarding at times .
If you do n’t take it too seriously , you ’ll have a great time with it .
On the other hand , the voice acting is terrible .
The level design stinks and the controls are hit or miss .
While we ca n’t recommend paying full price for this title , it might be a great game to grab on sale .
And it will certainly make a wonderful summer weekend rental .
The Cheonan sank after an as - yet unexplained blast on 26 March
South Korea 's navy has fired warning shots at a patrol boat from the North , the most serious skirmish since a Southern ship was sunk on 26 March .
Two vessels had violated a disputed border known as the Northern Limit Line , South Korea 's military said .
" Two patrol boats crossed on two separate occasions and warning shots were fired , " an official said .
Tensions have been high since a South Korean warship mysteriously sank on March 26 , killing 46 sailors .
A North Korean patrol boat sailed 2.8 km ( 1.6 miles ) into South - controlled waters on Saturday , said Seoul 's Joint Chiefs of Staff .
It retreated after a South Korean ship broadcast a warning , reports say .
Less than an hour later , another North Korean patrol boat violated the border , but returned to its waters after another warning was broadcast .
Two shots were fired from the South Korean vessel , a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said .
There were no injuries , he said .
The border skirmish took place close to where the Cheonan , a Southern warship , sank in March , apparently struck by a torpedo .
That incident left 46 sailors dead .
South Korea has not officially blamed the North , but Pyongyang has come under suspicion over the suspected attack .
An international team of investigators is expected to release its findings this week .
The area was also the scene of fatal naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 , and a North Korean patrol boat was set ablaze in a firefight last November .
Updated Websites operated by the US Treasury Department are redirecting visitors to websites that attempt to install malware on their PCs , a security researcher warned on Monday .
The infection buries an invisible iframe in bep.treas.gov , moneyfactory.gov , and bep.gov that invokes malicious scripts from grepad.com , Roger Thompson , chief research officer of AVG Technologies , told The Register .
The code was discovered late Sunday night and was active at time of writing , about 12 hours later .
To cover their tracks , the miscreants behind the compromise tailored it so it attacks only IP addresses that have n't already visited the Treasury websites .
That makes it harder for white hat - hackers and law enforcement agents to track the exploit .
Indeed , Thompson initially reported that the problem had been fixed until he discovered the sites were merely skipping over laboratory PCs that had already encountered the attack .
The attack is most likely related to mass infections that two weeks ago hit hundreds of sites hosted by Network Solutions and GoDaddy , said Dean De Beer , founder and CTO of security consultancy zero ( day ) solutions .
He made that assessment based on the observation that the compromised Treasury websites are hosted at Network Solutions and the owner of grepad.com is also the owner of record for most of the websites used in the earlier attacks .
" There 's a very high probability that it's the same person , " De Beer said .
" The only things that are changing are the domains . "
Earlier , Thompson speculated the attack might be the result of someone exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability on the Treasury websites .
After investigating that possibility , De Beer said it was unlikely because the hacked Treasury sites contained static HTML pages that are n't susceptible to such exploits .
Media representatives at the Treasury Department did n't return a phone call seeking comment . ®
This posting was updated to include details linking the attacks to similar mass compromises that hit sites hosted by Network Solutions and GoDaddy .
Clean installation is a much better way than the dist - upgrade option in its current form .
In reality clean installation takes even less time since you have already downloaded the ISO .
If you are a guy who likes experimenting with new stuff all day , you are definitely going to end up with a whole lot of unnecessary apps and libraries .
Clean installation can help you start all over again without all the fluff .
You will be amazed by the sheer amount of " new " space you were able to liberate out of the mess .
Installing from scratch is fun .
Period .
Using the USB Disk Creator app to burn the ISO image into an USB and using it as the installation medium is my preferred way of installing Ubuntu right now .
Another Ubuntu is released in just 6 months and USB live OS is something you can ' recycle ' .
It 's a much greener option .
Those of you guys who do n't even knew such an app existed will be amazed to know that the disk creator app is available in Ubuntu by default !
So all you need to do is download Ubuntu 10.04 ISO , fire up USB Disk Creator app ( System - Administration - Startup Disk Creator ) and plugin your USB .
That 's pretty much it .
Here is what it looks like .
In my experience using a live USB is much faster than the conventional live CD way .
So what 's you take ?
Most of you might have already installed the brand new Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx .
I did too .
But here is something I would really like to know from you guys .
I tried upgrading the whole distro 2 times before and failed miserably .
It took a heck lot of time and post installation issues were simply overwhelming .
India is currently on high alert for terrorist attacks in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games in October , and Mrs Irbaieva 's build and behaviour aroused suspicions .
Her strapping physique appeared to be a man's , crew claimed , while she drank water throughout the flight without lifting her hijab .
When other passengers and crew were said to have panicked , the flight steward decided she was just too well - built to be a woman , and alerted air traffic controllers .
Can We Solve Chess One Day ?
Computers play great chess — can they play perfect chess ?
Ken Thompson is one of the co-inventors of UNIX , perhaps one of the greatest programmers who ever lived , and won the 1983 Turing Award for his important work .
Today I plan on having a guest author , Ken Regan , discuss Thompson ’s work on chess playing programs .
It is Ken on Ken , or rather Ken on : when Ken ( Regan ) , played at the Westfield ( NJ ) chess club as a teen in matches against distant clubs , he knew Ken ( Thompson ) not by his famous programming handle but as the “ club techie ” who relayed his moves by telex .
I once visited Bell Labs and spent some time talking to Ken T. on his chess program .
I asked why he was doing so well — his program was winning a lot .
He said his program had , probably , fewer bugs than the competition .
In those early days chess programs were often buggy , and a program with a bug is likely to be a program with a chess weakness .
The reason , Ken T. explained the programs were so hard to get right was simple :
All chess programs looked at a huge set of positions and then generated one move .
As long as the move was legal the programmer had no idea the program had made an error — unless the move led to an unexpected loss .
The rest of this is the work of Ken R. , who by the way is an international master with a rating of over 2400 .
With , of course , lots of help from Subruk .
Chess Programs and the Big Match
Unlike us , Thompson has done pioneering research in computer chess programming .
He and Joe Condon created the chess computer “ Belle , ” which won the 1980 World Computer Chess Championship and numerous other tournaments .
In 1983 Belle became the first machine to achieve a recognized Master rating .
It took only 14 more years for an IBM computer , “ Deep Blue , ” to topple the world champion , Garry Kasparov .
Today you can buy a $ 50 program for your laptop computer that likely can beat Kasparov , at least according to published ratings .
Weird to me , this meant that people following the just - concluded World Championship
Match online could often instantly know more about the state of play than the human champions .
Often but not always , as shown by today ’s climactic game in which Viswanathan Anand of India won with Black to defeat challenger Veselin Topalov .
At Move 40 , Anand calculated 11 moves ahead to realize that a position after Move 50 with only a King and three Pawns left for each side would be winning for him .
Many computer programs seeing only yea - far for minutes thought Anand ’s move was a blunder allowing a draw , causing their owners to express consternation on numerous chat channels and blogs .
Thus , sometimes the programs are wrong .
Yet Thompson ’s other great chess creation removes even that chance of error , and ties chess to several problems in computer science we ’ve been thinking about .
The Book of Chess
Thompson greatly extended algorithms and data structures for carrying out perfect analysis of chess endgame positions with at most five pieces on the board — three besides the kings .
You could be better than him and better than Belle overall , but if you got down to 5 pieces , you might as well be “ playing chess against God ” as he called it .
It was a chess version of Paul Erdős ’ proofs from the “ Book , ” in giving you not only the answer but the shortest route to the win or draw .
His database overturned centuries of belief that certain endgames were drawn .
You can win them — if you have the patience to find over 100 perfect moves
In the past decade people have completed a perfect analysis of positions with six pieces , and are now working on seven .
This discovered a position where it takes 517 moves to force a winning capture , and then a few more moves to checkmate .
That position has n’t come up in any real game , but others do all the time .
In fact , one could have arisen in the nerve - wracking game where Anand had Topalov on the ropes , but missed knockouts that machines saw instantly .
In this position
Anand , as White to move , lost his last chance by using his Rook on c3 to take Black ’s pawn .
Most players would take with the other Rook to form a line along the 3rd rank .
Leaving both Rooks on the rim gave Topalov an easy draw by perpetual check .
Topalov could still have drawn , but it would take only a little inattention to allow White ’s Rooks to block checks and reach a position like this :
Here
White can give checkmate — in 99 moves .
I do n’t think a human would even find the first move , let alone all 99 .
It ’s not a Rook check ; it ’s not pushing the pawn which White needs to promote to win ; it ’s a move neither of us understands .
You can see it by going to the endgame site .
The only move to win is Kf2 - g2 , shunting aside the King .
If you keep clicking the best moves for both sides , you reach this position when it ’s mate - in - 56 :
Now “ The Book of Chess ” says to play 56 .
Rd3-d2 + Kc2-c1 55.Rd2-d1 + Kc1-c2 54.Rd1-d3 ! , reaching the same position but with Black to move !
This idea called Zugzwang is known to chess players in many immediate situations , but we have no idea why “ The Book ” uses it here .
White has 4 other winning moves , but the first two allow Black quickly to force
White back to this position , so they are not independent wins .
The other two might be independent , but the increase the “ mating distance ” from 56 to 72 and 74 , respectively .
Now we ’re starting to use terms from graph theory , with positions as nodes and moves as edges , but these are not your familiar garden - variety graphs .
These graphs typify alternating computation , which is a fundamental part of complexity theory .
And these graphs are big .
Building Big Files
How big ?
Under Eugene Nalimov ’s modification of Thompson ’s original file format , the database for up to 5 pieces takes 7.05 gigabytes , compressed over 75 % from the originals .
The complete compressed 6 - piece set fills 1.2 terabytes .
That ’s on the order of large data set examples given by Pankaj Agarwal in a University at Buffalo CSE Distinguished Speaker lecture last month , for NASA , Akamai , the LSS Telescope , and others .
The complete 7 - piece set has been estimated to be around 70TB , and its computation may finish by 2015 .
Nalimov ’s distance - to - mate ( “ DTM ” ) files are built iteratively working backwards from checkmate positions .
The newer ones ( and Thompson ’s originals ) use distance - to - conversion ( “ DTC ” ) , which means including all winning positions with fewer pieces in the ground set .
Following chess endgame practice , let ’s call the winning side White .
The first iteration marks all positions where White can give checkmate — and / or make a winning capture — in one move .
The next iteration finds all positions where Black can’t avoid the previously - marked positions ( or in DTC , must make a losing capture ) .
Note that this is only a subset of the usual graph neighborhood of the marked positions — it ’s the subset of for which all out - neighbors are marked .
But the next iteration ( with White again to move ) marks all the positions which has an edge to the previously - marked Black - to - move positions .
The 517 - move win was the only unmarked position left ( up to symmetry ) in the 1,034th iteration for those particular pieces , after months of runtime .
The Search Problem
You ’d like to take a particular position and decide whether White can win , which means analyzing forward .
However , it is not known how to save appreciably over the brute - force backwards process , just to decide the search problem for one position .
This is related to asking how “ fast - mixing ” the chess endgames are .
In that single 99 - move winning line , both Kings go all over the place , Black ’s as well as White ’s , so a pretty wide swath of the whole KRRP vs. KQ ( with White ’s pawn on the f - file ) search space is involved .
The tablebases of course can help in analyzing forward from a given position , because when the usual alpha - beta search reaches a node with 6 or fewer pieces , it will return a perfect answer .
But herein lies a paradox : the hard - disk fetches slow the search down so much that competitive chess programs often play worse .
The world champion “ Rybka 3 ” chess program works best with its tablebase - probe policy set to “ Rarely ” ( the default ) or “ Never , ” not “ Normally ” or “ Frequently . ”
The degree to which the chess search does not stay localized is reflected in poor cache performance by the tablebase files in practice .
One remedy is putting selected endgames on a smaller but faster flash drive .
Another is using so - called bitbases , which give only the win / draw information and use far less memory .
Omitting the distance information , however , raises the problem of playing programs going around in cycles .
Can we address the caching issue more directly , by changing the strategy of how they are encoded , without losing their full information ?
Asymptotically , for chess on boards , the search problem is complete for or according to whether one imposes a “ generalized fifty - move rule ” to limit the length of individual games .
Whether a player has 2 or more independent winning strategies is equally hard .
Of course , for chess on the board we are talking about the concrete complexity of the problem .
Shorter Tablebase Descriptions ?
Here ’s one natural encoding shortcut that turns out to be wrong , exemplifying pitfalls of carrying intuition from garden - variety graphs to alternating graphs .
Most chess programs today can solve Mate - in - 5 problems in microseconds , looking ahead 9 - 10 ply where 2 ply means a move for each player .
Suppose we store only the checkmate positions , then those with a DTM of 5 moves = 10 ply , then those with DTM 20 ply , 30 , 40 , etc .
The idea is that if a chess program probes a position with a DTM of 29 , then the program can do 9 ply of ordinary search , enough to hit the DTM - 20 stored positions .
We might expect to save 90 % of the storage , on top of the 75 % compression already achieved .
This idea works for an ordinary leveled graph , but fails in an alternating graph .
This is because Black can make inferior moves that hop over the 10 - ply , 20 - ply , 30 - ply boundaries .
This creates game paths in which the minimax search never sees a marked node , until its own depth limit aborts it without result .
What we would like to do is to find short descriptions for whole hosts of positions , say all - drawn or all - winning for White , that we can express in lookup rules .
The idea is to tile the whole position space by these rules , in a way that needs only a lower order of exceptional positions to require individual table entries .
This raises a concept discussed before , namely descriptions of circuits that take an index as ( auxiliary ) input , and need to output ( only ) the - th bit of the function value .
Is it feasible to produce that kind of circuit ?
The need for DTM or DTC info to find shortest paths and avoid cycling may make this idea difficult to realize , but it can certainly apply to bitbases .
The Tablebase Graphs
Can we organize the endgame files to make it feasible , given an initial position in the database , to retrieve and cache only the parts needed in the search problem from ?
This relates to the expansion of the graph .
Although the Anand - Topalov game example shows how progress from can roam all over the board , perhaps the expansion is only through relatively few lines of play .
This raises the idea of graphs that are expanders locally on small scales , but have irregular expansion on larger scales .
If one can identify lines that transit between phases with play localized to part of the board , then the remaining positions would break into isolated components that could be read piecemeal into main memory .
This reminds me of papers on distance and clustering in large social - network graphs .
The tablebase graph is huge and natural to study .
What general properties does it have ?
Which classic graph properties and theorems can be carried over ?
Note the following trick :
One can have position with three winning moves .
There can be three later positions such that the defender after move can go to or go to , after can go to or , and after can go to or .
In such cases position remains winning even if any one of were to change from “ win ” to “ draw . ”
By analogy with Menger ’s Theorem one might expect this to imply has two independent winning strategies , but here that ’s false .
Notions of “ flows ” and “ cuts ” are hence also tricky to carry over .
The Book as “ Deep ” Oracle ?
Ever since IBM ’s “ Deep Blue ” beat Kasparov , multi- processing chess programs have prefixed “ Deep ” to their names .
But here I mean a different technical use of the word : computational depth .
A string is computationally deep if it has short descriptions , but every short description requires a long time to produce .
The Book of Chess has almost no information in classical terms — because it is described entirely by the rules of chess .
These rules fit on half a page , and asking for the portion needed in the search from a given position adds just one more line to describe .
If this portion really has no better computation than building basically the entire table , it is computationally deep .
Although the database entries for the positions you see when playing from the Anand - Topalov position are classically the opposite of random , they sure look random , which ones are wins or draws .
Can they be used in applications where one desires pseudo - randomness , but also wishes to leverage the digested information of an - complete or - complete problem ?
There have been several papers in the past few years on the problem - solving power of deep strings , in general or specifically those that are witnesses for SAT .
Certainly intense computational power has gone into building the files , so one feels they should provide power for doing something else .
Open Problems
The ultimate goal is to solve chess — does white win , does black win , or is it a forced draw ?
Even as computers become vastly more powerful than humans we still have no idea who wins this great game , even from some well - analyzed famous positions .
Can we even prove that Black does not have a forced win ?
This may sound silly , but actually Bobby Fischer opined that in a particular position reached after five symmetrical opening moves , he would rather be Black !
A realistic goal is to try and extend the perfect tables of play to eight , nine , ten and more pieces .
The underlying algorithms are simple , but there seem to be challenging computer science questions .
How to handle simple graph search on such huge graphs ?
How to apply methods that work for graph connectivity , but seem not to work on the game graphs ?
How to distribute large files , and optimize the caching tradeoffs ?
Okay , this one was a little bit of a tongue twister so I was n’t quite sure how to say it .
Technically I should say Firefox 2 RC1 RC1 but I guess it would make more sense if I refer to it as the first Release Candidate of Firefox RC1 .
Well , it does n’t really matter how you say it , instead all that matters is that the download is available .
Here are the direct links for the downloads of the English versions ( the only language currently available ) :
There have been quite a few great visual changes going on since Firefox 2 Beta 2 was released .
I think everyone will be much more pleased with how the theme is progressing as we head into the final homestretch .
The tabs look much more streamlined and the navigation buttons do n’t look so washed out .
Oh , and we ca n’t forget about the cool new Refresh button in this release . :)
I have also put together a portable version of the RC1 to make it a little easier to try .
All you have to do is download the Firefox Portable file .
Then you unzip the file and browse for the file FirefoxPortable .exe .
Just execute that file and you will be running the first Release Candidate of Firefox 2 RC1 !
The profile is kept with the FirefoxPortable folder so you do n’t have to worry about messing up your other profile and the uninstallation process is simple … just delete the folder !
NOTE : Yes , the final release of Firefox 2 RC1 was supposed to be today but it has been pushed back until September 26 .
I would also expect to see the final release of Firefox 2 pushed back into early November because of the recent unexpected delays .
